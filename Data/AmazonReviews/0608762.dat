<Title>Now a part of the iPod craze!
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Trust me, I was the LAST person to buy an iPod. I was perfectly happy with my iRiver H140 (which I still love), and was sick to death of seeing those white headphones everywhere! But then I decided to get a tinier player for my walks to class and such. I tried out different smaller players and they all had some type of defect. An iPod Shuffle wasn't an option as the thing doesn't even have a screen. When these second-generation minis came out, I was blown away by the specs: supposedly 18 hours of battery life, price cut down fifty dollars, etc. So I went ahead and bought the blue version and yet to have any regrets. My review:  PROS:  // I did a battery test on this the afternoon I bought it. It wasn't even charged to full capacity, and on top of that, I played with it a lot, and it still ran continuously for about 23 hours. Amazing. One of the reasons I was hesitant about getting a first-generation mini was its battery life (about eight hours, I believe). Apple has definitely improved on this feature.  // iTunes, the software that you use to put music on your iPod, is great. You can make it automatically sync to your iPod or manually update. I choose the latter option as I have more music on my computer than will fit on a 4GB player. I thought having to use software would be annoying in comparison to hooking a player up like a regular hard drive and using the file tree method, but iTunes is simple and gets the job done. There are other programs you can use to manage your iPod, like MusicMatch, but iTunes seems to be the least clunky to me. Also, you DO NOT have to buy from the iTunes music store to work your iPod. You can even hide this option on the sidebar if you wish and make iTunes solely a music manager.  // So tiny! I have to admit that when I opened the box, I exclaimed, "It's SO cute!" It's basically the size of a credit card. A little slimmer, a little longer, but you get the idea. Even the package it comes in is very compact!  // Sound quality is absolutely superb. You'll listen to songs that you've heard on your computer or other MP3 player or whatever and hear nuances that you haven't heard before. Like I said, I have an iRiver, and while that has amazing quality too, you'll be surprised how crisp this little device sounds.  // Plenty of features. Notes, contacts, games (Music Quiz, Solitaire, Brick and Parachute), clock, alarm... I have yet to use any of these extras but I guess it's nice to know that they're there in case you do. I think more efficient features would be voice recording, FM tuner, etc.  // Scratch-resistant. All of my friends' iPods are scratched up like you wouldn't believe. The mini has a lot more resistance to scratches as it has an anodized aluminum case.  // Inuitive design. Everyone knows about the click wheel. I've handled lots of different players and Apple really wins in this area. The controls are underneath the wheel, so you don't have to worry about buttons bulging out on the exterior.  // Colors-- this is a pretty trivial point, but I was initially disappointed when these "new" colors came out. I thought the earlier model pastels were much prettier. However, now that I actually have one (photos don't do justice), I think my blue one has a gorgeous, rich hue, and I imagine this is the same for the green and pink. No complaints in the aesthetics department from my end.  CONS:  // No support for WMAs. iTunes will import these as their own format, which might result in a sound degradation. I had to rip a bunch of my CDs as MP3s just to retain original audio quality.  // Apple really skimped out on the accessories. I'm used to getting a bunch of add-ons with my player for free, like a case and adapter. The mini includes a clip-on holder, headphones, and your charging cord, but that's pretty much it. HOWEVER, to Apple's credit, you can charge your iPod without an adapter (right from USB, or Firewire). Plus, to get these 4GB models down cheaper than they were before, it makes sense that they cut out the superfluous items.  // This will be a minor issue for most people, but when you're in your menus (like listings under Songs or Albums or wherever), the titles don't scroll. So if you have a lot of songs that start with the same string of words, you're going to have try them all to see which one you're looking for. On the actual now-playing screen, they DO scroll, it's just that in the menus they don't. Like I said, this won't affect most people, but it did kind of annoy me when I first saw it as all other players I've worked with scroll titles in menus.  SOME THINGS TO KNOW:  // The iPod never actually shuts off. I know that when I first got this, I was like, "Where's the stop button?!" You can put it to sleep by holding the play/pause button down for a few seconds, but it will never actually be turned off. This is a smart move made by Apple because if you were to continually shut off and restart everytime you wanted to use it, not only would it take a long time to boot up, but it would wear down its interior.  // iPod doesn't give you a straightforward way to copy your music back onto your computer after putting it on, but there's a way to do so without using external programs if it's enabled to disk usage. 1) Click on the iPod icon in My Computer. 3) Click Tools > Folder Options > View > Show Hidden Files and Folders. 3) A folder called "iPod Control" should appear. Navigate into that folder and all your music should be in several different folders within. If you don't want to do it this way, there are also third-party programs like CopyPod.  // For iPod support, Google "iPodLounge." Their forums are really helpful, too.  // Ordering from Amazon is probably your best bet. I ordered this on March 17 and received it the very next day on March 18. That was with Super Saver Shipping deal where it's actually supposed to take up to two weeks to get to you! This could just be in my lucky case, but even so, you can also always return your iPod if something is wrong with it with zero hassle and for free. Like with those other players that gave me issues? Amazon sent a UPS guy to my house to pick it up, returned it, and I got ALL of my money back. Just my two cents on that.  ---  Overall, a great player. Besides a few flaws, Apple has found a new iPod-lover in me which I thought NEVER would happen! Sorry for the length of this review but I hope it helped potential buyers. Happy iPodding. :)

<Title>Incredibly Fast Shipping!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Cheers to Amazon! I bought this IPod as a gift for my fiancs burf-day, so I haven't even taken it out of the box yet, but I had to write a quick note singing their praises. Amazon's logistics and delivery network is unbelievable.  I opted for the free shipping offer (Super Saver Discount), which Amazon claims will ship in two to three days.  I placed the order around 2:00 PM CST, yesterday (3/21/05), only to have it show-up on my desk at work at 10:30 AM CST, today (3/22/05). That's a total of 20.5 hours for Super Saver Delivery.  I will say that my home in St. Louis, MO isn't extremely far from Amazon's distribution center in Lexington, KY, where this package was shipped from - about 350 miles.  But still, I've ordered pizza's that have taken longer to get here.  Way to go Amazon!

<Content>I love the ipod mini it holds so much music and is so small. Also the 18 hour battery life is great. This is perfect for holding my hip hop music collection. If you dont have alot of music I would also recomend the ipod shuffle. But my ipod mini has been great so far. Go Ipods!

<Title>If It's Too Loud, You're Too Old...
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned a number of other MP3 players and have made a concerted effort to avoid "iPod madness."  But with the recent price drop and upgrade of the battery life, I decided to take the plunge.  I bought mine through the Apple store and got free engraving as well as free shipping.  All-in-all, I LOVE my new 4gb iPod mini.  I also like that I can import my MusicMatch Jukebox playlists into iTunes rather easily.  There are really, in my opinion, only a few negatives:  ~ Dock is no longer included.  However, the included USB cable works fine IF you have a powered USB port on your PC. ~ The included ear-buds are AWFUL!  Fortunately I had several pairs of good headphones floating around, so that was not a big issue for me.  I would recommend picking up the USB power adapter and the Insten iPod Sync & Charging cradle.  I would also recommend checking out the iLounge web site for lots of good information on the care and feeding of your iPod.  Oh!  One other negative is that these things ARE addictive. And I'm kinda thinkin' now that should have gone for the 20gb version.

<Title>"the next big" bogus offer
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let's face it, you can't get something for nothing!  The San Francisco Chronicle recently exposed the real story behind the so-called "offers" that are continually being posted here.  Do a search on Google or on sfgate.com for "iPod not really free David Lazarus" and you will see what the con artists running these programs are really up to.  In a nutshell, it's just another way for spammers and other sleazy people to steal your personal information.

<Title>Very disappointing battery life
<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I received my Ipod Mini last week (good job Amazon for the free shipping....which arrived very promptly) and I had a lot of trouble with iTunes. I had a 256 mb mp3 player before I bought my iPod and transferring music to that one was so much easier. With iTunes, you have to make sure every song you want on your iPod is in the library. Thus if you add songs from a different computer, the songs that are not in this new library will be deleted! I guess this protects illegal music sharing, but for something this expensive this is a very inconvenient feature. Basically I think iTunes is an inferior program for transferring music; on my old mp3 player you could just drag and drop music files into the player.  Most importantly, the battery life of my iPod is absolutely disappointing. I've had to charge it every 2 days since the day I received it, and it's not like I keep it on all the time. I just use it when I walk to class, and in a span of 2 days it is actually on for about no more than 6 hours. I don't even have the backlight setting on at all. I am extremely upset with this because the 18 hour battery life is what initially hooked me into buying this second generation version.  Apple is lucky the iPod has such a good interface. The scroll wheel I must admit is a very intelligent tool and the ability to make playlists is something flash drive based mp3 players can't do. For 190 dollars I got a second generation iPod that has EXTREMELY poor battery life and that's why I am so upset with this. If anyone else has had problems with their battery, please share. It's better to know I'm not the only one who got gypped!

<Title>What is Wrong With iTunes?
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my iPod and iTunes, and simply can not see why people dislike iTunes.  A previous reviewer said that they couldn't transfer songs from another computer.  BULL.  Just right click on the iPod, and change it to manual synchronization.  Even if you don't like iTunes, there are many other applications, such as iPod Agent, that can transfer music (and more) to your iPod that are available online for free.  Especially with the new price, IPODS ROCK!

<Title>Wonderful.
<Date>Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a tremendous amount of music - too much for an iPod of any current size - and so I knew that I would be moving music on and off of the device no matter what.  I chose the smallest iPod Mini because of its good price and physical dimensions (it's a lot smaller than most people think), and have been very, very happy with my purchase.  I am something of an audiophile, and yet have been very pleased with the Mini's impressive sound quality, its ease of use, the incredible battery life (18 hours is not much of an exageration) and the flexibility that the Mini provides me.  To be only slightly critical (and not to discourage anyone from enjoying an awesome device), I am not especially fond of Apple's ear-buds (and a bit uncomfortable, too), but they were easily replaced for even better sound.  Also, I do wish that I could turn off the "auto-pause" feature (the unit pauses automatically when the earphones are removed, but is so sensitive as to occasionally pause when the plug is inadvertently rotated).  These are minor criticisms, and I hope that everyone gets an iPod!

<Title>Great, but bruises as easily as an apple....  Poor for audio books (no bookmarks)
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first Ipod and I love it.  The functionality is excellent and I've found that it lives up to nearly all of the positive notes that others here and elsewhere have written.  However, I have two complaints: One that would not have changed my purchase decision, and another that would have made me buy an accessory earlier.  First, the battery life is nowhere near 18 hours.  I do not use the backlight, nor do I play it very loud.  Perhaps the best I have done with battery life is 7-10 hours.  I was so surprised at first that I thought I had accidentally purchased the fist generation Mini.  I confirmed that I had the second one. But again, I would still purchase this, regardless.  Second, get a case or some other protective cover!  I dropped mine twice outside.  Both times were from only a foot or two but were on pavement or asphalt.  The Ipod worked flawlessly without any problems at all. But, drops that may have only slightly scratched a plastic case resulted in several small but very noticeable dings and even an actual dent on the corner.  The metal used for these cases must be pretty soft or pretty cheap! If you want to keep your Mini looking clean and new over time, and you occasionally have two left hands, you will definitely want to get some type of case or cover for it.  8/31/05:   After using the iPod for months, I realized that it missed a great feature I had on my old Rio 500: the ability to bookmark!  I listen to audio books a little more than I listen to music.  Though I understand there is an ability to bookmark Audible books and that there are various hacks and tricks out there, there is NO way to easily bookmark an audio book that you may have imported from CD or elsewhere.  I cannot change my original rating, but: For music, I would keep it at 4 stars.  For Audio books, the iPod deserves 1 star!  If you listen primarily to audio books, look elsewhere for a player that allows you to easily bookmark your spot.  12/22/05:  Battery life stinks!  I use this mostly for audio books and podcasts, and the best I can get is 2-3 hours before the battery dies.  Apple support is the worst!  I sent it back to them for repair: they received it on a Thursday or Friday, and sent it back on a Monday, stating that it was up to their standards.  If I was not now "captive" by having converted many CDs to Apple format, I would dump the Ipod altogether.

<Content>Besides the owners manual, and the few problems you might encouter, the mini is great. Despite what other reviewers have said, I have had my mini for about two years, and the battery still seams perfect(I've never done a full battery life check) As for finding out how to upload, download, and use the mini at first,it's a little more tuff. I STILL LOVE THE MINI.

<Content>I paid $250 for this i pod. After about 6 months the battery went dead slowly and even stopped charging altogether. I could only use it if it were hooked up to a charger. I replaced the battery myself(it CAN be done, people) and it worked fine for about a month before it started freezing up. Now my computer doesn't recognize it anymore and the clickwheel doesn't work. I never once dropped it or got water in it. I ended up giving it to my friend who collects broken i pods for parts and believe me, he's got A LOT of them. These items aren't worth nearly what they cost. They break often they're expensive to fix. Why Apple gets away the obvious contempt they have for their customers by selling them over-priced faulty equipment is beyond me.

<Title>The second-generation Ipod Mini is a hit!
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I went into the Apple store this weekend, planning to buy myself an Ipod shuffle to keep myself under the $200 mark while buying an Ipod, and what did I see but the newly released 2nd generation Ipod Mini, selling just within my price range!  This mini is totally worth the added cost compared to the shuffle. While I envy the shuffle's extremely light weight and even lower price, I'm glad to have the extra storage space on my Ipod as well as a much-needed screen.  My ipod mini is pretty light, even if not weightless, and it has an amazing 18-hour battery life.  On the missing regular Charger: I haven't had any problems using the USB cable and connecting my Ipod right to my computer.  Plus, so many people have ipods these days that I imagine I could always borrow someone else's charger if I needed it.  And buying a new charger is always an option.

<Content>I just got an ipod mini tonight. Within 20 minutes of having it at home i already had about 2 gigs of music on it. Within an hour i was listening to my music. Plus the price point now beats out the zen micro, the mini's only real competitor. I have played with my friends zen micro and i have to admit I was going to get one before the price drop.But it takes time to get used to the touch pad and the fm reception is bad. Overall this is a great  product adn even better due to its price. my advice is to go out and get one ASAP. UPDATE: this thing is very sturdy i have left it in the snow for 5 inutes and it still works. I have left the headphones dragging on the road at speeds upwards of 40MPH and they still work great

<Content>everyone knows the iPod mini is a great player, but I was really amazed at the new battery life. I don't even have to care anymore, it lasts so long. I HIGHLY recommend the mini. Are you going to be one of the poor souls that end up with a zen micro that gets 10 hours battery life on a good day? --  Personally I think the zen looks like it came out of a cracker jack box and it seems to my ear that they use a bass preset as "normal" to trick the consumer-- just try amping one of those creepy zlooking zens! Whatever folks, thats up to you. However, you WILL NOT be dissapointed with this SUPER mini from apple whereas you may be very depressed if you buy one of the lesser players like the zen or dj

<Title>Revised: Good but could be better
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Good  1.The new Ipod mini has made one major improvement over its predecessor i.e. a battery life of 18 hrs or more. My 4GB lasted for 22 hrs on the first go.  2.The looks are the best coz of the sleek anodized case.  3.Easy to use,Click wheel Navigation features are unbeatable. 4.Easy to use iTunes software and music downloads. 5.For students you can get this on the apple store for $179 and the 6gb for $229.  6.Good Customer Service 7.Anti-Shock memory good for those of us who drop things  :D  The Bad  1. The sound quality is not the best, PC World compared it to headphones quality while comparing the iRiver and Creative products to listening room quality. However for normal listeners this shouldn't matter. 2. It cannot play WMA tracks so it can store only half the number of songs that a wma player can for the same capacity. 3.Doesn't come with the wall charger now that the price is reduced  The Ugly  1. The ipods have to be returned to Apple to replace the battery which normally will run out in 6-12 months depending on use, that costs $99 besides shipping not to mention the waiting...it would have made more sense to produce them with replacable LiOn batteries.   My suggestion I would suggest getting creative's zen micro.They hav a 5GB version for $229 on Amazon .They are releasing 2 new models a 4gb for $199. A 6 gb for $249.They are equipped with replaceable 10-12 hr batteries which you can get for $40. Carry around an extra battery an you get 20-24 hr listening time.  The zen micros also have better sound quality as compared to the pods.  But if want great looks and not bothered by less than perfect sound quality stick to the ipod mini.

Music Quiz is the only one you CAN'T play while listening.  This is a must buy!

<Title>Simply THE best mp3 player!
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>iPod mini was the hottest gadget last year & the best mp3 player around. Looks like this will be true even in 2005. There is absolutely no competition for the iPod's, no other player is even half as good as iPod.  Pro's, 1. Very good audio quality. Support for normal mp3's (unlike Sony). 2. Small size (smaller than most cell phones like much-talked-about-Motorola-Razr) 3. Extremely well desgined (let's hope Apple makes a cell phone and PDA in near future) 4. Very intuitive interface (award winning touch wheel and minimal buttons) 5. 4GB hard drive (enough space for about 800 mp3 songs) 6. Available in many colors (hopefully Apple will come up with Nokia style faceplates for future Mini's) 7. iTunes is one of the best music software around (rate songs, keep playcount, easy-sync with the iPod) 8. Excellent screen for such small size 9. Recharges from a standard USB port with the same cable as used for the upload of songs. No need to carry around a charger now. 10. Tons of innovative accessories in the market (from Bose speakers to colorful socks!) 11. Good battery life, about 10-14 hrs depneding on how much you surf around on it. ofcourse we all want more and there is no end to that demand :) 12. Everything about the iPod Mini is designed to perfection (no other company has put this much time & effort into their mp3 players even in 4 yrs since iPod hit the streets)  Con's, 1. The battery is internal with no easy replacement chances 2. Colors on the new Mini, except Silver, IMHO, are all gaudy. Last generation of Mini's had much pleasing colors. Check out for yourself at a local store before buying. 3. Gold version has been dropped now, its become a collector's item? Instead of adding more colors they have dropped one! 4. Doesn't come with a wall charger any more and takes longer to charge from USB port. You always need to be around a computer or pay extra for the charger.  Its simply fabulous and I am running out of superlatives to describe it. Thanks Apple for the new iPod Mini!

<Content>last time I checked you could get an ipod for $180. i last checked about 2 weeks ago and i thought it was a rip off then. this is outrageous, apple makes their ipods for $30 and amazon is selling them for $200. they're earning more money than they need, yet people still keep buying them. Sure it's great with all the songs, games and features but, it's not worth the money your paying for it. IT'S A RIP OFF.

<Title>Such a rip off
<Date>Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't like iPod's. I think that they're a total rip off. You buy an iPod for like $200.00, then you have to buy your charger, then you have to buy your headphones. Plus you have to pay for the songs you download on it. Thats what blew me away. I think that since you payed about $300.00 for your iPod, they should atleast give you the songs for free. I would advise everyone to stay away from them if they want to save money...

<Title>I don't know how I ever got along without it...
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I LOVE MY SILVER IPOD MINI!  After about a year of research and procrastination, I was having a particularly bad week, so after seeing a teenage at the drug store with her Pink mini, I decided that if she can have one and she doesn't have a job, I can surely have one and buy it with my hard-earned money!    I marched myself into the Apple Store and treated myself to my mini.  Awesome decision!  I was wavering between the 4GB and the 20GB since there was only about a $50 difference.  It didn't even make sense to me to consider the 6GB because that was $50 more as well, and if I was going to pay the $50, then I was going to get the 20GB.  I decided on the 4GB for now. My computer hard drive is only 6GB at the moment, so there's really no need for an iPod whose storage is bigger than what my system can hold! :)    MY LIKES:  1.  The Size- It's absolutely perfect!  It stays in my purse so I will always have music on the go.  My co-worker gave me a baby blue skin to put on it so it will be protected in my purse.  2.  The Color-  I was aiming for the blue one until I saw it in person.  The color was a little too blue for my taste (even though blue is one of my favorite colors!  ZZZZ-PHI!) I'm not a fan of Pink nor Green, so Silver was it.  It's sophisticated looking.  3.  The Battery Life- This was the sticking point for me.  Up until I bought my mini, I was listening to music on my 1GB SD card plugged into my Palm Pilot.  It was a good solution for a while.  I was, and still am, thankful for the capabilities of my Palm, and if it weren't for the fact that my Palm's battery life is horrible, I may have stayed with that and never bought my mini.  So far, I have gotten a good 12 hours on 1 charge.  That's awesome.  The advertised time is about 18 hours.  Look, if it lasts me a whole work day without dying, then I am happy.  So far, it has totally surpassed that.    4.  The Screen-  It is clear and bright.  I love it!  5.  The Click Wheel-  It took some getting used to, but now, I love it.  It makes it easier to navigate around the menus.  6.  USB Cable-  Quick music transfer!    7.  iTunes-  I used to use MusicMatch faithfully.  I will probably still use it since I have lifetime upgrades.  I also like the burning capabilites of the program.  I use Windows Media Player as well.  I let RealPlayer go.  Too much spyware.  iTunes is a very robust program that does just about everything you need.  It organizes your music very well, and it is an easy program to learn.  8.  Sound Quality- The sound quality is awesome.  I can't ask for anything better.  Very crisp and clear.  Plus, once you play around with the EQ, you'll find what suits you.  9. Educational Discount-  If you are a student, you can get an Educational Discount on all Apple products if you purchase directly from Apple.    MY DISLIKES:  There aren't many, but there are a few...  1.  No AC Adapter-  I had to buy it separately!  Apparently, it was included in the previous generations.  I own a laptop, so I don't keep it on all of the time.  Therefore, that would have been counter-productive trying to charge my mini from the USB port.  The Adapter is $30 by itself, but for people like me, it's a necessary cost so I can plug it up to the wall and it can travel with me.    2.  No Stop Button -   There isn't a dedicated "Stop" button in iTunes or on my mini.  All I see is a "Pause" button.  If there is a stop button, someone please show it to me!  3.  On/Off Management - I don't like the fact that whenever I plug up my mini to charge, even if it's already turned off, the unit turns on.  I have to physically turn it off.  Not a biggie, but it's just something I've noticed.  4.  The Earbuds-  They sound just ok to me.  I'm not a fan of them.  My inner ear is shaped funny so I'm probably not getting the full effect of them since I can't really put them in as far as they are intended to go.  I may have to get some of those ear canal ones.  I have figured out to have these stay in my ears all day without them hurting.  I don't wear them with the foam though.  The foam irritates me to no end.    Ok...that's my review.  I hope it helps you all!

<Title>More Hype than Substance
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok the price is good, for a 4GB Music Player. The interface on the iPod itself is great! The clickwheel is a brilliant innovation, I love how you just have to move your finger round the wheel and have things like volume, location in song and scrolling through the menus change seamlessly Sound? Well I have hooked the iPOd up to a pair decent pair of PC Speakers (complete with subwoofer) and the output was great. As for earbuds, that's good too, plus let's not forget that the sound quality also depends on the MP3s you've got...Also there was absolutely no skipping occuring.  Ok so that's the good. Unfortunately, there's a lot that's bad - BATTERY LIFE - it's ridiculously low. I get about 2/3 hours mileage out of it at most. This is without playing with the clickwheel too much. I don't know if mine is a defective piece, but I don't think so.  iTUNES IS AWFUL. This is the least user-friendly piece of software I have ever come across. Instead of allowing you simply add songs to your iPod based on filename, you have to conform to the ID3 tag format. Although this may not seem too much of an issue for some, it was a real problem for me, as none of my songs are catalogued according to ID3 and I have over 700 songs! Winamp is smart enough to pickup whatever info it can get, and iTunes should be too.  Further, and most importantly, on Windows 2000 Professional, if you try and install iTunes when Quicktime is already installed, the setup hangs, and you get nothing. So you have go back and uninstall quicktime, before installing iTunes.  It is not very easy to create playlists. You can't just select 5 songs and say create playlist out of these 5 songs. You have to first create a playlist, and then drag the songs into the list....  Finally, the iPod's casing is looks a lot stronger than it is. It has a niced brushed metal look, but is very weak. I've gently dropped my iPod once, and was upset to observe a dent on the top left corner :-( I guess one needs to invest in a case for the ipod.  Keeping these things in mind, I would say that the iPod is a good buy, but more for fans than for practical people...

<Title>Apple iPod Mini is the Apple of my Eye
<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple iPod: definitely the best MP3 player out there. $200 is not a lot of money for hours and hours of entertainment. Last year, I considered buying a cheap MP3 player. You know, even below $100 if possible. In the end, I couldn't find one nice enough for my price range. This year, my best friend purchased a green mini. I fell in love with it! Every time I went over to her house, I sat down and asked her about the features. I listened to all of her songs, and I was blown away by the sound quality. Even the style of the mini is adorable! I asked her how much it was, and she said $250. Yikes! A bit steep for me! But i wanted that mini, so I started saving up. A good 6 months later, I hadn't spent one penny of my now saved $300. Then one day my best friend called me to tell me that minis were now only $200! I was so excited. With my extra cash, I bought a wristband, speakers, and a case from www.apple.com. What a buy! I love my pink mini so much! Here are my favorite features:  -Style: It's adorable! Fun pink, blue, and green, plus a more conservative silver.  -Size: It's remarkable. About the size of a credit card, and less than 1/2 inch thick!   -Click Wheel: Hated this feature at first. Just could NOT get used to it! But now I find it great.  -Battery Life: Not too shabby for an iPod. I'm impressed.  -Screen: One of the only reasons I bought a mini as opossed to a shuffle. Clear words are a definite plus.   Things I would change:  -iTunes: Hate it hate it hate it. Everything about it annoys me! I mean, even something as stupid as the visualations on my computer. They stop after one song! What a pain! Worst software ever.  -Games: So hard to play. I mean, not really a big issue because nobody ever plays them anyway, but especially Solitaire disapointed me.    All in all, the Apple iPod Mini is a great buy at great value. If you're looking for a high quality Mp3 player, this is for you!

<Content>Apple iPod is a great advancement to technology that will have everyone smiling. The sound is inevitable and is extremely satisfying.  However, I marked it down by two stars because : 1. It does not come with any free songs; once you get it you do have your iPod, but you need to fill it with songs that'll COST you more money.  2. A little too expensive on the account that it has no songs in it

<Title>Great product, but want a couple of software improvements.
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm very pleased with my 4gig Ipod Mini so far, but wanted to add a few comments to what others have written.  The sound quality is quite nice, even with the standard ear buds. The capacity is right for the price, and battery life is good for how I use it (a couple of hours here and there). I have two concerns, but they are not significant enough to reduce the rating from 5 stars for me:  - I-tunes, the computer software you use to load/unload songs, is not completely intuitive. Although the software works well and downloading/purchasing new music is easy, getting songs onto your ipod can be difficult if you already have an extensive music collection. I solved this by creating a couple of specific playlists in I-tunes, and having the I-pod only synchronize with those playlists.  - Although the I-pod mini can play songs in set order, random, or direct selection, I've not found a way for it to shuffle songs from only one playlist. I like to hear relaxing songs by the pool, and energetic songs when I'm at the gym. Being able to shuffle only my "poolside" playlist or my "energy" playlist would be great. Perhaps it can be done and I just need to research more.  - Some of the help documentation isn't very deep. This is typical of Apple. Because their hardware and software have so few problems, most users never need extensive documentation. But if you want to go back and change some unusual settings (like the I-pod's name, or the shuffle method I mentioned above), how to do it is either not explained or difficult to find in the manual.  Those caveats aside, I'm loving my I-pod mini and definitely recommend it. All of my concerns are non-critical, and they could be addressed with a software update.

<Date>Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So what am I supposed to do when I travel and the battery needs charging and no computer is handy?  That's it!  Shell out another $30 for an AC adapter!  And why would one want to boot up the computer at home just to charge the battery anyway?  On another matter, after iTunes software installation on my XP system, iTunes would not recognize the iPod.  Eventually I had to uninstall the software and repeat the process to make it recognize the unit.

<Title>Don't bother with this product...
<Date>Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got one and when I opened the box it (the iPod) didn't work.  I called the Customer Service and they said quote: "Too bad."  I was PISSED off! I called later and someone else said to return it for a new one so I did.  Pros: *Navigation is good *Nice design *Lots of options to do *iTunes is easy *Get good comments  Cons: *The sound quality is horrible.  It's like listening to a cassete player. (Little exaggeration) *Customer Service is bad *Costs more than Zen Micro *You have to pay $.99 for one song from iTunes *Terrible Manual  I was using this and suddenly it broke (as in stopped working) AGAIN.  I called Customer Service and they said they'll send a replacement.  I said I didn't want one because I'm getting the Zen Micro instead. I got my Micro at Best Buy for $199 with 5 GB of memory WITH a power adapter, belt clip and stand, and those other accossories that it says it has.  Conclusion: I recommend getting the Creative Zen Micro instead because it costs less and you don't have to pay $.99 for EACH song. For the Zen Micro you just have to pay about $12.99/month for "Napster To Go" with UNLIMITED songs. Do the math: iPod Mini: 1000 songs= $1000 Zen Micro 5 GB: 1250 or 2500 songs (depends)= $12.99/month. Less than $.02/song if you download ONLY 1250 songs.  If you download double it'll be like it costs $.01 per song. And so on.

<Title>Little but Big Problems
<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I always admired people with these mini iPods and I was surfing amazon one day and I saw it for the low price of $149.99 with free shipping. So I decided I deserved a big present for myself, I bought it. It took about 2 weeks for the shipping and I took it to Washington D.C., the battery life isn't great for a trip but it's good. It takes several hours to charge, which is a downfall but it should charge overnight. Although, I had the same problem with it 3 times. It kept giving the exclamation point folder icon, which meant a low battery, no memory, or reset. Well I know it had memory because I had songs on it and I know I charged the battery. I called apple for help but got no help what so ever, I was very fed up. Apple charges you $49.99 for each Tech Support Phone call you make after the first one, just so you know. If you are up for a headache then sure it's a great buy. I know people who never had problems, but then again I know at least 2 other people that have had this trouble with it too. Needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.

<Title>The iPod's great, the software is terrible
<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the iPod mini as a christmas gift.  It's the only mp3 player that I have ever owned.  But the Itunes software is terribly annoying.  My first beef with it is the size of the program; it is SLOW.  It takes 2 to 3 times to bring up as windows media player.  It rips a CD at nowhere near the speed of wmp.  Also, it destroys any type of organization scheme that you develop on your own.  If you rip a CD using Itunes, it will put the files in my documents\my music\itunes\itunes music\artist name\album name.  If you have multiple iPod's sharing the same computer, forget trying to keep things straight.  Also, apple has added the "convenience" of only being able to upload to your iPod using the Itunes software.  A drag and drop using windows explorer would be much appreciated.  Bottom line: If you've never touched a computer before, apple makes it 100% idiot proof, otherwise the software will frustrate you to no end.

<Content>I bought this iPod about a year ago, a total newbie to mp3 players. I wasn't sure what to get, or what I'd even need. This one turned out to be just right.   Right now, I have over 700 songs downloaded, and STILL have room for lots more. (Basically, this means I have my entire music library - including just about every song I ever heard and liked even a little bit - plus comedy clips. It's super-easy to import, delete and organize your music, and all the features are equally simple.   If you just want to listen to music - not watch epic-length movies, or concert series - this iPod will suit you just fine. True, you can get the shuffle...but for fifty bucks more, you might as well spring for the 4GB, which will hold all the music you could ever want.

This little pink beauty does everything I need it to.  I've downloaded every album I could possibly think to download and I haven't put a dent in the 4gigs.  It's been through some hard use at the gym but the classic apple case barely has a scratch.  The battery is excellent.  I've had it play for hours even after it warned of low battery life.

<Content>I just have to say, I really enjoy my ipod mini. I like the lightness of it, the color, and the pretty good durability. I've dropped my ipod twice without it having any sort of case on it and from a standing point. It has yet to show any signs of wear & tear! The one thing that I dislike is the users manual. It took me at least 2 hours to figure how to download songs. You're better off going to a friend who has an ipod and asking them how to configure your ipod with the computer. Although this is a sort of major setback, once you figure out all the kinks, you are well on your way to having a great time with your ipod.

<Title>The Best iPod Out There
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a blue iPod mini from Apple's Refurbished section in March 2006. When I got it, I read the manual first. It was confusing. It wasn't really helpful. There was nothing on how to import songs. It wasn't a setback because I also had a silver one, but I just wanted to point that out. Once I hooked it up to my Mac, it worked perfectly. The nice blue color, lightweight, and easy to use clickwheel. It was wonderful! But just a few days ago, (Jan. 3, 2007) the mini started acting up. The hold switch wouldn't lock the iPod, and the clickwheel wouldn't respond to touch. Finally, the hold switch started working again, but the clickwheel was another story. I brought it into Apple, and they said it was caused by abuse! I never dropped it, scratched it, or got liquid on it. Finally, they repalced the Clickwheel cable, for no charge. Although there was a problem, and even though people now think they are out of date and they would'nt get one because of no color screen, you can keep the new iPods. The minis are all i need.

<Title>All Well and Good Except for the Battery Life
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second - and last - iPod. At this point in the history of the iPod, anything I say will be superfluous, but I'll reiterate the one reason why I'd never get another iPod. The battery lasts about a year if you're lucky, and 6 months if you're not. At that point, Apple expects you to put out another $60 for another battery. Not only is that expensive, but it's also a pain in the neck. Even if you're close to an Apple store - and I am - you wait in line, you come back four hours or more later, and pick up the iPod, and pay tax on the battery to boot. Then you reload and hope that this one will last another year. Truth is that I picked up an iRiver 1 gig MP3 player which may not be stylish, but I get almost as many songs and the one AA battery lasts about 35 hours! Then I dispose of it and just replace it. And I'll repeat this: for anyone who flies, how are you going to charge your batteries on an iPod in flight (or worse, stuck in a snow storm in Denver while sitting on the tarmac?  P.S. The earbuds are still lousy, but I immediately replace them with Sonys.   It's now last June, and the iPod sits in a drawer and will probably remain there. IF you must have an iPod, get the "insurance" with it which runs about $15. Though you'll still have the pain of taking it in or sending it in for a new battery, and least it'll be $15 plus postage rather than $60.    In the meantime, my iRiver continues to serve me well, and I found that a 2500 mAmh rechargeable battery will last about 40 hours. We have two of them now, each with different music and I just trade off with my wife depending on what I feel like listening to. Besides, the FM works beautifully. Before iPod knocks them out of business, I might just get another one to be sure.

<Title>I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy just thinking about my iPod!
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Oh my gosh! I love my iPod so much and I think I would've died without it. You might be thinking, "1,000 songs? I could just name 5,000 songs from the top of my head!" but you're wrong. I was thinking the same thing until I took a risk and bought from the wonderful Amazon.com. Here's the story...  One day, my friend came to school and said, "Look, I got an iPod for my birthday!" I was like what is that? And she explained to me. I totally fell in love with the idea of getting one and I asked my mom for one for a birthday present. But of course, she said no. So I saved up. After a while, I had about $400 saved up for just an iPod mini 4G. But I needed it. I got the iPod (of course) for $174.95, the iSee mini case for $11.55, the portable charger for $29.99, and the speakers for $39.99! I just got it 3 weeks ago, and I already have 122 songs!  Things I love:  1,000 songs, now that's a whopper compaired to an mp3 player! its adorable appearance clear, beutiful sound  Things I detest:  iTunes (it takes 4 min. for one song to download) charging, HOURS AND HOURS! battery life...8 hours, come on! horrible for a plane ride  but still...all these things can't keep me from giving it 5 stars!

<Title>A solid product which deserves to sell a bazillion units
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I visited the ipod mini page from a link on my purchase history. I didn't expect to need to add my positive review until I read some of the negative comments being posted here.  I own a second generation ipod which I bought as soon as it became available to Windows users. Put it this way, when I bought it, the cashier at Best Buy was like, "What's an ipod?" Ok - maybe that says more about Best Buy hiring practices than anything else.  I bought a garish pink ipod mini this round for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Took about an hour to fill it with a 1,000 of her favorite songs. USB 2.0 feels a lot faster than my firewire ipod transfer.  I had a few issues with loading the ipod mini software but as an old hand at this stuff I didn't worry about it. I fear a few newbies might freak when their computer fails to recognize the ipod without rebooting their machine and plugging the ipod back in. Subsequently, I've had no recognition problems.  The navigation process on the ipod mini is still excellent. The physical build is solid and attractive. I highly recommend the ipod mini but please get a case to protect it. I sat across a guy on my ferry to San Francisco the other day and was horrified to see his 4th gen ipod scratched to bits. I shook my head in disgust. Lol.  Enjoy your music!

<Title>Where is my charger to go with this ipod???
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There is nothing to be said about ipod minis and how fantastic they are. But where is the charger to go along with the ipod from this particular vendor!!! It's like selling someone a car without a steering wheel. This is the 3rd ipod I bought from Amazon and the first two came with a charger as you would expect! But this one, which I bought a s a mother's day gift came without one and makes it completely ungiftable. Yes yes the description does not include one, but come-on, it is only common sense that a charger should be included, when you pay the same price as one that would have it!!!

<Title>Impossible To Set Up 
<Date>Thu May 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently received a 4GB Mini Ipod as a birthday present, and was quite excited until I found out it was almost impossible to program and came with almost no instructions.  After more than 10 hours of trying and searching the Apple website for solutions, I am giving up and returning this item back to where it was purchased and buying an iriver.  The itunes software kept telling me that there was an error and that I needed to reformat to factory settings - of course, it does not explain anywhere how exactly do do this in the limited instruction manual that comes with the unit.  Even when I finally managed reformat the unit and download songs into the unit, the songs would not play - again, no instructions as to how to deal with this problem.  So I try to download the songs again and get the same error message that the unit needs to be reformatted to factory settings and is not able to copy any of my songs!  Before completely giving up I went to two different friends that have MP3 players (one with a 20GB ipod and the other with a 20GB iriver).  Both spent over an hour trying to figure out the impossible before giving up and recommending that I return the unit for something easier to use.

<Title>Great design and appearance, but not built to last!
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This review is from the perspective of someone that has used my iPod mini every day for just over a year.  Let me start by saying, I loved my iPod. I have the Belkin iTrip for my car, and I listen to it most of the day while working at my desk.   I say "loved" because after about 10 months I noticed my battery life became shorter and shorter. I've read about battery fatigue, but this didn't concern me too much. I was a heavy user, and most of my listening happened in places where I could keep it in a charger. No worries.  However, after about a year my iPod sound quality became very staticky. It became apparent that when I jiggled the phone jack that something in the physical headphone connection was causing the signal to get distorted. Still, this was not a huge deal for me. If I was just careful in the car or at work I could still listen.  I've now had it for about 14 months (I bought my mini from Apple the first month they came out), and it is just not useable. Which sucks, considering there is only a 1 year warranty. Nice timing.  Obviously, my 2-star rating could be seen as unfair because I really don't have many complaints about the product and the way it functions.   However, given the problems I've had with it, and realizing that it didn't last for more than 2 months after the 1-year warranty, I wouldn't feel right giving it a higher rating.  Just be careful with this product. It looks sexy, and it is a great mp3 player. But, if you plan to actually use it every day, you should plan on buying one every year.

<Title>Some people dramatize bad points...
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unlike what some people will have you believe, the iPod does in fact work. It took me about four minutes to import all of my music from iTunes- perhaps it's easier to do if you're on a Mac computer. The interface is easy to get a hang of, and from then on it's pretty easy to use to. Songs can be organized easily from iTunes, into whatever scheme fits you best.   The earbuds are, however, very uncomfortable, albeit they have good sound- some people complained about lack of bass, though I've found, at least with my classical music, that there is plenty, if not to much, bass.   Overall, very worth the price, though you might spring $50 more for 2 more Gigs.

<Title>Ok product
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My friend have a new ipod mini and I helped her transfer and setup and all that. I was impressed at its size and beautiful color. I was hoping that it didn't cost about 200 USD, I wish it was a bit cheaper.  The Bad: When I tried to install Itunes, it does not work. Why? I have Windows ME. It ONLY works for Windows 2000 or GREATER. I had to transfer the songs to a cd and do it on my brother's computer. A big pain in the butt since my computer is bought in 2001 with one cd drive.  Transferring the songs from a music cd to Itunes took awhile, maybe 5-10 min if you transfer about 18 songs. I don't know, but it may vary from computer to computer. I don't like the fact that you have to use itunes to transfer your songs to the Ipod. You can't use the Windows Explorer to do it.   The Good: Using Itunes was easy. it can take a few seconds to know what the buttons do, but its pretty much easy for those people who hasn't used Itunes before. The mini also comes with a belt clip, which looks nice. I'm not sure if it's secure since I my friend does not put it on her belt (she has a little pouch to put her ipod.) The backlight is AWSOME, so bright and it's whiteish. The Ipod mini's controls are very easy to use. The click wheel is awsome. The earbuds are good, the sound is good too.  The Good//Bad: The Mini only need an USB cable connected to the computer to charge its battery. But if you're going on a long trip without a computer, then you would have to buy an iPod USB Power Adapter for around 30 bucks. I would rather use an outlet to charge it than an USB cable.

<Title>The NEW iPod mini
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is defintly the best iPod that has came out so far. I do like the regular iPod's but they are to big for me to carry around. The iPod mini is easy to use holds 1000 song (4 gb $199) or 1500 (6 gb $249). But if you want to get your iPod cheaper go to the apple website and go to the bottom and you can get education discounts if you are a student ($20 off). Besides the iPod being easy to use it is very small. The click wheel is very nice, I considered the Zen Micro because the FM tuner but the quality for the radio is bad. Plus the Zen Micros keys aren't as easy to use becuse if you accidntly tap a button it is touch sensitive and it screws everything up. The games are an great feature but the iPod mini is made for music. iTunes is also very easy to use. Also, the apple support is very helpful and your warrenty is 1 year. I had a Creative flash player and the customer service for Creative isn't very helpful like appl. So anyways the iPod mini is a must have.

<Title>used computer at work to copy cd to Ipod & lost my Music
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Is iPod, iTunes, iTunes Music Store A Monopoly?    In the basic sense of the word 'monopoly', Apple has one in the iPod ecosystem.   There are multiple definitions as to what constitutes a 'monopoly.' There's Microsoft's Windows. Apple's iPod ecosystem. Merriam-Webster's definition. And the legal definition. Has Apple created a monopoly?   Yes. What goes around, comes around. Apple's iPod ecosystem, which includes the ubiquitous iPod, iTunes on Mac and Windows, and the iTunes Music Store, is truly a monopoly.   Or, nearly a monopoly. Or, could be proven to be a monopoly. Or not. That's how law seems to work these days.   Thomas Slattery sued Apple Computer, claiming the iPod is configured so that it will only play music from iTunes Music Store and not music from other online stores.   In short, Apple is facing a number of federal and state antitrust claims, and a California judge has ruled that the plaintiff (Slattery) in this case has met the qualifications which assert a "tying" claim.   The case may now proceed as a monopolization claim under the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and other claims for violation of California's antitrust and unfair-competition laws.   Microsoft chairman Bill Gates must be smiling. RealNetworks CEO (former Microsoft employee) Rob Glaser probably helped himself to another jelly doughnut.   The judge noted the basic facts: Apple has an 80-percent market share for online music sales, and more than 90-percent of the market for portable hard-drive music players.   According to Merrium-Webster (the only authority who would comment), there's a non-legal definition for 'monopoly`:    Main Entry: mo�nop�o�ly  Function: noun  Inflected Form(s): plural -lies  Etymology: Latin monopolium, from Greek monopOlion, from mon- + pOlein to sell  1 : exclusive ownership through legal privilege, command of supply, or concerted action  2 : exclusive possession or control  3 : a commodity controlled by one party  4 : one that has a monopoly   If Windows is a monopoly at 90-percent of operating systems on PCs, then Apple can have a near-monopoly on portable music players and online music sales with the iPod's ecosystem.   But a monopoly does not illegallity make.   The issue is how Apple wields that monopoly and both the plaintiff and the judge in the California case think Apple may need to loosen the iPod's ecostrings.   It's the whole 'closed system` perspective that seems to continue to haunt Steve Jobs and Apple. Granted, the iPod ecosystem works very well. No one else has bettered the mousetrap.   That's the point. It's a trap. Mostly. Once you buy an iPod, you're pretty much obligated to use iTunes if you want to listen to music on said iPod.   Once you start with iTunes, you're just a click away from the iTunes Music Store, and, if you're an iPod owner, that's pretty much the only store from which you can buy tunes that will play on the iPod.   Except Wal-Mart, or Tower Records, or Sam Goody, or Target, or... you get the idea. There are alternatives, but online it's mostly iTMS or nothing if you're an iPod owner.   For example, you can't buy music on Microsoft's Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that's not Apple's fault.   Then again, Microsoft is not the monopolist when it comes to music on PCs. It's an also ran. A runner up to the crumbs left by Apple's stampede.   The lawsuit, and others of similar ilk, have a case, though with many holes. While Microsoft abused their monopolistic position by forcing manufacturers to pay for Windows on every PC shipped, and to bundle software (illegally, it was determined), Apple doesn't really 'force` iPod buyers to use iTMS.   That's the difference, and it's a big difference. The problem is that you can't use other music from other online stores employing DRM (digital rights management) not compatible with iTunes.   Whose fault is that? Apple's? Yes and no.   Posted by Tera Patricks at 9:35 am on Monday, February 6 2006  Category: News * Reader Comments (26) * Email It  Page 1 of 1 pages  Reader comments...  Jeff says:  The remark about Microsoft deliberately modifying Windows to make Quicktime shaky is not completely true. The Quicktime plugin developers did not fully understand what they were doing, and were relying (unknowingly) on an undocumented side-effect. When that changed, they had problems. That was definitely Apples fault, not Microsofts.   The whole "why won't Apple license Fairplay" issue needs to be considered from a real business perspective. Does anyone know for a fact that Apple haven't said to anyone "Sure, you can use it, the one-time cost is $1,000,000,000"? (Long term, thats probably not an unrealistic figure)   The courts cannot mandate a price for a company to sell its IP. That would set a precedent that would bring down the US economy.   You might as well sue Microsoft for not "making Steve Jobs an offer he can't refuse". That'd probably be the responsible thing for Microsoft to do, where responsible == return the greatest profit to MSFT shareholders.   Hell, Apple are already being hauled over the coals for charging 3rd party manufacturers a fee per unit for using iPod-compatible connectors. No-ones suing over that price-gouging, because they can't. Its not illegal to price your product exorbitantly - if you can't afford to make iPod-compatible hardware, thats *your* problem, go make parts for some other mp3 player.   Market forces are supposed to sort this one out. Your new widget appears on the Dell player instead, its an instant hit, people drop the iPod in droves, you get to sleep "on piles of money with many beautiful girls"   The one counter to all of this, that I'm aware of, is the "inter-operability" argument. That Apple should be forced to open its IP up, so that its competitors can inter-operate with it, in the same way that the EU forced Microsoft to show the Samba guys its internals.   But this is not the same situation - the iPod can already play MP3. The only thing it won't do is support "someone elses file format" and thats a function of the business deal between two third parties, the other vendor and the music industry.   If the courts rule that Apple has to change its ways so that Microsoft and Sony can broaden their markets whilst maintaining their current contracts, then they (the courts) have sunk to an amazingly corrupt new low.   Posted by Jeff on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 11:58 am    ian Johnson says:  Not a fanboy, however apple built a working system and a good interface to deliver. No one is required to use either one. You can still buy CD's and play them on your a CD player. Should cassette- er 8-track manufacturers sue them for making CD's inoperable in an 8-track slot? You probably can't get the new Britny Spears on 8-track, and there's probably a recording of "Pac Man Fever" on cassette that will never make it to CD. It's called out with the old and in with the new. It happens. Don't cry because it just makes it that much harder. Primus came out with a Brown Album on vinyl long after LP's were much in vogue.  This is like the "Coffee is Hot" model with McDonalds. Based on these relatively simple premises:  1. Coffee is hot.  2. If at all possible avoid spilling it on yourself.  Nobody forces coffee to be hot. It's just better that way. Do not commandeer a cup of brew unless you feel you are sufficiently able to navigate the liquid as it cools down, into your mouth.  If you don't know how to load your iPod with songs that you got like your "Pac Man Fever" cassette. Get out your old Walkman. And return the iPod for someone more capable. If you want to buy a PossiblyWillPlay (TM) player and load it with songs you can only find on the iTunes store burn them on CD in audio format, after all you own a copy of the music, then use your Windows Media this or that to import the CD. As long as you bought the music you probably won't be reported to the RIAA for putting your Pat Boone iTunes original collection on your iWinKyoob player.  And to Adam, anyone can put their music on iTunes, even Purple Grandma Deathkill Emo, and apparently keep every penny of the sale from their "Knitting with Satan" EP. See this on Digg   Ok Ok, I'm sort of a fanboy and this is mostly a rant, but more importantly I believe that when you dumb stuff down for the least common denominator, everything starts to suck. -Hey world, someone come up with a cooler idea for music distribution and delivery format and I'll buy it. And in the meantime please keep the whining to a minimum.   Posted by ian Johnson on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 2:50 pm    iDJ says:  Didn't `WE' choose for iPod and iTunes? Aren't `WE' the millions of people that made the same choice? Didn't `WE' kill the the `others'.  Apple made something that WE love, because of the looks, the feel and it's easy to use too.  That's what WE want and WE made this monopoly!   `WE control iPod'   Posted by iDJ on Tuesday, February 7 2006 at 4:07 pm    Jason says:  "For example, you can?buy music on Microsoft?Music Store and play them on your iPod or within iTunes (not easily, not legally). But that?not Apple?fault."   Actually, that IS Apple's fault. They won't allow iPods to play any DRM'd music but their own through the iTMS. And when anyone has tried to make their alternate legal service work with an iPod (like Real), they got sued by Apple.   The iPod is technically capable of supporting WMA and the associated DRM. The portalplayer platform they're all built on is used in other players that do. Similarly, other players could be made to work with Apple's FairPlay DRM - there's no technical hurdle, it is only that Apple refuses to license it.   Long story short: Apple holds the keys here and it is only their decisions that prevent interoperability (with either players or music stores).   Posted by Jason on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 10:25 am    Fred Winston says:  Nope, Jason. That's not it. It's still not Apple's fault that Windows media audio, even with DRM, won't play on iTunes. It's the DRM from Microsoft that's at fault. Not Apple. It's not an Apple licensing issue that other DRM'ed music won't play in iTunes. It's the fault of those that have proprietary DRM. The defacto standard for DRM is, of course, FairPlay. From Apple.   Posted by Fred Winston on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 11:25 am    adam says:  Fred -  it's equally the fault of apple that music bought from iTunes won't play on other non-apple devices.   defacto doesn't mean anything in this context.   Posted by adam on Wednesday, February 8 2006 at 12:10 pm    Kai Cherry says:  Wow. That's all I can say here...after being `hung up on' by a fellow Mac user for picking `the wrong side' in this non-debate. The fact is, it feels good to be on top, some of us have a deep `love' for Apple.   But love is often blind. Apple has an effective monopoly on the Online Digital Music (and soon, probably video) market. This is a fact.   Apple has an *overwhelming* market share of the Hard Disk digital player market...and likely the flash market too. All of this in about 4 years time...from nowhere. Sound familiar?   Alone, these two things are perfectly alright. But the vertical integration in these two markets, and a lack of interoperability, and fairly aggressive tactics to break interoperability are a problem.   And let's not kid ourselves here: *Apple* benefits from this far more that the music rights holders. In the beginning, many, many large artists were not playing along, but the fact is, if you wanna move music online, there really isn't anywhere else to go.   What's really...weird...is that these same points people are using to defend Apple's position are the same one's Microsoft proponents were using. The difference is, by the time anyone stepped in to do anything about it, it was far too late. Everyone lost.   This is an emerging market. You can argue up one side and down the other about inferior competitive products or whatever, but if someone made a music store that sold songs for a nickel less per, worked with iPod/iTunes, and still had DRM...there would be more places to shop.   Or what of the higher quality audio and video people clamor for? Not gonna happen.   As well, if other folks stores could sell players that could play Fairplay DRM music (and lets be honest...this `they can sell in mp3' is a strawman; no Major Content Provider is licensing non-DRM music/video...stay with reality) then there might be room for some new emerging and compelling players out there.   The likely remedy here tho would be that Apple would have to adopt or support another technology; the burden would be on them to interoperate with the rest of the market. And that market uses Helix or WMA DRM.   As it stands, there is a wall there, and there is no way to penetrate it. Think about 5, 10 years from now. What if somehow, Apple was bought, or was no longer "the Apple that we love".   If it were *any other company* would this be "ok"? Seems to me that when it was, it wasn't. All I'm sayin'   Posted by Kai Cherry on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 12:49 am    John says:  Just a thought, but one can turn around and, looking the other way note that tunes bought from Steve only play on (portably) an iPod. That's more of a tie that binds....   Posted by John on Thursday, February 9 2006 at 1:56 am

<Title>I love my mini
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod mini about a year ago and it has been working amazingly for me ever since. One of the reasons I love it is that I'm a huge clutz and I drop my stuff all the time. I don't keep it in a case ever, and I have dropped it from five feet and it has not even scarched. Of course, I don't drop it on purpose, it just happens. I particularly don't need a color screen. My black and white screen displays the song I am listening to fine and if you want, you can turn on the backlight. Many of my friends have iPod Nanos, but I don't actually see how they're SO much better than the minis. You can see the little album picture next to the song title, so what? If I really wanted a cool new iPod, I would most definitely get an iPod video. All of my friends who have nanos always keep their iPods in cases so they don't break, but I don't need to. With a nano I would be too afraid that I would crush it... It sits in my pocket comfortably, I don't have to worry about it while I'm moving around. Unlike many people, I download plenty of music from the music store and I love it. I don't like leaving my house, going to the store, and buying a CD for one sone that I actually like. The only problem with this iPod is that the backlight goes off if you don't do anything to the iPod, but it's fine. iPod minis are, in my opinion, better than nanos.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my ipod mini for approximately a year and a half. My menu button and volume control have stopped working.  I just went to the Apple Store in Oak Brook, IL and apparently the ipod's only have a one year warranty.  At the store they confirmed that "yes your ipod is broken, so you have two choices." 1. "Since we don't repair them you can purchase a refurbished model for $183.00" or 2. "We will give you 10% off a new model(new model is $249.00)".  I am not very pleased with Apple and the quality of my now useless, one and a half year old, $250.00 ipod.  I chose neither option 1 nor option 2.  I refuse to pay more money so that I can once again be sitting in the repair chair at the Apple store in another year and a half.   All I ask is that you take into consideration my experience and take to heart that while I was waiting in line for the repair man, there were four people ahead of me with broken ipods and two people behind me.   Honestly, my money is spent better elsewhere.

<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My (now ex) boyfriend got a white Ipod Nano for his b-day. I was slightly jealous, because the things were expensive as crap. But after a while I lost many reasons to be jealous, so here come those Cons, ya ready?;   1: The thing doesn't take Double A's, it has an internal battery... On a long Greyhound trip I would rather be able to run in and out of a gas station to get a fresh set of AA's, then hafta wait til I got home to plug into USB to charge.   2: I like versatility! Say I buy a new Dir en Grey CD at Hot Topic, I want to listen to it as soon as possible, not wait till I get home to rip it all to MP3 and wait even longer to transfer it all to the Ipod. If they made an Ipod that could play store bought CD's as well as data files then yeah, I would probably buy one.   3: The earbuds, I'm not sure but I think they run off a special jack... so that means I hafta get headphones specifically for Ipod. No chance of using my HUGE Panasonic cup headphones I got at Fred Meyer.   This tiny little thing does have its strong points; so here's the Pro's;  1: 4 gigs of storage (more than enough to hold my collection of Jpop and several NIN and Manson albums)  2: Very pleasing display, anyone looking over your shoulder can read off what you're listening to.  3: It reads ID3 tags (so does a Rio Volt), this is great for someone who obsessively names and tags all of his mp3's.  4: Its small and can fit in your pocket, unlike a CD player, though with that smallness comes the ease of losing it, someone stealing it, and functionality like playing CDR's which woulda been useful.  5: It can display japanese texts in the ID3 tags. Perfect for someone like me who listens to mostly japanese music.

<Title>Complete waste of money

<Content>Ok I liked it when I first got it, it was the popular thing to have. After three months though I got tired of the limitations of itunes, the first and formost being its incompatibility with virtually every other program on your computer.  It got worst when my ipod completly broke, it would only play half my songs and then completly refused to turn on. I sent it in and got a new one, that new one worked for about three weeks.   The constuction of the Ipod makes it impossible for anyone to troubleshoot without the intervention of apple. I filled out many messy complaint forms and help-plea emails that were never followed up on.  There are lots of other Mp3 players that are much better, perhaps not as well known or expensive but much better.

<Title>Not impressed
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my iPod mini over Christmas in 2004.  My headphones broke after just a few months, and right around the one year mark, my iPod stopped working completely.  I took it to the Apple store and they gave me a new one, after I bought an extended warranty for $75.  I've had my new one for almost a year and for the last month or so, the fully charged battery will not last for even one full song.    iTunes is seriously disappointing as well.  It is completely incompatible with any other media or mp3 players.  Also, any songs downloaded from the iTunes store can only be burned onto a CD 6 times.    Apple sucks people in with the iPod's cute appearance and user-friendlyness, but I have not been impressed.  I have spent way too much money on accessories (which have also been unreliable and I've replaced chargers, headphones, cases, etc.).  I have spent the past 2 years building up a library on iTunes that I will not be able to use with the next mp3 player I buy which will not be an iPod.

<Content>Like others have reported, the hard drive in the Mini is very delicate.  My wife's died within about 10 months. It can't be fixed, you have to get a new one.  So that's why the new Nano, which came out only about 1-2 years later doesn't used a hard drive.  Don't buy the Mini used, get a Nano.
