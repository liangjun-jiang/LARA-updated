<Title>WOW! THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO MUSIC!
<Date>Sun Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The RIO rocks! It is so great that Diamond Multimedia prevailed in their fight against the forces of pure evil in the music industry and allowed us, the public, to have the RIO! This little baby holds your MP3's and plays  them with outrageous quality and no moving parts! You simply cannot make  the music &quot;skip&quot;. Take it jogging, bob sledding, whatever! The  Rio is cute and compact, battery lasts forever, runs great and is really  simple to use. Works well with the PC linkup, etc. A hot item!

<Title>The first MP3 Handheld available on the Consumer market
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I had high hopes for the Diamond Rio and it certainly lived up 2 the hype. Lightweight and excellent quality with some good connecting software. My only gripe can be with memory. You definately need another 32Mb to store  your music. If you want one, my advice is to wait for the new upgraded  version with 64Mb and a graphic equaliser!

<Title>Next Millenium Consumer Electronics
<Date>Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Diamond's RIO is the current, silicon-state nightmare for monopolistic entertainment industries. When the first audio recording-devices entered the consumer market decades ago, the idea of a controlled  &quot;charge-per-copy&quot; business model in the music industry was  doomed. Although traditional copyrights could never be totally enforced,  the record and music-producing industry neglected these threads existing in  the shades of multi-billion profits.<p>Mp3 and the Internet raided the  existing markets with their &quot;natural&quot; power like a cruise-missile  against a frying-pan.  Like other good examples for  &quot;Killer-Apps&quot;, the RIO is designed to Web-Specs (mp3). This makes  its use and performance comparable with other CD-quality playing devices  while putting the power of the internet into the palm of your hand. If you  want to make a statement of &quot;being digital&quot;, the RIO is a must!

<Title>Brilliant!
<Date>Tue Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Remember when the Walkman hit the market years ago?  At first it was fad, then it became a craze before finally becoming as ubiquitous as taxi cabs in Manhattan.  The Diamond Rio is the first product with the potential to  eventually REPLACE the Walkman.  Think about it - portable music that  sounds as clear as a compact disc from a device that looks and feels like a  pager.  Unshockable, no matter how much you jump around or how bumpy the  bus ride.  This is the perfect gift for your favorite &quot;gadget  junkie&quot;, as long as they have a PC to download from.  Pssst...here's a  secret:  you can record your own CD's into MP3 format and download the  songs into your RIO - it isn't just for internet music!!  Great product.

<Content>Only a half an hour of &quot;near&quot; quality music makes this format seriously flawed. To change music you eventually have to upload new music, i.e. a huge inconveneince when a computer is available. Mini disc is also  shock proof, recordable, near cd quality but in addition you can change  music with out the inconvenience of uploading music from a computer.

<Content>I've had my Rio for about 4 months.  The other day I went to download some songs to it, and now it says that it only has 16mb of memory.  I don't know what happened to it.<p>Also, the 32mb of memory is not enough if you're like me and use the player all day.  If I bought another mp3 player to replace this broken one, it would have to have at least 64 mb of memory.  I could fit a maximum of 8 songs on the Rio.

<Title>Rio excellent player
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got the Special edition 64 mb's RAM and a 32 MB flash card for 96 MB's of RAM.  Very nice, and skip free so when I work I don't have to worry about skipping like I did on my CD player.  Very compact, easy to fit in a pocket or even better it's got a clip if you don't have pockets.  Some people complain about batteries but I get the same performance out of a single battery in the Rio than 2 in a CD player.  It's not an issue to me anyway since I use rehargable batteries, but some complain anyway.  Download speeds to the Rio are pretty good, would like a faster download time though.  Anyone think of Firewire or USB?  As far as durability I accedentally dropped it on concrete and it still works perfectly.  Overall a fine product, I'd pick it up again after my experience with it.

<Title>Great little device for short duration play
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I got my Rio PMP 300 from my employer as a gift.  It was my first exposure to MP3, as up to that point I had been dismissing it as a fad.  Having the device, and about 150 CD's, I figured why not give it a shot.<p>The installation of the software went smooth.  I found an update, and installed that as well with no problems.  Then I started trying to rip and found that the included software was hardly stable.  I was running on Windows NT, which seemed to be supported by the manufacturer, but with some caveats.  I would start ripping and the software would crash.  I would try to transfer to the device and the software would crash.  I would complete a transfer to the device after several tries only to find that one or more songs didn't actually make it.  Bottom line - the connectivity for this device was pathetic.<p>But speaking for the device itself - I loved it.  The music played cleanly, without interruption, regardless of how much I shook the device.  The buttons on the front are well placed, well labeled, and nicely inset just enough so they still provide easy access, but you don't have to worry about them protruding.  It has all the features you might want including random and repeat.  The display let's me know how much memory I have, what track number is playing, and the time of the song.  There are also various other indicators that are helpfull (battery, etc.).<p>The memory on this device is small - 32Mb.  And the manufacturer says it will only support up to 64Mb total with an expansion card.  That expansion card can hold it's own set of music so you can swap them in and out without effecting the music on the built in memory.  However, vendor chose the odd memory type of 3.3V for the external memory versus typical CompactFlash.  <p>There's a convenient &quot;lock&quot; switch on the side that keeps the buttons from registering.  This can be good in two ways: it won't get turned on accidentally and burn battery, and you won't accidentally hit the stop button and interrupt your listening.  The belt clip is handy, and detachable, and the battery life (one AA) is quite respectable.<p>In all, I really love my Rio PMP 300.  It's perfect for a trip to the gym, a jog around the neighborhood, or even for a short plane flight.  If all you need is an hour (30 mins on internal memory alone at a 128 sample rate) to pass the time, then you really don't need to spend more - this is the perfect device.

<Content>I've had my player for just over a year.  No problems!  No skipping, doesn't have a mind of its own.  In otherwords, the play options (random...) never switch on me without my promt.  It functions very well.  Battery uses quickly.  It's only just very recently that it's beginning to die on me.  It plays, then won't.  It's something to do with the battery and the connection.  Also, the screen is fading from the top down.  This may be to slight rain sprinkles, or its visit to a sandy beach in the Turks (this occured in February though).  I am getting another!

<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This seemed like such a great idea: music that won't skip; I can record what I want. Then I got it.<p>The software is far more complicated than it needs to be, and it's unbearably time-consuming to put everything you want on the machine.<p>Then it there's not enough memory to record all you'll need for a long enough stretch.<p>I could go on for pages but won't waste your time with it. My last straw, however, was when, after I'd purchsed some additional memory, the lid to hold the battery in won't close. So the little, grandly over-priced toy is a total waste. <p>Stick to your CD player. Maybe it's not all the up-to-date, i.e., the hi-tech industry has replaced it with this little thing. But you'll enjoy it more.

<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>while this is truly great product which I enjoy. The limited playback time hinders the Rio. If your going to have mp3's on your computer it's more convient to use winamp for free then spend 170 for a portable version. It's  easier just to hook your audio output to your stereo and make mix tapes,  yes tapes then waste your time with the Rio. I suggest waiting for the next  portable player with at least 60 min. of playback otherwise, keep to the  tapes.

<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I was given a Rio as a gift, and I really thought I wouldn't use it, but it's been incrediably handy.  I now take it with me whenever I go jogging, because, unlike a c.d. player, it never skips. You can also easily move  between and within songs, unlike a cassette Walkman.  My only problems with  it is it takes longer than I thought it would to download songs to the Rio  from my computer.  Also, it's pretty hard to find free, *good* downloadable  MP3s on the Web (you'll get lots of porn sites when you try).  But to make  a mix from your c.d.s to take on the road with you is great.  The battery  doesn't last a super long time (about 12 hours I think), but it only takes  one.  I've recommended the Rio to friends, and I really enjoy mine.

<Title>Not bad, but far away from best
<Date>Tue Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Weve seen it so many times. Companies make a product that lookspretty cool, give it a name that most people will remember, andadvertise a lot.  Then it WILL sell, dosent matter how good the product actually is. RIO is a good example of that. And it was easy to do such a thing becourse the other portable mp3-players on the market are pretty anonymous. They dont advertise that much. Probably cuz they want to focus on doing a great player. Like the first portable mp3-player, MPMan. Its out in a new version that is far better than the RIO-player. It has flash memorycards, is easy to deal with and does even support other fileformats for storing. The main problem with mp3-players is the amount of space for storing music. To get near cd-quality you got to have 128kbps or more(156 recommended). The best solution to this right now i think is a player with a harddisk or cd-rom built in. Then you can store many hours and hours of music. But it makes a little bigger and more expensive player. So i think the next step from that is flash memory cards. They are small and can store pretty much and best of all they are replaceble. So, summary: Dont buy the RIO-player if not your only demand is to get a small player. Check out the other cool players instead.

<Date>Wed Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I like the rio a lot, my big problem with it is the lack of storage space.  The parallel connection is VERY slow for downloading, maybe next gen will have 64MB and a USB connection.  The thing I like the most about my rio is  the fact that I don't have to carry my valuable CD collection around in my  car where they can easily be damaged by sunlight, mishandling or worse yet,  stolen.  With a cheap adapter I can plug my rio straight into my car  casette deck and I only have to worry about the rio getting stolen, not  $100's worth of CD's.  <p>I think the music industry is less worried about  the MP3 market stealing music as it is the Rio market stealing sales for  replacement CD's that are easily damaged or stolen.  Now the CD's I buy  stay locked up safely in my house.

<Date>Fri Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big advocate of mp3, but I think that even with additional (and expensive) flash cards, Rio doesn't haven't have as much memory as I need. I really don't like listen to music at 64kbps,  although that rate is perfect for talking. 128kps is good enough for most  songs, but Rio only can take 30 minutes of music at that rate. I do  congradulate Diamond for the size and design of the Rio, however. There  already is a newer version that has double the space, but it looks like an  iMac. (Boo!)<p>One thing to watch out for is a tiny little hard drive  called Microdrive from IBM. It holds 340 Mb, which is good four about 6  hours of music at 128kps, and 12 hours at 64k. Expect that around  Christmas.

Although the headphones it came with have absolutly  no bass boost I would recomend buying your own pair. The software it comes  with cannot get any easier. To get songs onto the Rio from your computer is  so easy and takes VERY little time, about 15 seconds per song! This is a  great product and IS durable, I have dropped it numerous times and it works  FINE. It has never skipped... won't.

<Title>cool technology but don't run out and buy one just yet
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>MP3 players are truly a great idea, but this product is not very practical.  It only has 32MB of memory and the upgrade cost is almost like buying another whole player.  I enjoy using mine for exercising - it's  light and doesn't skip.  However, it is very touchy/quirky.  Don't bump it  or the whole thing will turn off.  And sometimes it will automatically  pause play even when I have the &quot;hold&quot; feature engaged.  The  technology is great, and I'd like to upgrade but I'm going to wait until  players can hold more memory or until MP3s can be further compressed.  This  would be one of the coolest products ever if it could hold your entire  library of music.  For those of you that can't wait that long, go for at  least 64MB.

<Title>Can't believe other reviews
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>First of all, I have used software named &quot;Streambox&quot; to cut down the size of my files.  So, instead of playing the selection at 128 kbs, I have cut it down to 16 kbs.  Believe me, the quality does not deteriorate  that much!  By doing this, I now can hold 100 tunes (mine are all jazz)--50  on each of my two 32 mb modules.  If I choose to do so, I just cut down on  the number of tunes, for example to 47, and replace them with three old  radio shows.  As long as I keep the number of selections at 50 or less and  do not exceed the 32 mb on each module, there is no problem.  Now for the  negative--Yes, it is rather cheaply made.  Bump it and it will turn off;  the battery compartment is not well thought out.  But, if you have problems  within the warranty period (one year), Diamond will replace the unit.  One  more thing--the cost of the 32 mb modules is beginning to drop.  I would be  lost without my Rio!

<Title>lacking memory
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>when I first received my Rio for my 16th birthday I was excited, as well as a little doubtful.  could such a tiny device live up to all its claims?  well, it's been a little over a year, and my Rio and I are constantly  attached at the hip.  it's little, it's light, it doesn't skip when I  exercise, and the software is so easy to use that even my mother has  figured it out.  the only drawback is that the onboard memory is limited to  32mb, which, for me, just isn't enough.  I can only squeeze between 6 and  12 CD quality (128 kb/s) songs on at a time, so I always feel like I need  to change the songs halfway through my day.  my advice is to splurge and  shell out the extra cash for the special edition Rio 300 with twice the  onboard memory (64mb), or even better wait for the Rio 800, which should be  out soon, and promises to be the best Rio yet.

<Title>Good Value
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Many people like to criticize the Rio 300 (and the newer model,the 600) because it only comes with 32MB of memory.  While thiscriticism is valid, I'd like to point out that the Rio 300 (and other 32MB players) are considerably CHEAPER than their newer 64MB siblings. ... <p>Think about it, folks, ...  A 32MB SmartCard, if you search around online, only costs about [30% of a 64 MB player].  If you're that upset about the skimpy memory on the Rio 300, simply shell out the extra sixty bucks and you'll still have saved yourself fifty-plus dollars.<p>As for memory, you can gain more music space on your player if you DON'T transfer songs at high bit rates.  For example, I typically transfer my songs (from an origianl CD) at 112 kps (CD quality) and sometimes at 96kps (near CD-quality, and believe me you can't tell the difference).  In short, I love my Rio 300 and will soon buy extra memory for it and still have money left over in my pocket.

I must say that the Rio is efficient on batteries, has very good sound with very little distortion (if it's distorted, it's probably the ripper/encoder that made the MP3), and since it's completely electronic with no mechanical parts, it obviously never skips.  I run with mine and use it in the car with a cassette adapter, and I love how light it is.  Despite all these pluses, there are a few things the wary consumer should know:..As for mechanics, the Rio 300 has limited onboard memory - I get along fine with the 32 MB, but at times, especially on long trips, I wish I could play more than about 3/4 of a CD at 128bps (about &quot;CD quality&quot;).  Be ready to shell out more for that flash memory add-on.  The case on the Rio 300 is relatively fragile.  Don't count on putting it through a lot of abuse, and be careful with the belt clip, as it may strain the thin plastic - - mine cracked, but a little superglue fixed it and it's fine now.  The bottom line: if you don't have a lot of money but you want that MP3 player, it's a good buy.  As for me, I'm about to convert to a minidisc player/recorder with a USB MP3 adapter.

<Title>Portable relaxation machine
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've had a PMP300 for a little over a year now, and the only complaint I  have is with the transfer cable. I had to return the first unit I got as  the cable was defective, and now it seems to be failing again.<p>I have a  32 meg flash card, and at 48k bitrate I can store 43 songs on my Rio. I  mostly listen to celtic and classical music to help me relax and drown out  distracting noises, and prefer a larger variety of music to near-CD  quality. 48k is supposedly AM radio quality, but I quess I'm no audiophile  as it works for me.<p>I will probably have to upgrade to a Rio500 or  something similar, but I won't go back to CD or even cassettes. It's small  enough to fit in a shirt or pants pocket, and it is skip-free unless you  bump it fairly hard.

<Title>Very nice gadget, i like mine.
<Date>Sat Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I just got my rio , i got the older version with 32 megs of ram , instead of the new overpriced version with 64 megs. I find 32 megs of ram to be not enough memory for the music i wish to store for trips , or vacations  without computers for example. But for everyday use, I find 30 minutes of  music to be enough for my work day, after work I just upload new music for  the next day. It would be nice if it had more memory though. Now that the  price for the older model is dropped to 100 bucks after rebate I find it a  good value. I really like mine. I recommend it to people who like variety  in their music during everday life, and don't mind changing tracks everyday  or so.

<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>This product is a GREAT idea. But if you want to get something similar to this that plays MP3's, you should wait a year or two so the memory increases on the product. because right now, it only plays 30 minutes of  music, which is about space for about 5-8 songs. My advice is to get the  MINI-DISC player for now. It will play a very long time's worth of music,  and you can buy MORE blank CD's to record more. Plus you can get songs off  CD's, Tapes, PC, 8-Track, and more! I'm sure there are lots of players for  that you can find at amazon.com.

<Title>Sounds like a good idea.... But leaves much to be desired
<Date>Mon Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I bought my Rio about 2 months ago. It plays perfectly, and I have no complaints with the performance. But if you are going to take this with you as a truely &quot;portable&quot; unit you are going to be stuck with only  30 minutes of storage for cd quality music. Maybe that's not a problem for  you, but personally I need more of a variety of music when I take this on a  trip. And the extra 32-meg flash memory cards cost $100!! That's way too  much just to hold an extra 30 minutes of music. I recently sold my Rio and  purchased a portable Minidsic player/recorder for $275. My advice to people  would be to save an extra $100 and go for the minidisc. It uses digital  sound, and does not skip. You can use it to record mp3's from your computer  and the blank 74 minute discs cost less than $5 a piece, as opposed to $100  for a 30-minute flash memory card for the Rio. Minidisc is a much better  overall value than the Rio. I would not recomend any buy a portable mp3  player until the storage can be greatly increased at a much lower cost.

<Content>I use my &quot;Rio&quot; on my Motorcycle. A CD player obviously is out of the question and the portable walkman AM-FM device loses signal strength at every turn and I don't like tape. I have added the extra 32 meg flash card  to mine to enhance the playing time.<p> I record at 80kbps for good quality  and 1 1/2 hours of music. (on a motorcycle at 60 mph, CD quality isn't my  main concern.) <p>For my application and similar ones I feel the RIO is a  great audio source. The lack of memory is a concern and the flash cards are  expensive. The download time isn't that bad but I would have preferred a  USB connection. The output level is a concern but 12 hrs of playtime on a  single AA battery is great.<p>Don't buy the RIO as a replacement for you CD  player just yet. If you have a need for non-skipping, lightweight and a  small audio source then the RIO is the ticket.

<Content>I borrowed one of these from a neighbor of mine. It's great, and I personally cannot tell the difference between CD and mp3. If you have the internet, it's better, because you can get free music and download other  programs to allow your CD'd to be turned to mp3's, so you can have your own  little megamix. However, there needs to be more RAM, or have something like  an Iomega Zip Drive attached so that you can have more space. But hey, it's  a start! A Great Start into the future of portable music!

<Title>Perfect portable tunes for people who exercise
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>The Rio is absolutely the best device I've ever seen for providing high-quality portable audio to those who work out. It never skips, a single AA battery will keep it playing for at least 8 hours, and it weighs almost  nothing. I used to make tapes to play at the gym, but now I just convert CD  tracks to MP3's and download. The compression software is included, and it  only takes about 15 minutes to compress an entire CD into MP3's. While it  is true that the Rio only plays for about 30 minutes in near-cd quality as  shipped, there is a slot for an extra 32MB flash card which doubles the  playing time. This extra memory costs about $90, but it's worth the price.  The Rio also ships with a $50 rebate coupon from Diamond, although I've  been waiting six weeks for my rebate check. All in all, if you're looking  for convenient, rugged high-quality portable audio for your workouts the  Rio is the device of choice.

<Title>The first mp3 player ever is a big hit!
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I read a lot of what other people have been saying about the diamond rio.  For the most part, the reviews have been good, but when they weren't good, they were BAD.  I don't understand how someone can complain about the rio  just because they can't install it on their computer, or they didn't look  at the computer requirements.  Or if they mistreated it...  The sound  quality on this is excellent.  For those people who said it is NEVER cd  quality sound could never be more wrong.  The Diamond rio can actually be  above cd quality sound, depending on the speed of your encoder.  I was  almost completely satisfied with the Diamond Rio, but the 30 minutes of  sound it could hold weren't quite enough, maybe if it just had 45 minutes.   I didn't want to buy a memory card for it because they're about $100, and  it reduces the sound quality by 50%.  I bought this mp3 player last summer,  and i still have it in one piece.  I've dropped it a few times, and had to  make simple repairs, but i've never had to do anything that actually cost  me money.  There are better mp3 players out there now, like the diamond rio  500, and some nomad ones, but they're probably considerably more expensive.   The diamond rio is a bit fragile, and if you drop it, then it will skip,  because the battery could be knocked out of place.  But as long as you're  fairly careful, it'll stay in one piece.  I've been biking with mine,  skateboarding, through the airport, etc...  and as i said before, it still  works.  You might want to shoot for the diamond rio 500, but the price on  this baby is killer.  The only thing that beats an mp3 player, sadly, is a  minidisc player, mainly because you can bring your songs with you, and many  other reasons, but i'm not going to go into that ^_^  the bottom line is,  if you want a VERY small mp3 player which holds FREE downloadable music  from the internet which works on fairly new computer, and is fairly  durable, go for this one!

<Title>Good product, bad support.
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I purchased a Diamond RIO 300 almost a year ago, and I definitely say it has been great.  The one problem I've had was with the battery compartment. When Diamond designed the RIO, they took the duracell ultra batter and  built the RIO around it. Low and behold, the Duracell Ultra tends to be  bigger then most AA batteries, so I had problems when using rechargable  batteries (stupid me, saving the environment) that made the RIO shut down  every time it was bumped.  Diamond addressed this issue in a knowledge base  (which was hard to find) and basically said &quot;shove something in there  to make the battery fit.  I use foil now (which sometimes makes the  compartment pop open, but only when it's in my backpack) and haven't had  much problems yet.  However, Diamond's tech support is very horrible in  trying to get merchandise replaced (which I've tried with my rio and other  diamond products).  I'll probably purchase a RIO 500 just because it has a  better battery compartment design.

<Content>I have this unit with the 32 Meg Flash Card. When I first bought the product, I was running around like a happy fool glad to be ride of my walkman bouncing around my waste on short jogs. After the honeymoon was  over I started to have issues. The software that came with it, was the  music match software.It was good for only a limited number of plays before  expiry.I called diamond and they told me their RIO Port software was to  come out shortly. When the software did come out I found it didn't work  properly on the PMP300. I looked for some help files on &quot;configuration  / troubleshooting &quot; but there was none. Tech support told me this was  a known issue the pmp300 doesn't always show up as a configurable option so  reinstall the software. 3 reinstalls later I still couldn't get the Rio  port software to work, so I gave up and I just reinstall the music match  software when it expires every two weeks. Since then my LCD has become dim  and the plastic belt handle broke. The unit is about a year old now and  cost about 230 $ new.<p> I really like my MP3 player but I will not buy  another RIO .I am looking at alternatives

<Title>Excellent Player that's Easy to Use
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I've had my Rio for almost a year now, and it goes everywhere with me. I  have had very few problems with it. The sound is not always perfect, but  errors are few and easy enough to tune out. I have an expansion card for  it, which doubles the memory, but since I've had it, the player has started  to &quot;skip&quot; (that is, every time a certain song is played, it  leaves out a second). It's a great player for running and hiking, though,  because dropping and bouncing it do no damage. That's what I use it for the  most, and I find it to be a far better option than a skipping CD player or  a cassette player. The earphones are useable, and in fact are ideal for the  activities mentioned above. The device can also be hooked up to speakers  through the earphone jack.  MusicMatch Jukebox is the included recording  software. It creates quality mp3s, but may not work well on older computers  or with additional programs open. The Rio Manager software used to download  to the player (which uses an EASY parallel port connection) is  self-explanatory and also serves as a music player on your PC. I've tried  playing music through RealPlayer, MusicMatch, and Napster as well, and in  my opinion, this is the best software. My complaints: there's no radio  tuner, and the player cannot be hooked up to an AC adapter. Being an  environmentally-conscious person, this bothers me. Also, see complaints  about batteries in Michael Slabodnick's review.  Otherwise, it's a great  piece of technology with a lot of possibilities.

<Content>I bought this mp3 player thinking I was going to be on the cutting edge. What i ended up with was an ok piece of hardware that just wasn't worth the money - only 1 hour of music? What a waste! BUT, the worst part was that it  was so flimsy that it broke within the first week! I dropped it about 1  foot - not on a hard floor, but on a soft carpeted floor, and that tiny  fall completely killed it. It wouldn't turn on. So i had amazon.com send me  another one. Guess what happened after i got a new one. The exact same  thing, 2 weeks later. So i returned it for a refund and am now going to  wait for portable mp3 players to get better and cheaper.

<Content>The Rio, for being a first generation MP3 player, is awesome. The design is well thought out, and simple. The audio quality is great at 128kbps, an in general it sounds &quot;right.&quot; I bought it mostly for jogging because I wanted to choose what I listen to. (Anyone who has been  interupted by commercials in a great part of their run can relate, I'm  sure.) I wasn't looking for much, so this meets my expectations. I'm not  much of an audiophile, so the features offered wasn't an issue. Price was,  and . . . for  32mb... I'm happy.<p>I've only had my  Rio for three days, so I can't really comment on durability issues. My one  problem with the player is the headphone jack. It seems to be really cheap,  and so I worry about it being the first thing to fail. The software is  really cutsie, and easy to use. Being what I consider a power user, I'd  rather see it simpler, and more streamlined. All in all, I'm pleased with  my purchase.

<Date>Sat Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This is REAL. Im 13 years old and i live in Pennsylvania . LISTEN! A VERY good player has good sound and is very portable. There are a few small set backs , the plastic outside is flimsy , stronger than it looks , if u drop it on hard linoleum it will be fine but i wouldnt go mountain biking with  it. The battery case thingy pops open and is poorly designed , if u bump it  too hard it turns off . that can be fixed by putting a small spring inside  or something though.The headphones are ok , they sound decent and are comfy  4 me , the software is decent but i like RealJukeBox better.I wish it had  better EQ but the ROCK setting is good 4 me ( CLASIC setting is best 4 punk  rock). Sometimes the rio doesnt connect to the port cord cuz gunk gets in  the uncovered connection but it can be cleaned( with a Q-tip not with  water).It's easy to set up , if u can use a remote 4 a TV all u need to  know is the port conection which is fast and EZ. Music is of good quality  at 64kbps and free with Napster or Scour Exchange.Battery life is GREAT one  batter has lasted me about two weeks( not with constent but frequent use).  My battery life indicator measures wrong but that doesnt really matter to  me , its no prob . it measures almost dead wen the battery is brand new but  the battery still works.no other complaints. over all a Great product ,  small lightweight , relativly strong. Their are players that record and  have Fm tuners , u can get a FM tuner 4 extra money and u can have it  support other formats 4 more money too .It cant record , but no biggy.with  64kbps u get about 24-30 songs... get a smartmedia card.  i got 32mb  which adds the capacity to about 56-60 songs, but i geuss 16 MB would do.my  bro has an MD rio ranks lower cuz extra memory is expensive but the rio its  self is half that of a MD player. Great product , buy it. Excellent  present.

But there are many differnt programs you can use to accomplish this.  Then  after you have it converted to MP3, send it to the Rio. <p>Looks like  Diamon has released the Diamond Rio SPECIAL EDITION to quell these  complaints about limited playback time.

<Title>Bad sound, expensive media, short recording time
<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I've compared MP3 with MiniDisc and CD.  MiniDisc is nearly indistinguishable from CD; MP3 is not.  Even at 256kbps, MP3 quality is clearly inferior to both MD and CD.  At 128kbps, it isn't &quot;near&quot;  CD at all.<p>Added to that, 30 minutes of audio isn't nearly enough; I  wanted something I could listen to on a six hour plane flight.  An hour's  worth of add-on RAM for an MP3 player is way too expensive when compared  with $2.50 for a blank MiniDisc.<p>Solid-state digital audio may eventually  be the way of the future, but it has a long way to go yet.  The one reason  to get a Rio is if you need something that absolutely will not skip even  when shaken violently.  If you just need something that'll stand up to  jogging, go with MiniDisc.  I did, and I can still download MP3s and dub  them onto discs to listen to portably, so I get the best of both worlds.

I'm so pleased that I've ordered one of  the new 64mb models so I don't spend so much time reloading my favorite  playlists after my 13 yr old son sneaks the Rio out of the house for his  runs....I run better listening to vintage Cream and CSN rather than the  Backstreet Boys...(we don't have exactly the same taste in music).<p>If you  run while listening to music, you can't go wrong with the Rio! If you want  to be able to mix artists with little hassle..the Rio is it! If you need  more play time...more memory is available... enough said?

<Title>Too slow
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>It takes about .7X minutes to load X minutes of music, e.g. 23minutes to load 32 minutes worth of music.  Also, my early model has a64K and another 32K buffer, and you have to address each separately, loading one with music, then the other, instead of them representing a continguous data space. It's a pain, and there is more 'left-over' unused memory as a result.

<Title>Very Limited
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I returned mine after 3 days - compression below 96K produces very poor quality for all but voice. Most downloadable MP3 music is 128K compression. At these rates you get 30-45 minutes of music and then you need to have  access to a pc to change the music. May be OK for a jogger, but not much  use if you are going to be away from your computer for long. You can get a  good cassette player for less money that is not much bigger than the Rio...  then if you're a jogger you still have the size advantage and if you  aren't, you have the changable selections - and the ability to record about  the same amount of music.

<Title>RIO rules--minidisc sucks
<Date>Thu Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>How long does it take to make minidiscs?  about 10 times longer than it takes to load up free Web tunes to the RIO.  How much does it cost to store MP3 files in a computer: 17.2 Gigabytes is about $200 for a computer hard  disk.  It would cost about $600 to store all the same music on minidiscs.   HELLO--the device is not a storage device, but MP3 is the better storage  media. RIO is a short trip, exercising, taking the bus kind of device. Get  one; it kicks butt.

<Title>Pretty Damn Good
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>What most of these reviewers are forgetting is that the Diamond Rio 300 was the FIRST MP3 player to hit the market.  And it was a great struggle in the courts to even get it released.  <p>I had one of these pre-ordered for  almost 3 months and finally got it 2 days after it was released.  I have  been pretty happy with the way it has held up.  I did a 16 MB upgrade for  it and it seems to hold enough music for me.  <p>It is durable, but the  button control now falls off unexpectadly.  This is probably why they moved  away from this design on the 500.<p>Personally, I would still consider this  a very good MP3 player.  When I bought it it was over $200 and I thought  that was a bargin.  I really just depends on what format your music  collection is...mine is 99% MP3, so these little guys are awesome.

<Title>It was nice at first
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>The rio 300 was great, untill i broke it.......twice!  The first time it broke was for NO apparent reason, which is never a good. I thought it was just a defect, untill 2 weeks of constant jarring and crushing in my  backpack proved otherwise. The front plate was completly torn off. It did  look a little flimsy and weak. So if your a high school student, just  trying to keep up with the ever changing music fads, wait untill one of the  other, stonger Mp3 players drops in price, because it just wont last in  your backpack! For this imperfection, I give the Rio pmp300 TWO STARS.

<Title>Flaws
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>It is cool to have such the technology to listen to music at not have it skip. But Diamond needs work in many areas before they have a great product. First the battery location is not well placed or it needs a better  locking mechanism(mine has tape holding it closed). Second, their customer  service really needs improvement. My first player didn't work correctly. SO  after calling long distance on my dime they sent me out a new one which  intially didn't work. Then I called long distance again to be told that  &quot;this is a common problem&quot; that is not in the manual. But i enjoy  it though.

<Title>MP3 all the Way!
<Date>Fri May 26 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This product is AWESOME!  It was really easy to use, probably because I'm a 13-year-old computer nerd, but anyway, it was really easy to set up.  You plug in the Parallel adapter, and off you go!  I already had RealJukebox and a small collection of mp3's.  And, since I can't really notice any  difference in the quality, I can fit up to 20+ songs without any extra  memory!  This was well worth the $ I paid after a rebate and 3-7 day  shipping.  BUY IT IF YOU HAVE A NEWER COMPUTER AND LIKE MODERN MUSIC  (modern is easier to find)<p>Ciao!

<Title>It gets more difficult the longer you own it!
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>Love the concept.  Love the transportabilty, BUT onehour...means more like 30 minutes AND after you download 50 songs theyexpect you to pay (from there software provider-music match) for adding other songs to your play list.  I am sure there are ways around it, but who wants to spend the time figuring it out?  I want ease and Daimond is not making it easy!  I own stock in the company and am really annoyed that they expect me to pay after I forked over the cash for an over priced piece of...  I will get around it because I grew up on computers, but WHY make it more difficult for me so that I am DRIVEN to write a BAD review at amazon.  I made an effort to write this review so that the comapny will make a change.  Simply...I want to hear a song right now, but because my roommate is sleeping and I USED up my 50 songs I would have to make an even BIGGER effort than signing on and spending 10 minutes writing a NEGATIVE review to DIAMOND in hopes that they will make their product more USER FRIENDLY. When I paid $150, I was not aware that the product ACTUALLY held only 30 minutes and I would be responsible for anything over 50 songs.  I want to feel at ease, in that I can recond ALBUMS and not be selective in songs.  DO SOMETHING DIAMOND OR SONY WILL TRULY MONOPOLIZE THE MARKET!

<Content>I bought the Diamond Rio 300 Player and I love it.  It's is so portable its unbelievable.  One tip though, the speakers that come with it aren't that good.  The plug doesn't fit in well you have to shove it in.  By the  way, if you see that your player keeps pausing it is because your volume is  up too high.

<Content>This is the best little gadget I have!  It's the coolest thing!  It's about the size of a deck of cards and weights about 4 ounces.  It hold 32MB of songs, which turns out to be a lot more than you'd think.  The advertisement says near CD quality music, but I've never had a CD play this  good, and honestly would like to hear CD quality music if this is  &quot;near CD quality&quot;.  It's well worth the money-- it's an offer you'd be crazy to pass up!

<Title>Somewhat disappointing
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>When I bought this product, the price seemed right, and the sound was great. Overtime however, my control pad wore out smooth!  My battery mechanism holder broke!  And the headphones broke as well!  I got a  replacement pair, but those eventually broke too. The Rio offers an hour of  music storage.....which is only true if you use 64kbps!  Pretty much  cassette tape quality. An expansion card will allow the Rio to hold more,  but at almost 100$!  The sound never TRULY disappointed me, but it should  be noted that it ISNT EVER CD quality. NEVER. It takes away bass from songs  to allow more volume. The durability on this product is a joke. The  software that came with it was efficient, but not great. It would be more  cost efficient to get a CD-Recorder and make CDs rather than to use this!   Don't waste your money!  Get an Mp3 player from a better company such as  Creative, or possibly even Sony.

<Title>Works great for me
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>This thing was the first MP3 ever? Wow! Not too shabby. Its durable,it has good sound (satisfactory at 64kbs), it looks cool, and most importantly: it gets the job done.  Throwing music on the Rio from my CD's and my computer is simple. Who cares if it doesn't support USB? I can go brush my teeth or  clean my room while I wait 5 minutes for all 17 songs to download onto the  Rio. That's right, 17 songs at 64kbs, which makes me happy since I haven't  even upgraded this inexpensive device yet. In fact, i might not even need  to upgrade it; I'm already content. No moving parts, no skipping, la dee da  da, bla bla,great sound, and it all does the job with one &quot;AA&quot;  battery, which lasts for hours upon hours. I honestly, have no complaints,  really. Listen to this picky electronics consumer's advice: if you know how  to use a computer and you want a quality MP3 player worth your hard earned  money, go buy the Rio.  ..., sweet.

<Content>This product is a great idea, but needs alot of work. First off it only holds 30 minutes of music - that needs to be expanded. The second problem is that to get the MP3s on the Rio you need a Microsoft WIndows machine.  This completely ignores Macintosh and other operating systems.

<Title>the RIO is way cool...
<Date>Fri Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I think this is a wonderful product.  I purchased the SE (64 meg) and have  not experienced the problems mentioned in previous reviews.  Downloads  taking too long?  Try closing other applications and freeing up some  resources -- mine takes about 30 seconds for a 4 minute song.  Music isn't  loud enough?  Try using other headphones -- I keep the volume between  &quot;5&quot; and &quot;8&quot; while running and it's plenty loud.  All I  years?  Since when has *any* of the cool, new stuff been available for the  Mac?  &quot;Thinking differently&quot; has its drawbacks guys!  ;-)  And  finally don't even try to weigh it against the Minidisc, it's like  comparing apples and oranges.<p>If you're only curious about the RIO, the  one sold here with is a great deal after the $50 rebate.  If you know  you'll want to store gobs of music and upgrade later, go ahead and spring  for the SE... You won't be disappointed

<Title>Rio works for Talk Radio too!
<Date>Fri Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I use the Rio SE to hold 8-10 hours of talk radio programs converted to MP3 from RA.  While the Rio sounds terrific playing music encoded at 128 kps, at 16 kps you can get lengthy play time.  Since talk radio is  generally heard on AM radio, the lower quality sampling rate sounds  familiar.<p>Since I always thought MP3 was the venue for pirated copies,  garage bands, and alternative music, I had always ignored the format.  This  Rio is the answer to a talk radio addict's dream.

<Date>Fri Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>Woo hoo, I can pay $100 and get a chip that'll hold an hour of audio, or I can spend $2.50 and get a MiniDisc that'll hold 74 minutes of superior sound. Add to that the fact that I can record a concert or other event  without having to have a computer present. Also factor in the fact that a  Minidisc play-only unit can be had in the same price range. You decide.

<Title>Great product with a few limitations
<Date>Sat Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>I have had my rio for quite some time now, and i must say that it was the best money i spent on an audio device, or computer peripheral. It is extremely light weight, slightly smaller than a pack of cigerettes, runs on  one AA battery (lasts about 14 hours). The music, despite what some people  say, can sound great. the software you use makes a huge difference. the  included software is good, but you can download free software that is  better. It will hold about 7-8 of your favorite tracks at almost CD  quality. Most of the time cd's only have that many good tracks anyway. The  only downside is that you can't change tracks when away from your computer,  but most of the time even that's not a big deal. I bought my rio when it  was still $199 and i feel that it was well worth the price.

<Title>Excellent product/Too little storage
<Date>Sat Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 1999
<Content>This device is great for on the go people. It's small, lite, and the playback is great. What really annoys me though is the short playtime you get if you don't compress the music into the player. Compressing the music  will only make your music (if you really care about what you are listening  to) sound pretty bad. I recently bought a 32MB memory card for my Rio,  which is the other problem: MEMORY IS EXPENSIVE. It cost me $99!! And  what's worse is the fact that a new Rio is coming out with 64MB of flash  memory included! Also, I've encountered another problem with Rio, if it  suddenly gets hit, the thing will just stop playing. Sure, it doesn't skip  if you shake it, but a sudden jolt on the thing while riding in your car or  working out will make it stop for some reason. Another problem is the slow  process of recording your CDs and putting it into the device. All in all  though, I'm pretty satisfied with the device. Because of it's portability  and great sound quality, it more than makes up for its weaknesses.

<Content>This product was a God Send for me, as I love to listen while on the run.  I had been using a 40 second EASS CD player that weighted about a pound and ate batteries.  The Rio controls are super easy to use while in motion and  in the dark.  <p>I load my music from CDs.  It takes a long time to crunch  the cd to mp3, but you can have the pc cranking away while you are doing  other tasks and once you have the database, changing the music inside the  Rio is real fast.<p>Overall a well thought out product.  What we need now  is a water proof model.
