<Content>But now its gone bad!! Iriver support is not responding. I can't down load the updater to my H10,it won't reformat, and emails are getting me nowhere. Worst yet I miss my music. Like a relationship gone bad, it was great while it lasted, but the end was really sour.

<Title>I have never HATED a device as much as this one!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am actually on my 3rd H10 having had to receive 2 RMA numbers from iRiver.     The number of issues I have w/ this thing is difficult to even tally up.  Generally I wouldn't bother writing a reveiw; however, this morning I find myself having to wipe the piece of cr*p clean for the 30th time and re-syncing several thousand songs once again.  I'm not even going to bother.  I'm just going to go buy a new mp3 player and be done w/ it.  If you buy one of these things after reading this then I can only assume you are a masochist.

<Title>Great first player. Experienced no problems.
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While I wasn't ecstatic about receiving an iRiver (I wanted an Ipod), once I started using it I really loved it. It works well with Windows media player, I didn't have to download any software and moving around the menu is extremely easy. I didn't have the charging and battery problems everyone else had, but maybe that's because I read the manual. You don't have to connect to the computer to charge it; you need only connect the mp3 side of the usb cable to your player and THEN connect the ac adapter to player/wall. The only thing I needed to do to my player was update the firmware, which was easy if you can follow directions. Songs aren't always played in order (kind of annoying), but not so much that it ruined my experience with the player. SMART and AFFORDABLE BUY!

<Title>Hands down the best player available
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Without a doubt the best player out there. I was blown away by the build quality and attention to detail, iriver really put a lot of work into this. You will wish your cell phone/PDA could even come close to this quality. Took it out of the box, pluged it into usb port and opened explorer (just like a drive letter!), draged mp3s to it, done within 5 min of opening the box. No need to use Windows Medeia Player. A really cool feature lets you record from the FM radio to. By the way the display resolution is 128 x 128 so you can optimize photos (not in the manual or web site). If you are deciding between Ipod and the H10, there is no comparison other than GB, this unit makes the Ipod look like a cheap kids toy.

<Title>REVISED
<Date>Sat Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing it's way better than any other mp3 player I've used. Here are the specs: FEATURES  * Plays up to 150 hours of digital music* * 5GB of internal storage** * Vivid color display * Ultra-intuitive interface with convenient touch strip * Displays your digital photos * Slim, lightweight design * PlaysForSure enabled to play more of your music * Rechargeable, removable battery lasts up to 12hrs. * Built-in FM tuner and FM recorder * Integrated voice recorder * Ultra-fast USB 2.0 transfers * Supports MP3, WMA, JPEG and TXT files * Enhanced 3D audio (supports SRS WOW  PACKED WITH  * iriver earphones * Carrying case with belt clip * USB 2.0 interface cable * Installation CD * AC adapter  PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  * Windows XP (Service Pack 1 or higher) * CD-ROM Drive * USB Port  It has a great navigation system almost as good as the iPods click wheel.(but that thing is really hard to match) It's features rival that of it's opponents and tops them all. The 3 players I checked out were the iPod mini, the creative zen micro, and of course the H10. I didn't think the Mini was worth $250 when it can't use Napster has no microphone or radio. The Zen micro was my 2nd choice because it has a radio and mic plus it looks way cool with the blue LED in the back and the colors but that is more of a gimmic than a plus and the touch pad doesn't work that well. Then I saw this by accident actually. I downloaded Napster onto my comp and was looking at it's special offers to see what would work with it. I was going to get the zen micro then I finally checked this thing out and I was captured. Since the iRiver H230 looked ugly I never cared abought them but this thing is beautiful and it looks professional. The color screen is a little to small but it looksamazing compared to most LCD screens like the iPod so when you turn it the image isn't negative. It's simplistic button layout is a definate plus which makes it so you don't have to take much time to get used to it. Also it has volume control on the side unlike the zen and iPod. The sorage is fine with me because I don't need my entire music collection with me at all times. However you can't directly link your H10 to a digital camera. Plus it has a few minor bugs. Hopefully iriver will make a firmware update.(mud slinging lol must be a fanboy of iriver) I wish the price was $250 so it could compete with the iPod mini and zen micro easily. But when you make an investment like this you know it's going to work and it does. It also comes with a great iskin which protects it from any fall. This thing is small though I was suprised when I opened it up. Supposedly it weighs less than the iPod mini and it's a photo player!!!  what I said up there ^ is an out of the box reviewwhich you shouldn't trust after only a week of having this machine it is a pain in the @ss. iRiver should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a premature item with all its bugs. this thing doesn't like a lot of computers and has problems with freezing but worst of all it can't play albums in track order. this is terrible for people like me who listen to bands like green day and linkin park who use transitions in their songs but even then there are pauses inbetween songs. If I bought a camera I'd expect it to work without having to wait a long time for it to be fixed. iRiver has terrible american support which is unacceptable even if they are based in korea. I can't give this thing anything higher than a 3 because it's faults are too big. this had a lot going for it but iRiver being as smart as they are released it way too early

<Title>Disappointment
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered the H10 and have now sent it back.  I have had problems similar to those many others listed.  The radio worked great and picked up even distant stations well.  The user interface and size are fantastic.  However, when I loaded music with WMP10, it would not work.  This includes MP3s and WMAs ripped from my own CDs as well as Napster to Go.  I uninstalled and reinstalled WMP10 and got the latest download from Microsoft.  Using this and USB 2.0 on both a Falcon Northwest Pentium 4 3.06 MHz (XP Home) and a Sony Vaio laptop (XP Professional), I had the same problems with both computers and had to conclude that the device was not functional.  The names of the songs jumbled such that artist names were linked to songs of different artists.  The menu and directories were all goofed up.  Many songs loaded but wouldn't play.  Some would play a few times and then everything would jumble up.  Tech support from iRiver was virtually nonexistent.  I sent it back and ordered a Zen Micro today.  I'm hoping I'll have more success.  Overall, the H10 is a very nice device conceptually but it might be better to wait for a later model with more stable technology if you want to order this player.

<Title>The product does not work - Zero support from IRiver
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this product about 2 weeks ago.  In spite of hours spent on researching tips from the Misticriver forum and trying all sorts of different ways, the product has not worked correctly.  The playlists do not work, the lists by artists and album is corrupted.  The tech support, which is open only during business hours, has at least 45 minute wait.  They clearly do not have answers to the problems with playlists, etc.  My inquiries via email have been unanswered.  It is clear that the product was prematurely launched to coincide with the Napster to Go campaign.  It is a nice paperweight, if you can afford to spend over $250 for a paperweight!

<Title>No problems here... and Napster to go
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have other iRiver products so when I decided I wanted to go with Napster To Go (monthly subscription service that lets you "rent" tracks for compatible players), I knew I would go with iRiver.  The H10 is an elegant little machine -- very nice to look at and solidly built. The interface on the player isn't all that great, occasionally confusing, but it works.  I have had no problems getting music onto the player. It works well with the Napster software. I play albums -- in track order -- by creating playlists in Napster and transfering those playlists onto the player. It's a snap.  And the sound is wonderful. I've been using some pretty good Sony headphones so far and have been satisfied with the sound quality. I have some Shure phones coming soon and expect it to sound even better.  Bottom line. For me the player has been almost flawless.

<Content>I was given the iriver H10 as a gift.  Upon opening the box, two inserts read,"STOP, before returning this product........."  That should have been my first clue that something was wrong.  The second insert recommended that I contact iriver via e-mail if I had a problem.  I did contact them, over a week ago, still no response!  The product is terrible!  It copied my whole MY documents file.  I tried to delete it, it wouldn't allow me to do so.  Now, when I return the product for a FULL refund, I have to make sure the salesperson can delete my files in the H10.  Also, EVERY time I tried to download files, it froze my computer!  Absolutely the worst!  Don't buy it.

<Title>Great product, although not perfect
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When this mp3 player was first announced and I started to see it all over the net, I was excited. I am a long time iRiver enthusiast (also an anti iPod) and their first micro hard drive mp3 player looked great, with a color screen, and of course tons of other features that iRiver always includes. (By the way, this is where Apple falls short - they dish out the same thing over and over, saying it's a "new generation" iPod with nothing different except the front design. The iPod never has extra features except games, it has terrible battery life, and plus it looks rather uninteresting to me, though not overly ugly.)  Unfortunately for me, when I ordered this iRiver H10 from Amazon (just two weeks ago it cost $271 now it costs 280, I have no clue as to why) they sent the wrong product! I had to return it and order from Newegg. In any case, the red version of this player looks simply amazing. Great sleek design, beautiful color screen, and the red metallic color tops it off. It's a lot lighter than I expected, you have to feel it in your hand for this fact to hit you. The button layout is bot intuitive and comfoprtable.  When I turned this player on my amazement didn't cease. The color screen had better resolution than my color cell phone! The touch pad worked a lot better and easier than Zen Micro's touch pad. I proceeded to plug it into my computer to start downloading music into it. I had no problems with syncing with Windows Media Player, only a slight learning curve. I certainly didn't experience any freezing or crashing problems that many other people mentioned. It might be that they had defective products or their computers are somehow incompatible, though I can't imagine why. After I got some songs into it I listened to the sound quality. Amazing sound. There are thirty or so different preset EQ modes, including an SRS WOW that you can customize, and another Custom EQ. The default EQ is nothing compared to SRS.  So far no problems. The only thing that annoyed me about this player is that it arranges songs in alphabetical order, even if there are numbers in front of them. Let's say you copy a cd into your computer and sync it into the H10. When you rip from cds using WMP, then it automatically puts track numbers into the music files. For example: 01 Foreward 02 Don't Stay 03 Somewhere I Belong etc  When you download it into the player, the numbers are gone and you see the songs arranged in alphabetical order, even when you browse song titles in albums. This can be remedied by changing the titles of the songs like this: 01 songtitle to 01 - songtitle  put a space, a dash, and then another space in between the number and title. Then, go to properties for that song and do the same thing in "Summary" where you input the title, artist, album, etc. Doing this with all the songs should put them in the original album's order. I just found this extremely annoying to do with hundreds of songs, and iRiver should fix this bug.  In any case, I found this player to be out of the ordinary, with great quality sound, beautiful design, and a handful of extra features like text and photo viewing.  And by the way, I know how annoying iRiver support is, with unresponsive service and the like. iRiver orginates from Korea, and the service is a lot better there, along with product quality, and I heard they have no bugs over there. So maybe it's just over here in the US that the problems are occuring.

<Title>iRiver H10 tries, but flunks. Wait for updated drivers
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love iriver products, and was blown away with the sound on this player, but I had UNRESOLVABLE problems with the player and Windows Media 10. I downloaded the "fix" from the iRiver site, but I just couldn't get it to work without re-running the "fix" over and over again. Finally, I returned the player to Best Buy, severely disappointed.  They need to create a new version of iRiver Music Manager as an ALTERNATIVE so one can just drag and drop the songs from your hard drive to the player. The Windows Media 10 is incomprehensible to use; and the connectivity "For Sure" is not sure at all! Furthermore, the documentation doesn't explain HOW to get photos on the player. WM 10 placed them on the file system, but the only way to see them was to use the file "browser" on the H10. Another problem was that the playlists were all "out" of sequenced from the alphabetical order I created on WM10. (This was when I COULD get the WM10 to recognize it). After awhile, I couldn't get WM10 to connect to the H10 at all.  Calls to the tech support line yielded busy signals for 2 days. My email to customer service has yet to be answered.  This has soured me from purchasing iRiver products for some time. Too bad for them.....

<Title>Worst MP3 Player I Have Ever Owned!
<Date>Thu Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Over the last couple years, I have owned a variety of music players. Here is a brief timeline: Rio (64MB) -> Mini Disc (Sony 74 mins) -> iPod (1st Generation 5GB) -> iFP-390T (iRiver 256MB) -> H10 (iRiver 5GB - Present) -> iFP-899 (iRiver 1GB - Present). The H10 is by far the worst player I have ever owned. Here is a list of frustrations that I have experienced during the short time I have owned it:  -Short battery life. I have only made it to about 6-7 hours. Much shorter than the 12 hours listed by the manufacturer.  -Frequent crashes. Much like the only operating system it works with, my H10 has crashed on multiple occasions. So far I have found that the only way to reset the player is to remove the battery. This is made more frustrating when you have the protective skin on, as you have to completely remove it first.  -Slow song changes. It's not very scientific, but it feels like it takes about a second or so to skip to the next song. It makes me think that the buffer is very small. I could be wrong, but believe that the iPod buffers about 20 minutes.  -Poor functionality I. In the morning I like to listen to the radio and switch to music during commercials. With the H10, you have to back out through quite a few screens to get to the radio from the music function.  -Poor functionality II. There does not seem to be any way to create multiple, on-the-fly playlists. You can create one quick playlist and that is it. Has iRiver never seen an iPod?  -Inaccurate battery indicator. This is related to the battery life issue, but is a different problem. On multiple occasions, the indicator has read 100% full for 4 hours, then when I shut it down and turn it back on, it reads 50% full. It will work for about another 2 hours, then completely shutdown due to insufficient battery power.   The H10 has a few other things working against it, but I have listed the ones that bug me on a daily basis. Hopefully, a firmware update will come out soon that will fix some things, but the short battery life is really annoying. Maybe it's so you have to buy additional batteries from them, I don't know.  There is a happy ending to all of this, although it does not involve the H10, but does include iRiver. I missed my iFP-390T and hated the H10 so much that I went out and bought the iRiver iFP-899. The 899 is, without a doubt, the best player I have ever owned (sorry 390T). I'll probably write a review for it, or maybe the 799, which is pretty similar. I love iRiver, but I wish they would put as much care into their hard drive players as they do with their flash players. If you need tons of space and no FM radio, go get an iPod. If you need tons of space and as well as FM radio, go get an iPod mini and use the extra money to buy a good mini radio. The H10 is too little, too late to compete with what is out there. Nothing is innovative about it, and it is more expensive that similar items. Even the Napster To Go service, which only looks good on paper, can't make the H10 worth the price of admission.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been looking for a new replacement MP3 player for my Ipod 3G 30 Gig.  I was thinking about Ipos Shuffle, Ipod Mini, or Zen Micro (or Zen Micro Color).  Then by accident, I stumpled upon Irivier H10.  It is very small, stylish, and easy to operate.  It's got FM radio, voice/FM recording, color screen (to view pics), and other standard MP3 functions.  It's only $30 more than Mini, but has so much more to offer.  The sound quality is great (but not w/ the included earpiece) and there are 40 sound presets (including your own setting).  In the package, you will also receive a transparent plastic skin.  It fits the player perfectly and easy to remove if you choose to.  This usually goes for $8+ for ipod, and you get it free.  Sure, you can't view those pics on TV like Ipod Photo, but who cares?  What's the chance of you carrying a cable w/ you at all times?  The battery life is around 12 hours per charge and it is replaceble as well.  That means you can buy an extra battery for your long trip to extend the battery life or change it when the battery dies in a year or so.  It is a true Ipod Mini killer and I've used 2 Ipods, Sony MP3 player, and a Samsung MP3 players.  Strongly recommended!  Edit 1:  *After I went to Apple Store yesterday and played around with Ipod Photo, I'm even more impressed with H10 color screen. On Ipod Photo, you have to view the screen directly (right in front of the screen) in order to see the photo clearly.  Otherwise, the photo/lcd will look dim. But, Ipod Photo has faster photo browsing speed.  As I said before, viewing photo on mp3 isn't a priority for me and I'm very happy as is right now.  *I haven't have much problem/bug with this machine yet as others have described here.  The only thing that I've experienced is that once I connect the player to my PC, I can't see the "remove this external drive icon" in the taskbar after a while.  So, I simply unplug the connection cable/usb.  Luckily nothing has happened yet.  *Many people asked me about the skin, well, it is just the Ipod skin you buy in Apple store but fits much nicer on the player.  I can't stress how nice it fits on H10.  For my Ipod, I litterally have to force it onto my ipod (because it sticks to the player so much that the friction is making it hard to do). And yes, it will attracks dirt just like other skins. If you worry about the look of it, don't use it.  If you want a good protection for the player on the go, this is a good choice.

<Content>Do not buy this player as its sound quality is nowhere near to the Creative Zen Micro , Only good thing about this player is Good FM reception , It gives distored sound with EQ settings .I have tried with studio series sony headphones also , whereas with full volume and EQ settings Zen micro gives very ultimate sound. But if someone wants fancy look and facility to store the JPG files can go for this player.

<Title>the perfect mp3 player
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is more of a zen micro killer than an iPod killer...or perhaps its both. It seems to be based on the latest chipset from portalplayer and uses almost all of the features ( unlike apple). I have a iPod 40g for my collection but wanted something to try napster to go. Well, I found it. I am kind of in awe of this mp3 player. It seems to be a lot like the iPod in intelligent filing system and ease of use AND it looks pretty good too. Of course I love the color screen and fm. This puts the creative product to shame. The iPod is in a class by itself-- its the "in" player and might always be. However, if there ever was a true challenger its the h10. I am really happy to own an iPod AND an h10.  BOTTOM LINE: This is as close to an iPod to date as far as looks and feel, and has a ton more features. I doubt it will really hurt the iPod mystique, but it is far superior to any creative zen or dell dj products which look cheap and seem to be inferior in quality ( build). It blows most players out of the water. This is the perfect player for people who like iPods like myself, but want to try napster as well too. It's just a great mp3 player and I can't really express just how nice this thing feels in the hand and operates so nicely. It's more like a pda than a player in some regards. ( very advanced filing system, menus) I really think this is going to sell like hotcakes once they start circulating...and the most bashing will come from creative ( they also make dj) because they can see how much better the iriver product is.  The firmware fix is on iriver.com website now. iriver fixed the bugs that all the bashers said would never be fixed lol. What a bunch of losers on these review boards!

<Title>research this player before committing
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: great build, feels nice and solid;  - the touch pad is excellent very precise movement: tapping the top and bottom of the strip or simply holding it down allows excellent precision and accuracy.  - great feedback with the buttons (you don't have to wonder if you pressed a button when it's in your pocket). - sound quality is excellent volume from 0 - 40. around 20 is already loud enough for me. - color screen; big pictures will appear blurry, but it's expected with a small screen - very intuitive controls. the back button always brings you back to the last screen no matter what the last screen is. example: while in the picture browser i wanted to change the song click FF then click back and i'm back in the picture browser. - excellent shuffle mode algorithm: you will not hear the same song twice as it the player takes the played songs out of the algorithm - MTP = drag and drop if you prefer it more than windows media player. there is no propietary software (but drag and drop is slower than syncing with WMP. it's still not UMS) - excellent FM tuner - battery life is excellent, it actually gets about 12 hours as advertised - removable battery - comes with a iskin like case (but the case attracts a lot of dust)  CONS - IRIVER hurried to release this product; thus, the software isn't complete. there are A LOT OF BUGS. Hopefully, these bugs will be fixed soon with a firmware upgrade. here's some of the bugs 1. some might encounter problems with syncing with wmp i/o error 2. albums on player plays in alphabetical instead of by track number 3. the clock on the player might not work 4. the back light turns on and off randomly in some units. there are some more bugs... visit www.misticriver.net   - you can rate songs on the player but it doesn't integrate with windows media. so a rating of 5 on a song does not update your library on windows media. the player just put the 5 stars first and 1 star last in a list. - for some, this might be a con but not for me - once the backlight is off the screen is pitch black, you can't see anything. press any button turns the backlight on then proceed with function. so if you want the player to FF you got to press it twice. - file browing is slow in browser mode (not the music browser but the file browser the music browser by artist, title.... is nice and fast) - horrible tech support. expect long wait time. (called around 4:30 ish, never answered...finally at about 5:05 got a voice mail saying their hours are from XXXX to 5:00pm)  conclusion. i'm giving a 3 star because at $280 there are simply too many bugs with the player right now; with time IRIVER will release upgrades to fix these issues because it's their new flagship model. the functions and features of the player beats any player out there within the same price range. be patient with this player, it will be an excellent product if IRiver fix all the bugs.  for more research info goto www.misticriver.net click on forums then the H series   it's an excellent forum for support and faqs.   EDIT: regarding "tommygman" i'm glad your player works perfectly. and no i did not simply read something negative. I have a H10 myself and i'm waiting patiently for an upgrade. furthermore, i can tell you that the Korean version of H10 (UMS) which came out a month before the us version (MTP) already had 2 firmware upgrades while they're on FW1.10 the us is still on FW1.00 IRiver has a list of bug fixes which you can find at misticriver.net

<Title>Me likee iRiver....
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll just start by saying, I've had an iRiver mp3 player since April, and except for some stupid things done on my part, it's worked perfectly, and the little 190T of mine has even survived a five-foot drop on a hard stone floor, and has an excellent equalizer, and just adjusting the bass and treble gives it spectacular sound. Judging by others' reviews, I assume the H10 is no exception. As soon as I amass the necessary funds, I intend to buy this, and rock out! The removable battery was iRiver's smartest move in my opinion, and that will give it the serious edge over the iPod. Creative's mp3 players are fairly good, but a friend of mine has one, and the bass is nowhere near as powerful as from my little 190T. The sound overall from the Creative Nomad was diminuitive compared to the 190T.    People who like excellent sound, compact packages, convenient controls, and the complement of a removable rechargeable battery will not regret this mp3 player at all (and yes, firmware upgrades are a must for ANY mp3 player, and iRiver is sure as heck no exception.), and will find a good deal of use from it. Peace out. Chaos in.  I have a few other questions: can this player be used as a backup hard drive? I know that the 20 and 40 GB models can be used that way, but can the 5 gig H10 be as well?  Does the .TXT support mean one can read MS Word documents? That alone would have me drooling a veritable Columbia River. I like to edit my stories on the road, and being able to read over my stories to catch my mistakes would be a definite bonus. That's my bit. But do try and think outside the iPod. This one's a definite up-and-comer.

<Title>Small, Feature Filled, Awesome new player
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all I have to say that my new iRiver h10 has NONE of the so called "bugs" mentioned in an earlier review. I'd love to know how many people actually had these and if that reviewer just read something negative on a bulliten board and felt compelled to bash as if every player had a defect lol. I've been through this player and the manual and everything worked-- and I did check out the site mentioned about the h10 bugs too to make sure mine didnt have any!. Well, my H10 works like a charm and iRiver site mentions that any firmware updates will be posted as needed. 'Nuf said. Back to reality-If you have windows xp and want to use napster to go, it was tailor made for that but of course its great for any mp3's or wavs too. Instead of wondering what it has, let's just say it has just about everything and at a great price. The bonus is that this is a super high quality player that looks simply amazing. I consider this an iPod plus, the plus being fm, recording, removeable battery etc. Its a pleasure to hold and look , and with windows media player 10 its a joy with this music system they worked out ( with microsoft)that Im using. This thing is simply the best mp3 player available. The only con is that it doesnt use iTunes. Its going to be a huge success for iRiver- there is no doubt about it. Ive been using mp3 players since before there were any hard drive models. Its unreal to have one this small with all the features and such an intense menu system with color .jpg viewing  of photos thrown in too. I have it right here and love it already. Mine is grey and very sleek. The design looks 10 times better in real life. Im prone to be pro iPod but have to admit this is really really close in the iPod style department and way ahead in features. Conclusion: The H10 just came out. It's going to be a huge hit and because of this there will be a lot of negatives tossed about by competitors. The fact is that mine works perfectly, sounds better than the creative and rio players Ive had in the past, and importantly looks amazing compared to the competition. Highly recommend.

<Title>Coolest Player for the Money
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I absolutely love this thing. Design is hot and it has the perfect small form factor and frankly I dont know how they got it all in such a small package. I got through the options/features as there are a lot of them and its this is killer plus. I've never had so much fun figuring out a player. I haven't noticed any bugs in my lounge dark grey H10 . IMPORTANT NOTE: The picture here doesn't do it justice. The amazon.com picture is distorted. It has the player tilted which as any photograhper knows causes bad distortion. In real life this will take your breath away. Basics: Super lightweight color screen for photos. A  slim  0.6 inches thick weighing only 3.4 ounces!!!! Amazing touch strip control and removeable rechargeable battery with 12-hour + ( my home test) battery life. Great  voice recorder and a digital FM tuner with FM recorder. The best thing about it is how small it is. Its going to surprise you. But, its not too small. Cool small is more like it. If you don't fall in love with this I will be surprised. Features are important and it sounds great. Looks are important and it looks great. Price is important and its priced low for the features it has. There are a few mini players around now but none with the features this has that look this good. I guess that's what got me interested in the first place. Good luck with whatever you choose. Im a happy camper with my h10!   More info-" PlaysForSure-verified with Windows Media Player 10 with  for Auto Sync for music, photos and playlists. You can choose from a growing number of PlaysForSure download and subscription stores, -- comes with earphones, carrying case with belt clip, USB 2.0 cable, AC adapter, and installation CD-ROM. "

<Title>Awesome Player!  Be sure to upgrade the firmware.
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is hands down best in class...  Comes with great sounding Sennheiser earbuds (must have upgrade if you buy other players). Move over Ipod Mini, Creative Micro and Rio Carbon!  Uh, I forgot they don't have color screen to view photos.  :)  It's obvous that some earlier reviewers are slinging mud...  Hey Bill Gates showed Iriver player at CES 2005, OK!  Got it?  Iriver ROCKs!    Ipod was too well "fem" look for my taste.  Had Rio Carbon but it had terrible sound quality (PCMag was right and good riddance).  Have Creative Muvo and thought it sounded great (of course had to spend another $25 for Sennheiser earbuds as Creative's stock earbuds was TERRIBLE) until of course I got this awesome player!  Best part is that I was among the first 1000 people who got it on Superbowl Sunday for only $180 shipped from Napster including 12 months subcription!  So go get this player as great deal even at $280!    Update -  Hard drive failed on the unit I had.  Called tech support and had to wait 30 min plus but the tech support guy was wonderful and issued RMA on the spot.  Now that's service!

<Title>Great Mp3 Player worth the money!
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this thing it's way better than any other mp3 player I've used. Here are the specs: FEATURES  * Plays up to 150 hours of digital music* * 5GB of internal storage** * Vivid color display * Ultra-intuitive interface with convenient touch strip * Displays your digital photos * Slim, lightweight design * PlaysForSure enabled to play more of your music * Rechargeable, removable battery lasts up to 12hrs. * Built-in FM tuner and FM recorder * Integrated voice recorder * Ultra-fast USB 2.0 transfers * Supports MP3, WMA, JPEG and TXT files * Enhanced 3D audio (supports SRS WOW  PACKED WITH  * iriver earphones * Carrying case with belt clip * USB 2.0 interface cable * Installation CD * AC adapter  PC SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  * Windows XP (Service Pack 1 or higher) * CD-ROM Drive * USB Port  It has a great navigation system almost as good as the iPods click wheel.(but that thing is really hard to match) It's features rival that of it's opponents and tops them all. The 3 players I checked out were the iPod mini, the creative zen micro, and of course the H10. I didn't think the Mini was worth $250 when it can't use Napster has no microphone or radio. The Zen micro was my 2nd choice because it has a radio and mic plus it looks way cool with the blue LED in the back and the colors but that is more of a gimmic than a plus and the touch pad doesn't work that well. Then I saw this by accident actually. I downloaded Napster onto my comp and was looking at it's special offers to see what would work with it. I was going to get the zen micro then I finally checked this thing out and I was captured. Since the iRiver H230 looked ugly I never cared abought them but this thing is beautiful and it looks professional. The color screen is a little to small but it looksamazing compared to most LCD screens like the iPod so when you turn it the image isn't negative. It's simplistic button layout is a definate plus which makes it so you don't have to take much time to get used to it. Also it has volume control on the side unlike the zen and iPod. The sorage is fine with me because I don't need my entire music collection with me at all times.  However you can't directly link your H10 to a digital camera. Plus it has a few minor bugs. Hopefully iriver will make a firmware update.(mud slinging lol must be a fanboy of iriver)  I wish the price was $250 so it could compete with the iPod mini and zen micro easily. But when you make an investment like this you know it's going to work and it does. It also comes with a great iskin which protects it from any fall. This thing is small though I was suprised when I opened it up. Supposedly it weighs less than the iPod mini and it's a photo player!!!   iRiver has set a new standard for photo viewing mp3 players and micro harddrive players at the same time.

<Title>very nice but not perfect
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>pros: nice look, good feeling in hand due to metalic body       slim and light weight        color screen is bright and clear       easy to navigate ( after you get music or photos in to it)       Fm radio is terrific       sound is good, i am still testing the 30 EQ setting       btw MX 400 is a nice earbud  cons: i am using windows xp sp2, wmp 10 , but it still takes        me several hours to figure out how to sync playlist and        photo, since normally i just drag and drop music to mp3       players. I dont know windows media player can creat a    playlist of photos beofore. Also the gel case from the box seems useless, it doesn't provide anything to protect the beautiful screen, Maybe I need to get a cell phone screen sticker.   All in all, h10 is the best 5 g player of its kind( if you say ipod is the best it is also ok, ipod is ipod, who cares)

<Content>Actually, 4.5 star. Very well built machine. Evrything is perfect.  Due to the misleading of the user manual on connecting and disconnecting from a computer, I substract 0.5 star. It is noted here that you can not handle it as a regular USB hard drive, as most of the mp3 player in the market.  Strongly recommend it to anyone who is seeking a mp3 player.

<Title>A few major flaws.... 
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For most of us looking for a fast and reliable music player, this one appeared to be the one. At least, at first sight, it had potential. After working with an iPod for a while and its horrible iTunes music manager or Sony's music software, I felt relieved that a digital player would now be easily recognized as a mass storage device, thus facilitating the file transferring process from my PC. However, this single feature is worthless when it comes to managing your playlists. Lets face it, your not managing 50 o 100 files, you have 5 gigs of audio tracks in storage and it would be nice to find them easily, not to mention, program the way the files are played. You cannot create your own playlists unless you use WMP, and that is a problem. You should be able to transfer your playlist files either from Winamp or any other player to the device or simply create your own in the H10 based on the folders the music is located in. Tech support is inexistent, and no software is provided with the device.   Most of us use a single media player of our choice, not necessarily Windows Media Player. In my case, I've been using Winamp for several years (mostly for its simplicity), and I would certainly like the option to transfer playlist as an .m3u.   Pros - Low price - Superb sound - Multiple audio playback support - Built in Radio and recorder - Drag-n-drop capabilities  Cons - Lack of playlist and music management - Scroll pad is not to useful - The photo viewer is as bad as it gets  Overall, I believe this product is not recommended for beginners, unless you like to spend time surfing the web trying to find answers for all your needs. Still, its ahead of its competitors. Sad.

<Title>Nice when it worked, but poorly made and unreliable
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice gadget for the 1 year and 11 days that I had it, until it suddenly broke completely, for no apparent reason, and I had to buy a new player.  The warranty is 1 year!  $229 for a disposable MP3 player is a lot of dough.  Initial use was painful due to flaky firmware that iRiver eventually improved, they just released it too soon.  That got better but the user experience with iRiver plus Yahoo Music Engine was awful, largely due to Yahoo Music Engine being brand new.  Better now but this is still a collaboration between three vendors (iRiver, Yahoo, and Microsoft) that is not always smooth.  Bottom line is that I'm deeply unhappy with having this device fail on me 11 days out of warranty.  I have replaced it with a Creative Zen player and will never buy anything from iRiver again.

<Title>Not worth the headache
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player).  Finally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products!  As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one.  It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months.  Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though).  Be smart, stick to a Creative, the new Toshiba Gigabeat S, or (clench your fists) an iPod.

I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....

<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The H10 is a nice looking device that doesn't work.  I have a constant reoccurring problem where the device will hang when you select a song or playlist.  The hourglass (initializing) will remain until the unit runs down the battery.  The only solution is to reinstall the firmware which also deletes all your files.  You have to use Windows Media Player to transfer and sync files.  WMP is clumsy to use.  It is not user friendly at all.  Anyway, after the firmware reinstall it will work for a while and then just start hanging again.  I used to be a faithful iRiver customer, but not any more.

<Title>H10 has been an excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have read some of the negative reviews and agree with some of them, on a very limited basis. Most I disagree with. Maybe some of these folks have bought lemons. I bought my first H10, the red 5GB, over a year ago. Since then, for family members, I have bought:  2 5GB H10s 2 6GB H10s 1 20GB H10 (listening to my 20GB as I write this. Someone else in the family has the red 5GB).  Needless to say, I think it is a great product. Sounds great, great display, great features. I have always made sure I had the most recent firmware on all of them. Maybe that is part of the problem the others are experiencing...they are not taking the time to do "routine maintenance". Response for service issues from iriver is not great. They take too long to respond to my emails, but usually do in the long run. I think you have to be a bit computer literate to use WMP (Windows Media Player) to do the song syncs/playlists. I really like the WMP now. It took some time to get used to it. Playlists are a bit difficult to do, but doable. So, I give this product 4 stars based on my extensive experience with the H10. It sounds better than the Dell and Creative MP3 players I have and far more flexible. Thinking of buying the Iriver Clix now.

<Title>Falls below expectations
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The specifications for the H10 looked good when I was reading it, but unforunately this mp3 fell short of my expectations.  Positives: Color screen Radio Tuner  Negatives: The USA version, which is what I bought through Amazon.com, isn't recognized as a "mass usb storage device" in Windows. This means you are forced to used Windows Media Player 10 in order to sync files with the player. When you do try to sync albums to the H10, they do not automatically play in order.  The time and date on the player was always a day or two off. This is a silly bug that should've been caught before they released this product.  The sad part is the iRiver has released firmware fixes for their International and Asian version of H10, but they completely ignored the USA version. How can iRiver release a product like this and expect it to compete with such products as the Creative Zen Micro or Apple iPod?

<Title>Amazing potential, poor execution
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Disclaimer:  I got this as a gift.  Had I been able to choose my own player, I likely would not have chosen (and still would not choose) this item.  Let me start with the good stuff:  1) Excellent sound quality!  Nice comprehensive (and customizable) EQ, too :).  2) Very small, comfortable to hold in my hand, fits easily in the pockets of even my tight jeans.   3) Plays protected WMAs.  HUGE plus!  Wouldn't accept any player that didn't support this (:ahem: iPod).  For just $15 a month, I have hundreds of thousands of songs at my fingertips... it's a fabulously liberating opportunity that you can't comprehend until you actually experience it.  4) It's neat to be able to listen to NPR (radio), and the extensive preset slots are handy.  Now for the icky stuff:  1) I find that the side controls are impossible to operate by touch.  So when the H10 is in my pocket, I can't feel where forward and back are.  That's bad design, IMHO.  2) I had to format it before I could use it with Napster.  3) The aforementioned inability to natively play songs in album order.  This is a horrendous bug, particularly when playing albums whose songs blend into each other (musicals, thematic albums, etc.)  4) I don't like the earbuds; while they offer great sound, they keep falling out of my ears (though this could be simply a personal-preference/personal-problem kind of thing).  5) What use is the photo feature?!  It doesn't automatically show album art.  It does a dastardly bad job of compressing full-size jpegs (jaggy-city!).  And the screen is smaller than the display on my actual camera.  When would anyone actually use this darn feature?  6) Sync'ing playlists is problematic with WMP10.  When I delete a song from a playlist, for instance, WMP10 says "Deleting [songname] from iRiver H10" but it doesn't actually delete it.  So, synchronizing should be renamed "copying"... which stinks.  I need the ability to actually keep my playlists in SYNC.  Only workaround I've discovered:  Delete the playlists off of the H10 and simply recopy over the newer version.  7) There's no two-way metadata sharing.  For instance, I can rate a song 3 stars on the iRiver, but that rating isn't carried back to WMP when I sync.  For that matter, is there even ONE-WAY metadata sharing?  I haven't noticed the H10 doing anything with the ratings I have made on WMP.  Blah :(  8) It sometimes takes too long to shut down (more than 5 seconds).  9) This is more of a Napster negative than H10 negative, but still... so many songs are purchaseable but not transferable.  That's really rude and unfortunate, IMHO.    Add to this the legendarily awful support of iRiver, and I must say, I'd not encourage anyone to actually pay money for this item.  Maybe with a firmware update things'll be better, but I've been burned so often in the past waiting for promised firmware updates, only to have the company simply release a new product version a year later and offer a wonderful "$20 coupon" and insist that we shell out $229 for a new player.  Great.

<Title>Mine doesn't work with Napster
<Date>Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was one of the first to get the free H10 with the one year subscription. Since then I have run into the 2 mayor problems. 1.- Tracks disappear from the directory in my computer without logical explanation, they simply go missing. It happens EVERYDAY with LOTS of tracks. 2.- When I try to synchronize the H10 with napster, it ALWAYS stops in the middle of the process without reason. I already have reinstalled napster, reinstalled media player, reformat the h10 and none of this solve the problem  When i finally get a few songs on the player, and I try to skip to the next or previous one it take about 5 seconds to start the next song. Believe me, is annoying.  I won't recommend neither the device not napster to go to anybody.

<Title>spectacular
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well first of all, I read many reviews on products that were in my price range before I decided to get the H10. I looked at the Apple iPod mini (of course), the creative Zen Micro and then the H10. Before I even herd of the H10, I bought the Zen Micro and was very impressec after the first couple of days of use. Although, after a week, it started to freeze and start up by it self even though I turned if of and locked it. After trying to upgrade the firmware via creative.com I sent it back. A couple weeks after taking a second look at the mini my uncle suggested me to take a look at the H10. Sure some reviews mention how it may not be working well or freezing and what not but reviews about the mini and the zen micro said that and still, many people seem to be buying them. So I told myself that I might as well try the H10. I've been using it for 2 weeks now and have had no trouble at all... but it only get's 4 stars because you never know what can happen right? So hopefully it will just keep on impressing me and I'll be able to use it for a while. Still haven't tested out the text characteristic but I hope it works just as well as the rest. So... all I can do is suggest you to try it out because it's always worth trying something new... and maybe you won't get a bad version which apparently are not to rare...

<Title>Could Be Great - But Deeply Flawed
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Beware!  This is a great-looking player - sleek, color screen, and so forth.  But, as of this writing, it has serious flaws in functionality and sound.  - Any significant bass distorts when using my Koss Portapro headphones (I've used them for many other players with no problems).  I'm not talking thunderous bass - just typical stuff, with equalizer set flat.  - Player only lists (and plays) songs alphabetically, rather than by track numnber, which has proved to be even more annoying than I thought it would.  - Player can take a long time to skip from one song to the next.  It is possible that these problems will be fixed by a firmware upgrade (that does not yet exist).  It is possible that they cannot be fixed by firmware, or that iRiver will simply choose not fix them.  I'd strongly recommend that propesctive buyers wait until all is repaired rather than taking a risk.

<Title>Nice looking but fails in several regards
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Battery life averages about 6-7 hours. The problem with the color screen is that you can't see what is playing unless you are actively using the menus. It isn't like a regular black and white lcd where you can still see even without the backlight on.  Does not work properly with Napster-to-Go. I downloaded all these tracks and lost of them due to license sync errors three times in a week.   I returned it after a week and a half and got a Creative Zen Micro, which has worked beautifully with no trouble and actually lasts 11-12 hours.

<Content>I was really excited to about the iRiver H10...until I tried to set it up and discovered that it only works with Windows XP and nothing else. It had all the features I wanted and it would have been great, but I am not changing my operating system just to use an mp3 player.

<Title>Looks so good, but beware: Napster-to-Go compatible player
<Date>Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by saying that this is probably the slickest-looking player on the market, in its price range, that runs with Napster-to-go.  Full color screen, intuitive interface, and easy integration with Windows XP.  Here are the things I really didn't like about this:  1.)  Plays songs in alphabetical order, not in the order they appeared on the album (regardless of whether you did Napster, or ripped your own MP3s from CD).  For someone like me, this was the biggest frustration.  2.)  Broke within 2 weeks, TECH SUPPORT IS VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT.  One day, the thing decided to lock on boot, and their online recovery tool didn't do a thing.  I usually don't buy that extended warranty everyone always pushes, but in this case it could really save your bacon (I was within 30 days of purchase, so I simply returned it).  Called their tech support 6 times, and the first 5 times I simply got busy tones.  6th time I got through--and waited 2 hours for support (lucky thing I had two cordless phones, as the battery nearly died on the call).  Talked to someone, and within 5 minutes they said I'd better return my defective unit.  I did this, and replaced it with a Creative Zen Micro.  Much happier now.  3.)  Seemed to "lose" songs.  Some songs I could find on the file browser, but not in the library.  Very weird.  4.)  Recovery tools on the device were pretty much nil.  If it stops working, hope you're within 30 days, or that you did spring that extra cash for the extended warranty package.  You pretty much have no other options to you.  One day, I hope I have the opportunity to clean up their customer support operation.  My experience with them was the main reason I decided to return the player for a different one, rather than hope I just had a defective one.  &lt;u>A customer support group this bad is indicative that the IRiver folks don't stand behind their product&lt;/u>.  So, be warned and beware.

<Title>Two bad units
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Unfortunately, I can't comment on the quality of music playback as I never got that far. The first player would only display a white screen. iRiver technical support informed me that I had a "bum unit". Thankfully, Amazon has a very efficient return policy, but the second unit didn't do any better. It froze on the boot up screen, after waiting only ten minutes for technical support we went through various fixes before I was again informed that I had a bad unit.   I'm now returning the units for a refund. I don't have any confidence in the quality of the H10 and it doesn't help that included in the paperwork is an orange flier with "STOP" typed on it, instructing you to contact iRiver support before returning the product. It only leads me to believe that they have had numerous problems.   iRiver does earn one star with very adequate technical support, but it's unfortunate that the quality of product requires that support.

<Title>I just returned my iRiver--what a great feeling!
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Do you remember how great it felt to break up with that lover where nothing in the relationship worked?  It was like a load was lifted from your shoulders and you could smile again.  That's how I feel about my ex-MP3 player, the iRiver H10.  I was very excited when I first took it home.  But after charging it I found that I couldn't navigate the screens for ten seconds without it crashing.  Oh, not to worry, there was a firmware update available.  Still, it bothered me that iRiver would sell something that useless.  What about the people who bought it before the update was available? Anyway, I updated to the latest firmware release, but it was still WAY TOO BUGGY to be usable.    I would select a song, and it would decide to play another one instead.  On other occassions it wouldn't play at all until I rebooted.  Sometimes the scroll bar worked, but more often than not I would have to work it for a few seconds (or longer) to get it to respond.    I finally got tired of constantly fighting it and returned it.  Ahhh...freedom.

<Title>Buy if you want problems
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like iRiver products generally and I have the 1 gig player and it works great... but the H10 Iriver player is a piece of garbage.     Number one:   The darn thing cannot be completely turned off.   That's right!   You turn it off and the screen goes blank but it stays in standby mode.   This is because the unit is so slow to open its library in the first place.   Meanwhile, your battery goes dead because your unit has been on for three days and you didn't know it.   Yes, it stays on after you turn it off and lock it in the off position.   I contacted Iriver about this.   Their advice.   "Sir, just pull the battery out."   Yep, that's what they told me.     2.  If you have Toshiba computer equipment or a laptop, forget Iriver working with your computer.   It won't.  It won't ever work.   Iriver doesn't know why their unit doesn't work with one of the most popular laptops in the world and they don't give a damn.    3.   Horrible tech support.     What happened is they made this player and they knew it had flaws and dumped it on the market hoping people wouldn't care too much.   It's a travesty.   Perhaps some of their other units work good but avoid this model at all costs.

<Title>Great Product - Few Flaws
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the iRiver H10 5GB for Christmas, I knew I was getting it because I picked it out myself. I couldn't wait to open it and get songs on it because it had really cool features.   So far I am really enjoying it. Right now I have over a thousand songs on it which is something I wanted in my MP3 player. It does everything (that I know of) an iPod can do and more because it lets you listen to the radio which the iPod doesn't let you do unless you buy something for it. It is really easy to sort through it because you can search by artists, albums, genres, titles, and playlists. I uses pretty much only the artists and titles way of searching because that is the way I know my music. It also has a lot of EQ settings so you can change the sound to make it how you want it to sound. It is also really easy to navigate.   The only negative I have is that some of the songs that I deleted from the player still show up on the screen when I search through the songs. So if I click on one of the songs, that show up as still on the player, then it goes to a different song. I downloaded the firmware update that it told me to download before I put songs on it so I don't know why it does that. I don't know it it is something I did or not.   It is also really easy to transfer songs onto the player. You can also put pictures on it, which I did, but I never really looked at them so I took them off. The quality wasn't the greatest but I didn't expect it to be exceptionally well since it is just an MP3 player.   To get an iPod with all of this you would spend well over $300 but I got mine on sale for $200 inluding tax. I just recently bought some Sony MDR-XD400 headphones off of Amazon for about $75 with shipping, which are over $100 at Best Buy. I am hoping that they sound better than the earphones that come with the player. The earphones aren't terrible but they definitely could be better. I will probably be getting some better earphones also because I don't want to be wearing huge headphones in public and school.   So overall I would rate this MP3 player really well with just a few flaws. It is cheaper than an iPod of this size and everyone has an iPod so that is why I got this and you should get it also. I would recommend this product to everyone.

<Title>iRiver H10 vs. iPod nano
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While the iPod nano looks a little better than this, WHO CARES, the nano scratches easily, fingerprints are easily visible, and it doesnt have an FM tuner or voice recording capabilities.   H10:  Holds 1200 songs on the 5g model Holds too many pictures to count Has FM radio Voice record and radio record, ooooh Click wheel, sort of, except its not a wheel GREAT DESIGN  Shuffles songs Holds text, I think Comes with Sennheiser earphones, not much on the market better than that Comes with a rubber case 18 hours of battery life  iPod nano:  1g = 240 songs 2g = 500 songs 4g = 1000 songs Also holds many pictures Design could be better, easily scratches and shows fingerprints No FM radio or voice features Ability to shuffle songs Click wheel BAD headphones. bleh.  The only thing I really like about the nano that the H10 doesnt have is games, they're pretty fun. Weird marketing fact: The 4g iPod nano (1000 songs) is 250 dollars, hmm, the H10 holds 1200 songs and is 20 dollars less, (keep in mind it also comes with 40 dollar sennheiser earphones) now wouldn't you want to pay less and get more, I would.        -chris

When they came out with the ability to transfer these songs to a mobile device, I was all over it.  I upgraded the membership, went and purchased the product they advertised (iRiver H10 - 5GB) and thought I would be in high cotton.....  Not???  The device locks up always.  Controls are hard to find and use.  Rapsody software does not work with the device most of the time (lock ups, bad syncs, extremely slow).  User interface is extremely difficult to use (slow, not intuitive in places).

<Title>VERY POOR customer service
<Date>Tue Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, it takes a lot for me to write a bad review as I like to give the company time to stand behind it's product.  I recieved this player as a gift for Christmas.  One month later, the player would not turn on.  Amazon will no let you return this item so I had to go directly to iRiver.  So I returned the player in the beginning of February (at my own expense) to get a replacement.  iRiver sent the raplacement 1 1/2 weeks later by UPS.  UPS then "lost" the package so it was my job to contact iRiver and have them tell UPS they lost it (policy).  It has now been 5 weeks since I informed iriver that UPS lost my package.  I have called and e-mailed them several times.  Each time I call, they inform me that I must wait, that is my only option.  I may not speak to a manager, you must have an iriver employee "escalate" your case and then a manager can call you.  I have escalated the case 3 times and no manager has called me back yet.  At this point, I have learned that iriver is not a company that stands beind their products.  To make a customer wait 5 weeks (when they were initially told 8 business days), not let a customer talk to a manager directly, and not answer emails is unacceptable in my eyes.  Iriver has had my mp3 player longer than I have had it in my hands.  Very frustrating.  If you do decide to buy one (they are nice players when they don't break) just hope yours doesn't break.

<Title>Buyer's remorse:  Doesn't work properly 70% of the time.
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my iRiver for six months for use with the Yahoo Music Unlimited service.  I've had ample time to evaluate the ease of use of this device with the service and regretfully have to report that I'm so very, very disappointed with it. The player freezes constantly and must be reset by removing the battery (even with recommended firmware upgrades).  Six months later, I can't scroll through my playlist without it freezing up before getting through half of the song titles (I currently have less than 1GB on it). Also, the battery life is abysmal and if 2/3 of the battery is discharged, the device will freeze up, forcing you to disconnect the battery to restart the thing. I did extensive research before my purchase and am very saddened that I have this little red hunk of junk.  To think that I spent even more money on it to buy some decent ear buds since the ones that it came with are cheap and uncomfortable.  30% of the player for 100% of the price.

<Title>Iriver H10 vs the world
<Date>Sat Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>the iriver h10 is decent.  before i bought the h10 i went on cnet to look at the reviews.  i also went to bestbuy to check it out first hand and see how it would feel in my hand.  i didnt like the creative zen micro because everything was a touch pad.  it was annoying because you have to get use to it.  although the ipod mini was great there touch pad is so easy to use and itunes is really easy to use.   i also looked at the samsung color 5gb mp3.  i didnt get it because it had an 8 hour battery life that wasnt removable.  despite i felt that the samsung felt the best in my hand and was the easiest to use, also the controls were sort of perfect where there located.  Plus:  removable battery, fm tuner(no am), voice recoreder, not fully touch pad, a physical hold switch, fairly easy to use(the mp3 player not the software).  and it comes with a pocket sleeve. Alot easier to delete songs off the iriver than an ipod.  you can put pictures on it.  Negatives: manually is hard to understand, you have to go online to figure out how to create the playlist because it is not in the manually. Once you input the playlist it is not alphabetize, only the artist and genre which is stupid.  fm tuner present is kind of hard to do because once again the manual sucks.    i felt the iriver is decent and it sure beats the creative zen an day of the week.  until apple comes out with there own version of a mini with a color screen then iriver is doomed.  i love this because it comes with a removal battery which is my main concern.

<Title>Don't pay attention to the negative reviews for iRiver H10.
<Date>Wed Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After my 13 year old daughter's iRiver H340 was stolen at school (!), I purchased the H10 as a replacement for her.  My daughter loves the sound quality and features of the iRiver MP3 players generally, and being a serious voice student, she finds it handy to use her MP3 player to instantly record voice lessons, vocal warm-ups, accompaniment music, etc.  In response to all the negative feedback about iRiver MP3 players generally, and the H10 in particular, I must say that my 13 year old daughter had absolutely NO DIFFICULTY learning how to use either iRiver product (i.e., the H340 which she owned initially and the H10 which we purchased as a 'replacement' after her H340 was stolen), including the ability to easily down-load and organize CDs and other music.  The H10 is much lighter, sleeker and more portable than the H340, and while it doesn't have nearly the same amount of memory as either the H320 or the H340, the H10 is more than sufficient and offers great sound.  If my 13 year old (who is not especially computer-literate), was able to use both of her iRiver MP3 players virtually out of the box, then I'm sure most other people can.  We carefully checked-out other available options including iPod, Creative Zen and other manufacturers, and found that nothing offers the quality and features of an iRiver.  Having now purchased 3 iRiver products (i.e., my daughter's H340 and H10, and an H320 for my 15 year old son), I can highly recommend iRiver's MP3 products without hesitation.

<Title>Much better with new firmware
<Date>Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>They have new firmware out for this thing, and it fixes most issues.  You can play in track order and it seems to sync with Napster To Go OK so far.  I think Napster To Go stinks right now, so if you truly are a music fan you won't be happy.  Most emerging artists are "buy only".  If you're going to download Fleetwood Mac and Eric Clapton, then go for it.  All the standard stuff is available for download.  The audio quality on this thing is awesome.  The scroll pad thing isn't anywhere near as good as the ipod.  All the older reviews are from before the new firmware.  This thing is safe to buy now.

<Title>Superb Player
<Date>Sat Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After a long debate between the iPod, Zen Micro, (which are also fine products) and this iRiver H10, I finally decided on the H10. This mp3 player is simply incredible and far surpasses the iPod and Zen Micro.  *It easily and flawlessly syncs with WMP10, but I prefer to acess it as an external drive, also flawless. *The sound quality is excellent, even with the included headphones (Sennheiser MX400). *The processor is somewhat slow, and while this isn't noticable while one browses through songs, it takes several seconds for the "Browse" fuction to load. *There are many features, such as FM radio, FM record, alarm, clock, txt viewing, and jpg viewing. *The EQ settings are effective up to a point where the sound gets too distorted. *Button positioning and fuctionality is excellent, although using the ff/rw buttons to change FM stations is rather awkward. *The color screen is very impressive, although when the backlight turns off, the screen barely visible, and doesn't refresh until you press a button. *The battery life is excellent. While I have not explicitly tested it, I just plug it in for the night, and it's good for about 1-2 days of use. *The cover for the USB connecter is small and easy to lose, but it stays in effectively and 3 replacements come with the player. *I feel the player is slightly overpriced, so wait until it's on sale.  This player is incredible, and I in no way regret purchasing it. I highly recommend the iRiver H10.

<Title>Not a bad player, once you can get it to work.
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by thanking the folks at Misticriver.com.  Without them, I would have been the owner of a very expensive paperweight.  That being said, a buyer should not have to depend on such websites to get their player working, but in the case of the H10, that is exactly what is required.  Two reasons for this.  First, the stability of the player is very sub-standard.  Even after applying the upgrade, it still locks up on me, and the track sorting still isn't quite right.  There are other problems, but these two seem to be the most pervasive.  The second reason is that iRiver's technical support is useless.  Don't bother e-mailing the company--you'll never get a response.  Check out iRiver's rating with the Better Business Bureau--not good.  If you need help, just call right away, but be prepared to wait a good, long time.  An hour or two is not uncommon.  Once you get them, their typical response seems to be "You got a bad one--send it back and we'll send out another."  All of this is too bad, because the H10 is one of the slickest players on the market today.  I got mine for free from Napster, and I'm keeping it.  But, if I had to do it all again, I'd definitely choose something else.

<Title>Super Buggy
<Date>Fri Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my H-10 for less than a week and will have to return it tomorrow. I had a great experience with my Slim X I-350 cd player, so I trusted iRiver to deliver a great product, but alas, they did not.   The earphones were uncomfortable, the combination charging cable/USB cable is awkward, the connection between the charging cable and the power source is separated at the slightest nudge, and the software is intrusive and would not properly sync between unit and computer-no matter how many times I tried transferring a file of MP3's, some would just not read, despite others transferring successfully.   Perhaps the buggy software is enough of a reason to return it, but the other stuff is merely incidental. Actually, the reason I'm returning it is because the unit itself is remarkably unstable. It CONSTANTLY freezes and become totally unresponsive to input, especially when using the pause/rewind/fast forward buttons. Like I said, I have had the unit for 4 full days, and I estimate about 4-5 freezes a day, with an average of 2 hours listening a day. The only remedy is to remove and replace the battery for a hard reset, which is a  pain in the rear once the unit is in its silicone sheath (the battery is inaccessable with the sheath on). Perhaps as a more ominous sign of things to come, today I had an instance of the unit not even turning on- again, remedied with a battery reset.   Honestly, I'm glad the unit is technically defective, because of all the other low points. To be fair, the sound quality is excellent, and the Sennheiser earphones nice and punchy.   I'm willing to give iRiver another shot, because I was so satisfied with the i-350 I mentioned before. I might try one of the 20 or 40 gig models, but I'm off the H-10 for good. Dear Lord in Heaven, don't let it come to me having to buy an iPod.   EDIT: I returned it and got a replacement- Lotte Department Store in Korea does not give refunds (caveat emptor). The replacement is much more cooperative, although it has still frozen several times- 5 or so times in the past month. Also, one time during playback, the battery died- and upon recharging and restarting, it gave me a system error messagem which required downloading new software to get it back up and running. It is still a naughty child, this H10, but not so much that I want to sell him to the circus anymore.

<Title>Extremely Unstable OS, will not last!
<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having owned the H320 and then having it die on me within 3 months (read my review for that item)  I decided to stick with the family and get the newest in the I River bunch.  What a TREMENDOUS disappointment.  First off, the file structure is different.  Now instead of being able to simply drag and drop any file on you I river icon on your desktop as if it were a hard drive, you have to now "synchronize" your unit through either Napster or Windows Media Player software.  This not only limits how you can organize your player but also takes almost 5 times as long.  As if this wasn t enough, the OS is extremely unstable, I found it freezing constantly for no apparent reason.  I would be listening to a song not touching or meddling with the unit, and then all of a sudden it would just stop and i would no longer be able to control it, I couldn t even turn it off, I would instead have to physically remove the battery.  A few days before I finally gave up and returned the peice of junk, it randomly erased everything I had stored on it, again for no apparent reason, as I was always very careful when disconnecting it from my computer.  After it had erased everything I began attempting to put the same songs back on, but it only allowed me to put up to 250 megabytes on, claiming that my hard drive was full.  At this point needless to say I had far past given up on this model redeeming itself and having owned it less than a month to Bestbuy.  My final beef with this unit is the fact that it s only 5gigs for the same price of the H320 which offered 20Gigs, it seems iriver has completely lost any advantage it once had over the competition, being a 2 time I river owner with both units miserably failing, I advise everyone to stay completely clear of ANY iriver products as with my experience they will not last.  I am now the not so proud owner of a Creative Labs Zen Media player.

<Title>A good all around media device
<Date>Thu Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm the type of guy that wants an "all-rounder" player.  With 5 gb of storage space, I feel thats more than adequate space for what I "NEED" it for.  My main concern was how would it perform holding it while running.  Well, to my delight, it worked flawlessly.  My only complaint about the player really is, WHERE iS THE STOP BUTTON?  It has a Play/Pause button but no Stop button.  If you are done listening to music...you have to turn the player off completely or change functions (ie FM radio or browse pictures).  While listening to music, the verticle touch pad acts as the volume control and its very percise. My thumb is comfortable on the touch pad while running if I want to change the volume without looking.  I have other ear phones that hook around my ears so I don't use the earphones that came with it.    As far as software gliches, my only problem so far is:  My laptop computer doesn't have a USB 2.0 port (slower transfer rate) and the SYNC to the computer is strange.  I just got it so I guess I need practice.  If your computer isn't hooked up to the internet, some songs can't be switched over (it searches the internet for copyrights).  I had to transfer my entire Song Collect over to the H10 because I couldn't figure out how to transfer (sync) individual albums...FYI..I was using Microsoft Media Player 10..the software that comes with the player.  I read about a firmware update from some of the comments, I'll try that before I just opt to send this player back.  Overall?..I like it, I stuggled a bit with buying something this expensive..but I feel it's "all-rounder"..ness..is sufficient and outweighs having multiple media devices.

I had no problems with down loads and the sound and ease of operation was very good although the display is washed out in bright sunlight. I took the H10 on a cruise which is when I noticed the tracks on the albums were in alphabetical order instead of by track number. The new firmware has corrected this problem. Just go to the Iriver web site. All and all a very good product, with a good display for photos and good FM radio

<Title>best u can get
<Date>Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>ok, so i got this thing a week ago. played with it, admired its features, everything. i dont see anything wrong. i immediately upgraded its firmware to the latest edition before i even started to toy around with it. and so far no problems. its really thin and i truly think this is a good rival for the ipod mini. the ipod mini  only plays music and has no color screen. this iriver plays radio, record radio, has color screen, views pictures, and a whole bunch of other things. and so, i think you should get this one if you are in loko of a 4-6 gig mp3 player.

<Title>Everyman's iRiver H10 review
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is written from the perspective of a first time MP3 player owner... I've owned several MiniDisc units in the past, some of which made me happier than others.  I am somewhat computer savvy and I've never played with an iPod.  Basically, I'm pretty darn satisfied... vs. other competitors in its class (not the iPod itself) it wins in several categories.  1. Oh-so-sleek look. It doesn't have the same minimalist/modernist design of the iPod, but that's something I never wanted in the first place.  Its appearance seems to suggest it's a distant relative of the PlayStation 2.  The battery recharges quite quickly, about 2 hours on average.  2. SIMPLE and easy to figure out interface. Menu system is very logical and it's easy to choose songs to listen to based on artist, album, genre, or playlist.  Touch bar has just the right amount of sensitivity and appears to be pretty rugged.  Great fit in the hand.  3. Windows XP compatible. Plays most, if not all, common forms of MP3 and WMA files. I haven't tested how well it handles media with Digital Rights Managment, but that's just not in the cards for me.  4. Great sound. Has around 20 preset EQs for all genres of music, including a Custom EQ. Haven't used the headphones but I hear pretty good... I use my own pair of earphones and the sound is many times better than even the MiniDisc units I've had (by Sony!).  Alas, there are a few downsides...  1. The silicone case hides the beauty of the player, attracts dirt, and the clip is somewhat awkward. It's good for protection, if you're on the go.  2. Though it has photo capabilities, the size and resolution of the screen don't yield very good results. Text interface also has its quirks, but it does its job. Same could be said about the FM radio... it picks up only the strongest stations in your area, but when it does, sound is good.  3. The player (out of the box) and its computer interface has a few minor problems. Best recommendation is to get the latest firmware upgrade ASAP. It still doesn't solve a few things... sometimes I've gotta Refresh the music database to maintain the order of music listed the same as inputted. Also recommended is to use Yahoo! Music Engine, although no program is really required (ie. drag-and-drop files onto the player in Windows Explorer).  It does require a little tinkering to get it set up the way you want it, and therefore requires a bit of computer savvy as well as patience.  But once you get used to it, it's a truly high quality and convenient item to have. Also, I found a sale here for about $50 off (I paid $199). Definitely affordable and great quality for the price paid.

<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought this with some reservations based on the negative reviews that I read.  It has worked perfectly for me.  Synced to WMP 10 with no problem.  Have purchased songs online (from Walmart!) and had no problem listening to them on either the H10 or my other iRiver player.  I would recommend this player to others and have had good luck with three different iRiver MP3 players that I own.

<Title>This little unit is brilliant in my opinion !!
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I researched this purchase extensively and finally chose this unit after trying to wade through all that crazy, confusing info out there on digital music players. I wanted something I didn't need to mess around with much but just load, go and enjoy all my favorite music on that's stashed away on all those buried cd's. I LOVE THIS THING !!  I didn't need 1,200 songs so I chose to input my music in at the highest quality option. I'm astounded at the sound quality of the playback. I don't want to hear the music in my ears I want to feel it between my eyes and this lovely little unit does that well without having to max out the volume. I have over 680 songs, photos of my baby grandson and the text file of the itinerary of my upcoming trip in it and there's almost a full gb of room left!!  If you have (you must have) Windows XP and the latest version of Windows Media Player... loading your files into this unit is sooo easy. Make sure before loading your files to download the updates at iRiver as the formatting will wipe out what you've put in. Updates are easy and the PDF manual is helpful and easy to read. The battery lasts a good long time and is removable and rechargeable. A spare is a bit pricey but affordable if you need more than 12 hours of playback at one time. The controls are pretty much self explanatory and I find very easy to use. I have a number of custom playlists and it handles them all with ease and like a champ. I've had none of the problems reported by other reviewers. That could just be from clean livin' (yurite) but so far so good!!  I found this at a great sale price too but even at full retail I think this unit is well worth every dime!! I'd recommend it for sure!!

<Title>great product, way better than ipod
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i love it. the design is great, way better than the ipod i think. it has so much more to offer with the FM tuner, Color screen, voice recording, photos, and u cant forget the removable battery. that i like most of all. and its way cheaper than the ipod mini and its about the same size. maybe a mm off. lol. this product is great, my new favorite mp3 player. the only possible downside is the screen. it could be a lil bigger, becuase you cant reli see your pictures THAT clearly. but for what it has to offer at this price, its great. never had any problems yet.  yes u do have to update the firmware from time to time, but its easy. the design of the buttons are just simple, might not be that great for ipod users, but im used to the layout of the buttons. with the ipod click wheel, u touch it and ur volume goes up, so it is harder to manuever in ur pocket. i recommend this over an ipod any day.

The sound is better than i expected, the color display is very good, very simple to navigate and simple to add music to it with WMP. Very nice device, can't find anything wrong with it yet. i'm in love with this thing...and the pic viewer and text reader are very usefull and work well. i cant believe how great this thing is...and compared to an iPod, it's great value and even better than the iPod, so you really cant go wrong with this thing.

<Title>Superb player that beats IPod
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I did alot of research before I bought an MP3 player and decided to buy the H10. I don't regret it. I decided against getting the IPod Nano for 2 reasons: 1) It does not support WMA files. Huge negative in my opinion. All of my music is in WMA format, so I would have had to re-rip all of my music. 2)Flimsy construction. Most of the people I have talked to who have bought the Nano have had their screen scratch up or other problems.  I would highly recommend this player as it is easy to sync songs to the player and has excellent sound. No the stock headphones aren't very good, but then again none of the players come with good headphones. I bought Sony noise cancelling headphones and the sound is excellent. Make sure you install the firmware updates before you sync songs into your unit. This will fix the problems other reviewers are talking about like not saving songs in album order, slow turn off time, clock not advancing and hesitation between songs. As soon as I loaded the update, my player worked perfectly.   Bottom line: This player rocks!  IPod is hype over substance. Get the IRiver instead.

<Title>not the best choie for ebooks
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iRiver series has some great advantages for music. It offers gapless playback, avoiding two-second pauses when listening to a complete album (which can ruin continguous transitions on albums such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon). And many reviews suggest it offers higher fidelity for complex sound.  One downside: This is one of the only players not supported (at least explicitly) by audible.com, favored as having the largest library of downloadable audiobooks/ebooks. There are some ways around that, such as third-party software that requires being a bit more tech savvy than you might be. But if audiobooks are your thing, an alternative (such as the Creative Zen line, or the industry-leading iPod) may be preferable.

<Title>Worst mp3 PLAYER EVER!!! DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was the first mp3 player i bought, actually i bought two, one for me and one for my wife on the same day. Mine lasted about 2 days...it would freeze my computer up, and when i would unplug it and then my computer would be fine. My wife's lasted a few months longer. Then one day all the mp3s on it just dissapeared!! I plugged it in and after about 5 min of the computer being frozen i opened the folder and found that all the songs were still on player, but what good does that do me if i can't play them from the mp3 player itself!! I returned mine for and XBOX!! which i am very pleased with...my wife returned hers(she had bought some 2yr service plan  with it) and got a creative zen microphoto...which she is pleased with...so far.

<Title>This Jewel is A Pleasure to Own
<Date>Sun May 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I chose it for the following reasons: it is PC compatible; has an FM tuner; and iRiver gets excellent ratings for sound quality. But the deciding factor was that I loved the way it looked in "Trance Red" (not "Trace Red") - like a lacquered cigarette or small jewelry case.  In three weeks of use, I have not been disappointed.  Media Player 10 handles the synchronization flawlessly.  The real payoff is that I finally have the motivation to collect, categorize and listen to ALL my music, not just the six CDs I have in the car.  For me that means going all the way back to the 60s.  The fact that this little jewel holds it all (for now), operates seamlessly and can plug into a home stereo, a car audio system or be taken to the gym or on a trip completely changes the way I listen to music.  The FM tuner gets the best reception I've experienced in portable unit. Be prepared to spend another $50 to $100 for better earphones (an unending search)and connectivity accessories. A few negatives. First, the repeat-pause-skip buttons on the side provide no tactile feedback to differentiate one from another and they do not react the first time around. So you if the H10 is in your pocket or otherwise out of sight you end up fumbling around a lot before you get the desired response.  Second, iRiver has released a 6GB H10 in the same case and and 20 GB version, which is a bit bulkier, both for under $300. So the only reason to buy the 5GB H10 is to save $30. Finally, 3.7 GB of music on my PC will not fit on this 5 GB player, which only has 4.6 gigs available for music.  Somehow the music expands during the synchronization process.  I have queried both iRiver and Microsoft by email about this and received no response. PS Be sure to download and install the firmware upgrade before you start.

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I must admit - the reviews I'd read on the bugs for this mp3 player had me worried... but in the end, being as shallow as I am, it is much more aesthetically pleasing than the ipod or zen micro.  Its cute look (and color screen) had me sold!  Although there were problems with the album order playback (which I think was everyone's main complaint), the new firmware update is now on the iRiver site which I have downloaded and now it works perfectly (not that track order bothered me much in the first place).  The radio feature is great and i find it very easy to use.  It's quick and easy to put music on it with Media Player, the sound is great, and all in all I'm very pleased with this very handy little thing!

<Title>Horrible -- do not buy; maybe wait for future version
<Date>Sat May 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This device basically doesn't work and is poorly thought out.  If you don't believe me ask yourself why the first insert you see when you open the box is a bright orange piece of paper saying "STOP! Do not return this product!  Call us first..."  I don't see IBM needing to put those sorts of inserts into their ThinkPads...because they work.    My background is that I have had an iPod for 18-24 months and bought this so that I could use a subscription music service (Rhapsody to Go).  This experience has made me appreciate the many features I took for granted in iPod.  Generally, the H10 operates like a computer that is being asked to run an application for which it has insufficient memory (if you have ever tried to play the latest computer games on a non-latest PC you'll know what I'm talking about).  So essentially this means it acts like it has been hit in the head, being jerky at best and nonresponsive often. For instance, it takes forever to load up a new song on the H10.  Whereas on iPod you go from song to song seamlessly, on the H10 between songs you get a whirring and it stops...I guess it's loading it up...and finally, if you're lucky, it will play the song.  There is never less than a 30 second break between songs.  That's feeble.  That stuff needs to be invisible to the user.  It would be faster to go from single to single on a real physical jukebox playng vinyl 45's.  Also, it doesn't always play the song you expect.  Also, the little slider control is frequently nonresponsive.  Also, the fast forward, rewind, play controls are hard to distinguish from each other (you have to focus on them, which is hard to do while jogging). When scrolling, you frequently overshoot your target (too sensitive).  That's aside form the fact that often it just crashes and won't do anything at all.  I guess I should call this number on the "STOP!" insert before I return it but I get the feeling it's going to have to go back.  This just does not come up to the level of an acceptable mp3 player.  This is a protoype.  (By the way I did the firmware upgrade first thing so that won't help.)  Now that I realize how great the iPod is relative to the H10, it really makes me appreciate the thinking that went into it.  To be honest, would anyone take a job at iRiver if they could get a job at Apple?  I don't want to be harsh but probably not.  And I think that collective personnel advantage at Apple probably translates into a better product for them in a million ways.  One dumb decision was to include several features like photo display and text display that I suspect 98% of users don't care about at all.  Basically, people want an mp3 player to play music.  Looking at your photo collection on a one in ch screen probably is not a key feature.  Instead of devoting time to creating a phto and text service, they should have made sure they had the basic music player working. Duh.    [Update: bought a Samsung Yepp and it works well.  Very happy now.]

<Title>Wow.. just Wow
<Date>Sat May 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is truely an amazing product, i abosolutly love it. I use it every day since i got it and i have all of my friends with ipods in envy. Just about all of my friends who owns an ipod now wants an iriver. The iriver looks awsome to, i love it in trance red. The sound quality is amazing on this, i espicialy like the equalizer on it with 40 presets. The voice recorder is fun to playaround with, espicialy when you can record things on it then pretend to listen to music while your taking a test in school when actualy your listeing to answers instead, just set it to repeat haha, or you can upload a cheat sheet as a txt file on it and "scroll for music" :) works amazing, havnt failed a test since. The photo viewr is fun to playaround with as well. I like how the charger and the usb connector are on the same wire, so you can charge it from an outlet or from your USB port on your PC, unlike the Ipod where you have to buy an extra wire to charge it from an outlet. As for people who said they cant tell the buttons on the side, its not that hard to figure out and memorize. Middle is pause, top is fast foward, bottom is rewind. And as for people who said the songs take 30 seconds to change no it doesnt, it takes 2 or 3, if that, same with the ipod, all mp3 players are going to take a second or two to change songs, the more songs you have on it the longer it will change, it has to scan all 5 gb of data for the one song your looking for, And for people whosaid the touch strip isnt sensitive enough, if you use it for 2 or 3 days it will break in and become more sensitive. Anf for people who said you often skip over your desired song, just tap the botton or the top of the strip and it will scroll one at a time, hold it down and it will scroll by itself so you dont have to keep moving your finger up and down.  One of the biggest pluses is the removeable battery. Now you can spend 40$ on a new battery every year instead of sending it in for 3 weeks, getting a used refurbished and most likely non working one that someone else has used and who knows what they did with it or where its been with the most horrible customer service in the world (Apple, iPod) I also like the color screen , it makes it look nicer and gives it a cooler graphical look instead of the boring ipod plain text. The FM Tuner is also a plus, sometimes im just in the mood to listen to the radio instead of my music. FIRST THING TO DO WHEN YOU BUY THIS : HTTP://WWW.IRIVERAMERICA.COM/H10UPDATE GO THERE AND DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE, otherwise youll have to re sync your iriver after you update it, this firmware fixes most of the problems that people were listing such as the play in alphabetical order stuff. Ipod mini lists at 200$ , this lists at 240$, (230$ when i bought it) so for 40$ more you get twice as many features, plus youll have something not many other people have :) which is always a plus, thats one of the main reasons i didnt want an ipod, everyone has one. I hate having something everyone else has. so BUY THIS !!! its amazing and i love it :)

<Title>Had issues, maybe a lemon?
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I did lots of research prior to putting down the $240 dollars for this product and thought I was making a good choice.  And I still think I did.  Unfortunately, though, I don't think iriver has quite got all the bugs worked out of this stylish little player.  The features are great, the sound quality is wonderful, and the compact size fit perfectly into my pocket.  But like that of a few others that I have talked to/read about, my player froze constantly, got terrible battery life (about 1 hour), had trouble powering off, and wouldn't properly accept music from Windows Media Player (although this may have been a problem on the computer's side, I don't really know).  After two days I returned it to Amazon.com.  Personally I don't think that the h10 is a bad player and will probably buy one again in a few months when iriver has a little more time to work out the bugs that are inevitable in new technology.  Although expensive, this pretty little player is worth it, as long as you get a well working one (like most everyone else does.)

<Title>Almost good, but not enough...
<Date>Thu May 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yeah I think Iriver will be ready with the next release, in the meantime I returned mine...  Good things: - installation and setup with WMP was a snap, really easy, upgraded  firmware easily, everything worked as it should - good design, pretty machine, impressive screen, convenient skin - radio works really good, easy setup of preset stations, much better sound than Zen Micro - like the controls that you can use from you pocket without looking at the player  Bad things: - How could they come up with such poor design for the cables? You have to connect USB with power, not separately, A/C adapter is HUGE. Forget about it if you're on the road... - Menu navigation design is poor, very poor. Can't switch quickly between MP3s and radio, have to navigate through 5 screens, so much for skipping commercials... - no bookmark feature like Creative labs, and worse, fast forward and rewind feature skip only 3 seconds at a time max, terrible!! That means that you can't possibly listen to Podcasts because if you lose your position listening to a 30 minutes MP3 file, you can't go back, big flaw... Would be so simple to provide... - I do not understand why it doesn't come with a feature to autoatically resize pictures to the creen size... You don't want to transfer a 4 mega pixels picture to be able to watch only 120 pixels or so... - no option to sort songs  Bottom line: I'll wait until they iron out these details, which are too annoying right now, to justify spending that much money...

<Title>Not an iPod... but thats not a bad thing
<Date>Sat May 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yeah fine everybody's got their complaints, but I actually returned an iPod Mini and bought this instead.  I will admit that it is not quite as "friendly" as the iPod but it is very powerful.  Caveat Emptor: if you have done any research you probably figured it out by now we consumers are caught between Microsoft and Apple in the media player wars... Apple AAC vs. Microsoft WMA.  At the moment Apple has no pay as you go service like Napster or the Yahoo service, so that might infulence your decision like it did mine.   I paid about $207.00 on clearance in May 2005 (probably because the 6GB players coming out soon).  Right on par w/ the ipod mini 4GB and $43 less the the 6GB.  For that you get a color screen that can show photos (albeit tiny ones) and an Fm radio built in.  If you hold down the play button while listening to the radio this thing will start to record live radio in MP3 format (pretty nifty).  All in a package about 0.1 inch larger on all sides then the iPod Mini.  Okay my gripes 1) few accessories... I can't find an armband for this thing.  iriver.com does sell some pretty cool stuff like an extra battery, a cradle that will charge the player and a battery at the same time, and a wired remote to handle some simpler functions, but if you want all that it will cost you about $100. 2) The documentation doesn't explain how to delete songs from the player and I had trouble doing this through Media Player 10. I figured out the device shows up as a removable drive under "my computer" in the XP start window.  This is also the easiest way to put .txt and .jpg files on the H10. 3) playlists most be made through Media Player so there is no "on the fly" programming of your song order 4)The supid charger for this thing is in 2 parts so if you want to take it on vacation you have to disconnect the charger and USB cable from your computer, a pretty sloppy thing to overlook.  On the other hand iriver will be happy to sell you a travel charger as soon as they get them in stock (insert eye roll here). Despite all that if your looking for a hard drive mp3 player i would give it a try.  I'm pretty happy with it and you could probably do worse.

<Title>More Features For Less Money
<Date>Tue May 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>*NOTE* I don't own this player but I did test it extensively while shopping for an MP3 player.  I like the placement of everything first of all.  The movement ribbon, forward, and backward buttons are right on the front.  Play, pause, next, and previous are on the side.  The menu system is very simple and you should know right away where everything is.  Aside from displaying album art while playing, which it doesn't do, I can't understand why someone would use this thing as a portable photo album.  It's main function is an MP3 player, so you can consider that a bonus feature.  Don't complain about it.  The text viewing, again, is an added feature so I can't complain there.  The FM radio is a nice touch, but with 5 GB of MP3s I don't see myself using it.  The file browser doesn't seem very useful to me.  It's much easier accessing media through the proper menus.  For the most part the music menu and sub-menus peformed much like an iPod.  I like the touch ribbon a bit more than the circular one on the iPod.  Up and down comes much more naturally than clockwise and counter-clockwise.  The only gripes I had were the scrolling speed, which doesn't seem very fast if you're looking through a long list, and the track skipping.  If you press the next or previous buttons it takes about 3 seconds to switch tracks.  If you're looking for a particular song you're better off scrolling through a list rather than pressing next a bunch of times.  You can still press the next button 6 times in a row and be 6 tracks ahead, it just takes a bit for the current track to be updated.  I didn't try this out but I know for a fact that this player can be used as a portable hard drive.  You can copy files to and from the player via a file manager.  Personally, I prefer a more direct handling of files and not using an intermediate program.  Based on my testing of this model I plan to purchase the larger version when it becomes available.

<Content>I uploaded my songs that I ripped from cd's into this player.  I must hear the songs in the order they were intended and I must not hear pops, clicks, or lag in between songs, especially on albums that run through seamlessly (ie: The Wall, The Downward Spiral).    Once in the iRiver, they go into some insane order I cannot even describe, and there is about 3-5 seconds of lag in between songs.  Unacceptable to me.  I bought this so I could do the whole "rent the song" thing on Yahoo Music (ie: Napster, Raphsody) but after dealing with this and hearing bad things about my friends Creative Labs model, I decided I would go with the iPod 30gig photo.    I am 100% satisfied with it.  It is perfect, and the iTunes software is perfect as well.  Get an iPod unless you are really into the idea of renting your music.  We'll see if iPod crumbles under the competition (with the state of the players, i doubt it).

<Title>STILL DOESN'T WORK
<Date>Tue May 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sure this seems like a great product, but after a month of hour long costumer service phone waits (by the way their costumer service stinks) and downloading millions of different components my Iriver still doesn't work. Conceptually a great product, but I'm going to stick with my Ipod and Itunes since they actually function.

<Title>Bleeding Edge!
<Date>Tue May 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought it for the Janus/drm compat:  Learned quickly there are lot's of shortcomings with DRM / Janus / subscription technology. Technology is still in it's infancy. Too bad for those of us who want it NOW.  An ok mp3 player (audio quality should be better) handles non-drm music files aplomb.  If you are not an computer geek, you may find it extremely time consuming getting it to work with subscription drm.  Lots of formats, firmware updates, tricks are involved in getting the first tracks to play.  Even when it works- slow slow. changing tracks takes 3-5secs even with latest firmware 2.03.  SO- IF you are not the type that will enjoying tinkering with this device, you're probably better off purchasing tracks (Real Jukebox 10). Don't count on the susbscription services being easy to use!

<Title>Very intuitive interface but not perfect
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I actually have the 6GB version of this mp3 player but its identical to the 5GB.  I bought it for my girlfriend and I - we're using it with the RealRhapsody subscription service.  I now find myself wanting one for myself!  Before I continue with this review here's a piece of advice that took me the better part of a day to figure out.  To use the iriver with a subscription you have to: 1. Update the firmware from their website (simple) 2. Before using RealRhapsody or YahooMusic, go into Windows Media Player 10 and copy a song/playlist onto the player. I used some ripped mp3s - put them in a playlist and then hit "sync"    THIS IS A CRUCIAL STEP!  - Without it you will get "transfer error" from the subscription services.  You absolutely have to have Windows media player recognize the DRM/Subscription ID for your h10.  WMP10 will then ask if you want to "archive the subscription device license" - say yes.  This is the only way to get your computer to recognize the device.  3. Start to sync the player with your music service.  Make sure you carefully select how you group the items and if on sync - you only want to add songs or if deleting a song from a playlist should also delete the song from your h10.   Now the review   + The interface is very intuitive.  Anyone, and I even mean people  who struggle with a univeral remote, can immediately figure out how to use this player immediately.  The big bright color screen is easy to read under any light and the important words ("Music", "FM Radio", "Settings"...) are big and easy to spot.  Slide your finger and not only does the menu move but the color and backround text does too.  Even more complex functions such as recording from FM radio are pretty intuitive with a few minutes of playing around or, god forbid, reading the manual.  + The touch slider's sensitivity is adjustable!  This is huge for me since I prefer to have a very sensitive touchpad and my girlfriend prefers a less sensitive mode.  + There is a switch to lock the controls (Rio Carbon has this in menus - bleh!)  flip the switch, put it in your pocket and you're set.  For those who will be keeping the h10 in a bag, spend the extra $40 on a wired remote (found at iriveramerica.com)  + Voice recorder encodes into mp3 directly and can record from mic or fm radio! All the other players (zen micro, rio carbon) record into .wav which is a big waste of space.  +/- Single connector - I usually don't mind plugging in power and usb separately but it's very nice to have them combined.  All you have to do is connect one cable and voila! The player is charging and connected to your computer.  I'm not super psyched about having the proprietary plug but additional/replacement cables are readily available on the manufacturer website.  + Docking station - you can get a docking station for this guy at iriveramerica.com for $40 - connects to power/computer/stereo line out. It may seem unnecessary to some but its great to have a real dock and never fumble with cables.  + Battery - it has not yet run out on us during a day's worth of heavy use.  Additional batteries are just $40 and are compact enough to keep a spare with you.   ++ CASE! It comes with a good case! Not one of those junky fake-leather/plastic things but a transluscent rubberized case that actually feels good in your hand/pocket, gives access to all the buttons and protects the player from drops/scratches, etc.  Janus/PlaysForSure - the subscription stuff is awesome as is the ability to control whether a sync is a full syncronization or only update.     Negatives Not too much to write here folks.  I love my iriver 140 and miss having an inline remote with a screen.   Price seems a bit steep for me but then again, its a quality product.  Earbuds are decent quality but not great fit/feel. Then again I despise the iPod earbuds as well (which some people rave about) so don't think of this as a major negative.  I'd say any free/included headphones are only there to get you started and let you play around right away.  In conclusion, I'd still give the player 5 stars.  Its a bit more expensive than the competitors but at the same time you get what you pay for.  The screen is wonderful and the interface is incredibly easy to use.  The voice recorder is actually useful for meetings and can record my npr shows when I'm not able to listen.

<Content>I recently picked up the H10 and have been very impressed. When I got it, I installed the firmware update and then loaded music onto it easily. The sound quality is superb and the radio reception is excellent. I haven't tested how long the battery lasts. The only shortcoming is that the touch scroll takes time to get used to. I highly recemmend the H10.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>OK first off, i will tell you that all the pro's people suggest are true. the SRS Wow feature is amazing, and i like it very much. It really adds whatever you are looking for.  now to address the cons that people have put forth.  1. The Headphones. The Headphones are Sennheiser MX400's, which are about 10.99-19.99 depending on where you buy them. I believe they are nice, but i would buy a nicer pair. They are by far higher quality then any other out of the box headphone, but i just prefer something nicer.  2. You can't play files in track order. NOT TRUE! the current firmware fixes this, BUT, you MUST put the file tracks into WM10 and then load them onto your iRiver. You really think its going to magically fix them for you? (you may need to refresh the database after doing this).  3. Slow. I do admit, it is slow, but as with all MP3 Players, there is always a downside. My previous player, the Creative Zen 40GB Nomad Xtra, was a complete and total piece of crap. i used to, but now will never buy another mp3 player from them. Their cheapness comes at a price (a low one as a matter a fact)  4. Takes a while to turn off. It depends. sometimes is lightning quick, other times it takes about 10 seconds. Like its going to affect you anyway, when you press the button to turn it off, it will, and 10 seconds really doesn't kill the battery or damage it, does it?  5. Pictures suck. THEN DON'T USE IT FOR PICTURES. simple as that. The Radio, Radio Record, Voice Record, Line-In Record, Music should be enough for you, dont you think?  COMPARISION:  iRiver H10 20GB        299.99 iPod  20GB             299.99 Creative 40GB Zen      235.99  The iRiver is the SAME PRICE as the iPod, but it has these advantages:  Color Screen Sennheiser Headphones (14.99 Value) Pictures Text Music, No programs needed to transfer Napster to Go Plays WMA, MP3, Protected WMA FM Fm Recording Voice Recording Line-In Recording Smaller SRS-Wow and Custom Equalizer FM in Korea, Japan and European Regions.  FOR THE SAME EXACT PRICE?  and as for the creative...i'm sorry, but its just a piece of crap.  HOW MINE DIED: because of its huge bulkiness, i dropped it 2 ft. onto carpet. The hardrive broke, and after i smacked it (no joke) it turned on to work again. Then, about 3 weeks later, i was listening to it, and it just died. Completely, i tried everything, and i decided i didn't want to wait 2 hours to call them (it took that long).  iRiver support is ok, and they have a good online system. They also have smart tech support, but as with everyone, it takes a while to reach them.  I stand by iRiver, and i promise if you buy this product you will be satisfied.

<Title>Loving my iRiver H-10
<Date>Sat Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Am I missing something? I bought it, charged the battery for a few hours, upgraded my pc to Windows Media Player 10, loaded the v2.3 firmware, started ripping from my cd's and syncing to my H-10. Then sync'd a few pics from my hard-drive. Was just too easy. And I know vitually nothing about this kind of stuff, I'm just a hack.   Now, I haven't used a subscription service yet, so maybe that will present problems, but who knows.  Manual is not particularly engaging &lt;understatement>.  I love running with my iRiver. So far the only thing that has presented a problem is the awkwardness of the belt clip on the plastic sleeve. The plastic sleeve is very handsome in my opinion, but the actual belt-clip is not user friendly. A minor complaint.  Now, iRiver really should include the cradle with the product bundle, that would be a courtesy.  Earbuds are okay for comfort, everybody has different ears, but think the sound quality is excellent.  So far so good.

<Title>Ugh, awful
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this because I wanted a cool MP3 player. Ugh, bad move, should've got the iPod mini or the Rio Carbon. From day one I've been having problems with this skipping. I'm not even moving the unit, and it skips. WTF? I pressed the reset button more times than I could count. The website states that players skip. Okay, well then the least you could do is add a decent hard drive, not one that is cheap. Now, I can't do anything but listen to the FM tuner or view photos. I formatted the hard drive (2nd time), and now all the player displays is this Chinese lingo I can't understand. I'm returning it, and hopefully this was a bad apple. What sucks even more is that they sell like hotcakes, so it will probably take another week for me to get one. If the next player still skips, then I'm buying a Rio Carbon. Hey, iRiver, why don't you make decent hard drives?

I saw some other reviews here suggesting some people had problems; here's my two cents: no problems.  A couple of times I had to unplug and replug the UBS cable from the iRiver to the computer before Rhapsody would recognize that the iRiver was there and ready, but other than that, no complaints.

<Title>Couldn't Get It to Work!!!
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was so excited when I bought this player but when I plugged it into my computer, I ran into a few major problems.  1) Windows media player didn't recognize it so I couldn't transfer  songs to it.  I installed Windows Service Pack 1 (as suggested by Auto Support) and still nothing.  I went to download the latest firmware but when I installed it, now my computer couldn't recognize it.  2)  Also this player is supposed to be a hard drive too, but auto support stated that ALL the files have to be transfered using Windows Media Player.  I think that's really gay and it's a classic example of battles between corporations.  iPod is the same way since you have to use iTunes to transfer anything to it.  Microsoft wants to make you dependent on their software.  In my opinion, Windows Media Player is a low quality program full of garbage advertising ads.  Winamp and DivX are wayyyyyyyyyy better!!!  I would look for a better alternative (avoid anything with the letter i).

<Title>Terrific: more info from jordan
<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am one who loves the iriver h10. A lot of people have problems with windows media player 10. Windows media player 10 tells you to press F5 because it can't detect anything. I tried that and 2 minutes later it found the iriver h10.  To delete song(s) connect your player to your pc and open windows media player. Then click on sync and when the screen comes up there will be a menu on the right side. It says music with a plus sign next to it. Click the plus sign that looks like this but surronded by a box +. Then it will have menu's like emusic or other things. Then (let's just say the file is emusic) left click on it and all the songs from that file will go on that menu. Right click on the song you want to delete(when your right click on something a new menu will come up) and click delete.  The iriver h10 5gb accessories included: earbuds, case with belt clip, usb 2.0 cable, and a battery recharger. The earbuds are not my taste, but a lot of people love them. The case is easy to slip on and remove and resists fingerprints. The recharger is on the usb 2.0 cable. The instructions say light will dim when battery is fully charged. What a lie. I just leave it in for 45 minutes or so and that does the trick.  This mp3 also comes with a removable battery which is helpful.  This is a great mp3 overall. It's got an fm tuner and recorder. The fm comes in crystal clear where I live. It also has a photo viewer and voice recorder so you can sing and then hear yourself.  All that matters is that you get the mp3 suitable for you. You should also get more info on great mp3s at www.pcmag.com

<Title>Buyer Beware!  
<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sometimes we have such high hopes for a product only to be sorely disappointed in the end.  I did a good amount of research on MP3 players before settling on the iRiver H10 and it still bit me.  The unit itself is really attractive, easy to navigate, has an awesome color display and sinks perfectly with Windows Media Player 10.  That's the good.  The bad and the ugly side come with reliability.  It's just down right terrible!  I've had my unit under 6 months and I've already had two issues.  First, the clock on the player wouldn't advance which was a total annoyance.  If you're like me it's the stupid, little things that bug  you the most.  I called up their service line, only to get enraged by the amount of time I spent on hold.  Without exageration, to get my issue sorted out I spent a good 3 hours on hold and that was only from about 5 calls!  Most of the time I would get sick of waiting and just hang up.  Eventually I was directed to download their firmware upgrade.  Amazingly, that seemed to fix it.    Now, we come to problem 2.  During playback of audio files, my player now only emits high pitch static.  Again, I've been going back and forth with them on the issue.  I wrote them two emails for starters which were never responded to.  Got one of their service people on the phone, astoundingly in under and hour, and was told to download the next firmware update.  No offense, but I am truly sick of downloading upgrades for a device that should function correctly out of the box.  Anyway, I did as I was instructed and my unit still plays static.  To date, my H10 remains non-functional with no fix in sight.    In short, for a product that ran me upwards of $250.00 after it was all said and done, it is without a doubt the worst piece of home/personal electronics I have ever owned.  If you enjoy spending a lot of money and getting nothing but a company that has zero customer service and isn't concerned with correcting that problem then buy an iRiver.  As much as I despise the Apple organization, I have to say they have really cornered the market on portable disc-based audio.

<Title>"Amazing potential, poor execution" is wrong
<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> For the Cons at least..  1) I don't get how you are not able to feel where the buttons are. Either this thing is doing somersaults in your pocket and you don't know what the orientation of the player is or, I don't even know what. this thing has about 5 buttons and a touch strip. 3 of the buttons are play, next track, and previous track all easily "feel-able" on  the side. the other two buttons are back and select, and the touch strip is a simple up and down. I don't get how that is hard to use.  2) Format? So what? And I didn't have to format mine and it works fine with WMP.  3) A new, simple, firmware release fixes the whole problems of having to play song tracks in album order. It all works fine now.  4) Who really uses stock earphones? And anyway, that is just you for you as you mentioned, so its OK. But anyway, iRiver probably gives some of the best stock earphones compared to any other companies.  5)This is an Mp3 player, not a photo viewer. And besides, Ipod started offering it's new Ipod video with a 2.5" screen. If you can't view pictures on a 1.5" screen what makes you think you could watch movies on the Ipod. And besides, all that the picture viewer is meant for is so that one could carry around their pictures with them for a quick show, not to replace their photo albums. And the photo's are much clearer than the Ipod Photo.  6)The sync feature works great. You must make sure that the song isn't selected in another playlist. Other than that, it deletes and add songs as soon as I make the change on my computer. Couldn't be easier.  7) If you look around online, there is a program that allows you to transfer ratings from and to your H10.  8) Shut down and start-up time have been shortened with the new firmware upgrade.  9) I don't know what you mean by not transferable, but they easily go onto the Mp3 player.  Additionally, iRiver is known for their long wait times and slow response customer service, but once you get through, they are one of the best.   I would strongly encourage people to purchase this product as it is the best Mp3 player that I have ever owned. The design is beautiful, the touch strip is amazing, and it's so easy to use and so compatible with various music sharing programs. (Not just Napster) With it's great sound and functionally (Music, Pictures, Radio, Text) it's one of the best players out there.    This review was not meant to attack the other writer, but just correct some information and add another opinion.

<Title>By the time you read this, you'll be after an iPod...
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Now let me start by saying I am NOT an iPod fan. I just want an mp3 player that works to advertised specifications and in a costly kinda way, I am not finding that mythical product, with particular reference to the battery life.  Early in 2005, I bought an iPod mini with a supposed battery life of 12 hours. I was  lucky to get 6 hours out of it - and it took 8 hours to charge back up! So finally I got really annoyed with the long charge times and decided to buy the iRiver HD 10 with its 5Gb memory as everyone kept raving that the battery life really was closer to 12 hours - and I thought it was rather cool that it had photo capability...   I have put both units through the same routines - day in and day out for up to a month, trying to eek a day's worth of music out of them. And here is the end result... Neither mp3 player wins!  Why? Read on!  Let me positive to start with - here's a list of the pro's of the iRiver HD 10:  - Nice looking and light - The battery does recharge very quickly - in about 2 hours as opposed to the 8 I was experiencing with the iPod - Sound is as good as on the iPod - Can store photos and text files as well as music and picks up FM stations - Not that fussy about music formats - Less power/connection cords than the iPod - which is great if you travel a lot like I do - The photos look OK on the screen - its not hi-res stuff, but it gives you something to show people on the fly  And thats about it. Now let me detail the problems with the iRiver so you can decide truly whether or not you even want an mp3 player, let along a iRiver after this...  - Battery??????!!! 12 hours??? PFFT! I have NEVER got more than 7 hours out of it, and generally closer to 6 hours. Not even CLOSE to the 12 hours promised! - I think if you press the 'Pause' button - but don't physically turn the iRiver off, then it continues to drain the battery. The amount of times I have done that and walked away to return an hour later to a flat battery... At least the iPod shut down when you pressed pause - or at least, didn't drain the battery. - The battery also doesn't retain its charge over several days of no use. Neither did the iPod, but I don't think it ran down as quickly. And yet the rechargable battery in my camera is still showing full after 4 weeks of little use... - The plastic case it comes with is an absolute dust magnet, but even worse, the clip is very awkward. Yes, it clings to your pocket or whatever - but you can't get it off, and to do so, just about rips the clip out of the cover. Very awkward. And as one other person says, its an ugly cover which hides the beauty of the iRiver. - iRiver advertises that 'its not natural to scroll in circles - its better to go up and down.' Well, let me assure you, scrolling is quicker in circles! You scroll down... that covers about 6 songs, and then you have to lift your finger/thumb up to scroll some more... Sure, you can press down at the top or bottom of the scroll strip, but it takes longer to go through the songs... - The FF/Rew buttons are a bit sticky - may have to press several times to get them to work. I think actually a lot of it is the hard drive is slow to 'boot up' and respond - Getting photos across via Windows Media Player (WMP) is VERY buggy! I have 50Gb worth of jpegs on my computer. I optimised a select 50 to put onto the iRiver - and WMP decided to put ALL jpegs across anyway - even when I took all my photos out of "my pictures" and only left the optimised ones there. It found ALL jpegs on my computer and tries to upload each and everyone every time I connect WMP to upload a song...  - Dragging photos across to the iRiver in Windows Explorer is PAINFULLY slow. With my optimised images (20-30kb only), it would take about 2 minutes per picture! What's up with that??? - Can't show the pictures on TV's -but then, you can't do that with the iPod Mini or the iPod Nano anyway... - I created playlists in Windows Media Player - and NONE of them transferred across.I had to rate all my songs ON the iRiver - it didn't recognise one rated song from WMP. THAT was painful, and I am glad I only have 130 songs to rate, not 20Gb or 30Gb worth! - Adding favourites to the "Quicklist" is also time consuming and tedious - The unit takes longer to boot up than an iPod - The shuffle feature etc are quite well buried in terms of menu's - I actually failed on my first attempt and had to read the instructions (horrors!) - The shuffle feature seems to be very inclined to repeat tracks. I used to get annoyed with the iPod for cycling through my playlist and then stopping. But its even MORE annoying to press pause, come back a few hours later and have the same tracks cycling through again - even if you have it set NOT to 'shuffle and repeat' - There was some preloaded crap on it which was a real pain to track down and delete - And for the organised ones out there, no features for contact lists - unless you put them in a text file...  So, I leave it up to you. I would probably recommend an Apple over an iRiver because at least once its set up, it doesn't seem to be as buggy as the iRiver. But I wish all makers of mp3 players would get the battery issue sorted out - why can't they use the same batteries as those in digital camera's? Then I'd seriously consider buying the units!

<Content>WHen i was looking for an mp3 player that had music and photos in one, i searched for a while. Then i found this iRiver mp3 player. I thought, man it looks the same as an ipod nano. I choose this mp3 player cause it holds more than the nano. The 4gb nano is 250 bucks and this iRiver mp3 player is 200 bucks and holds 5 gb. I don''t know why apple jacks up there prices so much? Now, this product, when i got it, seemed sleek and cool. And it was. I put on a lot of photos and a lot of music. I have to say the sound quility of this mp3 player is awsome. I have an ipod shuffle and it sounds way better than the shuffle. Plus, the color screen is very vibrant and looks good while displaying your pics. Now, i choose this mp3 player over the nano because it is cheaper, it is way more durible. My friend got a nano and the screen cracked on the 5th day he had it. He had to pay 200 to get it fixed. iRiver mp3 players, this one, is very sturdy, u can drop it 5 feet on to a hard wood floor and it would not break. It's an amazing product. I highly recomend this to any music fan and any one who wants to listen to good quiltiy sound and look at pics on his mp3 player.
