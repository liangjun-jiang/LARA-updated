<Content>The product was delivered inoperable out of the container. It will not power up nor will the Colby people replace the item unless I pay postage both way for a replacement. To date it is unresolved and I am totally dissatisfied with the   manufacturer/supplier.   Archie Womble

<Content>512MB Slim MP3 Video Player   got this mp3 player as a gift,and loved the design of it.the instructions were easy enough until it came down to downloading or syncing music to the device,it will not do it.i tried for hours last night to get music on this thing and it just will not go on.i bought everyone in my home mp3 players for christmas and we are all enjoying our music,different brand of course.but this device will not function right at all.i will not reccomend it at all.the only thing it is good for is the radio,can not even load photos.
