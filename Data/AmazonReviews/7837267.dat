<Title>This Item is not well constructed
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa e280 is straight up garbage.  I had to take it back on 4 seperate occasions because the the memory froze and could not be reset.  when you load all of your songs and movies, sometimes the songs don't appear on your Mp3 player.  you have to load it 3 or 4 different times to get in on your ipod. the buttons on the sansa are pretty damn small as far as the arrows. the volume button and volume button navigation is well thought out but as far as the unit as a whole, I would give a D-. Very sloppy craftsmanship and I think they need to recall this item and fix the errors or else they probable will soon loose repeat business.

<Title>Prettty good - keep trying
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Happy to see that this player (compared to e140) would resume playback where it left off after turning off.  Resets volume to 50% on power up(?) though!  I had the opposite problem than what this is probably supposed to prevent.  I usually am listening at reduced volume so that I can hear what's going on in the background, only to get blasted after turning the unit back on.  Player needs some way easy to bulld playlists internally.  Sound and battery life are very good.  The more storage capacity a player has, the more the manufacturer really needs to think about the interface and software.  But I'm pretty particuar about the order that I want to play back my tunes.  It's not easy being me :-)  Windows Media player for a front-end?  Don't think so!  I may sell this and look at the Creative one even though it' not as small.  I hate their (Creative) software, but at least it has something.

<Title>This is some headache-causing hardware!
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My beloved Zen Micro Photo's hard drive died, but thankfully, I had Big Box Retailer's extended warranty on it. Unfortunately, they no longer stock that unit, so I had to pick out another one. The Sansa looked like the best out of the bunch: Small, high-quality screen, video playback, high capacity, flash-based, and most importantly, it had a built-in voice recorder.  Almost from the outset, there were problems. I don't use any online music services, so having Rhapsody foisted upon me was an immediate annoyance. The media manager application had a propensity to randomly crash, particularly in the middle of file transfers. Not good. The design felt very badly thought out, with a mechanical scroll wheel that feels rough and gets stuck (I see why Apple dumped them!), and buttons that are tiny, hard to press, and don't feel like they're being pushed when they are.   But the real deal-killer for me was a problem I don't think many others will experience: I have a great deal of music whose filenames and ID3 tags are written in Japanese characters. The Sansa's US firmware does not support Japanese (and other Asian languages as well, I'd assume), and as a result, the player will choke whenever it's asked to play a file with even one Japanese character in it. Since about half my music library fits that description, and it would take forever to go back and manually rename all those files in English, I was extremely annoyed. Perhaps a firmware flash would fix it? I tried to get some firmware of Sandisk's Japanese site, but they don't have any direct downloads. Maybe the newest US firmware has Asian language support, I thought to myself. I found the firmware, unzipped it, and loaded it onto my player.  Dead as a doornail. Tried it again. And again. And again. At that point, I just gave up.  Some people don't seem to have any problems with this. Well, more power to you, I guess, but based on my experience, this is NOT something I would recommend. If you're in the market for an iPod alternative, Creative's units still offer the best combination of features, functionality, and design.   Now I just need to figure out what I'm gonna buy after I return this thing.

<Title>Great Alternative to Apple's Proprietary Garbage
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me start by saying that this thing is really small.  I saw the pictures and even some video reviews on youtube, but I was still pleasantly surprised at how tiny this player actually is.  My Motorola Razor cellphone dwarfs it. It's cheap, so unless you're a dedicated Apple user (i.e. have more money than brains), you're getting a great bargain. I got it mainly because of nice size and compatibility (no need for dealing with iTunes - this baby looks just like another drive to your comptuer, which means drag and drop support for files). I wasn't expecting much from video - but changed my mind, after being able to watch tv series episodes on it during my commute to work, or full movies during recent flights.  The resolution/quality of the LCD is simply amazing. FM tuner gets great reception, even in my basement - not to mention the fact that I can quickly record a new song directly off the radio, so that I can listen to it later. The only downside I can list at the moment is the button interface - the rotating wheel could be a little more depressed, to make pressing buttons around it easier, but you get used to it really fast.   Other than that - this device is definitely the way to go.  I couldn't be more happy with the purchase.

<Title>nice feature set, nice look, easy to use
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll admit that I've never owned any iPod, so I cannot directly compare this unit with a Nano.  Why buy a Nano, though, when the Sansa with equivalent flash memory has additional features and costs much less?  Sure, the Nano's interface (the click wheel) is a little easier to use, but that's not worth a 35% premium while sacrificing features such as video playback and an FM tuner.  My previous player was one of the Sansa e100 series.  This player is a definite upgrade beyond the obvious (color screen, larger capacity, video playback).  It definitely sounds much better than the e100 (and I was basically satisfied with that player's sound once I had tweaked its equilizer to my liking).  The interface is a lot nicer than the e100.  As others have written, the buttons around the scroll wheel are small but this hasn't presented a problem so far.  The menu system is so straight-forward that you don't really need to refer to the manual to use the player, though I would recommend looking at the manual at least once if you plan to put any video content on the player.  Contrary to some other reviewers' opinions, I think this player has a nice, not cheap, look.  I don't know whether it's identical in form to the lower capacity players in the same series; if not it seems much nicer in my hand than those players did when I briefly handled them at a local store.  I'm quite satisfied with this player so far, but I've only had it for about one week.  A word of caution to would-be purchasers:  I had originally ordered this from Amazon and, according to their customer service, they don't know when they will get more units in (despite the website saying "in stock").  I was given a delivery estimate of approximately two months away, so I canceled my order and went elsewhere.

<Title>Great player.  No hassle
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall this a great player with many capabilities.  The FM tuner, voice recorder, pics, and video are specs that everyone knows but it comes together nicely here. Replacable battery is always a plus.  Sound is great. If you don't like what you have you can manually adjust the equalizer settings.  There are many to choose from.  You might want to invest in some higher quality headphones though.  The factory set isn't bad at all, but you could go better.  I've heard a lot of complaining about the scroll wheel and the buttons.  The wheel is easy to use and DOES NOT JAM as some other tend to think.  Yea the Ipod click wheel is nice.. but this isn't an ipod is it..?  When pushing buttons, it seems that your pushes does not register but it does.  No issues there.  Battery Life is great.  Running through the menu, playlists, and all the other functions obvioulsy drains the battery but not significantly.  It'll last for at least 9 hours depending on usage.  Ease of use:  You can't go wrong with this player, and it is incredibly straight forward.  The installation cd gives you a user manual just in case you have any questions but you can figure it out yourself by just running through the menus.  File transfer and media converter is straight forward. To easily create playlists the cd will update your windows media player, so make sure you install it.  Media player tends to be moody at times, but once you start dragging and dropping your files, its easy.    Just something to point out.  An earlier review said that the boot time was around 5 minutes or so.  That's totally exaggerated.  I have a little under 6GB of USED space and it takes about 10 seconds max to boot.  Obviously, you should take care of your player.  Buying a case is a best bet even though it comes with a slim fabric case.  Take care of the player and it'll take care of you

<Title>co-dependent
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i must have got lucky i guess cause mine seems to be functioning properly. but i seriously think it's lame not to be able to create playlists or delete media without syncing up to a comp. i never owned an ipod but hear they are pretty much the same. it doesn't work well with windows media player. and i think it's weak for a company to sell a product without proper software included. they tell me rhapsody works better. i haven't had a chance to try it yet. i decided to make better use of my time and came on here to bash it instead. my creative labs is far better with menu options and music access.  the buttons are a little funky but my wheel works great. it does freeze up for a sec when you try and rate a song. it does take a minute to reload after syncing up. which is another reason they should make it so i can create playlists and delete songs without syncing up.  i do like the video, pics, sounds good, light-weight, nice big screen, it has potential, thier customer support seems good, but then when i asked them why you can't delete songs they said cause people used to complain about deleting songs on accident. so now that's my problem. i really appreciate them striving to suit the needs of the underprivledged. i hope microsoft gets the same idea and makes it so i can't create or save on my xbox without my computer. i'm satisfied with my purchase but taking away two stars for lack of convenience. all i want to do is put stuff on it. delete media i don't want when i hear or see it, so i can load it back up with fresh jams when i have time. it is going to take me forever to get it set up how i want it. not to mention adding new stuff yet to come. blah.

<Title>iPod Nano had better watch it's back! The Sansa competes and EXCEEDS in most if not all categories!
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't fall into the white earbud trance any longer!! Wake from your Apple induced slumber people and open your eyes to the SanDisk Sansa e200 Series!! This review pertains to the Sansa e280 8GB mP3 player and let me tell you that the iPod Nano and Apple for that matter, had better watch it's back! The feature set capabilities and price point of the Sansa e 280 should have no trouble making Nano into apple pie as long as users like me help educate consumers to the realization that yes, indeed, there is a whole market of AWESOME mP3 players that in fact cost LESS, have more features, better reliability, and a company that backs its unit even after it has been sold!   For a long while now, many consumers have a certain "fruit" in mind when it comes to the mP3 player of choice. Well, I have news for you. The Sansa e280 outstrips the Nano in almost every regard. the e280 was the first flash player to come out with an 8GB capacity. The Nano soon followed with it's own 8GB (2000 songs) however, the Sansa has and expandible Trans Flash/Micro SD card slot enabling the user to ADD Storage!! Yes I said ADD IT! Currently SanDisk makes a 2GB micro SD card for about 100$ enabling you to add 2gigs to your player(about 500 more songs). Nano doesn't offer this and yet it is still priced the same or higher in some cases as I found my Sansa for under 200$. with this capability, the life of the player should be extended because of increased volumes for SD cards that come out continuously. Unlike with an apple product where if more storage is needed, you have to buy a new player and spend another 250 bucks! You can plug the storage card into the player and all the music transfered to it automatically integrates into your albumn folders which is a fabulous benefit!  Another Nice feature that the Sansa offers is a larger display screen. At 1.8 inches, the colors are bright and crisp. I would have liked to see a higher color resolution, however, still much bigger than the Nano and quite easy to read and see.  The construction of the Sansa is excellent with a poured metal back casing that is virtually un-scratchable (unless you drop it I would imagine) but you really can't scratch it like an iPod or a Zen. It also doesn't use the same plastic as the iPod or the Creative Zen so the front is SO much more durable!!! You would really have to scrape something pretty sharp against it to show scratches on its face unlike the iPod and Zen player in which you just have to place them in a pocket to receive one.   The e280 has a tactile wheel for navigation which is similar to the iPod platform but I find it to be a bit better. The dial has tiny grooves enabling the user to have more control through the screens. Unlke the iPod, the wheel lights up an electrifying flourescent blue color enabling you to navigate in lower light conditions and it also enhances the sleek look of the player.   The Sansa is compatible with Windows Media Player(free) and Rhapsody which is a paid music subscription site just like iTunes. However because this is not an apple product, you are not confined to the Apple platform.    The Sansa offers an FM tuner which is spot on and crystal clear, a voice recorder (useful if you are the memo on the fly type), video playback and photo viewing capabilities. The Nano has video and photo but does NOT have FM radio or recording capabilities. Easy and user-desirable things to add and yet Apple still hasn't caught on.   The cost of ownership for this is already cheaper right out of the gate with the lower price point but also a GREAT feature that Apple refuses to offer as it would effect their bottom line DRASTICALLY is that the Sansa offers a USER replaceable battery for about 19 bucks. You have to send your iPod out to Apple at the cost of shipping and $50 per battery. Not to mention the battery life for the Nano is 15 hours where the Sansa e280 played for 22.5 hours before dying!  All in all I spent 177.00 and got a FAR SUPERIOR PLAYER!! SanDisk customer service is top notch as well. I owned 2 very expensive $300 a piece 20 Gig ipods. in just over a year each(right after the warranty was up) they had hard drive failure which cost 268.40 to repair. I was told it was cheaper to buy another iPod and was sent rudely on my way by Apple rather than their customer service trying to work with me to keep me as a customer. I have done research on every player out there, Hard Drive and flash. I bought a Sandisk. They are the leaders is flash memory for a reason. Not to mention their customer service was STELLAR!! Top notch and happy to have me convert.   In closing, the Sansa is most definitely worth your time and your investment. Don't spend the 250$ on the Nano for your child's christmas present. They will be receiving a far inferior product, will have to replace it or fix it and the cost is RIDICULOUS! Educate yourself and purchase a Sansa.

<Title>Nice, but No Control
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk's other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn't give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped.   It would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. "It's our way or the highway." Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.  It's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won't make much difference if the device won't play.

<Title>Just OK
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had this for about a week, then it crapped out and would not hook up with PC after.  Tech-help had no clue, "Just RMA" they said.   When skipping songs, there is a real pause that is aggrevating.  Scroll wheel is cheap as stated before.  Screen is real nice and video option is nice.  All in all, I returned this for an Ipod Nano 8gb.  No comparision.  Outside of video (which I have no use for) and price, (you do get what you pay for) this player can't even stand in the Nano's shadow.    Get the nano, you'll be glad after you did.

<Content>It came boxed very nicely, the MP3 player and its accessories were safe and snug, and the battery came fully charged. I pressed the 'on' button and it turned on and was ready to go. To put music on, I just hook it up to my USB port (with the cable that comes with, obviously) and drag and drop the songs onto the drive. It's as simple as that. To charge it, just keep it hooked up to your computer. I always recommend reading the instructions with more expensive products like this, though. This thing works just as well as any iPod could, and holds plenty of music. Thoroughly satisfied with this.

<Title>Very poor software
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product works only with Microsoft Media Player which is a very poor software, nothing for the real music fan. I have tested the sansa e280 in my office when it came and it worked despite all the problems with windows media player. But then I wanted to connect to my computer at home and it was blocked absolutely. I tried everything (uninstall and install again), but without success. Today I went to a computer expert of our lab, but after some trials he gave up. So the Sansa e280 seems to be rather useless because of its close connections to Microsoft.  The update of the firmware solved this problem, but the software for upload is still very poor: let the Chinese do it !  Used the Media Monkey which is much better than the Microsoft Mediaplayer, but still not logical enough.  The memory size is too small for a music freak, 32 Gb would be more appropriate.

<Title>Impossibly difficult to use
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?.  Easily enough, as it turns out.    I was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.  Dragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from "My Computer" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out.   I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method.   This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!.   Using Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.    After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.  This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.    Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands, it's without merit as a player.

<Title>Hope you went to college
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've got an engineering degree in computer science.  I've been supporting multi-million dollar web applications for years.  It took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the Rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for.  There is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player.  It's not ipod caliber quality, the only reason you'd get it is for the Rhapsody service.  If you are not highly technical and patient, move on!  Player itself works fine.  ------ Edit - 4 days after getting this thing synced properly, it decided the device was no longer authorized to play the DRM'd music.  Only Rhapsody songs that are added again seem to work.  Filling the 8 gigs over a USB 2.0 connection takes hours.  All this after upgrading to the latest version of Rhapsody, the latest version of Windows Media Player, and the latest firmware for the player.  Further investigation indicates this sort of thing is a common problem with the Plays for Sure protocol used by the Sansa to integrate with the music subscription services, though Rhapsody seems to have the worst reputation.  That could mean it's just the most popular.  Get an ipod.  They're #1 for a reason. A lot of the high reviews and comments on reviews for this product are either people that haven't used it with a music subscription service or viral marketing from Real or Sandisk. -------------- Hopefully the final Edit -   We finally got this thing to work right.  It turns out that if part of the memory gets corrupted, the DRM doesn't work properly, resulting in the problems described above.  Oddly enough, you have to reformat the player using windows, like you would a 3.5" floppy disk.  Since doing this it has worked almost flawlessly.  I'd bump the rating from 2 stars to 4 if Amazon would let me.  Rhapsody technical support was no help, BTW.  We installed Napster as a last ditch effort to get the thing working, and the first thing the application told us to do was fix the corrupted memory by reformating the player.  Too bad for Napster it made Rhapsody work again as well.

<Title>Great player for the money, but room for improvement
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a subscription service (Ruckus) so I didn't want to deal with iPod. I did a lot of research on non-iPod players before buying the sansa. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.   Design is very sleek and the size is just right. The color screen has good resolution and pictures/videos are clear. Controls are very intuitive. The side buttons are a little hard to press, but if you buy a silicone case the buttons become raised making life a lot easier. The scroll button is kind of clunky as well, but I feel the sansa's other features compensate for it. Plus it's pretty neon blue... :)  After reading poor reviews about the FM radio, I have to say it works great for me. I live in a pretty rural area where stations are always a little fuzzy and the sansa comes in just as well as anything else. The antenna wires are in the headphones (standard cheap-ish round earbuds which I find very uncomfortable). I'm planning on getting new headphones, so hopefully the radio still works ok. Otherwise, volume is good, almost too loud.  I wish the package included an AC charger, but now that Sansa has been out for awhile, there are plenty of after-market accessories available. Sansa's website links to licensed products. There is also a memory expansion slot, which is a big plus over competitors. However, the battery life is longer than most players and it charges pretty quickly through USB. The downside here is that you can't use the player whenever it's plugged in. This makes for one of my bigger beefs: file management. It's a bit annoying if you just want to delete a song because it has to be plugged in. If you can't remember if you want to delete a song or not and would like to listen to it to check, heaven help you... You can't play anything (either through the sansa or the synced list on your computer) so this requires unplugging the player, listening, plugging back in, then deleting. I suppose this type of occurrence is rare, so I can deal.     Initial ease of transferring files wasn't great either. After a day though, I'm a pro. Yes, you may have to read the manual, but it'll save a lot of grief down the road. Although it's easier to use off the bat than other players I've tried, it could be improved. The sansa allows you to drag and drop files on MSC mode and sync through Windows Media Player in MTP mode (my preferred method). It took me a few tries to import playlists "as is", but contrary to some reviews here it CAN be done. Make sure you're using the AutoSync feature instead of Manual sync in Windows Media. (easy enough to do once I read the directions!) If you do it right, you'll still have a library full of all songs and playlists that will only play certain songs. The Sansa also has a "GoList" feature, but I've found it to be worthless. In order to add a song, you have to be listening to it. You can't queue up a playlist like in any PC jukebox program. May as well just make playlists in advance then import them.   While some things could be improved, I think the Sansa e280 is a very solid player and I'm glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to the ipod nano, based on both on price and function.

<Title>Sansa E280
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When my Zen Micro blew up on me a few weeks ago, I decided it was time to purchase a new MP3 player. I had long tried to avoid the iPod but after playing with a friend of mines new 8GB iPod Nano I decided I would get one. Fortunetly, I stumbled across the Sansa E280 by chance while looking for a good deal on the Nano. I decided to take a chance on this relatively unknown device and am now thrilled that I did!  While it is basically the same width and height as the Nano, it is slightly thicker which might bother some people but I still don't even know it's there while in my pocket. The Nano has a color screen which can be used to view photos and 8GB. It's actually a nice little player but compared to the Sansa E280 it falls easily to a comendable second place. the E280 has an internal 8GB but there is a slot for a 2GB expandable memory disk! It is very easy to connect to the pc as well. I am by no means a computer expert and I use Windows Media Player to store my music. When I first connected the E280 to the pc, it asked me did I want to sync the two, which I said yes to. Ten minutes later the Sansa was loaded with all my music, no problems what-so-ever.In addition to displaying photos as the Nano does, it also plays videos. When reading reviews I thought this was a clever gimic but nothing worth using on such a small screen (it is only slightly larger than the nano's). I put an episode of South Park onto it when I first got the E280 and was suprised by the quality. I still wouldn't recommend replacing your tv with one of these but it is actually far better than I thought it could be. The packaged video coverter works well. I literally dragged and dropped the episode into it and the it was converted and transferred to the E280 before my eyes. The fm radio is also brilliant. My Zen Micro had an fm radio that never really worked. I didn't expect much better from my new MP3 player but once again I was suprised. No problems picking up the local stations at all.   The player itself fits comfortably in my hand. The only complaint I have about the physical player is the rotating wheel. At first I was disappointed with it as it felt very cheap, particularly when compared with the rest of the player. I got used to this very quickly and don't have a problem with it anymore but I think it is worth noting all the same. The other complaint I would have about the player is that songs cannot be deleted from the player itself, you must hook it up to the computer and manually remove them.   All in all, I would highly recommend the Sansa E280. Of the many MP3 players I tried out, this one really came out of top. It is beaten on size by the iPod, although the difference is near negligible. If your looking for a great little player packed with more features than you'd know what to do with, pick a Sansa E280 up!

<Title>big failure
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned 4 MP3 players including the Sandisk 4gb which I give 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I cannot give the E280 the same rating.  I could not get the e280 to work on my computer. The 4gb is compatible with my Sony, but the 8gb was not recognized.  I tried EVERYTHING.  I downloaded drivers for my PC, I downloaded drivers for the  e280 MP3.  I was on the phone with Sandisk for an hour (and they were OK).  Sandisk told me there was something wrong with my computer (EVEN THOUGH I could run the 4gb beautifully).  They said I didn't have 2.0 usb ports (but I do).  I called Sony just to make sure I did have the 2.0 usb ports.  They walked me through hell and high water.  The only thing left for us to do was to wipe out my computer and reformat it just to see if the MP3 player would be recognized.  I wasn't willing to do all of this because I would have to back up all of my data on my entire computer and then reformat it.  Another few hours of work after I already spent 5 hours speaking with both Sony and Sandisk.  The mp3 player is just not worth it to me.  Good price, but never was recognized by my computer.  It did charge up however, and the menu was working.  But, I never downloaded any music to it because I couldn't get connected.  Now I know why it was such a good price.  I am so sorry it didn't worked because I really love the 4gb one.  I guess I have to go with another player.  boo hoo

<Title>my second one
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is my dream movie/mpeg player, i bought one in october and used it continuously until tonight i accidently put it into an olive jar with no olives but lots of olive brine and left it for several hours, (dont ask) so i am ordering my second one. i watch movies on it in bed and i listen to audiobooks on it.  where ever i find myself in a situation where i have to wait it is a great companion and i can get all my spanish lessons on it as well.  i have also purchased a 2 gig micro sd card bringing my total memory to 10 gig, that much memory does the job. i dont understand people who want to store 80 gig of files on their ipod or archos, it makes no sense and forces you to use hard drive based players which in my opinion are a real problem for an 'active' person.  now for the bad news, it is buggy, and does lock up, Plus you have to unscrew 4 small screws to change the battery to reboot, which can be a problem if you are on a bicycle tour and cant recharge, why not make battery change easier.  it uses the quick time movie format which is limiting, and the software conversion program is written by archsoft and doesnt give you 'any' options, i bought the full version from archsoft. the movies i convert are large 4 to 7 gig and in mpeg2 dvd format, and the software/hardware combination wont handle it and the audio gets out of synch VERY badly, i found a solution, i also have an archos 80 gig hard drive type video player so i convert the file to archos divx format first and then using that file i convert to the quick time format killing 2 birds with one stone but the file actually gets "larger" in quicktime then in divx. another irritation is that the player only handles 10 minute video files so the converter chops them up for you and rotates the frame to fit better, i can live with the 10 minute files, but every 10 minutes you get a 20 second pause as it opens the next 10 minutes, plus the conversion program leaves several rows of pixels unused on the screen, and i'd like the screen to be 1/4th of an inch bigger all the way around but NO bigger, i like it small so i'll always carry it.  i also dont like sansa's firmware updater service since if you have toasted the snasa's operating system the computer wont recognize it and the updater wont update the non-existing operation system, i am still trying to find the firmware on their web-sight.  so with all this pain why buy another, well 'love' is like that.  flash memory is really 'sweet' and the battery lasts and lasts, but for me the main thing is that it is SO small and light weight that i always have it with me, and when you find yourself stuck waiting at the doctors office and you are content watching a movie while those around you are stuck reading dog eared cosmopolitan magazines you'll love it, even those people who have other video players wont have them with them because they are just toooooo big.    hopefully later products will 'iron out' some of these little irritations. and thats why i only rate it 4 stars not 5. hurry up ups i need my sansa.

<Title>Great Unit
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I like this unit so much that I thought I'd capture a few points that I think make this player a great choice:  1.) Currently an excellent $/GB value. 2.) Build quality is great (solid metal backplane). Screen will scratch, but one of the many available screen protectors will address this problem. 3.) User interface is well-deigned. I'm a fairly big guy (6'1") with large hands, but I have no problems operating the 4 buttons arranged around the scroll wheel. I was apprehensive about the scroll wheel, but it works great for me. The fact that it - unlike the iPod wheel - is raised a bit (i.e., has a positive profile) makes it easy to locate with your thumb when the player is out of view. 4.) Battery life is excellent; I've never run the unit to full discharge, but with heavy use on trans-pacific flights I've never gotten close to battery-empty status, so the stated 20 hrs. seems very realistic.(Remember that turning the brightness down will do wonders for battery life...) 5.) My player is loaded to capacity, and it takes apx. 10-15 sec. for booting, no more. 6.) Sandisk phone customer service has been more than satisfactory on two occasions (wait time was quite long but the actual service was very good).

<Content>I really want to enjoy this player... its a beauty to look at and is the perfect size. But...  Takes about 30 seconds to boot up, takes another 10 seconds to get anything to play, takes about 10 seconds to skip to a new song, takes about 30 seconds to transfer 1 song...  i've never had a player that was anything but instantanious (except for the initial boot).

<Title>Its extra features, may not be what you'd expect
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Sansa e280 (8GB) about a year ago and my wife has the e260 (4GB).  They have been reliable and easy to use.  I selected Sansa over iPod because of its lower price, the ability to listen to and record FM radio and voice, and because of its expandable memory, user replaceable battery, and not needing to use iTunes.  I'm not going to compare similar features of these two products, but rather focus on Sansa's extras.  To me the microphone in the Sansa is surprisingly good and its voice recordings are excellent.  I was surprised to find recordings in WAV format, rather than MP3, and have not seen this mentioned in other reviews, on Sansa's web site, or in the product manual.  Recordings are 16-bit mono, sampled at 16kHz, which is fine for voice.  The level is preset, working well for voice, but set too high for amplified live music.  For FM recording there is another surprise producing a 16-bit stereo WAV still sampled at 16kHz.  The surprise is that the signal is mixed to mono, but recorded in stereo, doubling file size without providing the benefit a stereo image.  The low sampling rate means playback sounds worse than the original, losing frequencies above 8kHz.  A sampling rate of 32kHz would be more appropriate for FM recording, but would double file size too.  I have not needed to replace the battery, but I suspect the cost may not be justified when the time comes.  The microSD slot is not HCSD compatible, so expansion is limited to 2GB.  It's better to buy more memory up front, if you can afford it.  On your computer, a separate drive is installed for the expansion slot, and files must be placed there manually.  Despite its issues, I find the Sansa to be a great value.  Not needing iTunes is priceless.

<Content>I had a Sansa e280 for little over a year. Unfortunately, it broke a couple days ago. I was very satisfied with it, but now i'm thinking about upgrading to a higher memory. The only cons are that it freezes fairly often- many times i had to wait until the battery died to use it. Also, after you put your music on the player, you can't edit the title, artist, album, or anything like that.  I would recomend this item over a nano.

<Content>I bought the Sansa e200. It was on sale for about $84. I also bought a power supply for use while traveling. It was a total waste of money. My e200 has menu screens that are neither English or Spanish. The manual/instructions were supposed to be available on Adobe PDF. I have the latest Adobe (8.0), but I cannot bring up the instructions. All attempts to solve this problem have failed. I would never waste my money on another Sansa product.  Puffmaru

<Title>Meh.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Good: I love the metal backing!!!  It's pretty much the reason I bought the product--I'm a very clumsy person and have managed to drop it several times without it breaking.  Pictures look pretty nice, and although the only video I saw on it is the preloaded one, that was good too.    I like the EQ settings and that you can rate the songs. The voice and FM radio are nice too.  I've never used the micro SD slot, but it's nice to have the option.  The Bad: You can't edit your playlists on the go.  I've previously used Creative players that can so that could just be me.  It's also frustrating that you can't play only one song from an album without adding the entire album to the now playing list.  Basically, unless you have a playlist you have to listen to whole albums at a time.  I also wish you could change the orientation when looking at pictures, but it's not really a big deal. It also takes a ridiculously long time to start up, which makes me sad.  Overall: It works, but I'm not terribly impressed.  It kind of feels like (gasp) a return to the CD era in that unless you have a mix already made you're stuck to just albums.  It's perfect for some people, but I'm looking for a replacement.  Most Creative Labs products would be a nice alternative.

<Title>What more can you possibly want?
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought my e280, not being confused by Apple's marketing "trick" of convincing people that the nano is not just another player. And I don't need the prestige value that Jobs has built into his player. Rather, I get to keep my various music files on separate cards, so I don't have to play with the whole "list" business. My classical music isn't inter-mixed with my pop music, or my 30's collection.  But more importantly, the e280 is feature rich. I use every one of them, especially the recorder which allows me to structure my day and make certain I get all the essentials done. The photos are great, the video quality only suffers because most video producers do such a terrible job wih focus and lighting, and the built in FM receiver has allowed me to use my car stereo with the addition of a simple Giffen car device (at some point I'll spring for the built in system, but not until I get a Click and just leave it in the car). I use Bose earphones at home and the sound is simply first rate. Given the price, the increasing music options (including the ability to turn my records into mp3 files), and the freedom from iTunes makes this a no brainer, unless you have some deep, psychological need to be "in" and have a nano to impress your friends. One suggestion - get the rubber black cover for your e280. I've dropped mine a few times and it just bounces wihout any damage. As for the nano crowd, just wait until you have to replace your battery! In conclusion, I'd rather save $100 and use the money to build my music collection than give it over to Apple. The nano is just more proof that no one has ever gone broke underestimating the foolishness of the American consumer.

<Title>Cannot set MSC connection mode
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Before purchasing this device I downloaded the Sansa E280 user guide from the Sansa website. The user guide has clear instructions on how to set MSC or MTP USB connection mode. Really simple. Just select Settings/USB Mode from the main menu. Piece of cake. A child could do it.  That is, a child could do it IF THE F*****G Settings menu had a USB Mode selection. Which it doesn't.  Sorry - didn't mean to shout.  I sent the device back this morning, along with the nifty base station that I was going to use to hook up the device to my home stereo.  Now, just to be clear: I was able to find out that there is a magic handshake that will allow you to set MSC mode: everytime you connect to your PC, put the device in LOCK, and hold down the left-nav button while you are connecting the device to your PC. So simple even an ambidextrous ape could do it, BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT TO???!!!??? Why the f**k would Sansa ship a device that has to be used in that way?  Oops, shouting again. Sorry.  Anyway, I sent the device back because life is far too short to allow oneself to be aggravated by poorly designed or poorly implemented electronic gadgets.

<Title>Kicks iPod's butt!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this a year ago and I love it!!  I use it constantly.  Battery goes forever and recharges quickly.  It is very light weight and I don't even notice it when I run.  Far easier to use in my opinion than ipods. I like the actual wheel and buttons instead of the touch pad, which I never could master.  I have had zero problems which is nice since I moved to Africa with the Peace Corps right after getting it and would never be able to get it serviced.  Far less expensive because they don't spend billions on advertisements, but the quality is high.  My only recommendation is that you get any accessories at the same time you order this.  You will save on shipping and it is hard to find accessories that fit it elsewhere.  The world only seems to want to sell ipod stuff.  Buy it!  Love it!

<Title>Looks great and works good --> recommended!
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've got this device two weeks ago and I am very happy with it.   PROS: + solidly build, scratch resistant, looks great (truly "sexy") + great looking interface, easy and quick navigation + tactile navigation wheel for fast navigation (also looks great when shines blue) + good sound, custom EQ, also loud enough + sharp display; even videos are looking good + good tuner reception, sensivity over average, works also in Europe + 20 hours with one battery charge + the battery is replaceable: $19.99 if you need it one day... in contrast to $60+ for an iPod + supports MSC (Mass Storage Compliant) mode: no need for any software to transfer files, can be used for any data as USB stick + supports MTP (Music Transfer Protocol) and MS PlaysForSure (eg. for Napster To Go) + can by extended to 10GB with an microSD card + is not an iPod ;-)  CONTRAS: - supports only an old QuickTime format for videos (big files) - buttons are quite small and may be difficult to push - upper surface is a fingerprint magnet (easy to clean, fortunately..) - no gapless playback (very short - maybe 0.2s - breaks between live tracks) - bad quality FM recording - sometimes crashes during video playback - microSD Card can only be used in MSC mode if I am right.. and can only be used for music, no photos/videos  I don't really need video, so big .MOV files is not an issue to me, and also don't care about audio recording... therefore I can easily give 4.5 stars ... or even 4 3/4. Truly great gadget!

I was looking for megabytes, FM radio, nice design, but I found even more: it was a LOT of megabytes, RECORDABLE radio, BEAUTIFUL design, and also good screen, memory extension and an INCREDIBLE price. I thought that this is something like a joke, but for my happiness it was something real. So I bought it, I wasn't delaying a second. Now I own it for 3 months and I am still the happiest man on earth, because I love music very much, and Sansa helps me everyday too keep it close to me.

I read all of amazon review before buying it, I was a little scared of what I read, I bought it anyway for my wife, I been playing with it for a bit (it is for her Christmas), let me tell you the wheel is a little mecanical compare to a I-pod (who cares), but works great, I was able to dump 3.5 GB of songs ( ran out of MP3) and copied one video over and 15 pictures I have 3.7GB used, the screen quality is really nice, I bought it for $184 + free shipping, I don' t think you can do better then that..... I will recommended it in a heart beat,it is small, cute ,a really nice piece of electronic. I also read that people have problems with the software and complained that you have to use the "media converter" , but I read the manual and that works great too... (I think people do not like to learn new tricks). the only thing is that it would be nice to be able to dump the video on the Sansa, (it shows up in Mycomputer), but I think the software resize the pictures and video to the screen size of the sansa..... so it is worth the effort.... my take on it rely nice, the best buck for the money, the feature I like the most is it as a clock !!!I-pod do not have a clock, the FM radio is also nice, *****GREAT ALL IN-ONE *****

<Title>Fantastic MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for about 2 weeks now, and the longer I have it the more I love it.  It comes pre-loaded with hundreds of songs that are easy to access via convenient categories such as 70's, 80's, Hip Hop, etc.  This is great if you're new to MP3 players and/or don't have a big MP3 collection of your own yet.  The Rhapsody service it comes bundled with is outstanding.  You'll likely find most every song you want, and you'll find it easily, plus you'll quickly discover all sorts of new music you like.  The FM radio works very well too, with splendid reception.  Viewing photos on a screen this size is, naturally, problematic, but the color screen is crystal clear, if small.  You just can't go wrong here.  Trust me, you're going to love this player!

<Title>Great for 2 hours then died after firmware upgrade
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>E280 has great features and capacity for the price.   The player has a quality feel to it except for the thumbwheel which doesn't rotate smoothly.   Pictures, video and music were easy to load.  Video and pictures were very crisp.  FM, MP3 and voice recording audio were all very good.   The player's GUI was intuitive and easy to use.   Now the bad news...   The manual and Sansa web site recommend upgrading to the latest firmware (the player shipped with 01.02.12A).  When I upgraded the firmware to the latest release (01.02.15), the player would not start up again.  The thumbwheel would illuminate but nothing else worked.   I called the Sansa help number (1 866 726-3475) and after only a 2 minute wait, a native English speaker answered the call.  He walked me through some procedures to get the player in fail safe but none of them worked.   The customer service rep said that the 1.02.15 firmware offered very little improvement over 1.02.12A and recommends staying at 1.02.15 (too late to help me!).   The rep offered a RMA number but said it would be much quicker to return directly to Amazon (Sansa would take 4 - 6 weeks minimum).     I decided to return the player to Amazon.  Since I had a few questions I decided to call Amazon, rather than processing the return via the web site.  Finding their 800 number is not easy, and I had to Google "Amazon customer service" in order to get it (800 201-7575).  It took a lot of patience and punching in numbers to get through to a person.    When the rep finally answered, she was very nice and is sending out a replacement unit.  Unfortunately it will not arrive for five days (12/27), so I won't be able to enjoy the player over my Christmas break.  Quality issues can occur with any brand and I'm willing to give the E280 another shot.   Assuming no firmware issues with the replacement player, I believe that I'll be happy with the E280.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have the 80gb IPod, Iriver, and Samsung YP-K5 and this player is better then all of them combined in my opinion. The option of the expandable memory is what hooked me. They are going to come out with bigger and bigger for players and the microsd cards so why spend more on a bigger player when i just make a bigger player with more memory. As Soon as I got it I upgraded the firmware. I have the entire player filled with mp3s and videos and they all work flawlessly even from one song to the next. Even made a little mistake not relizing it. Plugged the player into the front with my external Hdd. External sucks a huge amount of power from the computer system. so it ddnt load the drivers. Called tech support and got a human within seconds and them telling me I made an Id10t error. plugged the player into the back and it started up within seconds.  Reason for the 4 stars is that it is a pain trying to make playlists for the thing.  My advice to anyone getting this player. Get it snag some extra cash get the 2gb microsd / transflash. And an External wall charger first thing. O and a screen protector.

<Title>Doesn't Work with Any Known Music Subscription Service
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned my e280 for about a week now and have come to the realization that the e280 is not compatible with any known music subscription service.  Even though the likes of Napster, Rhapsody and Yahoo Music declare that any of the e200 series players work with their services, it does not.  This defeats the very reason why I picked the e280, to hold a lot of subscription music for my trips to the gym.  The player seems to work okay for your own MP3 music, but don't even consider this lemon for holding anything more than that.

<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>i got a refurb for less than half retail and the only difference is that engraved on the back it says "refurb." the quality, battery life, ease of scanning through the menu, and the drag and drop makes the sansa more appealing than ipods. the video quality is as good as you can expect from a screen that size. light weight, but i'd get one of the clear, adhesive screen covers and silicone cases to protect it

<Title>Sansa Rules
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Sansa e series player is the best value.  It sounds great, and is easy to use.  Best of all you can kiss i-tunes goodbye.  We have a couple of these and love them.  The expandability through the micro SD slot is neat, but slows down boot time.  I have a sweet set of speakers that I also use with this that make it great on the deck and outdoors.  Excellent choice.

<Title>Very pleased so far
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have only recently started using the e280 but so far am really enjoying it.  The disk that came with it was very easy to use as far as installing the software and the manual that came on it is very user friendly and had everything I needed to get started.  The only problems I have run into so far with this player is that every time I connect it to the computer to load music windows media player begins trying to synchronize with it.  The first time I did this I was excited as I watched the percentage of the synchronization process until I later turned on the player and saw what this dirty filthy media player had done.  It mucked the whole thing up due to media player being a bigot of certain files.  The other problem I had was getting the media into the player at first but after taking a second look at the manual, which fully explained my problem and solved it for me I have not had a single problem.  I highly recommend this player.  It has its shortcomings just like other players, inadequate headphones and the like but if you buy a moderately priced accessory package you will be more then happy.  I like it compared to the ipod.  I got mine at a very good price and don't have to worry with itunes or any of the problems some of my fiends face.  Loading music is simply as easy as dragging and dropping files.

<Title>Packaging and durability
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received the item promptly but I do have a huge complaint. I did not received it as I have received other fragile items from Amazon. They usually pack these things in boxes with enough protection so they don't get damaged on the way. Well, I got this one in a padded envelope!!! That is not enough people! I received the Travel Kit for the Sansa better packed THAN the Sansa, with the box and the little inflated plastic bags inside for extra protection. I ordered this MP3 for my brother to replace one I had already bought also from Amazon. I wanted to try the " wear and tear theory" that the SanDisk company told me about the little Sansa. I want to see if this Sansa also cracks and breaks as the previous one. The company told me it was a wear and tear issue and the warranty didn't cover that (this was after only six months of use). So far so good regarding that issue. The little Sansa has no problem in performing its job. My brother just loves it because he says he doesn't have to be fidgeting around with file conversions. He just plugs it in and the Sansa transfer everything he has in his library. One complain, though is that he says that the headphones break easily from the cord. Other than that the Sansa delivers what it claims. We like the product, it is just the problem with the case. People had told us that we dropped it and that's why it broke but I keep telling them, "no, we did not drop it, it just happened." And that's where the mystery remains.  Anyways, I'll see how this one does and I'll let you know, especially after the packaging issue. So, I would say that the Sansa's performance deserve a 5 stars rating, the durability 1 star and the packaging 0, if there was that option.

<Title>Outstanding!
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have never cared for Ipods and their proprietary music software, preferring instead DRM free MP3's.  I have had this unit for around 8 months and have been very pleased with it.  The sound is great, it looks good, and works with DRM music when I need it to.  Now that Amazon offers DRM free mp3 files, I like it even better.  I would highly recommend this, and leave the sheep to worship Apple and the Ipod.  Don't assume because everyone has an Ipod that it must be the best product.

<Title>Better Than My iPod - Waaaaa!
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My husband just received his Sansa e280 about a month ago.  He's in love with it.  I jumped in and had bought an 8GB iPod 3rd Gen Nano instead.  Now I'm left to make mocking faces at him when he tells me how great his new gadget is!  A few things I am quite impressed with would be the expandable memory (you can add a SD card to increase memory for music, videos, photos, etc.), the self-replaceable battery (as easy as a new $20 battery instead of sending it to Apple for replacement at upwards of $60), the nifty accessories that come with it (screen wipe and soft case), the fact that he can also listen to FM radio, and the capability to record verbal notes with the audio recorder.  So, in short, I'm peeved.  I fell into the "fad" instead of getting something far better and now I get to have it rubbed in my face a whole lot.  :)  Save yourself the iPod heartache and pick this one up instead.

<Content>OK, I bought my E280 at the end of 2006 and it's been running daily ever since!  When I got my Sansa E280 I found a program from BakMyTunes called saCaster ($14.95 and worth twice as much!) that manages my music, lets me create and manage all the playlists I want, backs up and restores the media files and allows me to subscribe to and manage Podcasts directly.   I now have a Sansa View and I still keep my E280 synced, charged and stored on my laptop bag for times my I forget my View.  The really nice feathre the E280 has ove the View is it can be put into the MSC mode and it stays there.

<Title>Good product and great price
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had an Ipod nano for about one year before i lost it, and when I was looking around for a replacement, I found the Sansa had so many more features, and for around the same price. I've been pretty satisfied with it, the sound is good and I love the fact that it has a recorder, being a songwriter, that comes in handy when i get ideas and dont have a pad of paper handy. And unlike the Ipod, this actually comes with INSTRUCTIONS!! Overall, I'm satisfied with it, but one thing I would change is the fact that it comes with 20 pre-loaded songs that cannot be deleted-kinda annoying,but i just skip past them. Plus, Amazon has, by-far, the lowest price for the 8G.

<Title>Don't buy
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought two of the Sansa e280 players for Christmas 2007. My player is working fine for now but my son's player has gone into "white screen" mode and I have not been able to find a solution on the SanDisk site or on the Internet. When I contacted Amazon customer service by email they refused to accept the defective unit back because it is beyond "the 30 day" limit. A call to the Amazon service rep was a bit more helpful. The rep was very pleasant and connected me via conference call to a SanDisk technician. The technician could not solve the problem of the "white screen" either. He told me to email my Amazon invoice to SanDisk Support. I am still waiting for a reply. Hopefully, this story will have a happy ending. In the meantime, my recommendation would be to find another player until SanDisk can fix this problem and the problems related by other owners.

<Title>Wouldn't recommend buying the e-series

<Content>I actually have the e260, but I think this has the same issues.  1. Controls are difficult and wheel is breaking down already 2. Has no sleep function like the m-series. 3. Has no bookmarking for audiobooks or video. 4. Difficult to fast forward/reverse through without accidentally going to the very end/start. 5. Difficult to sync properly. 6. Can't remove some old files, no matter what method I've tried.  Sleek body design, thin and small.  Great to be able to expand the memory with the micro-sd. But, the newer series has a new control pad.  You might want to consider that instead.

<Title>Really Nice MP3
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just picked this unit up about 3 weeks ago.  I really like the bright screen, easy to follow menus and great sound. With so many features it is hard to say anything bad about this unit. It fits great in your hand, around your neck with the provided lanyard or in your pocket.  This item has many accesories to choose from and the fact that it is 8GB it has a ton of room for your music library as well as photos and videos.  The FM radio is a nice feature and the fact that you can use it as a voice recorder comes in handy when attending lectures or meetings. The mechanical wheel to navigate around the machine feels reliable and is sensitive enough to move around the menus. All in all I give this unit 5 stars.  Pros: Well built, bright screen, FM radio, voice recorder and photo viewer.  Cons: Price appears to be going up, however if you search around the web you can find this for around $125.00

<Title>Good player but the firmware was buggy
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The player came with old firmware and buggy media converter. It didn't have the option for selecting the USB mode and the media converter couldn't detect the player. So there was no way of copying video to the player.   I had to spend more than 2 hours researching on the internet to find ways to upgrade the firmware (the sansa firmware updater didn't work either). The earphones are pathetic, you are better-of getting a new one.   Other than these issues, its a good player, good value for money. Audio/video quality is very good.

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this Sansa to replace my truly wretched Philips GoGear MP3 player. My lord that Philips sucked, not that it's germane (or Tito) to this review.  But all that misery is behind me now because this Sansa player is awesome, especially with the Rhapsody music service.  No software glitches, very pretty, sturdy and lots of nice accessories.  The GoGear is dead to me.  Of course battery life is never close to what is advertised for any MP3 player, but this one actually will give you 12 to 15 hours of playtime even if you fiddle with it a lot and have the backlight on bright.  I suppose if you set it to play a 20-hour playlist and never turned on the backlight you might get the the full 20 hours they advertise.  So far, I have had no issues with this player, and I like the size, look, feel and features.

<Content>Santa Claus brought this for Christmas 2008.  I have loaded it from my PC, synced it with Ruckus music service, and jacked it into my car's 'Aux' slot WITHOUT OPENING THE MANUAL.  The little slot on the side is the greatest feature of this MP3 player.  Sandisk is a leading developer of miniaturized flash memory and the inclusion of a 'Micro SD' slot on the side of the E280 makes it INFINITELY EXPANDABLE.  As I write, an 8MB Micro SD module costs $53, and I have little doubt that a 64MB Micro SD module will someday be developed.

<Title>Excellent mp3 player for your money!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>At the end of last year, I was looking into purchasing an MP3 player.  I did a lot of research into them and found that there were not many contenders that shine above all the rest.  The two choices that I was left with ultimately were the Apple iPod and SanDisk Sansa.  I purchased this item about 3 months ago and I must say that I could not be happier.  I use it every day and no other words could help describe it except perfection.  SanDisk truly thought of everything when designing this product.  It has a beautiful sleek exterior that not only is very attractive, but also very durable at the same time.  Many of my friends who have purchased and iPod complain about the touch-sensitive wheel and after a while certain buttons and functions cease to work from continued use.  The construction of SanDisk Sansa far exceeds that of the iPod in that nothing is touch-sensitive and every function has its own button or wheel.  I expect that my Sansa will outlive any iPod on the market!  The storage capabilities of the SanDisk Sansa MP3 players are perfect for those people who do not wish to house their entire music collection.  This item is so easy to move music back and forth onto the computer and my favorite aspect of all is that I do not need to use an additional program such as iTunes to manage my music; this really outshines iPod for this sole reason.  The Sansa works very much like a USB flash drive and moving files is a cinch!  There are so many options the user has in regards to cataloging the saved music and I actually love the way all of it is displayed with beautiful, full-color menus that are far more aesthetically pleasing than the menus of the iPod.  The user has many options to supplement this MP3 player with accessories.  Although the product line is not that of the iPod line, every accessory anyone would want is available.  You will not be able to find the pastel or neon colors that many of the accessories for iPod feature, but rather, all of the accessories complement the sleek, contemporary design of the Sansa; most are either black or silver and some even have blue LEDs to match those found on the wheel of the player itself!  I love the fact that I got a product that far exceeds that of the iPod for a fraction of the price!  I am very happy with my decision to go with the SanDisk Sansa and know that it will be with me for years to come!  If you are looking into purchasing an MP3 player that will give you everything if not more than what an iPod can, I highly recommend this product as your choice!  Its durability and flexibility puts it in a class above all the rest!  You will not be disappointed.

<Content>die hard apple fans won't admit it, but this is a better deal over the nano.  The FM tuner is very clear, I up't it to 9 gigs with a microSD, and the only way I would give an Mp3 player 5 stars would be if they came with decent earbuds (shures,etc.) Some complain about the button placement but if Sandisk would have made it look like exactly like a nano they would have ran into some lawsuits. The scroll wheel is plastic (rubber would've been a little better) but it doesn't snag and works perfect. Highly recommend.

<Title>Good value and a legitimate alternative to iPod Nano
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you are just getting your first MP3 player or if you don't already own a bunch of music from iTunes, you really should give the Sansa e200 series a look.  Besides giving you a lot of storage for the money, its user interface is pretty good and intuitive.  It works with a lot of different music stores.  I like Rhapsody, and I have had no problems so far.  My complaints are small.  I think the thumbwheel feels cheap and loose, although it works without any problems.  The play, menu, prev, and next buttons are small.  The sound quality is good if you substitute the included earbuds with a decent set of headphones.    One extra little feature you get over the market leader is video playback.  I used multiple formats with some fairly lengthy clips and had no problem.  The FM Radio gets good reception, but the sound quality is so-so.  The unit displays photos well.  It would be nice if the converter would let you reorient the photo (landscape vs. portrait), but that is minor.  While this player is heavier than the Nano, it is still very light and is not noticeable in your pocket.   It was nice to be able to plug this Plays For Sure device into an XP machine and have the computer recognize it without the need for loading any drivers.  (You do need to load some software for video playback and photos).  The user replaceable battery rounds out a very nice package.  Battery life is long  I would definitely buy one again.

<Content>Last year I bought an iPod Nano and I thought it was the greatest MP3 player there was, for this year i recieved a 8 GB Sansa and it is so much better than the iPod Nano 1.)It is a lot cheaper the the Nano.  Why would you pay $250 for a 8GB Nano when you can get the same thing for a lot less? 2.)The radio is something the Nano doesn't have. 3.)Voice recording, 4.)After about a month, the back and the screen of the Nano was very scratched up. The iPod Nano is a great MP3 player, but don't waste money on that when you can get the cheaper and more efficient Sansa

<Title>Good features but hard to use and not well supported
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it for its video and photo features, in addition to its non-proprietary music formats. All are there and that's good.  I booted it up and charged it, which took about 6 hrs (I later found out charging depends on which USB port you use). Then I tried to update the firmware, which failed repeatedly. It also disconnected all the time when I tried to copy files to it. I called support, which took over 30 min to have a live person. It turned out I shouldn't be using the USB port from the monitor. Instead, one should be using the ones directly off the computer. No other USB devices had this problem.  Now it comes to copying files, videos and photo. It's soooo inconvenient! You have to use "Sansa Media Converter", which doesn't show what you have on the device and you have to type in the folder name, instead of browsing what's on the device. Every time you want to see what's already on the device, you'd have to unplug the cable and browse on the device. For photos, it only shows in Portrait. If you want to show Landscape, you'd have to convert the photo BEFORE storing on the device.  Video playback is not reliable (with the latest firmware 1.02.15). For the same pieces, it sometimes plays fine but causes hanging & reboots of the device other times. Half of the pieces I copied to the device hiss at words with "s". The hiss is apparently related to conversion from MPEG (.mpg) to QuickTime Movie (.mov), using Sansa Media Converter. I copied the converted files back to my PC and they had the same hiss using QuickTime player or iTune. No conversions required with MP3 files and no problems there.  All in all, it feels like a device lack of basic professional software support as expected these days. As a result, while I bought it for its video & photo features, I might end up using it mostly for MP3 playing, which is quite good. It's twice as thick and heavy as a Nano. I assume it's because of all the great features (video, etc) that are hard to use & unreliable. Too bad.

<Title>I've never owned an iPod
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just so you know in advance, I've never owned an iPod and won't be comparing the Sansa to one.  I purchased the e280 as a Christmas present for myself.  I plan to use it for mp3 songs and occasionally listen to the radio.  8 Gigs is plenty of space for me.  It's equivalent to over 11 CDRs of data.  I also like the smooth, professional look of the Sansa.  After receiving it, I'm very happy.  I immediately put it in a silicone protective case, and applied a 'stick-on' screen protector.  So, I'm not very worried about scratches.  The navigation screens are not only practical, but also beautiful to look at.  It interfaces well with my Windows XP computer.  I like the fact that I can 'drag-n-drop' songs onto the device.  It has a record button on the side, so you can start recording voice or radio anytime without hassle.  It's so easy to use.  You could hand it to almost anyone over the age of 5, and they'd figure it out within a minute.  It has a 'hold' switch to prevent accidental song skipping when it's in your pocket.  There are some things I would change if I could: I would add an FM transmitter, so I could play music in other people's cars without bringing any wires or accessories along.  I would make the buttons a little easier to push (their small size relative to the protruding navigation wheel is slightly cumbersome).  When playing a song, the large button in the middle does nothing.  The play/pause button is one of the outer buttons, located above the nav wheel.  I would consider also making the center button perform the 'play/pause' function.  Basically, it works as well as I expected and does everything I thought it would.  I highly recommend the Sansa e280.

<Title>Falls short from being a great MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this from Amazon.com. It came loaded with the latest firmware. I made sure also to install the "Sansa Updater" utility and now everytime plug it to the computer, it goes to cyberspace to find a newer firmware if available. OK, with the latest software, I now can say that there are still shortcomings on this player.  Sound quality: reproduction of high quality MP3 files is very good. In fact, the sound is warm and very balanced. Very nice. Unfortunately, during quiet passages or in between tracks, I can hear static noise. My Sansa c200 is completely quiet. The e280 is noisy in silent or quiet passages of music. I notice this problem more when I use a high end headphone like an etymotic er4b or sennheiser HD25. With regular earbuds, the floor noise is not so noticeable.  MP3 compatibility troubles: yes, even though my Sansa c200 plays all of my MP3s, the e280 picks and chooses. On certain MP3s, the e280 will not play a sound and then proceed to freeze.  Video playback and control response: video playback is very good. I was afraid I would not be able to read my anime subtitles, but this was no problem at all. The problem is that when Sansa plays a video, it seems as though the CPU gets overloaded and controls respond with a lag. It is pretty annoying when trying to FF or RW or stop playback and the e280 takes its time.  Video converter: it takes your mpeg, avi, and wmv files and converts them to quicktime MOV files. Problem is that the converted files are often bigger than the source files (often by a factor close to 2). One would think that after conversion, the file should be smaller since the Sansa screen is small and does not require full resolution.  FM recording: MONO, that's right, it is all mono. I was expecting the e280 to record in stereo. Recording sound quality itself is also not very impressive, with rolled highs and lows. Recordings sound very lo fi. Voice recordings sound very lo fi as well.  I still like it, but it if I had a choice today between the Sansa e280 and Zen 8GB, I would take the Zen 8GB.

<Content>MP3 player purchased as a gift. Package did not contain installation disk or lanyard. Player requires special software to load pictures. Music downloaded using Windows Media Player. Difficult to get the Sync operation to correctly work or play lists loaded. Operating player easy except for the back button (for a right handed person). Button too small and your thumb has to reach over the wheel in the center. FM radio works well. Amazon service and availability great.

<Title>Good product.  Customer service is not helpul!
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The product came shipped with instructions for a earlier model, the e200.  By comparing the e 200's insructions with my e280, they clearly don't have the same interface.  The e280 was supposed to come with a driver as well(according to the packaging and product description) but did not.  The device is not self-explanatory for this first time mp3 player's owner.  I contacted customer service twice with my issues and both times they directed me to their website for said instructions and driver.  Neither were available for this particular model however.  In fact the website's link for the e280's instructions took me to the instructions for the e200, the same set of instructions included in the packaging.  It was only after consulting several forums (unrelated to Sandisk) that I received the help I needed to get my player running properly.  Nice product but lousy customer service.  Thanks forums.

<Title>Great mp3 player at a low price.
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the SanDisk Sansa as a Christmas gift for my 17 year old son.  He is really enjoying it.  He says that the size is ideal and the sound quality is excellent.  8GB seems to be enough for his music collection. He formerly had a Creative Jukebox which no longer works.  Compared to the Sansa, the Creative was much larger and the display was difficult to read.  It also cost about twice as much as the SanDisk.

<Title>Great Tiny Gadget
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This gadget really performs great!  I got this a week ago and have used  or "ABUSED" it as if I had this for a month.  Just right off the box, I plugged it to my laptop for charging and at the same time load with music, photos, and videos.  I uploaded tons of family pictures and tons of video clips (of about 30 to 40MB each), synchronized it with my laptop's Windows Media Player 11, trasferred and deleted songs, uploaded and deleted videos, recorded voice messages, tried the FM tuner and  used the pre-set function to mark my favorite stations - ALL WITHOUT FLAWS!!!  Battery life is also longer than I expected for this small gadget.  The navigation buttons are not the best compared to the other mp3 player I used before. They are just fine (not the best but it work).   One thing I have not tried is to upgrade firmware, which I think I will not do not unless it is really necessary. For now, I do not see any reason to do that because the device is performing excellently. I don't have a music subscription too, and I don't have plan on having one.  I travel frequently and now with Sansa E280 with me, I have enough music, videos, and photos that will keep me busy during my flights to South America and my trans-Pacific (13-hour) flights.  I never used an IPOD before so I cannot compare it with that device.  I highly recommend this gadget.

Nice metal back, feels really solid.  Nice, loud, volume!  Interface is easy to use and buttons are great!  Great price for the size, like the fact of adding up to 2GB with microSD.  I already had a 1GB microSD card so now it is actually a 9GB player!  Overall a great purchase!

<Content>This Sansa requires Windows XP - it doesn't work with the Windows 2000 operating system.  And if you want to use it with Rhapsody to go you should buy the special e280 Rhapsody or e280R version which Amazon doesn't seem to carry.  You can find it at Best Buy, though.  I'm returning this one.

<Title>Elegant MP3 player which works great with Rhapsody
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa e280 is a stylish product that does exactly what it promises. I did not want to buy an iPod because I consider them to be overpriced and do not like Apple's monopolistic ambitions. The Sansa is a perfect alternative. It is relatively easy to use, compact, esthetically pleasing and moderately priced (at least here on Amazon).  Moreover it works with Rhapsody To Go which I consider to be the best way to access digital music, since you rent it for a small monthly fee, instead of paying a buck to download a single song. Why pay to fill up your hard drive with songs when you can just access them from a remote server whenever you want and for a lot less money?  I have long been a user of Rhapsody on my home stereo which gives me access to millions of songs for a modest fixed monthly price.  Up until now when I wanted to take music with me I would purchase songs or albums for a dollar or 10 dollars respectively and then transfer them to an SD card on my PDA or burn them on to Cd's to play on my car's MP3 player. This process always annoyed me because it was both expensive and time consuming.  Now, however, all I do is hook my Sansa up to my laptop and download nearly any song from the Rhapsody catalog onto the player. I can then listen to the songs on the Sansa or hook it up to my car stereo's auxiliary MP3 port and listen through the car stereo.  When I get tired of the songs on the player I just erase them and download something different without paying a penny extra just as I do on my stereo system at home.  The only time I have to pay a per item cost is if I wish to burn a song but I can't see any reason to do that unless I wish to give someone a gift.  Unlike what another reviewer says below, there is no need to buy the Rhapsody version of the player.  I have the generic version that Amazon sells and it works flawlessly with Rhapsody.  The Rhapsody version is more expensive and comes preloaded with songs most of which you probably don't want. One note about using Rhapsody To Go with the Sansa which I initially found a bit confusing (Rhapsody is a good product but Real often rushes software to market before it's quite finished leaving the user frustrated while they work the bugs out and, finally, Real has bad customer service with poorly trained service personal with questionable English skills. I really think that if they fixed this area of their business they'd be as successful as Apple and the iPod):  Rhapsody says that with Rhapsody To Go you can transfer nearly any subscription track to your Sansa, which is true, but first you have to DOWNLOAD the track to your PC before you can transfer it to the Sansa. It would be nice if you could just drag and drop from the Rhapsody catalog directly to the Sansa icon, (which I could do with Rhapsody 3.1, but cannot with Rhapsody 4.0); unfortunately it's now a two-step process in which you download to your PC first and then drag and drop to the Sansa.   The disadvantage of this is that you start filling up your computer's hard drive with songs that you can already stream just so you can put them on the Sansa E280.  I usually delete the downloads from my hard drive after I've transferred them to the Sansa, particularly when I'm using my laptop which has a smaller hard drive than my desktop machines.   (The new wireless Sansa should connect directly to the Rhapsody service allowing you to access the entire 3 million song catalog directly anytime you have a wireless connection and without the need of a PC).  All in all the Sansa is a very good product, particularly in conjunction with the Rhapsody To Go service. I like that fact that it has an FM radio and a voice recorder.  The photo and video players work fine although I don't use those features much because who wants to view images or video on a 2 inch screen? I think that's one of those things that people do just because it's cool that you CAN do it. But it's not comfortable, so I'll watch video on my big screen TV if I'm at home or my laptop if I'm traveling.

<Title>Great MP3 Player - Minor Problems
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just received my Sansa e280 a few days ago, was downloading music to it in minutes without loading anything onto my computer. It's so easy to use and I can't hardly put it down!  One problem I have had is when I try to rate a song it locks up.  It's done it 3 out of 4 times I've tried it. Another time the player got stuck between music files and showed half of one song and the other half of another.  I had to shut it down and reboot.  So mine has had an issue or two.  I used the disk that came with it to load the photo/video converter - it was simple. And you can select what you want to download from the disk.  I have already loaded over 1,400 songs and several pictures and one home video and still have 2.4 GB left.  My kids have the smaller version sandisk and are now wanting the e280 too.  No more lugging those CD's around!!

<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My daughter bought her dad this sandisk for Christmas. First of all I have to say that Amazon is awsome, our item was lost in the mail due to a severe storm here in CO. and it was replaced in no time at all.   I own the 4gb and it's perfect for me and my husband had an ipod but he likes this so much better. The controls are so easy to use. It's so easy to download songs,pictures and videos. This has replaced the satellite radio in our cars. We love the screen and it's colors. The fm tuner is a big plus and we love the fact that we can record little reminders for ourselves. I highly recommend the sandisk and Amazon has the best price on the 8gb.

Plus it gives the choice of using many online music store, displays pictures, and plays videos.  Although the screen is small for videos, but it least it is capable.  The only downer is the headphones, but it seems all these units come with poor ones.  I bought a set of $20 buds ("JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Buds for iPod (Black)") along with this , and they work better and aren't painful to wear.
