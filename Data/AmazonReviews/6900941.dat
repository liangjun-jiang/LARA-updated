<Title>Didn't work
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I could not get the songs to download to the MP3 player.  I followed the instructions word for word and it would not work.  The system froze and when I unplugged it from the USB cable it stopped working all together.  I attempted to contact Coby's customer service but you can not get through on their phone lines.  I finally emailed their technical center and received a generic response.  I continued to question them about the problems with connecting and downloading and COBY instructed me to return these to Amazon?!?!?!?!

<Title>It works.....
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for my Girlfriend to use at work.  I gave it two stars because it's functional, and it looks good (she really likes it).  Memory expansion is a plus.  FM works fine, decent reception.  The third star is because its relatively simple to use/figure out.  Documentation is minimal, transfer connection was picky using the cable.  Memory card works fine (Corsair 512mb), and is fairly straight forward....almost.  Would have gotten more stars if not for:   Battery indicator flashes empty at about 2 hours use...but will run for another 10-12 hours.   Files are stored in 4 unnamed folders under the menu, different for recordings, voice memos, files on the player, and files on the card, but with no labels, its certainly not straight forward.   Headphones that come with it are garbage...the $3.99 gas station special is just as good/better.    If it could handle a larger memory card (1-2GB) that would earn a star alone....says it only supports up to 768 total (untested by me).   Coby support (website) is terrible.  But hey, what do you expect for $35?

<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a novice, I needed some help figuring out how to load onto a data card instead of to the memory, the directions were not clear about how to do that. The single AAA battery only lasted the length of 4 mp3 cd's. On the plus side, it is light and easy to read and I love the data card option to take extra music and audio books with me. It's a keeper at a great price for someone like me.

<Content>Priced right, works fine.  I'm not happy with the usb connection, it broke in the first week, so all of my music is on the 1 gig sd card I put in.  Battery lasts maybe 5 hours.

<Title>doesn't work
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I put it because one of the reviews here said the player came with a CD that had the Windows 98 driver. Well it didn't. And the driver at Coby's web site doesn't work. I installed it but Windows reports no driver. Fortunantly I bought it locally and can return it. But I'm agrreivated. Don't lie in reviews.

<Title>Impressed judging by its cost.
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got the COBY MP-C741 and have used it for a couple of days and I must say that I am impressed by it considering its price.  The package includes the player, headphones, a battery, the manual, a USB to mini USB adapter cable and a mini CD which includes its drivers. It is plug and play in Windows ME/2000/XP and Mac OS X so no drivers are needed, the included mini CD only has the drivers needed for Windows 98.  It has 256MB of integrated flash memory which can store up to 60 songs (at 4 minutes per song) at 128kbps and also plays WMA files (doubles the song capacity at 64kbps). It has an integrated mini USB 2.0 connection for fast downloads, it also supports creating folders as well as drag and drop. It also has a SD/MMC card slot in the battery cover for expanding its memory capacity to up to 768MB by using 512MB SD/MMC cards which can be swapped or changed to add more music.  It also features a navigation option to navigate and find files, the LCD is screen is backlit and can be programmed to display ID tags, file info or lyrics if available on the file. It also has some preset equalizer settings to improve the sound coming out of the player.  It can also function as a portable storage unit and it is not necessary to have a battery installed on it for using this function since it will feed on the USB port allowing you to take large files by putting them either on the integrated flash RAM or an installed SD/MMC card. Since it supports SD/MMC cards it can also be used as a portable card reader as well.  It lasted a whole two days with the included alcaline battery. It runs on a single AAA battery and you can also use AAA rechargeable batteries. The included heaphones while not the greatest they do a good job, you can also connect your own headphones to it if you wish since it has a standard headphone port.  It also has an integrated FM radio with good reception and also lets you store preset stations. The recording function allows to either record from radio or the integrated microphone, the recorded sound is quite clear (when using the medium or better settings) and can be reproduced by either the MP3 player or a computer (uses IMA-ADCPM encoding) and can store up to 16 hours of recorded sound using the best settings in the integrated flash memory.  The case is made of plastic so it has normal resistance and could be prone to scratches (no paint comes off) if not treated properly so I recommend that you get a carrying bag or case for it to keep at its best.  So far, I have no complains about this player or find any cons to its functionality.  Of course, there are a whole lot more options out there when it comes to MP3 players and it all depends on your needs for an MP3 player, the advantage of flash based drives is that they don't skip if moved around constantly (for example while jogging) or have a hard drive that could go bye-bye if dropped.  If you do not need to look at videos or pictures on your player or need to carry several gigabytes of music around, don't like MP3/WMA formats or are pretty annoyed by minuscule scratches (when maltreated) or that it won't make you a latte capuccino, this player is a viable choice.  With MP3/WMA playing capabilities, voice/FM radio recording, FM radio, plug-and-play, drag and drop, mass storage and SD/MMC card reading/memory expansion capabilities you will be hard pressed to find a device that will do all of this while costing around [...].  Hope this is helpful.

<Title>A piece of junk.
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this as a x-mas gift and all I can say is that the previous reviewer must be an employee. It is simple enough to download songs and it comes with all the accesories needed. But it freezes on every song, so if I let a song play all the way through I have to take the battery out.  I read the manual and thought this was due to the program I was using. I called the company and was on hold for one hour. When I got through the tech started reading the manual to me. He said either it was defective or I was using files that were protected (illegal download). Basically I think that this player might be ok as long as you are not using an online serice to fill it such as napster or rhapsody. But it is worthless if you are. Anyway I am going to try to unload this thing and spend a little bit more money and get something that works.

<Title>Good, but only for the basics
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this for myself for my birthday last year. I bought it for $70 at a store, it was my first mp3 player. It's a cute little gadget, tiny, easy to hold but it feels cheap. This mp3 is only good for people who havent had one already. It's perfect for children because it's so easy to use. It can hold a decent amount of songs but if youre a music pro this is not your machine. You can chage the equalizer, randomize and the recording capabilities are pretty decent. You need better headphones that the ones it comes with though because those dont go too high. Good machine by only for the basics.

<Title>Coby mp c741 mp3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought a coby c741 mp3 player and it works beautifully!  The device was instantly recognized by my computer (win xp) and I was able to put music on it very easily.  I previously owned an Iomega hip-zip mp3 player (which kept overheating), and a Sony minidisc player (the software that controlled the minidisk was a nightmare). In comparison, this Coby mp3 player is Much easier to use.  It has superior battery life (30 hrs) to many of the other mp3 players that i have researched. The screen is very easy to read and the FM tuner seems to work well aslo.  The small size of the control button on the front and the cheaper construction of the plastic shell arent a big problem. Overall a geat little player!

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Tue May 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was just looking for something to listen to music to while I worked out.  This player is very basic, but for the money does exactl what it says.  It holds enough songs to get me through a 2 1/2 hour routine.  Sounds pretty good and is very easy to work.  Couple of drawbacks:  The headphones that come with it has a very short cord and the battery runs down pretty fast (usually replace it about once a week, so I guess it can run for about 10 hours total before it needs a new battery).  Other than that it looks pretty cool and is very small (fits in my pocket while I walk around).

<Title>Bought one, won't work
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Coby MP-C741 I bought won't work.  Sometimes it plays one song o.k., but when it switches to the next song, it always switches to fast forward mode, and then there is no sound.  If I fast backward the song, it starts playing, only to start the next song in fast forward mode.    Also it has started just freezing up at after 12 minutes ....   I'm very disapointed with this product.

<Title>Bad bad bad. Waste of time and money
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If I could give this device a review of less than one star I would. An MP3 player is nothing more than a usb memory stick with a player wrapped around it. It should just work. However I've run into the following while attempting to set it up.  1. Unrecognized device. Uninstall USB device and try again... 2. Device malfunctioned. Uninstall broken device from device manager and try again. 3. Recognized device but says there are two removable disks that are both zero bytes in size. 4. Links in tech support page all give 404 errors 5. Device driver download from coby, only downloads a font file. No driver.  It's too late in the evening to call support, it was a christmas gift for my son from out of state. No reciept, can't return.  It might make a good item to throw at the neighbors cats when they get in my yard.  Other companies have figured out how to make a portable music player "just work" with my computer, why can't these guys?  My time is much more valuable than the time I spent to not get it working.

<Title>Batteries, batteries, and more batteries
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excellent product, hence the four stars.  However, if you want to play it a lot, you must must must invest in batteries galore.  The battery life is ridiculously low.  The sound quality is nice enough.  The earphones are terribly large and will hurt your ears, however, all of the earphones, including the Sony earphones I purchased appear to be large to me.
