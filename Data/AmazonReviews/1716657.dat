<Product Name>Coby PMP-3522 20 GB Portable Media Player with Touchscreen Interface
<Title>Love the Coby brand and this player

<Content>The only thing that bugs me is there is really no "how to" or support for the units.  Once you figure it out, look out!,  they are better then the ipod or zune.  It's just the learning curve that bugs me.    I also have a Coby 20G MP3 player that I have dropped several times and the case is the only thing holding it together as the screws broke off when I dropped it on the cement floor and it works like a charm.  LOVE IT!  Thanks.
