<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>What nobody has mentioned yet ... SOUND!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This isn't going to be long and boring because everything good/bad has been said so far. Good - size, flash memory, photo ability, etc..  Bad - I got black and it scratches VERY easily! I only had it 2 days and from carrying it in my pocket, the front looks very scratched like I had it a few years already.  Also, don't know why they put the headphone jack on the bottom ... and so far there's no belt clip for this.  Only a lanyard headphone or an armband.  I need a belt clip for the gym.  Anyway, the sound ...  I only listen to my players CRANKED!  Every MP3 player I've ever bought, including my previous 3 ipods, I listen to at full volume.  So, just to test, I got my 6 gb ipod mini and put it side by side with my new Nano.  I started "Walk" by Pantera simultaneously on both players and took my best pair of headphones going back and forth from one player to the other.  Well, the new Nano BLEW AWAY my 6 gb ipod!  Noticeably louder, deeper bass, and my favorite, much sharper and higher treble!  I hate to admit it, but it makes my 6 gb mini sound like crap. (Hello ebay!) I can't comment on the battery life yet at that volume, but I'm sure it will be much shorter than the 14 hours they say.  But if you buy this player for no other reason ... buy it for the SOUND!

<Title>I love it
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my iPod Nano for about a week now and I really like it.  My first impression of it was how small it was.  Small enough but not to small, they struck a good balance with the Nano.    The screen is a very resolution so it can show more information than the larger screen on the mini, not to mention that it's also in color.  The sound quality is great and it has a very good range of volume levels.  This player is another good one from Apple and an improvement over the mini.  My only problem I have with Nano is that any finger prints shows up on the black surface and the shiny metal back.  The black surface is very easy to scratch. But overall a great product.

<Title>Simply Brilliant
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my nano for a week and a half now and am loving it.  It is so tiny that I can carry it in my wallet - but it is still sized well to hold comfortably in the hand.  The sound quality and output is excelent.  The black does show fingerprints and scratches easily, but it just looks way to cool.  It is comfortable to use and the screen (though slightly smaller than the other ipods) is very crisp and easy to read.  Navigation with the clickwheel is just as easy as the larger ipods.  And I actually like the headphone port on the bottom better than on top (and I don't use a lanyard) - it just makes more sense-it takes some getting use to, but once you do, you'll love it just as much as you like everything else about the Nano.  This thing is super durable and you don't need to worry about breaking it.  Some complain about the price, but really, it is an excellent buy - you're paying for:  4gb of flash storage (the 1st flash player anywhere near that much storage), the tiny size, the color screen, and the flatout beauty of this thing.  No other player comes even close.  Just buy it!

<Title>Using I-Pod Nano with USB 1.1 Macs
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the nano from my local Fry's electronics.  4gig, black.  I'm using it with a 1Ghz Powerbook G4 15" 10/10/1000 ethernet, DVI, but NOT USB 2.0...  which poses a problem because the Nano does not support sync via firewire.(although it can be charged over firewire)  The lack of firewire, my only real complaint about the nano, and aside from that, there is very little to find fault in aside from an overly bright screen (see below).  I've overcome the lack of firewire compatability by upgrading my laptop to USB 2.0 through the purchase of a $24 USB 2.0 PCMCIA card from Fry's.  For about the same cost as what I would have had to pay for the firewire cable anyway (if it were useful for anything other than charging) I have a PCMCIA card that provides compatability in addition to fast USB for external hard disks, etc...  The mac (osx panther) recognized the card immediately, without the need for drivers, etc.  Sync was very very fast, transfering complete songs in less than 1 second per song in many cases.  FAST transfers.  Fry's had numerous models of cards, some with Firewire and USB 2.0, other's with just firewire, and still others with only USB.  I purchased the least expensive, USB 2.0 only card that, only on the back of the package in fine type did it mention macs... and it works almost perfectly.  (note unplug the card before closing the powerbook lid or it won't sleep, and won't wake up the monitor, forcing a restart... this is the only issue I've encountered)  Regarding the Nano.  Small, stupid small, almost too small...almost.  Click wheel works great, volume is powerful, songs are accessed immediatly with no delay (flash memory).  As there is no hard disk to be scrambled from impacts, it is able to take minor drops without issue.  And when it does fall, the thing is so light that it almost always falls softly.  Syncs are very very quick using USB 2.0.  (I frequently wipe all the songs and re-upload rather than poke through them when I want to make changes.  Uploading about 3 gigs of music takes around 30-40 seconds at most)  The unit is light weight enough that I often pick it up by the headphone cord with no fear of it unplugging and falling.  The stock earbuds sound great, but hurt my ears after extended listening.  I currently use some foam earbuds I already owned.  Others have no problems with the ear buds, so I think it's just dependant upon the shape of one's ears.  My only other complaint and I'm sure it can be overcome with a firmware upgrade, is that the white LED back light is blindingly bright at night.  When in the car using it, it actually almost hurts to look at it.  When the back light turns off, it does so by quickly fading out, so the capability to vary brightness is there, and needs to only have a menu option added to control it for low light use.  If I had to think up anything else wrong, I would say it the black moel shows fingerprints and smudges too easily. (but it looks sooo good in black)... but really, disregarding the lack of firewire which I'm sure would have added size, and since mose people already have USB 2.0 anyway could afford to be sacrificed... If the best complaints I can come up with are "a screen that's too bright", and "shows smudges", then this one is most certainly a winner.    -Jason

<Title>not perfect, but as good as you are gonna get for a while
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>style is everything as far as the ipod nano is concerned.  i went out and bought a 4gb black the day it came out, not knowing that it would be in such a short supply in later days.  after playing with it for a couple of weeks, i would say that it is the best mp3 player to date, all things considered.  yet, it is far from being perfect, and i don't ask for much.  i just want a recording feature, like a lot of the low end cheap mp3 players, but no ipod nano doesn't come with recording feature.  otherwise, ipod nano is the perfect companion to my 60gb ipod, which is getting heavier and bulkier by the day.

<Title>THE biggest revolution
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Steve Jobs said the nano wiould be the biggest revolution since the original iPod, he wasn't kidding. The nano is the most impressive thing I have ever held in my hands. I was really into this product from the start, but certain aspects of the player never hit me until I actually held it.  The day I got mine, my jaw droppped. How could something so small be an iPod? Well, after using mine, I know this is by far the best mp3 player I have ever seen.  I wont go into the specs, as other reviewers already have.   But I will state some things that are wrong with it.  First, I was somewhat disapointed to hear it was USB 2.0 only. My old iPod was firewire, and since I have a mac computer, I never really ever used 2.0. The time to load music was noticable. While takes my 3rd gen Ipod to load my entire library only about 5 minutes, it took my nano about 8-10 minutes to lload only 800 songs. Its not that big a deal, but still...  The other thing is not really that big a deal either, but it is something i found wierd about the player. The headphone jack is on the bottom, instead of on top like it had been for 4 years. I mean, its not the end of the world, I just find that choice very odd.  One other thing a lot of people have talked about was value. Yes, this little guy is somewhat of a rip off. Why not just pay $50 more, and get an iPod with 5 times the space? Again, it comes down to "cool" factor, something the Nano drips of.  However, these "flaws" would by no means make me change my mind on my purchase. This is still THE mp3 product on the market. I bought mine becuase I love apple stuff, and my old one was dying on me. Im glad I bought this thing.

<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great unit.  More memory than you could possibly need, plus the added bonus of picture viewing.  I've had this one since March 2006 with no technical issues, and I have heard that the new ones that come in different colors have problems so it's too bad they don't make this one anymore.  The menu is easy to navigate and finding the song you want is simple.  The do it yourself on-the-go playlist is great so you can change and add the songs you want to hear.  Great player, definitely buy a cheap wall charger and/or car charger for this because the color screen chews up the battery life.

<Title>What the shuffle should have been!
<Date>Sun Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is exactly what Apple should have been working on instead of the Shuffle.  I've purchased several Shuffles for myself and my family, and absolutely love them.  But, I have the same compliants as everyone else, no screen, small capacity, different accessories from other iPods, etc.  The nano addresses all of these concerns without sacrificing the sound quality that first drew to the Shuffle.  The nano's small size, vibrant color screen, standard iPod connector, long battery life, and large song capacity make it the most attractive option in the iPod line.  The lack of moving parts inside improve the sound quality, battery life, and durability of the device (it uses solid-state memory like the Shuffle, instead of a micro-disk like the larger iPods).  Additionally, the color screen, photo llbrary, and built-in Podcast support are welcome features.  The nano does suffer from the one drawback inherited from it's larger cousins - the device is beautiful, but the case tarnishes and scratches easily.  I'm looking forward to purchasing the iPod nano "tubes" to cover and protect my nano once Apple releases them.  Overall, the best technology value I've encountered in a long time.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute.  Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil.  In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle.   Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces.  Weight is another jaw-dropping figure.  The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.    Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable?  Don't be!  The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable.  Why?  The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player.  The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.    Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.  The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.  Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic.  It features a nice resolution, and color.  You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music.  There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.    Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.    Color - White is the traditional iPod color, but this black iPod nano is proving to be incredibly popular.  Just note that the black is more likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>I didn't think it was THAT small
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is the gutsy move by Apple to replace their bestselling iPod mini.  What will previous generation iPod and iPod mini owners think of the nano?  Pros:  * Flash memory, not hardrive based which means no moving parts and no skipping or momentary delays when selecting a new track  * Incredibly thin.  The commercials don't do it justice, you have to feel it to believe it  * Sexy new black option without including Bono worship  * Lots of new features, a world clock with all sorts of timezone, a screen lock to keep out iPod leeches, and a stopwatch.  * Lovely color screen  * Built tough, will survive all sorts of drops.  The exception is the scratching on the Lucite.  You most likely won't bend it sitting on it.  Cons:  * Shows scratches much more readily than the iPod mini's brushed steel look.   * Fairly expensive for the capacity.  2 gigs for $200 and 4 gigs for $250, a bit disappointing for those who were expecting a 6 gig flash release from Apple  * Screen is too small to show detail in pictures  * No firewire port  * No TV outlet for showing off pictures yet  * So thin you might leave it in your jeans... through the washer and dryer cycle.  I highly recommend buying the iPod nano, especially for iPod mini owners.  Its great for gym and travelling and other bumpy rides.  I also recommend getting a case for it so you don't get it all scratched up.

<Title>Sets a new bar for music players
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have always been a loyal creative customer till now. Apple has redefined the mp3 player space, with this release. A 4gb flash player for 250 dollars is a really good deal, considering other vendors currently sell a 1 GB flash player for 120 bucks. Samsung has provided a sweet deal to Apple, allowing them to price the player at such aggressive terms. The biggest surprise of this player is the nice lcd screen that comes with it. It is very sharp and very clear. Apple should update the ipod nano, to allow it to host video clips on it. Nano has an included solitaire game , that is very sharp and clear on the LCD screen. Nano will shake up this space, and will quickly become the defacto king of music player space. Though in the long run, there is no reason, why cell phones will not have 4 GB flash chips to hold the songs, video clips etc. I bought the black nano, which interestingly was shipped directly from shenzen, china. I recommend the white nano instead, as the black color shows the fingerprint imprints very easily. Highly recommended. Apple should have included a case with it, as it is so small, that U can lose it very easily.

<Title>VERY cool...but not for everyone
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 80% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.  ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $50, you can upgrade to a Photo that has 5x times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is--it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.  Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their petite size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300.  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>Apple iPod Nano Review
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this iPod nano 4GB Black on September 8th and I recieved it September 12th. I was expecting Apple not to discontinue the widely famous iPod mini but I guess they did. Rumors and speculations said that Apple was going to make a 8GB mini with a color screen but in the end they discontinued the line all together. The nano isn't perfect though. The gigabyte to price ratio is horrible and the battery life isn't that good. The 2GB nano is $99.50 per gigabyte while the 4GB nano is 62.25 per gigabyte. Much more than the iPod mini's. The battery life is rated at 14 hours. I got up to 16 to 17 hours which is good but my friends said their new iPod mini can get up to 23 hours! The design is sexy but, the smudges and scratches attract a second after you peel off the protective paper. The mini had a case that didn't deter any real scratches and smudges. You have to buy a case for this iPod while you didn't have to for the mini.  But, it's a fresh start with the iPod line and it's right now my personal favorite. 4GB holds around 1,000 songs, I have 939 songs (on various qualities, etc.). It comes with the iPod CD with iTunes 5 (the new one). iTunes 5 is nice cosmetically (Apple changed it a little bit) but, there is no major change. There are color choices with the nano: Black or White but black is a little bit better looking (but shows smudges and scratches more). The prices are $199.99 for 2GB (500 songs) and $249.99 for 4GB (1,000 songs). The screen lock is pretty cool I have to admit, I just set up my code and if someone tries to use my iPod, the iPod screen will be locked out. Another thing which is nice is the thickness. It's the smallest iPod in depth (.27") but it isn't the all around smallest iPod. The pictures are small but, this isn't a picture viewer to be honest with you. You should buy the accessory to put the pictures on our television instead. Another problem I have with this iPod is the accessories that come in the box. It just comes with the iPod nano, headphones, USB 2.0 cord, iPod CD, Manual, and a dock adapter. iPod has really been cutting back ever since they released the 4th Generation iPod but, atleast that came with FireWire while none of the iPod's now do. All together, this iPod is beautiful but if your a power user (like me) you will not like this so much. The iPod mini has some advantages over this one but, this iPod has advantages over the mini too. So, if you're getting a new iPod and you just have about 400-900 songs, this iPod will be perfect for you.

<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.   Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.   Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is the best value. It is only $50 more than the 2-gigabyte model, so you get twice as much storage, for only $50 more. Don't forget you can also backup important files to your iPod, so you may find some extra space valuable. The 4-gigaybtes is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color, and the white-colored iPod Nano will match many other Apple products. However, the black iPod nano is an intense and sleek finish, beautiful in person. It might show scratches and fingerprints more easily, but it looks so great that it may be the most popular color choice of this new player.   Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.   Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>Nano vs Mini - not bad tradeoff
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>BACKGROUND: i currently own: 4gig Nano, 30gig Photo, 512mb Shuffle... Use PC & Mac... Note, I am NOT recommending the 2gig Nano @ $199.  =======  BOTTOM LINE =======  BUY THIS NOW IF: (1) need a `exercise' music player, (2) this is your second iPod, (3) don't need over 2-4gigs of music (500-1000 songs) (4) if you're NOT willing to wait till the holidays (Nov-05), cuz most likely you'll get a price drop... and a 4gig Nano at $199 is a NO BRAINER PURCHASE...way beyond 5 star rating, MORE LIKE 7 STARS!  WAIT TILL HOLIDAYS IF: (1) want to get the absolute best deal, (2) this is your first iPod, (3) you are buying this as a Christmas gift.  ***Keep in Mind***: 4gig Nano will most likely drop in price to $199 during holidays, while a newly introduced 6gig Nano should be $249 ***NEXT PRICE DROP DURING HOLIDAYS 2005*** nano 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $14/hour battery time &lt;highly recommended> nano 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $18/hour battery time &lt;recommended>  ===== VALUE ======= PROS: (1) size - amazing! (2) weight/portability - amazing! (3) color screen, (4) faster interface - due to flash memory, (4) unbelievably cool looking. CONS: (1) @ $249 for 4gigs, more expensive than Mini for storage and battery (per-gig and per hour battery), (2) No significant new innovation other than size/appearance, (3) no FireWire - slow updates, (4) no iTalk, iTrip, or any top-connecting accessories that use remote control port.   NOTE - CURRENT PRCING:  nano 2gig @ $199 =  $100/gig OR $14/hour battery time nano 4gig @ $249 = $62/gig OR $18/hour battery time mini 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $11/hour battery time mini 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $14/hour battery time  ===== DETAILS ======= 1) SIZE/WEIGHT: Simply amazing... you can see for yourself...I really cannot convey to you how much `coolness' is packed into this tiny lightweight package... Super thin... about half the thickness as the Motorola RAZR.   2) COSMETIC CHANGES & SCREEN: Color screen is smaller than other color models, fonts smaller, click wheel smaller, still scratches and smudges like the rest... headphone jack is on the bottom (a good thing) and still displays album art... screen resolution is clearly less than the iPod Photo  3) PHOTO QUALITY: Not very good, still syncs w/ my iPhoto and Adobe Elements... but pictures have less resolution when I compare my 30gig iPod photo and the Nano side-by-side. PHOTOS ON MY TV: Not available.  4) MUSIC: Really no improvements here... but no steps back either.  5) USB 2.0 UPDATE TIMES: Slow for initial load (full capacity)....normal FireWire iPod on Mac is about 1 second per song (no FireWire use on Nano) ...USB on Mac is 2.5 seconds/song... USB on PC is about 2-3 seconds/song... longest test was PC formatted Nano, updating on a Mac = 4-5sec/song!!! ... hopefully Apple will soon enable FireWire connectivity for Nano.   6) BATTERY LIFE: Didn't really run above spec in my tests: ~14hrs w/ no backlight.... 10hrs31min w/ backlight set at 5 seconds...and normal amount of navigation.   7) FUNNY QUERKS: (1) No FireWire updates, but seems to charge via-FireWire, (2) Screen "washes out" when viewed at an angle... same for the iPod Photo or Mini, but not as severe.   ===== SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX =====  A) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE: In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing photo albums automatically, etc..., you need to purchase or own iLife (iPhoto specifically) 4.03 or better.  If you have PC, you have to buy Adobe Photoshop Elements.   B) SLIDESHOWS: without the TV-output capability, there is no use for this on this iPod... sux.    D) ITUNES 5.0: Cool new feature is ability to create `folders' for your playlists... if you have too many playlists, then this feature is great... but the navigation does not translate to your iPod Nano... you still have to use a million playlists on the same scroll column.   E) NO AC ADAPTER: You must charge from a powered USB 2.0 port... note, most USB 1.0 ports are not powered, nor does a 1.0 port update your songs.
