<Title>Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The promotion and advertising for this product states that this would download 1000 songs.  Knowing that some songs are longer than others etc., I figured that I'd be able to load at least 900+.   However, in downloading from my computer, I could only load 426 songs.   Naturally being quite upset, I contacted the Creative Company, and they said:    "Music files encoded at higher bitrate are much larger than music files encoded at lower bitrate, thus it reduces the number of songs a player can store".   They then talked about 32 versus 64 bitrate etc.    To me this is something close to false advertising, because NOTHING whatsoever is ever said about bitrate, and that as a caveat, know your bitrate etc. etc.    Hence, I could only load 426 songs.  This is Creative's major error.   Had I known about this, I would not have ordered a 2 GB player.      SO, I have ordered a 4 GB player, and intend to send back the 2 GB player I originally ordered and received.   (SHAME ON CREATIVE FOR NOT STATING THIS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION).     However, the player itself is good quality and performs quite well, and had some problems loading the software.     But more info needs to be stated by Creative about the amount of songs that can be loaded based on bitrate (Which most consmers know nothing about).

<Title>Works rather well
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use this nice compact MP3 player in my car, while I exercise and randomly around the house.  It holds quite a bit of music (I use Yahoo) and is easy to manage.  It has frozen up twice, but that is because I was trying to go forward and back too fast!!  It also has an appointment functioin, though there are a few key presses to get to it.  Overall, it has great sound and ease of use!!  I highly recommend it!!

<Title>Didn't last a year
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I thought this was going to be great. It's light, sleek, I loved all the features.  But towards the end, it became a frustrating hassle.    Janurary 2007: I received it.  Then about two weeks later, the toggle switch that you use to navigate it broke off.  For the remainder of the time that I kept it, I had to navigate using my fingernail.    Spring 2007: It froze.  It's okay, I just reset it.   August 2007: It froze.  But then when I reset it, it froze during loading.   September 2007: Can't skip songs or change volume because it'll freeze.   Fall/Winter 2007: Can't reset it when it freezes because it'll just freeze over and over.  I had to let it rest overnight and attempt to reset the next day.    December 2007: Stopped using it.    It WAS awesome.  But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Excellent starter MP3
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the 1st MP3 player I've purchased. I think it is very user friendly & easy to load. I had it charged & loaded within 24 hours of receiving it. Pretty good for a tech novice.   I love my Zen & don't know how I lived with out. The free ear buds that came with the Zen are too large for my ears. I'm researching the optimal buds for price now. Also, I'll definitely invest in purchasing the electric (plug into wall) charge adaptor. Charging to my PC isn't convenient for me.  The only thing that I found slightly overwhelmed with was locating a company for music downloads & how the process is established. Having hundreds of online companies offering the purchase of music files is confusing. It would've been nice to have received a few free downloads intially. I went with Amazon.com for music downloads for my Zen. It's what I'm familar & comfortable with.

<Title>Good So Far....
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Muvo N200 that was great until it crapped out - I'm hoping this one lasts longer.  So far I'm impressed with the functionality.  I researched long and hard to try to find a player that was small, compatible with Audible, compatible with Netplayer, and had bookmarks.  This player does it all, and the bookmarks are a necessity for netplayer and audible content.  The interface is nice and fairly easy to use.  The included earplugs are surprisingly comfy.  If it holds up it should be a winner.  One dissappointment - I have a Motorola RAZR phone and saw on-line a adapter that claimed to charge both the RAZR and the Zen V.  I figured the Motorola version that I have for both plug-in and car would work, but neither do.  Chargers are getting too smart for their own good I suppose, so for now I am stuck with the USB charger,which I really don't like....

<Title>Love it
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player. It was actually smaller than I thought it would be and it is so adorable! The screen is really pretty, even though you can't see it in the sunlight, but you can just shield it with your hands and it's not a problem. I love being able to change the themes and backgrounds for the menus. Learned how to use it really fast. I especially love the search feature to find a particular artist fast or the keyword search for a song. Would highly recommend.

<Title>i don't like ipods...
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So I bought this instead. It's great, the software was simple to install and use. I made the mistake of attaching it to the usb port before I installed the software. The player didn't turn on, but once I reset it with the post of my earring, it worked fine. I ripped all my cd's into it very quickly. The picture viewer is good too. And I love the voice recorder. It sounds about as clear as a computer microphone (an average one at least.) I just wish the instructions said something about how to delete the mp3s I didn't want in it anymore. I finally found out how, but the button I have to hold in is now stuck. That's the only complaint I got. It's really good. Buy it instead of an ipod. This is for people who actually CARE about their music, not what social statice they'll have.

<Title>Very Impressed
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am very impressed with this.  I did alot of research before buying an MP3 player and decided not to get an IPod for various reasons.  I liked another Creative product, but there were complaints about the controls not being easy to use with big hands.  So I waited a while and then this came out. This player however is very easy to control with my big hands.  It is easy to use, and the sound quality is good.  I had some problems with it once, I think I left it on accidentally and drained the power.  I was rather sad, thinking it had failed already.  However I discovered that there are two reset buttons.  One is on the top, the other is on the left side, in the middle.  The one on the side fixed the problem and it sprang back to life.  I highly recommend this if you are thinking about getting an MP3 player.

<Title>Geat looks, sounds decent, annoying interfaces and interaction with PC
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Have had 2 days, so intial reactions of player and as compeared to my previous players as follows:  Pros:  1) Great small small small size! 2) Stylin' looks are fantastic (but why no orange-controls-on-black-body for larger GBs???? Only green (2GB)  or blah blue (4-8GB.) 3) Sounds decent (after twiddling with custom EQ settings, but this capability weak compared to iRiver, also used different earphones, Shures, than came with it to get improved sound quality) 4) Can be used as data store  (must use Creative SW to get into Removable Disk mode. Would prefer if Windows recognized as just another data device in my computer and managed directly as any other external data store. Detailed management functions, e.g.playlists)  should be done via on-board player SW thru' device user interface) 5)Beautiful little screen, I will rarely if ever bother with movies on a 1.5 inch display, but the screen is very clear, crisp, and nice to use which is a big plus to me. 6) Nice it has Radio feature, have not tried yet though. Unclear to me if you can record directly off-air as in iRiver, but maybe you can. 7) Like direct line-in recording feature, haven't tried yet. (Not sure yet if able to upload to PC from player to save in that direction). 8) Not an iPod !!!! Yay! Upped to 4 stars just for this fact!  Annoyances: Many, will not hit on all.  Let me say I work in SW industry so weak or non-working User interfaces are very aggravating to me. Also critical of instruction manuals not giving enough info to problem solve, and this is an example of an inadequate manual (compare the combined printed and SW user's guides to iRiver comprehensive printed manual packaged with player).  1) Wndows XP Professional on IBM laptop first knows device is attached and then doesn't.  Flakes in and out while firmly plugged in to USB port. Not problem with the USB cord or port on computer, tested those.  Sometimes unplugging and re-plugging gets it recognized again, sometimes not.  Go to Creative website for Windows media patches to download, improved time between drop-outs, but did not eliminate problem. 2) SW only works when deivce plugged in and recognized: cannot work with files "offline" then transfer to device when ready. If decides to stop recognizing device while you are working with files, then all work is lost. Happned to me numerous times. Only tried with Media Explorer so far, possibly would be better with the Organizer SW. 3) SW harder to use than some others (e.g. iRiver). Also annoying that transfer sort options won't just let you default to order you put files in (iRiver does allow this). To do ordering must take the time to fool with tags or to create playlists (some of us do not want to spend this much time fiddling with our MP3 player.) 4) Recording button is in the way, next to volume and on side where you bump it easily, constantly.  And I have small-ish, agile hands. Should be on top, more out of way. 5) Takes forever to trickle charge through USB (1st time 6 hours,next time almost as long). Wall charger should have been included. Also, when checking to see if charged up, first gives 'charged' symbol then when you pick it up to do anything the 'charging' indicator starts again. Can't tell when its really charged all the way or not. 6)Horrendously slow downloads. On first loading (1.8 Gb, took about 20-25 mins on USB 2.0 connection...compare this to tranferring this amount to my thumb drive or any other modern external drive). 7) Stops at end of each album rather then keeping on playing to next...this is a pain for a busy professional using when traveling or when exercising.  Again, if had time to fool with playlists, surely it would play the whole list.  8) Screen turn-off and idle time sleep / player auto-shut down timers do not time properly  (too short) and there is not enough control over allowable settings.  Also, depending if it shuts down or you do it manually makes a difference in where it picks up again in songs.  Have not used for anything but songs, so don't know about books. 9) User interface on player OK once you play with it long enough to mostly figure it out, however a better instruction manual could save valuable time here.

<Title>Warning, Device Contains Cancer Causing Agent,
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>his is the exact warning description written on the 4th page of the use manual:  Warning: The cord(s) included with this product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.  WTF??! Why isn't this warning listed on their advertisement? I would not have bought it if I knew about it. Do not buy this product if it is a concern to you.  But Overall it is not a bad MP3 player.

<Title>Not that great
<Date>Sun Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The screen can not be read in sunlight. File transfer is really quite slow, maybe 2 minute per album. The transfer software is buggy and prone to lock up.  As noted in some of the positive reviews there are some good qualities for the MP3 player but those are mostly aesthetic. These manufactures need to engineer a working product first then put on the lipstick.

<Title>less than expected.
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a Creative MuVo N200 that has worked great for over a year.  I thought I would like this new one with a color screen and the ability to view images.  Well I did not like the required software and built in media management.  I just wanted to plug it in and copy my files to it like I could with the N200.  The image quality on the tiny screen was less than optimal for viewing images.  When fast forwarding through mp3 tracks the time index would advance but the actual position would barley move or revert to the point I started at.  It could not handle true time index for long net casts (pod casts) > 1.5 hours in length.  So, I returned it.  I think I'll take a look at and Arcose or Coby V-Zon

<Title>Great, compact player
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have tried a few different music players, and this is the best. I was looking for a flash player that would work with Urge and Audible, with a color screen, rechargeable battery and great battery life. This unit fits those needs perfectly. My main use is for audio books, with occasional use for music, so the 2GB capacity is certainly adequate. If your needs are similar, I would strongly recommend this unit. I am not as concerned with the look of the unit, but this one excels in that department as well. The shiny black surface is very attractive (although it attracts fingerprints like crazy), and the screen is very nice. The OLED screen gives it great battery life, while not sacrificing screen quality. I have had bad luck with quality control issues in the past, specifically with different models of Sandisk "Sansa" players. I am having an issue with this player as well, but it is relatively minor, as it only happens occasionally. The issue is that every so often during playback you will hear a brief high-pitched noise, and/or the track will begin skipping back and forth like a badly scratched CD. The issue does not appear to be with the tracks themselves, because you can restart the track and it will play normally. It is a minor issue, because I am sure it will be corrected with a replacement (and if not, I will update this post), and the issue happens rather infrequently (once every few hours of playback). All in all, highly recommended!

<Title>Excellent Little Player
<Date>Mon Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this for a month or so and I love it.  I've heard other people saying that theirs froze up.  This happened to me too, but I'm assuming this is just one of those 1 in 100,000 things.  Also, the first time this happened, I located the reset hole, which was very easy, but you can find it in the instruction manual if you are having trouble.  If you stick a pin in and poke around for a minute, you'll find the actual button.  you'll know because if you press it, it will feel like a button.  Other than that, its very nice.  It works beautifully with Yahoo! Music Unlimited.  The controls are easy to use, once you get used to them.  I'm not saying it's hard, its just remembering that for options, you hold down the back button.  There's nothing really to complain about, except its very hard to find video for it, not that you would want to, considering the screen size.  Unlike iPods, it's easy to remove fingerprints and it doesn't scratch easily(but I still put it in the case just to be sure).  If I had the choice, I would definately pick this over an iPod.  My friend bought an iPod and now he is seething with jealousy.  DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE HE DID!  DON'T PICK THE LOSER COMPANY, PICK CREATIVE!
