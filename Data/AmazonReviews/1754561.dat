<Title>No complaints.

<Content>What's not to love? It sounds great, has enough EQ presets to customize the sound to my liking for different kinds of music and for headphones or powered speakers, and I've never had the battery run down in a day's use. It also works perfectly with my Yahoo subscription music, and holds plenty. I have well over 20 albums loaded currently, and still have space for more. The radio works fine too, as does the voice recorder.

<Title>Overcomming Microsoft's Restriction On This Product
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Microsoft has forced Samsung to remove OGG playback and normal flash drive capability for this product from its United States server's firmware downloads.  So, unless you happen to run Windows with Media Player 10+, you'll need to grab firmware from Australia in order to use this product.  That aside, it's a nice player with great sound and easy access buttons...  Yet another reason to back away from Microsoft.

<Title>Avoid the headaches, use the Australian firmware...

<Content>The major problem witht he new USB thumbdrive players is the copyright protection that wont let them work on any operating system except winXp/vista, because they have WMP10 and copy protection. Well, if you go to samsung.au and download the australian firmware you get ALL of the features of the american firmware, but none of the limitations on file use. I can now use my player as a drag and drop thumb drive, i never have to synch it and can use it with my win2k laptop! This trick works with many products as foreign english speaking countries do not have the legal restrictions the U.S. has! Enjoy!

<Title>YP-U2J is useless
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this device because I needed a USB key (it claims 2 GB) and wanted to listen to MP3's and FM radio also.  Not only does it not function as a USB key (some reviews have indicated that one can download new firmware to make it do that, but how many users have the skill or persistence to do that?) but my computer (Dell Optiplex 745) does not recognize it at all (thus Windows Media Player 10 cannot synchronize to it). Bottom line: I have a VERY expensive and not very good miniature FM radio.

<Title>Bigger is Better
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have used a 500MB version of this exact player every day for almost a year now. I download then play talk radio programs and then delete them. I put the player in the USB port, delete what I have heard and then sync new programs daily. It works great! The 2GB player is for my music. The one drawback is, it only works with Windows XP.
