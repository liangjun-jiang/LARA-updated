<Content>I purchased 4 of these for Christmas presents. Before I shipped one off I sat and played with it. It is FANTASTIC!!! The quality of the sound from the built-in speakrs is great considering how small they are. The tuner works so easy with the earphones in, navigation was simple enough-all the featuresbuilt in!. I liked the video that was pre-programmed with the words to the music. One thing though, if you are buying this for someone with limited sight, the screen is small. I still  believe that the radio and the amount of music it will hold for the cost is FANTASTIC!!!!

<Content>I researched and researched for an MP3 player with FM and I this item got the best reviews.  The price was right and it had what I wanted and more!   The item itself is very durable.  No need for all those AAA batteries as the item recharges off your usb port!  There is also a wall charger available.  The menu takes a bit to get used to, but once you figure it out (or read the manual :-D ) it is a breeze!  I was suprised that it came with a video player too!  That is great!!  It even comes with conversion software.  The player also has an external speaker and voice recorder.  I am very impressed by these piece of electronics and I do not get impressed easily.  Thanks Visual Land for a great MP3/video/voice recorder at a great price!

<Title>WOW

<Content>I was really excited to get this mp3 player. When it got to my house i couldn't wait to put my songs on it. Alot of people liked it too BUT a couple days later my play button got like jammed which was annoying to me. then maybe a day or two later something became loose in it and when ever you move it that thing shakes around. this is extreamly annoying and i cant even take it out anymore. you might be blaming this on me, but i would barely let my brother touch it. So i would not buy this mp3 player go to some company that people actually know. Visual land??? god id rather have an ipod right now!

<Content>I purchased this for my 15 year old daughter's birthday and was first impressed with how quickly it shipped - THANK YOU!!!  However, we were even more impressed with the player itself!  It does everything my daughter was hoping it would and more.  And we really appreciated the extra items you threw in...   Thanks again Visual Land!!!

<Content>when i got this mp3 player i was very surprised at how small and light it was i tryed putting song on it but i had bought songs off walmart.com and apparently they dont work..so i had to copy the songs on to a cd and take them to a different pc and download on that pc...which meant i had to go through and type in all the songs titles in myself...but once i got the songs on there the audio quality was great and the built in speakers r very handy

<Title>Avoid this player like the plague if you own a Mac
<Date>Wed Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you plan to use your Mac Running OSX to transfer songs to this player, you're going to be very disappointed. This is not as easily done as the instructions suggest, if possible at all (I've NOT yet successfully transfered a music file from my Mac to my VL-546.)  The software comes on a mini-CD that won't load into Mac CD/DVD drives that autoload, meaning you'd better have a tray CD drive or copy the provided disk to a full size CD.  The instructions state that the player is NOT compatible with iTunes, however they don't tell you that music ripped by iTunes is not usable even when copied to the VL-546 under drive mode either.  At least in my case this make my entire iTunes library inaccessible to this player.  I don't consider this Mac compatible, despite the claim in the Amazon description.  I suspect the reviewers giving this player high reviews are either employees of Visual Land or were otherwise compensated for their glowing comments.  Don't believe the hype, this player lacks intuitive menu navigation, feels cheap, and has flimsy controls and USB port cover.   I had hoped to break the mold as an avid Mac user and get something other than a Apple designed MP3 player.  Now I'm stuck with just a diminutive FM radio and voice recorder, what a joke.  I'll continue my search elsewhere and suggest you do the same.  I'd have given it less stars had I already sold it, I'd hate to ruin it's used value before I "drop it like it's hot".
