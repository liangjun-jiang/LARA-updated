<Content>This little guy rocks. First off, it's sweet lookin. Definite coolness factor here. It's small but not so small it's unusable and gets lost. Loading songs on it couldn't be easier. Drag and Drop and Done. Works on any operating system without having to install stupid software. It has easy buttons and navigates well. It is simply an mp3 player and it doesnt try to be more than that. This is great for on the go with its 1GB of memory, size, and durability. Great for the gym and for a second player. With the low cost and all the great features, everyone should pick one of these up.

<Content>I thought this was a great product, speaker, FM etc. Only after I received it (after one defect returned), realized it could not 'remember' when I was after power off. Contacted Buslink they confirmed it. For this it becomes useless for me. It now only serves as USB.

<Title>Doesn't remember where you left off

<Content>Yeah, it's really a bummer that this player always starts back up at track 1 after you turn it off! Plus when you put it in "pause", it automatically turns off after a few seconds, so there you are back at track 1 again. The display is numbers only, no song names. But it's a bottom-end mp3 player, what do you expect.
