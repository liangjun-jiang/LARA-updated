<Title>Don't Buy This Version
<Date>Mon Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the version of the Creative Nomad Zen Xtra with a faulty headphone jack. You want item model number 70PD055000032, not 70PD055000017. The other one is the same product, just manufactured at a later point and they have fixed the headphone jack problem. Hope this helps.

<Title>I would take this anyday over an iPod
<Date>Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Zen Xtra 40Gb for just over a year now. Up until now I have never had an issue with it. A lot of complaints that have been sent the Zen's way seem to have been a result of either ignorance or negligence.   Complaint 1: The sound quality is average...  Well it depends on what you call good quality sound. If you are from Europe and your idea of good sound is cranking up the music higher than anyone else in the area, then perhaps - if you did not upgrade your firmware with the US firmware (which does not have a volume limiter)- you are incorrect. I am a musician(trained to hear good sound) and with a good set of headphones/earphones, the Jukebox is out there beating the competition. Do yourself a favour and upgrade your firmware. You'll notice an immediate difference in the way it plays.  Complaint 2: The Control Buttons are inconvenient in comparison to the iPod  I couldn't disagree more heartily. I did a comparison with my father's iPod and immediately realised that navigating the iPod blindly while carrying it on the belt would be a very difficult task indeed. Instead, the Zen's side controls allow for blind navigation as each button serves as an individual function button. Perfect for rush hour on the tube when you want your player out of sight, but accessible...  Complaint 3: The iPod has more features.  Perhaps. Although I don't know if the iPod's playback menu items are near as comprehensive as the Zen's. For example: on the Zen it is possible to search for: a track, an artist, an album or a genre. Something the iPod doesn't seem to be able to do.   Complaint 4: The Zen is flimsy.  As with any portable device, the first thing you should do for it is get a case. Mine has never left its case except for the odd clean here and there. The case is tight-fitting, robust and has a belt-clip. Abuse or neglect any computer and it will give you hassles...  This machine is tough, its good-looking (although not as good looking as the iPod), has awesome sound with a feature rich interface (there's always a pleasant surprise in the form of a menu-shortcut or an added feature springing up somewhere) and after 4639 songs, it still has 16Gb of free space. Nothing wrong with that!  My only complaint is with regards to Creative's software. Now Creative make damn good hardware, but their software sucks to be honest with you. I am quite savvy when it comes to computer related stuff, but Creative's Media Source software is just aweful and buggy and so damn ugly. I eventually went across to Red Chair and bought their Notmad software which really does bring out the potential of the Zen and even adds some enhancements such as faster transfer of songs between the Zen and PC, streaming music from the player to the PC etc, etc... Do yourself a favour and don't even bother opening up Creative's solution!  For the sake of their software alone, I am dropping a star off my rating. I would give the hardware a 10 out of 5 and the software a minus 6 leaving us with four stars. Thats fair I think. :)  In conclusion, I think this is the best, most complete MP3 player on the market(despite all the new competition!!)

<Title>Works great, until it crashes!
<Date>Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the Creative Nomad Zen Xtra 30Gb around the start of the new year. By mid May, the player would get hung on the EAX Soound screen and wouldn't fully turn on. Since it was only about a month out of its warrenty, they would not help with a costumer service line or anything, but I had to send an email to the company. Well, after much hassel and faulty instructions about how to "update my firmware" I ended up having to send my product into the company in TEXAS so they could fix it. Now, not only was it a problem because I couldn't listen to my music anymore, but I also had to pay a hefty $40 fee just to return it, and if there was more to the problem than just my firmware, I would have to pay another $40! About three weeks later, they sent back a refurbished 40Gb player that works just fine, but now I have the task of uploading almost 25Gb of music back on. Speaking for myself, they were not helpful what so ever, the warrenty sucked and should have been extended so things like this don't happen, and they tried to buy me off with a bigger player.     One a side note, this player is HUGE! I know you are getting alot of memory and all, but this is in no way sleek or descrete. I can't fit it into any of my pockets or just carry it around because it it bigger than my hand! It may not look so big in pictures, but don't be fooled!

<Title>Discontinued 70PD05500032?
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for.  I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued.  Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique?  Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price.  When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as "Discontinued".  It is difficult to relate  reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store.  The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.

<Title>Look no further.
<Date>Thu Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my second MP3 player.  I am very pleased the Zen player.  I have the 30 GB model and approximately 7500 songs loaded up.  The random mode is outstanding. I rarely hear duplicate tracks.  The sound quality (as expected from Creative) is top notch.  I don't bother to use EAX in fact the quality is so high.  I have read that the battery life is shortened by the use of EAX, which only makes sense.  I am able to go about 14 hours in between charges.  I had to be creative (huh huh huh) to get the included case to work but that is a small compromise.  Right now the 40 GB models are going for under $200.  You just can't beat that value.  I bought myself, and wife both 30 GB Zen models for less than the price of 1 20 GB Ipod.  The creative software is flexible and fast. I had to use windows media player with my previous MP3 player which was slower than molasses in January when it came to looking up and erasing tracks that were currently on the player. I would rather have a little larger player and get the battery life that goes hand in hand.  Let's face it, the bottom line is, these players have to have 1. A hard drive 2. Some type of processor/memory combination to process the info from the hard drive and turn it into music, and 3. A battery.  There is not too much variation in items 1 or 2.  The only area that can be cut to make the unit smaller is in the battery.  Ipod may be smaller, but I can go over twice as long in between changes.    The bottom line is I am thrilled with this player.  If I were to somehow drop the player from a moving vehicle, or have a pack of wild pixies make of with my player in the middle of the night, I would not hesitate to order another one immediately.  My search is done, yours can be too.  You can't go wrong with the Creative player, but I would recommend spending the $10-$15 difference to upgrade to the 40 GB version.  10,000 songs in a package that is smaller than a portable cassette player that will go for 14 hours in between charges.....  There are no cons.  What are you waiting for?

<Title>Great MP3 Player for the money
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this MP3 player about 6 months ago, and love it.  I got an upgrade to expand the hard drive to 80GB and I can't even see myself filling half of it anytime soon.  The menu structure is very intuitive, and the screen is very easy on the eyes.  I have seen other MP3 players that hurt the eyes when you're looking at the screen for too long.  The only issue I have with the player is a short battery life, but I usually have it plugged in with the AC adapter anyway.  All in all, if you're looking for a large capacity MP3 player that won't break your bank, this is the one to get.

<Content>I bought this for my spouse for Christmas...he absolutely loved it.  A week later he closed his car door on his jacket pocket - the pocket containing his Jukebox.  It was busted, would not work at all.  We were devastated.  After a few emails back and forth with Creative, they gave me an authorization for repair; I sent it to them and received the repaired unit, like new, in about a week.  Fabulous!  No problems since.  If you don't care about the "ipod" name brand, I highly recommend this one!

<Title>So-So
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, the pros:  The battery is easily removable and replaceable ($20), compared to an iPod which requires service from Apple if the battery dies.  The same goes for the hard drive - I bought a Zen xtra with a broken 30G hard drive, and was able to easily swap it out and replace it with a standard 60G laptop hard drive that was sitting around.  After installation of the firmware and operating system (available from Creative's web site), I was good to go with 60G of storage.  The cons:  Software, software, software.  Creative's PC software is HORRENDOUS.  Get used to long delays and frequent freezes and crashes, especially if you have many songs.  My Zen has 22G of music on it in one big folder, and it takes minutes to load the folder up.  You can't even browse the device as a hard drive: you have to use special Creative software that provides a pseudo-explorer-like interface.  The cd-ripping software froze about half the time for me, and the sync tool didn't seem to work.  In short, if you're concerned about hardware and you're willing to put up with the hassle of getting this truly awful software working, get a Zen...otherwise just sped the few bucks extra to get an iPod.

<Title>Very nice player
<Date>Tue Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I bought this I read reviews at Amazon, Cnet, and other places. Some unkind things were written. I have been living with this player for three weeks and have nothing but positives. Being new to portable music I didn't want to shell out $$$ for an iPod, but I wanted the massive storage space. I have no desire to watch videos, listen to FM, or share files, so this Zen Nomad seemed perfect.  What it has going for it: 1) Better price bargain than any competing device (I got it at an after-Turkey Day promo for under $100.) 2) It sounds great. The included ear buds sound ok, but the fit seemed insecure. I spent more for Bose In Ear TriPorts. WOW! The combination is superb and better than I thought possible with portable devices. 3) The build seems solid. My case has not popped open. It doesn't skip (but then, I don't jog with it), and the display is easy to read. 4) I can replace my own battery, thank you. I don't need to send it off and pay $50 - $100 for a replacement. Of course, it's possible the player won't outlive the battery. 5) The software is pretty easy to figure out. But I must admit that people who aren't computer savvy might be hopelessly frutstrated. There really should be a section in the next-to-useless booklet that explains step by step exacly how to transfer an album to the player and then play it. I shouldn't have to go to Creative's website to get this information. 6) Ok, it's heavy compared to an ipod: and uglier, too. BUt hey, I figure since it's not the toy everyone else wants, it's theft proof.

<Title>The 3 (?!) month warranty should be a warning
<Date>Sun Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like many reviewers, I really wanted to like this product. The price/performance looked just right. When I bought it late last year, there were enough reviews that I knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal, but it sounded like a fair tradeoff. <p>Boy was I wrong. Reading the reviews, it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it. That's been my experience.<p>If I'd been paying attention, I would have noticed the 3 month warranty. But I didn't because I'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty. Now I know better. I've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose. A $300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack? So now I've got to call their customer &quot;service&quot; (of course, no 800 number) to send the thing back. <p>From the other reviews I've read, it sounds like that won't be the end of my troubles. I fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because, as other reviewers have pointed out, the construction is pretty flimsy.<p>Now let's talk about the software. Like other reviewers, installation was hell. Subsequent behavior even worse. About 10% of the time it can't find the device when I attach it to my PC. After I had it a couple weeks, it got into a state where it could never find the device, no matter how often I rebooted my PC, reset the device, reloaded drivers, etc, etc. Creative's online support was no help at all. In fact, I'd have to rate it among the worst I've ever encountered. <p>Finally, I uninstalled and reinstalled the software, the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing. To my amazement, even that process was error-prone. It took several days of attempts before things finally &quot;worked&quot; again and I haven't a clue why. That doesn't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability.<p>I did buy the Notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement. But that's a moot point now. My gut tells me the Nomad will in the long run be, at best, a 40GB portable hard drive, albeit one on which I can't create folders, or, at worst, a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again (I have their Audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating). My gut tells me I'll also end up buying an iPod. Which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars, I'll end up spending more than twice that. <p>Be forewarned. I would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks, depending on how mad I felt about the crummy software. Now, even 1 star seems like I'm giving Creative the benefit of the doubt.

<Date>Thu Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Overall, a good buy for the price.  Easy enough to navigate through, although I'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll/pushbutton.  My biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of.  There is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours!  At best, I've gotten 3 hours+.  I've tried draining it until it won't turn on &amp; recharging it overnight.  No difference.  If you're intrested in buying a spare battery It'll run you another $50, a little steep I thought.  I've also had the Nomad Zen lock-up several times.  The good news is if you can't get it to reset/reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it.  That's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous IPod and similar MP3 players where the battery is permanently installed &amp; removing it voids the warranty. The Nomad Zen could use a little sturdier construction like the Archos Jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case.  At the very least, a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice.  <p>Pros:  huge storage capacity for the price, easy to navigate, can modify existing playlists on the fly, has a removable battery<p>Cons:  Battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised,  no operators manual available for any of the Nomad Zen players (on or off-line), occasional software lockups, replacement battery is expensive<p>Note: about 2GB (5%) of the advertised 40GB of storage capacity is used for the operating software (Firmware).  This is nothing new, every MP3 player, memory card, etc., used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it.

<Title>Hard Disk MP3 Players
<Date>Tue Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the iPod, Creative Zen, Rio Karma and iRiver iHP - you'll notice that each has their pros and cons; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later.  <p>If your view in life is that you are going to pay $x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed, fault proof, good product support, easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and don't buy yet.  All the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while.  If you are OK paying $x00 for something that can be used now, but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you.<p>iPod clearly has the most buzz.  Great design and looks cool.  Most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons.  It has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents; however, enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can't be used.  Some of the more geeky (non-Apple type) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this Apple-like interface.  Everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery, yet this is the price of sturdy construction.  iPod can be used as an external disk, and apparently stores files without problem.  However, the music and data are apparently not separated; iPod reviewers complain about &quot;white noise&quot; in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the iPod during synchronization.  Synchronizing music among computers, if you have more than one, seems to be an issue; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized.  Reviews for sound quality are generally (but not universally) positive.  Reviews of Apple's support are generally poor; they seem to address issues in warranty, which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item.  After that it seems like you're on your own.  iPod has no stop button; when new users mention this iPod veterans call it &quot;unnecessary&quot; and &quot;so 20th century&quot;.<p>Creative Zen feedback suffers from construction quality, poor product support, difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack.  Construction quality is a difficult item.  The Zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced.  What is added in functionality (battery replacement) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off.  Drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off (but not if it's in its case).  Many reviewers say the faceplate simply didn't fit well so they returned the Zen.  Feedback on Creative's product support is universally poor; this is not limited to the Zen, it applies to all the company's products.  The scroll wheel is finicky; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right; new users say they have 50% - 75% success rate; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device.  The Creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain doesn't load on some computers.  Enough people have reported that their headphone jack doesn't work after a month of using the device to believe that Creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem.  The Zen doesn't support folders so it is not really a storage device; even with third party software that &quot;creates&quot; folders, documents and programs can't be launched from the Zen, so it is not a hard disk, it's a storage device at best.  Reviews for sound quality are generally (but not universally) positive.  The Zen has no stop button.  Veteran Zen users have explained how to stop if that's what you want.<p>The Rio Karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk.  It seems like movement, even small movement, causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing.  If you plan to carry the device around (it is a mobile device, right?) then this is something you might want to think about.  Karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device, which has RCA output jacks and Ethernet jacks for connectivity.  Usability (button usage, feature selection, menu structure, display size and quality) also has good feedback.  Repair seems to be an issue; some say the repair don't exist - you just have to buy a new player.  Perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories.  Like the Zen, the Karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device.  It only comes in 20Gb; enough for most people, not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates.  The Karma does have a stop button.<p>There aren't many reviews for the iRiver iHP.  Those that have it like it.  The only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow, leading to longer delays in some functions (playback and even a slow display of the menu?).  Otherwise feedback seems to be good.  No comments on reliability, warranty, repairs, accessories.  No-one mentions whether there is a stop button, but the photos don't show one.<p>None of these are perfect.  If you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you.  Accept that there will be better devices (or new generations of these ones) in a year or two that will cost less.  If that is for you then pay the money, learn from the experience and you'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device #2.  If you aren't into paying $x00 to learn and experiment, or the cons outweigh the pros, then wait a year or so.

<Title>Good for a little while, but....
<Date>Wed Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, &quot;If the product seems broken, we cannot help,&quot; or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out.

<Title>Easy to use, massive storage space, sounds great.
<Date>Tue Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>And also, it's priced very affordably. With 40gb of storage I have about 7,500 songs on the player (everything music file I have is on there) with room for about 2,500 more. A similarily priced 15gb Ipod wouldn't have been nearly enough room. Having my entire music collection is great when travelling (both on plane and car trips) and I don't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player--it's all there. Having to copy/delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage. The software interface supplied was very easy to use but I went ahead and got Red Chair's &quot;Notmad&quot; software because of some advanced features I wanted. The sound is great even with the supplied earbuds--but I find earbuds uncomfortable so I use different headphones. On planes I use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good. Sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference. Accessing files by artist and album (I mostly look things up by artist) is easy and intuitive. Possibly the biggest advantage this player has (if price wasn't enough) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him/herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery. Since batteries do run out on everything, this will also be a big money-saver since Ipods, Irivers, RCA, Dell, all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician (Apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement). Try before you buy if at all possible: although I am a Mac addict now for over a decade and everyone I know has previously bought an Ipod, the Nomad Zen Xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface. I personally am not crazy about the looks of either the Ipod or the Nomad. The Ipod's white plastic look/surface doesn't suit me. I like the Nomad's color better, but it's not terribly flashy. The mini Ipod's look the best to me--but with only 4gb there's no way I would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage. My advice to mp3 buyers: consider how much storage space you will need, then try and listen before you buy--mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them.

<Content>I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it.  The Pros:<br>Price!  Almost half what an ipod would cost you!  I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.<br>Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization.  Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway.  I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough.  I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!<br>Cons.  Creative software stinks.  It's horrible.  redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more!  The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day.

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Wed Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Have had the player since Xmass and love it!<br>Pros: Great sound, very long battery life (I routinely play it for 12+ hours), very fast recharges rate, removable battery, storage size, nice screen, firmware updates, and great price.<br>Cons: Short warranty (3 months, so I got the extended warranty at Best Buy), occasional freeze up (easily fixed by popping out battery), somewhat flimsy navigation wheel.<br>Neutral: I didn't even try the included software. I just bought Notmad manager ($25) and file transfers are easy drag and drop, songs stored by ID3 tags not by folders, needs to have software on computer to transfer files, no window on case (nice case otherwise.

<Title>I don't see what everyone's problem is- I love this player
<Date>Sat Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is an excellent player, especially for the price, with features that are comparable to and even excel the Ipod.  For a price that's still less than even the lowest level Ipod I was able to get this 40GB monster, and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some.<p>Here are the pros and cons (few there are) in detail:<p>Look/Design: The system is terrific in size and design, IMO looking better than the Ipods.  It's bigger, but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences- it's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation Ipods.  It's very solidly built, and has a nice dense feel to it.  I find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least.  The scroll wheel is better than the Ipod's as well, in that you don't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly- just a small nudge of the finger and you're there.  The screen's large and easily read.  The only beef I can raise in this regard is the pop-off face, that sometimes comes off a bit easily, but besides that it's perfect.<p>Sound: Exceptional, though I can't really compare it to the Ipod.  From what I've heard it's at least equal.  Like others have mentioned, you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they're on lower bit levels.  There's no so-called background hiss that I've noticed, at least so far.<p>Interface- Practically seamless.  Songs are recognized automatically by ID3 tags, which at first I was against since I had organized my files by folder with a previous player from Iriver.  Yet after ensuring that all the ID3 tags are in order (with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out) it actually turns out to be really handy.  It's a dedicated music playing device, anyway, so this serves it better.  You can find any song quicky by an artist, album, or genre search.  Playlists can be generated on the fly (which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus) or by using the software, and there are a bevy of EQ options.  The only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance.<p>Software:  As I mentioned before, the Creative Mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said, though Notmad may still work better.  It's easy to transfer, preview, and organize files.  The in-program ID3 tag editing is a strong point, as well.  It was no problem for me to use their software.  Some may complain that there's no drag-and-drop capability, but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player, not a computer accessory or hard drive.  The software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience.<p>Overall, I'm giving this 5 stars as I've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over, but as I've only had the player for a while I leave room for doubt if the headphone jack, hissing, or scroll wheel problems show up with me too.  So far, however, I'm a very happy customer.  Please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an Ipod.
