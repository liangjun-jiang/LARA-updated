<Title>Zen and the art of consumer electronics
<Date>Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm usually skeptical about buying Creative products because of past experience with "seemingly short" support cycles.  Regardless, I caved and purchased the Zen as a low-cost alternative to the iPod shuffle.  I've only had it for a handful of days, but here's my first impression:  Pros: - Sound is really great! - Intuitive buttons allows choosing without looking. - Small, cute, light and seems durable. - No software needed to load music (HUGE PLUS! - acts like a flash drive) - "Tell All" LED negates the need for an LCD readout.  Cons: - No clip, but you get one if you shell out for the skin accessory. - Control buttons could offer a bit more tactile feedback.  This is a perfect little gem for the gym!  I'm very happy with it so far!

<Title>My "Zen Jr."  is exactly what I've been looking for!!
<Date>Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only had this about a week, but so far I love it! I'm always in a car or a truck & needed something small and durable..It goes from my duffle bag to my pocket, to the truck dashboard hooked up to the stereo via a Phillips Cassette Adapter..All this could not be done as easily with for example my wife's Zen Vision-M..The sound is great with said adapter, as well as the accompanying earbuds which are actually pretty good..Am ordering one for wife as a backup..Granted, you are not getting the features & quality of a $200 model, but at this price, what more could you want?  P.S.  Windows Vista insisted on installing a driver which I just pushed "cancel" and found the Zen Stone in "computer" The software is VERY buggy on Vista Ultimate..Had to restore the computer to be rid of it..  Also I'm not Suzanne!! lol

<Title>WOW !!  Small but Powerful !
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't let the size fool you.  This little thing just plain ROCKS !! The sound is VERY GOOD - even the Bass tones. With XP you can drag and drop your music files. You can create several folders on it - for example - I have one for Blues, one for Rock etc. The headphones that come with it are pretty good - but I bought a good pair of Sony Headphones which are great with this player. Want to lose weight? Put some AC/DC on this thing and head for the gym !!  It is a GREAT Buy !!

<Title>worthy alternative
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got the Zen Stone for father's day,I resisted getting a MP3 player because of price and couldn't see myself using one. This product has won me over. Here's why:   Great design! I got the sense CREATIVE Inc. put some real thought into the feel and look of the player, though inexpensive it doesn't look cheap.I got a "cool" when I showed it to my daughters.   I was amazed how simple it was to load and organize songs, very intuitive process. I like the feature that allows you to store songs in different files and access each file on the player, example: if you want to hear only "classical" you switch to that file you named "classical", using a 3 position sliding bar on the side of the player. You cannot do this with an IPOD Shuffle.   Sound quality is crisp and clear. My kids own variuos IPODs and the sound is on par with the Shuffle and Nano, if not slighty better. Note: if you are looking for that throbing bass you get with speakers, ear buds just can't deliver, regardless of the player, investing in good headphones might do the trick.    If you have been waiting to purchase a MP3 player for casual use, I highly recommend getting a Zen Stone.

<Title>Half the price/More than twice the value
<Date>Mon Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 2 of these for gifts to my extended families overseas. Created a MP3  files playlist and sync-ed it to the Zen using Windows Media Player 11 in lest than 5 minutes (not counting the actual transfer time. Did not require any instructions.  I personally own an iPod shuffle (given to me as a gift) and I love it. But this is half the price and equally good. If you want to save some money and are in the Windows world I would HIGHLY recommend this player.

<Title>Very user friendly *-*
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am technologically challenged.  I needed something that was user friendly without a lot of buttons to confuse me.  I needed something that was easy to transfer files to and from.  I needed something small that would fit comfortably in my back pocket while I did a physically demanding job.  The Zen Stone does all that and more.  It is sleek and attractive and holds more than enough music to keep me happy *-*  For 39.99 out the door from Amazon I can't say enough good about it.  If you don't need a LCD screen this is the MP3 player for you...  The headphones that are provided wiht the player bothered by ears because I have small ears.  I invested in a pair with spongey things on them and listen to this all the time.    It is also easy to plug into the computer at work and play through Window Media player to listen to MY music selection instead of a bunch of songs I don't really want to hear.  I checked out other MP3 players at double the cost with features I wouldn't have understood anyway and screens I would have had to put my reading glasses on to see.  Invest in this player and you will not be unhappy *-*  Winona

<Title>Perfect for me.
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think I was the last person to get an mp3 player, I didn't want to spend a lot of money but I wanted something cute and could hold a decent amount of songs. Putting the songs on is a little confusing at first and I still haven't found a way to move songs around and add folders to put songs into, but the good thing about that is the folders take up space, and the less folders the better. I've got around 200 songs on it now and still plenty of room (wma format). I would definately recommend getting the keychain case that goes with it, the first couple of days I had it without the case I put a couple of scratches in it and since then none. I also purchased a set of ear buds that go around my ear because my ears are small and the ones that come with it were too big and hurt or fell out.

<Title>awesome
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Awesome.  I love my Stone.  It's so small and lasts about 10 hours.  I don't know how long it really lasts because I have never used it for 10 hours straight.  Not having a screen doesn't really bother me, but it does have a little light that flashes different colors that mean different things so I still know what it's doing.  Otherwise it's a cool little thing and I would definately get either the skin or the arm band because it will get all scratched up if you don't.

<Title>Simple to use, high quality
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I read about this product in a NYT "Best gadgets under $50" gift idea list.  They said it was cheaper than an iPod shuffle and held more songs.  I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and found it was exactly as advertised.    It comes with everything you need:  the cord to connect it to your computer as well as earbuds, and the software you need is easily downloadable from the company's website.  Even if you don't know much about computers, you can use this.    I'm old enough that I want tech things to be simple and reliable - I don't need every bell and whistle, I just want my mp3 player to play music and not give me any grief.  And if it doesn't kill me price wise, that's ideal.  That's what this gives you.  I liked my boyfriend's so much, I'm probably going to buy myself one soon.

<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1 GB MP3 player is a great little device.  It's simple to use, tiny and has crystal clear sound quality.  I also use it to listen to audio books and it is the easiest audio book player I've ever used. I would highly recommend this product.  The downside is the price of the accessories.  I think they could be more reasonably priced.  Other than that, buy one, you'll love it!

<Title>Zen Stone 1 Gig
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For the money, this unit was good. I decided, however, to get the 2 gig Stone so I could read the titles of the entries I was playing. However, if you use USB external hard-drives, you need to be cautious about incompatibilities with the Stone players and the HD drivers. The players need to be installed in a certain fashion to avoid crashes. One of my techno-friends is going to show me how to do this one day. In the interim, I don't power up my USB drives when I know I'm going to down files to my Stones. This avoids the problem.

<Title>Dropped mine in the river, and it still worked!
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm writing about how durable and sturdy this MP3 player is. I've had mine for about 8 months now, and it has been through a lot. Getting dropped, sat on, dropped in a river bed, left out in the rain, getting run over by a skateboard, and generally misused. BUT IT STILL WORKS GREAT! The music is crisp and clear, loud too for such a little thing. It's easy to use, just plug into your computer's USB port and drag and drop the music you want. No software to install. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, or attach a lanyard to the back. The Stone lasts enough for a good 12-14 hours of constant play, but i never play it that long, which is why I only have to charge it once a week or so. I can even go two weeks without charging it and it plays good. Also, the 1 GB is more than enough for tons of songs. I compress my WMA's and MP3's down a lot, and find that I can fit over 1200 songs on my Zen Stone. In short, it's great for people who want a simple music player that is easy to use and can survive a tornado. Or a teenager.

<Title>Works great
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>WE gave 2 of these to my girlfriend's younger siblings as a Christmas gift. They love it. It has the same space as the Ipod shuffle at about half the price and works with Windows Media Player which is nice. It does not require other software though there is an optional download that comes with the MP3 player. Simple, easy, and very small. This is the perfect starter MP3 player for kids and may come in handy for its size for adults.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone MP3
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this product for my daughter for Christmas.  She is in her twenties.  From what she has told me, she loves it. We were both amazed how small it is!  She is very happy with the gift and has not experienced any problems with the product at all.  She recently purchased portable speakers for the unit that are battery operated.  This allows you to listen to your music out loud without the earphones.  When I asked her if she would recommend this MP3 player to someone else, she stated that she would, although, she really didn't have anything else to compare it to.

<Content>This is a great player for someone like me who never thought they would break down and buy an mp3 player. I'm not "into" all the latest technology, but I was getting tired of getting off the treadmill to change cd's constantly! This little thing is soooo easy to figure out. I taught myself how to operate it and how to download songs in no time. It may be a cheaper player, but the sound is awesome. I've had mine for probably 4-6 months now, with no problems. I recommend this for beginners or anyone who just needs a basic, easy to use mp3 player.

<Content>I bought this as a present for my mom and she loves it.  It's lightweight so she can slip it in her purse anywhere. She's also not a techy person so this MP3 is just the right thing for her since it has only a few buttons so she can't go wrong in learning how to use it. Transferring music is very easy and manageable through the computer. Sound quality is excellent and battery life so far has been good. It's definitely a good buy for the price.

<Title>A Great MP3 Player That Works Seamlessly With Windows Explorer
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting for a long time for a more mainstream, non-Mac MP3 player that would work with Windows Explorer.  This one is great.  I use it in my car. It is highly recommended. What baffles me is that no one seems to think very much of the fact that this player works seamlessly with Windows Explorer. Even Creative doesn't do much to advertise the fact. It is more than a matter of convenience.  It is a matter of principle. Countless MP3 services and MP3 player, CD, and DVD manufacturers think nothing of imposing needless restrictions on their customers.  This is how we end up with CDs, MP3s, and DVDs that we've purchased legally and cannot make copies of.  This is how we get DVDs that install malicious software on our PCs (thanks Sony).  The Zen Stone is untainted by any of this nonsense. You plug it in via usb, it appears as a new storage drive, and you drag MP3s onto it. It's as easy as that. It doesn't impose any DRM or format restriction. It is a pure, unrestriced computational process, which is exactly what it should be.

<Title>Very good so far
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had mine for about a month, and it seems great. I mostly listen to books while I clean, and it's loud and clear enough to listen to while vacuuming. One gig is a lot of space for the price, and it's small and lightweight enough to take with you always. The only conceivable downside is that it has no display, which can be troublesome when trying to find a specific place on a long track. This is made up for by the very low cost and the intuitive controls. So far, I love it.

<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought it to use in the gym and it is very good for just that.  It does not come with software which is not a big deal other than to be able to control the built-in volume limits. (I chose not to download it and install more junk in my Computer.) It does not have a clip so you have to buy that separate.  The clip is poorly engineered and it's hard to work without pressing the skip button.  It's half the price of the shuffle and nice for limited use.

<Content>I have had my stone for over a month and I find that it is a great device to have around. The software is free to download, but you can even use Windows Explorer to load the files - clean simple design and it takes a standard USB 2.0 plug, same as my digital camera - so it is easy to find a cable when I need one. Battery life seems good too.  The only thing that would be a nice addition would be a small clip on it so that I could clip it to my shirt.

<Title>Pretty good, nothing fancy
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I like my little stone, it's easy to use and fairly good looking- verrryyy tiny.  The earbuds that came with it are almost completely useless, they fell out of my ears 8 times in twenty minutes, and I was just sitting down.  The player works just fine, will easily accept drag and drop music (and Jpegs and whatever you want to stick on it)... but the stupid USB adapter cord is hard to keep track of.  I'm actually not sure where it is at the moment.  All in all, I like my little ipod nano knockoff, but it doesn't have any frills, so don't buy one if you want fancy equalizers or radio or pretty moving pictures.

<Content>This is very easy to figure out, and the lack of screen is fine for me (saves battery, I'm sure). Plug-n-play, drag-n-drop in Windows XP, at least. The price is very good for the capacity. While it's very light, the Stone feels solid in the hand and doesn't creak anywhere.  One annoyance for me is that the volume control isn't fine enough; its lowest setting isn't low enough for me while in the library, but this is addressable by changing the music I put into it.

<Title>Zen Stone Rocks
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a bit of an electronics junkie--I've owned four mp3 players.  Gotta say that the Zen Stone has been the easiest to use by far, and the cheapest!  I have seen people say the controls aren't as tactile as they might like.  I haven't personally had that problem but could see how someone with larger fingers might.  My only complaint about this player is a problem I've had with every mp3 player I've owned--the shuffle is woefully inadequate.  It seems to me like whatever algorithm is used to create a random shuffle on players is never random--seems to play songs from the same few artists and albums and then switch to another few.  But, that's really the only problem I've had.  The price is right on this player, it's EASY to use, it's tiny and adorable, and absolutely perfect for the gym!

<Content>I bought The Stone as a gift for my Son's 12th Birthday.  I did a lot of back and fourth research of so many different 1G mp3 players for weeks and weeks before I finally decided on The Stone.  At first, I bought it for 3 reasons.  One, it was half the price of a 1G iPod Shuffle.  Two, it was black.  And three, free shipping.  We found The Stone was a hands down AWESOME buy.  NO SOFTWARE NECESSARY!  We didn't have to upload/download anything to start adding music to The Stone.  AND, unlike most mp3 players of this type, FILES can be made and different genres of music can be stored in The Stone.  You know, some days he feels like Hip Hop, some days he feels like Metal, and he can listen to whatever he wants without the genres being mixed.  The Stone is pure and simple with that little extra feature...at A GREAT price...absolutely a good buy.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone 1GB - Nice starter or spare MP3
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1GB is a nice value in starter MP3 players.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $40.  For $20 more, you can get the 2GB Stone Plus which also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + simple design with more color options  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - below-average battery life of 10 hours or less - software issues - Creative software is buggy - DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable from 1GB (no SD card slot) - no FM tuner or voice recording - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Stone Plus with added features  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  The 1GB Zen Stone is decent but not perfect.  It suffers from quality issues and is really ideal for specific uses.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express nor as cool as an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations.  The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This burns out faster than the old battery operated unit, but is more convenient.  The sound is nice, and it comes through in stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds, which most people replace.  The Zen Stone Plus is the only larger option at 2GB. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7396823-2830211">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Creative has fixed some of the software issues.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>It is what it is
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: 1.  Small 2.  Rechargeable through USB (no AA battery like MuVo) 3.  Easy to use 4.  Blinking LED lets you know status of charging and whether or not it's playing.   Cons: 1.  It takes about 20 seconds between the time you hit Play and the music actually starts. 2.  The headphones that came with it were crappy.  Would rather not get headphones at all then pay for crappy ones. 3.  IT HAS NO CLIP FOR RUNNING.  It comes with no clip to add on like the Muvo did, you have to buy an armband separately.  I used to have an iPod shuffle, which had its own clip already built onto it, which was nice. 4.  The iPod shuffle had a nice feature where if you hit the play button three times quickly it would jump immediately to the first song on the list.  This one doesn't do that.

<Title>A tiny, lightweight player with standards
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing!  It uses standard mp3 files and mounts as a standard portable drive, so there's no need for any additional software to load it up--just drag and drop from Explorer or Konqueror or whatever.  It connects to the computer via a standard small-format USB cable, the same style as used on my digicam, which will be handy if I ever lose the cable.  And it weighs literally 15 grams--about half of what my already-lightweight eyeglasses do.  My experience with the battery life is somewhere in the neighborhood of 6-10 hours depending on how loud I have it, which for me means I charge it up about once a week.

<Title>Great for running
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit is very lightweight, compact, and easy to use.  It replaced a portable CD player on my runs, so for me it is the height of technology.  It may not be the latest and greatest in portable audio, but it gets the job done and there's enough money left over to replace your running shoes when they're worn out!
