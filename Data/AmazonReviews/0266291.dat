<Content>What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks.

<Title>My second iPod shuffle.
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Wll, they are small, so I misplaced my first one (I 512k).  Found it later.  But I figure that it will wear out anyway (even if switches go on forever, batteries WILL eventually die) given the heavy use I put it to.  I really like the fact that it does no need an external cord like the newer ones, which is why I bought it even though it was the same price as the newer one.  I also use it mostly in the car, since I do not tend to like headphones.  Also, the iTunes has gotten better as a program, but I have not bought anything better from the service.  I had a CD collection before I got the iPod, and feeding in my older CDs has gotten me to reacquaint myself with a good many CDs.   Now, about that vinyl...

<Title>Big on Hype - Small on Performance
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money.  Don't buy this one.. keep looking.  This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player.  This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music.  Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music.  This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.  My iPod Shuffle irreparably died after one year and one month - just one month after the warranty ended.  I've heard similar horror stories so I know that I'm not the only one to have experienced this.  Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like "hold" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.  Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year.

<Content>I received my shuffle promptly, but unfortunately have had problems with it.  It downloads properly, but won't shuffle the songs (they play in the same order all the time), and some songs have never played at all. My daughter ordered one at the same time, and hers works perfectly, so maybe it's just my particular product, but I have been very disappointed.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little device works really well. The battery life is as advertised. There is no skip what so ever unlike the iPod, so this is ideal for running. It is small and light and easy to take with you cycling or running and great for skiing and snowboarding. Another great feature some may overlook is the storage factor. This product also serves as a thumb drive so instead of buying a 512 thumb drive and using it for storage if your a college student like i am, you can buy a 512 shuffle and alot as much memory as you want to storage and to music for only $20 more...good deal. Ive read some reviews that say there is no "hold" feature and this is false. If you hold down the play button for a few seconds it will "hold."

<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is going to make my weight lifting MUCH easier  If you thought that the iPod was small, then you're gonna LOVE this thing! it's smaller than most packs of gum!  Some people have been knocking this player's sound quality, but I have found its sound quality to be superb! ---- the player is solidly constructed, very small, and very lite - the perfect exercise companion  Unless you love flipping through playlists, then this is all you really need, in any music player - having an LCD would be nice, but you won't miss it - the price makes this thing a TOTAL steal  and lastly, I'm very impressed by the disk use capabilities - I have already used my 1 gig as a USB drive for some files - I'm very pleased with its versatility - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

<Content>The iPod Shuffle (IPs) is great for working out. Pros -No moving parts, no chance to skip -Easy navigation, don't need to "look" to skip tracks or adjust volume -Headphones sound as good as previous iPods -Price is right Cons -Headphone a *little* long when working out, can get "in the way" when exercizing; your miliage may vary. -Cannot manually sync with more than one computer without erasing the music content  each time you connect to another computer (unlike earlier iPods) -No "repeat" function  Overall, a really well designed product and fun to use. I'd recommend it to parents for youngsters who aren't ready for the responsibility of a "regular" iPod, but want a portable digital music player.

<Title>Got it, returning it
<Date>Mon Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this because I needed instant gratification and everyone was sold out of the 20GB iPod (except for the U2 version, but who wants that?!)  I apparently don't have a USB2.0, so it never got more than 3 files copies over at a time before crashing.  My computer is 2 years old and has been upgraded with RAM, but apparently no amount of RAM is enough to run iTunes on a Windows XP machine.  This was supposed to help in relaxation and reduce stress through music ... not happening. I'm going back to breaking stuff.

<Title>Pros and Cons are silly 
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love all the reviews of the iPod Shuffle that list the "Pros" and "Cons", as if you would then look up some other MP3 player and compare its pros and cons to this one.  Is anyone really doing that?    The reason to own this gadget is that it is the current "it" gadget to own.  If you don't get it, i.e., "why no screen?", "why so expensive?", "why does the battery only last 12 hours?", "why is it different?", well, then don't buy it.  You don't get it.  The reason to buy and own this is because once you saw one, once you held one in your hand and marveled at its design/weight/simplicity/smoothness/color and all the rest, you had to have one.  You don't buy the iPod Shuffle because it's "exactly what I need in an mp3 player."  No it isn't.  It's not "exactly" what anyone needs.  But it is the coolest gadget you'll buy this year.  Addendum: Here's a weird thing I've noticed with my shuffle: When in "shuffle" (random) mode, I seem to hear the same songs  more often than one would expect if it were truly random. OR, maybe this is just a trick of the mind associated with all true randomness: we expect random to mean that once we've heard a song, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is really low, when in fact, the liklihood that we'll hear it again is as high as the liklihood that we'll hear ANY of the songs on the player. I guess it depends on how they wrote the "random play" program as well (like, did they include something in the algorithm to exclude the same song being heard twice in a row, even though in true ramdomness, that should be possible).

<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just made a trip to the United Arab Emirates and back (12+ hour flight each way) and although I packed my 20 gig 2G ipod, it never left it's case. I wore the shuffle around my next with headsets in my pocket and they never set up the myriad of security alarms and the batteries lasted forever!  On the return trip I discovered I hadn't shut if off, charged it from my laptop and still managed to use it 99% (watched a movies the other 1%) of the flight and there was still battery left for the additional 3 hours to get home from JFK.  I let Itunes pick the songs and then eyeballed the ones it selected and changed the ones I knew I didn't want.  Did I miss the screen no, did I enjoy the randomness, YES...actually heard songs I'd forgotten I owned.

<Title>Cool gadget...with a flaw
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle is a fantastic little device created by the genius designers at Apple.  They know how to make things work. The user interface is very easy  on the Shuffle.  The flashing green and orange dots mean different things, but they don't take long to learn.  The sound is excellent. I was very surprised by how it handles every song and seems to strike the perfect balance in pitch, tone, bass and treble.  The only draw back is that it charges through your USB port.  If you have USB 2.0, it charges fast. However, your computer has to be on for it to get power. If you own a laptop (I own an iBook), your computer has to stay on - you can't charge the USB if the laptop is in sleep mode.  This usually means I am using the laptop's valuable power source to charge the Shuffle and I dont usually keep the laptop on for 4 hours (Apples recommended charge time).  I highly recommend you buy the USB power charger from Apple.  Other than that, the iPod Shuffle is a perfect device for work, studying and just listening to music.  I haven't taken it off in days...

<Title>BLAND
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is disappointing.  Buyer beware, if you plan on using it mainly for a thumb drive that it cannot go in at a certain angle, especially into certain Dell USB ports.  I bought this specifically for a thumb drive use and to listen to mp3s while I walk to class.  I got to class today, tried to plug it in, it would not recognize it through the front port.  Just beware if you are planning on buying it strictly for a thumb drive.  Other than that it is ok.

<Title>Horrible value, a piece of garbage
<Date>Tue Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05).  It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird.  The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music.  Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty.  The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one.  I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me.    I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano.  It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner.

<Title>Unreliable.  Cute Design.  Bad Engineering.  Poor Quality Control
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the "Genius" bar. At that appointment, the "genius" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple "genius" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.  Perhaps it should be retitled the "idiot bar."

<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod shuffle is small and compact, and easy to use. Plus, now that the new version is coming out, this type will be a lot cheaper. I love the shuffle versus other players, because it gives me a chance to listen to all my music, whereas if I could see the song I was listening to, I'd be more apt to go straight to my favorite songs and never listen to all the other great songs I have. I'm a college student, and the shuffle is perfect for me: cheap, small, and durable. **EDIT** Haha, yes the person who commented was right. Itunes has an option that converts songs to 128kbps so that you can fit more songs on your Ipod. I now have 163 songs on it and it is only about half full. This is a great mp3 player for the price. Sorry about the confusion before! Bottom line: If you want a cheap iPod, the shuffle is the way to go.

<Content>I bought my IPOD Shuffle a year ago and a half ago and it crashed on me in 9 months. The Apple store here in India, replaced the same under warranty with another and that one crashed on me again in nine months.  However, in the process, I have become an ardent fan of the extremely user friendly design that I am looking forward to the new and yet to be released 'METAL' version of the same. I just hope this product lasts a lot longer than the warranty period.  I have learnt from experience with Apple products, that if Apple wants a product to last they can make it last and vice-versa.

<Content>The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the "shuffle" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for.  On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties.

Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle. Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere!  On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol!  Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.  So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it!

It almost feels fragile and I'm wondering how long it will hold up in use (for me to use when I run).  The on/off switch is somewhat difficult to move without feeling like I'm squeezing the thing to death.  It seems if Apple had just put a finger nail slot in the slide switch it would have been much easier to use.

<Content>The Ipod Shuffle is an amazing music player. I just got it, and I LOVE it. It never skips (due to the flash player) and is so light, I forget it's in my pocket. It's the easiest thing in the world to hook up to your computer, it charges fast, and it saves you money. If your the type of person who has millions of songs (literally) but doesnt have the time or the enrgy to make playlists, or to shuffle through a million songs on a big ipod, then get this one. It's easy, it's light, and it's really amazing how small it is.

<Title>Don't Buy This
<Date>Mon Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is useless and expensive. I don't like ipods in general because they have an internal battery that only lasts 8-12rs new. Which means after a few months of usage, the battery life starts to shorten. Before you know it, you need a new battery which Apple charges a hefty $99 to replace as stated on their website. The ipod shuffle is the worst of ipods.  Here's why:  1. No LCD screen so if you have the 1GB shuffle with 200+ songs on it, have fun pressing next until you get to the song you want.  2. Battery life is horrible. Only 8-12 hours so about 10hrs of realistic battery life. The Sony NW series (NW-E75, NW-E95, NW-E99) have 70hrs of battery life on 1 AAA battery. I have a Sony myself and they're not lying when they say 70hrs.  3. Ipods hold less than half the amount of songs as a Sony with the same storage capacity. The 1GB shuffle holds 240 songs as advertised. The Sony 1GB NW-E99 holds 640 songs. Why? Because Sony has better compression software while delivering the same sound quality.

<Title>Love it! 
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this for about a week and I absolutely love it.  I have never written a review for anything, so I have to say that I am pretty impressed with this. Also, I don't own any other ipod products - this is my first intro. to the ipod world.  I've been reluctant because of how expensive the other gadgets are, and also because I did not want to fuss with setting up docking stations, syncing software, etc. I really like computer stuff to be like a TV - plug it in, turn the power on, and it should WORK the FIRST TIME.  That is exactly what I got with the IPOD shuffle (finally something that works without aggravation).  The iTune software is easy to use to compile and store all your music.  The ipod shuffle really does work like a regular USB.  Sound is incredible (however, I use my own noise-cancelling headphones instead of the in-the-ear headset that I just can't get used to).  Battery life is as stated - about 12 hours off of one charge.  It couldn't be any lighter, doesn't skip, and the buttons are intuitive.  The one GIG version holds a serious amount of music.  While you can't carry around your entire CD collection, you can carry around your very favorite songs from your collection, which is how I've been using it. The cons: The buttons seem so sensitive that I'm a little concerned about durability.  Also, its too bad that this device doesn't include radio.    Overall, I think that it is an excellent MP3 player and it really is worth every cent. I highly recommend it to people who want something very easy to use, don't need to have their entire music collection at their fingertips and for those that are new to MP3 players.  Also, great for those who use public transportation (I don't think this thing plugs into a car stereo like the other ipods).

<Title>ipod shuffle versus creative muvo tx fm
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>hopefully someone will find this helpfull if torn between the two. I have both the muvo and the shuffle. The muvo since Christmas and the Shuffle for week. The muvo is a 256k and the shuffle is the 1g. In comparing the two they both have strong point and week ones. Cost the muvo 97.00 the shuffle was 145.00. Size is comparable. Weight goes to the shuffle. Display to the muvo, although I rarely look at it other than to remember a song title. Feel to the muvo for hefty solid to the shuffle for elegance. Sound quality a draw. The muvo has an equalizer which can be adjusted to suit your needs. The shuffle sounds good all the time. The sound in the shuffle maybe a little truer to the source. Battery life is yet to be determined. The muvo will eat the battery fast if you use the display alot or change settings. The shuffle is still on its first charge after a week. Headphones to the shuffle. They seem to fit better in the ear without jamming them in somewhere. They stay in the ear better and don't fall out.Attachments a draw. The muvo has a nice plastic slip case with a clip for the belt or pocket like a cell phone. The case has a hole for a lanyard of your choice. The shuffle has a lanyard only.Software to the shuffle. The itunes is alot easier to look at and more fun to use. The creative media source is utilitarian, but works fine. I use these items for walking and yoga and find them both to be great products. My biggest concern with the shuffle is the fact of the replacement of the rechargeable batteries. My hope is in time when I need to do that there will be a less expensive alternative. Also, consider the fact of buying batteries over the same time period for the muvo. You could get rechargeables and see how that works. The shuffle does have a battery pack attachment which will add life and make it weigh a little more than the muvo. If you go that route the shuffle would go on and on but with battery power. I hope this helps someone with their purchase. The reviews I read were helpfull to me. You can't go wrong with either choice. I use both and would not hesitate to recommend either.

<Title>iPod suffle - Pros vs. Cons
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: Good price for flash MP3 player Slick looking  Cons: Where are all the goodies for MP3? (No LCD, No EQ, No changable battery - would it cost another $100 dollar as other iPods?, etc.) No lyric supports. (Yes, I said lyric support. Some places you can download the lyric with music so when you play the music the lyric shows on your LCD. Thanks to no LCD technology.) No voice recording, FM options, etc.  (The SanDisk makes MP3 players at same cost with LCD/VR/FM/EQ/ etc.)  Well I think this iPod Suffle for following people: who just want to listen 100-200 songs in random without any options. (Why don't you just listen on FM radio?)

<Title>What the shuffle is, what it isn't
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My shuffles got delivered last weekend. I ordered a 1GB for myself, and a 512MB for my wife. Since the 512MB version is for my wife's B-Day, I had to keep them hidden through the weekend. I set up both, and I will discuss the 1GB since it's the one I've spent time with.  Packaging: True to form, this is another example of excellent Apple packaging. The green box is distinctive, and obviously will be the color of choice for all shuffle related packaging. One interesting note is the package has a "loop" plastic closure tab, so these things are meant to be hanging on a display rack. I imagine we will eventually see these things for sale everywhere. Opening the box revealed a simple set-up... laynard, earbuds, and the shuffle. Beneath the contents was a small CD folder containg iTunes and instructions. I actually haven't read the instructions yet, but intend to once I don't have to keep the thing hidden from my wife.  Shuffle: Man, this thing is light. Almost disturbing at first, it just doesn't feel like anything. However, I got past this once it was in my pocket. It's great because you don't know it's there... ie there when you want it, not in the way when you aren't using it. The slider switch for Off, Playlist, Shuffle was stiff at first, but after moving it a few times it became easier. (Of note, this was hard to operate when my hands were cold, so be aware of this). The navigation ring is very simple and obvious. Play/Pause, Forward, Back, Vol Up, Vol Down. That's it. The battery button is cool, I would like to see some times for how much juice is left when it is amber, but otherwise cool idea.  Setup: Taking the cap off of the USB connector, you see either 1GB or 512MB printed on the connector. I have an older mac, so I only have USB 1.1. This wasn't a big deal. The mac recognized the player, asked me to name and register it, and we were ready to go. iTunes has a new window for the Shuffle, giving choices on Auto-Fill or Manual, Source for autofill, and a few other settings. Hitting the iPod button gives more advanced settings such as auto-conversion to 128kbs AAC from other formats, and setting aside memory allocation to use as a data storage device.  I set mine up for 256MB data storate, 744 MB of music. I chose a specially designed playlist as my source, and hit Auto Fill. iTunes picked approx 190 songs from this list randomly, and started to transfer. USB 1.1 transfer time was approx 15 minutes (glacially slow compared to firewire), but really, this was OK since I'm going to use USB to charge the thing anyway, which takes 4 hours.  Use: I got to use it for the first time yesterday on my walk to work. I use my 40GB iPod in shuffle mode while walking anyway, so this was no different. Sound quality is excellent. It fits in any pocket, and while I haven't used the lanyard yet, it does look like a great solution for occasions where you don't have pockets. I'm sure it will look a little dorky at first, but I have a sneaky feeling that everyone will be wearing these things like jewelry very soon.  As a flash-memory key, it is formated in FAT-32 (windows) format, which is handy.  You can use it effortlessly between mac and windows, transfering files, pictures, etc.  Very useful, and it is plug and play ready for this purpose.  Two thing that I really appreciate: 1. Weight. It's so light, as discussed earlier. Just perfect for walking / biking / working out. 2. Navigation ring. Far superior to scroll wheel for use while in my pocket. Very easy to get to by feel through my coat, pants or shirt. Easy to change volume, fast forward, pause, etc. Just brilliant, simple engineering.  iPod -vs- Shuffle: The shuffle isn't for everyone. The lack of a screen makes it a tough primary player unless your only use is for working out / walking around. Not usefull at all as a source of listening for a home stereo, maybe usefull in the future in the car. However, I doubt I'll every use my 4th gen, 40GB iPod as a portable device again. I think it's found its permanent place in my home stereo, as a complete substitution for CDs. The shuffle is perfect for my mobile needs... I'm not just saying this as an Apple fan... it is PERFECT as a mobile MP3 player. Just music, long battery life, low cost, and seemless integration with iTunes. Even USB 1.1 transfer times are tolerable since you have to charge the thing anyway.  I was hesitant when the shuffle was announced, but now I see the light. I can't wait to give my wife hers, I'm sure she will absolutely love it. It looks like her mini is going to find a permanent home in the car.

<Title>Great for what it is: A simple flash based player
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Simple and elegant. This is what makes the ipod line great. I have owned a 20gb ipod for just over 2 years. It just happens to be the biggest ipod ever made as it is a second generation machine. I have used it long and hard enough that I have replaced the battery. With Etymotic Research ER-6 earbuds, the sound is phenomenal. So, why a shuffle?  I commute about 2 hour a day using buses, trains and subways. As a female, I don't always have pockets or belts to attach my ipod. It is usually in my bag. As I get jostled around, I don't know how many times that either the earbuds are pulled out of the ipod or out of my ears (ouch).  At first I wouldn't even consider the shuffle, but as I thought about it, I realized it would be great for the commute for the following reaons:   1. I can listen to all the songs that I have purchased through iTunes. 2. I can listen to audiobooks downloaded from Audible. 3. The ipod is light and hangs around my neck so there is no trying to find a place for it in my bad and/or losing the song as the earbuds get ripped out of the ipod or my ears. 4. As I tend to lose stuff, I am not going to be as upset to lose a $150 shuffle as opposed to the 20GB ipod that I paid a premium for as an early adopter. 5. I tend to listen to the same 200 or so songs out of the 1900 I have on my ipod.  So, what do I think now that I have it in hand? I like it. I like it a lot. The sound quality is surprisingly the same as with the ipod. With $100-$150 earphones there seems to be no difference. It is light and works great for the commute. I'm not hung up on the fact that it does not have a screen I did put a few favorite songs on twice so it would be more likely to show up. Also, if I want, I can set it to play in order and those songs will come up. Rating songs in iTunes is very helpful for this. All in all it makes a great supplement to my regular ipod.  One of the things that did upset me though is this: It is supposed to work with all macs; however, there is a caveat. You *may* need an adaptor or better yet the ipod shuffle dock if the shuffle doesn't fit "some computers" (sarcasm mine). I blithely assumed it would be some Windows box. Come to find out that it is too big for the recessed usb ports on the eMac. I was livid. I felt that two Apple made items should be compatible. I borrowed a male to female usb cable and it worked fine, and I also have a Powerbook that I can charge it with, but it was an unpleasant surprise.   The shuffle is not for everyone as it lacks the features of its more expensive brothers and sisters as mentioned in previous reviews. However, I believe it is perfect for what it is, and it exceeded my expectations as a device (compatibility issues aside).   *Note (2/10/05) I just found out I can fast forward, rewind and set bookmarks in audiobooks with the Shuffle. That bumps the rating to 5 stars! I just can not change it on the scale section. kmm

<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice little gadget to have around in:  a. The Office: you can use it as a USB memory to transfer files from/to any computer. I personally own a PowerBook from Mac, and have no problem at all transfering files from my Mac to any Windows laptop or desktop. Just plug it in - It's great!  b. The Gym: I own a larger iPod, but always prefer to take my Shuffle to the gym. It's so small and lightweight. I've dropped it many times and it is increadibly resistent also.  c. Home: I use it everytime pluged in to my Stereo via the AUX input. I just use a cheap 3.5mm to 3.5mm that I got from RadioShack.  d. Car: I use it either with a FM transmit adapter or sometimes with a Cassette Adapter I got from Walmart (both).  The only thing I don't like from the Shuffle is the fact that it doesn't have a display to see which song is playing.

I bought just when it was released because I dont like the regular ipod, its too heavy and expensive toy to go jogging with.   Pros: Easy to use. Fill and listen with excellent iTunes integration. Cons: Got rusty in a few months. I live near the ocean and now Im having problems connecting it to the computer.  Botton line.. Now with ipod Nano, I dont know if I would buy...

<Title>Great alternative to spending a lot on a standard iPod
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I left my "real" iPod on a plane one day and replaced it with the Shuffle. I figured since I nearly always listened to my music on shuffle mode anyway and because it fit a few hundred songs--well more than I can hear in a given train commute for a week--it would be acceptable. It's odd not knowing what is playing, but overall I like it most because it slips into any pocket without bulging or scratching. And if I lose it I am out less than $100 vs. $300 for the real deal.

<Title>Same connection problems as every other ipod & mandatory itunes
<Date>Sat Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a 3rd generation 20GB ipod that stopped working after about a year. Instead of buying another one, I got the 1 GB shuffle as a present.   However, no matter what ipod I've used I've always had horrendous problems connecting them to any Windows machines. With the 20GB ipod I managed to get it working on 1 of 4 machines I tried. Unfortunately this wasn't the PC where I had my mp3s, cue lots of annoying copying. Even connecting to this computer became hit and miss later, but by then the ipod died anyway.  I haven't been able to connect the shuffle I was given to either of my home pcs, no matter what I try. I'm about ready to ebay or stamp on it (would make me feel better).  Additionally, apple forces you to use iTunes, which I personally really dislike, and you can't transfer mp3s from your ipod to another computer... etc. etc.  Although the actual hardware design is nice (probably why they're so popular) unless you want to be constricted in what you can do with an mp3 and be forced to use iTunes AND spend hours searching internet forums trying to find out how to just get the bloody thing to connect, stay away from ipods and buy a less trendy but less hassle mp3 player from someone else (you'll get more for your money anyway)

<Title>This is a great iPod!
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I love my iPod shuffle! I got mine last year for my Birthday in September and it still works like it did when I got it! I have dropped it a huge amount of times on surfaces like concrete, asphault, carpet, laminate floors and a ton more. I've even accidentally stepped on it a couple times! It's lack of screen can either be a good or bad thing depending on your outlook on life:). It's good because no screen=no cracking and scratching. But sometimes you wish you had a screen like when you have lots of songs and want to listen to a certain song but can't find it. To over come this problem, I placed all my songs in alphabetical order and memorized their positions. I don't carry it around with me when I go jogging or anything else, so I just use it in my home on my speakers. Overall, this is a great iPod for those who a)Don't or can't afford an iPod nano or iPod video (Like me), b)Clumbsy (also like me), or c) those who a afraid of getting a cracked or scratched screen. Thanks for reading my review!

<Title>Good for what it's meant to be.
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is not your photo/video iPod. So you can't compare it with them. It's the most basic version of iPod. It's meant to be loaded with songs & listen to them in the order you loaded them or in random order (shuffle).  It doesn't have the lovely controls of an regular iPod, but has only the basic. There's a play/pause button in the centre surrounded by volume up/down & next/previous track all around it in a circle. They work very well.  It has a USB connector on one end which you use with your computer. This unit also works like any other USB drives, to store data. When used with iTunes, you can control how much music/data you want stored on it.  However, when you transfer 2 different playlists on it, you won't be able to switch between them, they'll be one on your shuffle.  The shuffle, on/off controls are in the back. So is the battery charge indicator.  The sound quality is not as good as your regular iPod, but is very impressive for a player of it's size. It comes with the same earbuds that accompany all other iPods.  I use it in the gym, or when I'm running. I think, that would be the typical use. It's inexpensive, so if you lose it, or crush it by dropping weight on it in the gym, it won't break your heart.  If you are looking for a pretty simple, non-bulky, inexpensive mp3 player, this is the one to get.

<Title>My vote for Product of the Year, maybe Century
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my shuffle for a month now and i don't think i can live without it. I use it on my commute to work, at the gym, at the grocery store, when I take out the garbage. It's like having your own soundtrack. I have 3 other regular ipods but they were a little too bulky and fragile to bring everywhere. I like listening to my 6,000 songs randomly which the shuffle does a perfect job of, itunes is so easy to use compared to music match and all the other stuff out there. the battery life is amazing. Get the white sony fontopia earbuds, they go awesome with the shuffle.  At this point, I think I would rather give up my TV and laptop before the shuffle, never thought I would say that. I listen to Bright Eyes, Mozart, Joni Mitchell, Billie Holiday, Supertramp, etc randomly, I know it sounds weird but I really enjoy the mix. I don;t know why people complain about the lack of a screen, after all you are putting in your own music, if you don't like it dont put it in!  Hate to gush about any product like this, but it has really made my life that much more pleasurable, so I am hoping that you will give it a chance.

<Title>Either you get it or you don't . . .
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, no more bickering about a product that you don't actually have.  What I am telling you about this product is a fact.  And honestly, I don't like apple as a company, but this product after much debate is a product that I considered worth buying.  The lack of a screen is not a negative, that is what it is.  Don't buy this product and then complain about the fact that you don't know what is playing next.  You put songs on there, and you can choose exactly what songs go on there, and choose what order you would like, if this "shuffle" idea is just to scary for you.  This item is small, there is no other MP3 play that is as small, or really even close, the rechargable battery is why it can be so small.  Yes this battery will eventually be no good, especially if you charge it to frequently.  But the money you would have spent after 2 years of continuious regular use would add up to be more then the price of the unit.  So it is worth the "disposability."  This is not an MP3 player for someone who wants to have only one MP3 player.  I have a 30 gig Creative MP3 player that was less then 1/2 the cost to me to buy new, then a 20 gig Ipod, and it is a way better unit (better sound quality, comes with leather belt holder, and it has an easily user replacable rechargable battery) But for someone like me who won't bring his hard drive based MP3 player to the gym (I don't need to explain why, it is clear to everyone.)  This unit fits the bill.  It is small enough to not get in the way whilst doing my workout.  That is the main reason I bought it.  I have sweat rolling down my face, I couldn't see the screen if there was one, and while I am benching, I don't think I should be looking down at my MP3 player to see what I am listening.  And if you remember from before, I did choose that song anyways, so it should not even come close to a suprise for me that this song is playing, or what it is.  So for those who think it is a waste of money (you'll love this)  You're right!  If you need all of those other features, then this is a big waste of money.  For those of you like me, who need something small as an "expendable" form of music for your activity.  Here ya go, it is worth it. . .   Oh yeah, and did I mention that I really don't like Apple and I tried everything in my power to find a better unit for my needs, and I failed.  So either you get it or you don't . . .

Amazon.com didn't show a ship time but said I would be put on the list.  Three days later I received this device MUCH to my surprise.  The size is fantastic, so small it fits in the shirt pocket or the hand so easy.  I've run this thing for close to 10 hours and it keeps going, no problems.  Weight is nothing.  Using it as a USB flash disk works good too.  The only things that annoy me about this are as follows:  -Transfering music to it in iTunes is slow. -I can't play the music on the device when it's connect to another computer's USB port (playing off the device, not copying to the hard drive).

<Title>problem with some MP3 songs
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got 1 GB Shuffle last week, but I found that it is not playing some of my MP3 tracks. It jumps within the song. While other tracks played Okay. Those particular songs played perfect in iTunes, Music match, Real Player, Portable CD player, iRiver Flash Player etc.   So it seems that Shuffle is very particular / strict about MP3 encoding and omits a portion of song when things are not according to its own specs. Or it is designed to favor iTunes encoded songs and AAC.   I tried everything possible like resetting, restoring etc but no luck. I couldn't try encoding those tracks again with iTunes as I don't have original CDs.  At the end, a visit to an Apple Store, there they tried on their system and finally concluded that although those tracks are technically Okay, Shuffle just can't play those tracks.  I was offered a full refund but I upgraded to iPod Mini and it is playing those very tracks without any problem (Please note this).  So if you have lots of MP3 tracks encoded with different software (non iTunes),you might face similar problem.  Shuffle is beautiful, no doubts. I really wanted this product to work.  Hope this helps.

<Title>An Excellent Player.
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent product that I would recommend to anyone wanting a hassle-free way to take music on the go. I'm not going to write a full account of how the thing works. You will find all you need to know in the product blurb above.  But there are a few issues that need to be addressed.  The first issue I would like to address is the lack of a screen. Many people have criticised the iPod Shuffle for lacking a screen. In my experience this is not such a big deal. The displays on players of this size tend to be as useful as those on portable CD players: that is to say not very useful at all. Apple has decided to make the Shuffle as simple as possible: load it up with music and go - that's it. No fiddling about with playlists and selections, just go. While you can play songs in a predetermined order, in practice the Shuffle feature is actually a lot more fun. It is essentially like a radio station tuned to your own taste and without the annoying DJs or advertising. The controls are the simplest and most efficient of any player of similar capacity.   Other companies decided to make a digital version of the Walkman/Discman with similar interface conventions and expectations. Apple did not. In my view Apple understands that the rules have changed for digital music and that this means a whole new kind of portable player, not some smaller version of a discman. Apple has realized that, for a player that will transport only a fraction of your music library with you, the management aspects are best offloaded to the software you use to transfer the music to the player. That is where you really need the organizing features, not in the player itself. As I'll point out in a minute, in this aspect of use Apple is currently unbeaten.  The sound quality is surprisingly good for a portable device - in fact that's faint praise - it's great. Note that it is worth encoding from your CDs in the iTunes (default) AAC format rather than mp3 as AAC files just sound a whole lot better. If you don't know what this means, don't worry. iTunes is already set to do this when you first install it. However, you can change it any time you like.  The supplied earbuds are very very good, but like most portables you can obviously get better sound quality if you upgrade to a more expensive set of headphones.   The build quality is robust, although you might wish to buy one of the sport cases or skins to protect it from scratches. The thing looks pretty cool too. I have had people stop me in the street to ask what it is.  The price is excellent for what you get, which is both surprising and pleasing given that it is sold by Apple.  But now for the most important feature: it's the software, stupid.   A digital music player is next to useless unless the software that organizes and transfers the music to your player is simple to use and actually works. Other companies have produced fine players, but their worth is marred by the fact that the software they supply for music management is outrageously bad, and in many cases simply too difficult for ordinary users to operate and troubleshoot. I know many people who have bought or been given digital music players who have simply put them in a draw because they could not get the software to work (Sony is the worst offender in this regard).  Apple's iTunes is still the best music management app available for the regular user. As its fans are so fond of pointing out, it just works. Filling the IPod Shuffle from iTunes works exactly as advertised, and iTunes is simple and easy to learn in a few minutes. The best strategy for the Shuffle is to use the "Smart Playlists" feature to automatically select music in various groups that you might like (e.g. dance for "Workout"; mellow for "Walk in the park"; and Pink Floyd for "Quiet Desperation on the Subway"). You can make five or six smart playlists like this in a couple of minutes. Then plug the Shuffle in, select the particular list you want and press "Autofill". In a few minutes it is done and you can leave.   If you are thinking about trying the iPod Shuffle, you can download iTunes for free from Apple to see if you like it. Technophiles sometimes complain that iTunes lacks some features that they (and only they) want, but is irrelevant to the ordinary user: iTunes is simple, anyone can use it, and it works. End of story.  If you want a simple solution to carry a reasonable subset of your music with you during any activity, it is hard to beat the iPod Shuffle. I'm really enjoying mine.

<Title>wonderful product
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I would recommend this to anyone who already owns an ipod. Easy to use, easy to carry, and makes the ipod experience that much more exciting. Ignore the reviews that talk of the pros and cons of owning this ipod... bottom line, Apple always makes a wonderful product, and the fact that it doesn't have a display isn't worth criticizing... its a beautiful design and if you want a display screen fork out the extra money for a larger ipod...

<Title>Inexpensive, High Quality Player
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is a great mp3 player for what it's meant to do. It isn't meant to store your entire music collection, but rather would you want to listen to more frequently, or a random selection of music that fits in a device smaller than a pack of gum.  As with all devices, there are pros and cons, and I'll try and go through those.  Pro - Inexpensive. Even though Apple is known for having very high pricing, this device competes even in the price category against other players, and often beats out other players in the price category.  Pro - Size. This thing will fit into your pocket, or almost anywhere, and it weighs in at just under an ounce. Bring it quite literally anywhere.  Pro - Simplicity. This device is very easy to use, very self explanatory on how to use it, and to understand the LED lights, Apple gives you a small little card with the iPod shuffle.  Pro - USB Flash Drive. You can easily set aside a certain amount of storage space on your iPod shuffle to use as a USB Flash Drive.  Pro/Con - No screen. Not having a screen can be seen as a pro or a con. On one hand, it gives the device a clean, simple look, but on the other hand, you can't navigate songs, or if you can't recognze a song, you can't look it up.  Overall, it is a very solid device that I would highly recomend to anyone who just wants some music in a very small device, easy to access, and use. If they want their entire music collection in one device, this isn't it, that's what the regular iPod is for.

<Title>Excellent value; Very Useful

<Content>This is my first MP3 player/iPod purchase. I couldn't be more satisfied with the 1G Shuffle. I am so tired of having to lug my cd player, carrying case and a selection of cds to the gym everyday. I have only had my shuffle for 3 days and have put 47 songs on it, which is over 3 hours of music and the memory is not even 20% full! I can't wait for the sport case to come in stock. For what I need it for the Shuffle is perfect. I would recommend this product to anyone.

<Title>Survived the washing machine!
<Date>Sun Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After owning my 1 GB Shuffle for a year and loving it the whole time, I was distraught when I lost it for a couple days - and devastated when my wife found it... sitting in the washing machine after a load finished.  It wouldn't turn on, so I sadly started price-checking a replacement, and researching the Nano.  I was happy to learn that Apple offers a discount off a new iPod if you turn in an old iPod for recycling, which pleased me greatly.   After a couple days though, I figured "What the heck..." and plugged it in to my PC.  Darned if the charging light didn't come on, and iTunes fired right up and recognized the Shuffle!   The tunes had been wiped and the battery was flatlined, but I let it charge up and reloaded my tunes and I was back in business!!  I love my Shuffle.  I hate reading reviews complaining that "It doesn't have a screen!" Get it straight -  the Shuffle doesn't have a screen on purpose! This player is made to be the lightest, most minimal player out there, for use by runners and gym-rats.  It's not meant to be a music library, so a screen is of no value - just one more thing to break and add weight.  If you want a multi-gigabyte hard-drive loaded with music, look elsewhere.  If you want the best MP3 player for your workout or run, a player that you'll hardly know is there, this is it.  And I challenge any of the players with a screen to survive a trip through the washing machine. : )

<Title>Sotware problems
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great device but it does appear to be having problems which may be related to Apple's latest software. My device, for no apparent reason started blinking orange and green and would not play. Apple recommends resetting and or updating to restore.  Go to Google and see for yourself the growing number of complaints of cases where the latest iPod Updater will not restore the Shuffle, and although the device will charge, it fails to mount. I strongly recommend checking the return policy before purchasing.

<Title>MY IPOD ALSO SURVIVED THE WASHING MACHINE
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>MY IPOD ALSO SURVIVED THE WASHING MACHINE!!!  I love my iPod, but between my wife and I, we don't always check our pockets very well, prior to doing a load of wash.  We have lost many important items, papers, rings, and other expensive electronic gear because of this bad habit.  We use our iPod shuffle daily, and are constantly using iTunes to re-shuffle the music on it.  It was a great buy, and it adds more than we imagined to the enjoyment of our music, and our daily lives.  The fact that it survived the wash is just the icing on the cake.  It took a day or so for it to completely dry out and return to 100% normal, and I chose to get a different set of headphones (which also went through the wash, but only returned to about 75% of their original sound quality.)  The output on the iPod itself was unaffected, and the new headphones sound great.   I don't think battery life was affected, but it did take a couple of complete charges and dis-charges before it got back into its normal swing.

<Title>Bear with me...
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am not exactly the most technologically savvy person.  I am good with computers and such however, I know next to nothing concerning mp3 players, palm pilots, cell phones, etc.  Up until now, cd players were fine with me.  However, this Christmas I recieved a 512 MB for Christmas.  I traded it in for a 1 GB because I wanted more space obviously.  So here I am with my new ipod and am estatic.  I felt pretty technogically savvy.  I am a college student and pile classes on two days (so I am at school the entire day).  After my first week of getitng my ipod and using at school, I fell in love with it.   I didn't know that it didn't have this or didn't have that.  I was content in plugging my earbuds into my ipod and turning it on to my favorite songs in between classes.  It was like I found the Holy Grail.  I don't want to spend $300 on a ipod that all I will want to do is listen to music on.  Video ipods.  Sure, video.  Neat.  But why?  Ahh, games on a ipod and a calender.  I can bring a gameboy with me and buy a wall calender.    To a simple average Joe like me who has no idea what's up with the newst gadgets, the shuffle was like finding you got the Noble Peace Prize, having your first baby, your marriage ceremony all over again, and getting your pay check all in one filling.  The shuffle, while may not have a LCD screen, games, videos, phone service capabilties, wi-fi connections, calenders, can shave your beard, fix your toilet, etc.  It is just enough for someone to want to sit down and listen to thier music.

<Content>I just bought a Shuffle for my wife and I am extremely jealous that she has one and I don't.  I almost bought the 20GB iPod, but decided that for what she needs, the Shuffle is much better.  This is the perfect device to use if you are an active person...it is extremely small and lightweight and unlike the regular iPod, it does not skip.  I am extremely impressed with the design and frankly think it is one of the coolest looking devices out there.  Not only is this thing unbelievably practical, but it is also extremely hip (I was amazed at the irrepressible urge I had to dance around like the dude in the commercial when I first used the Shuffle). My feeling is that there are other flash devices out there, but none even approaching the Shuffle's level of cool.

<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My husband got a 1GB shuffle this past weekend and I will be getting my own very soon.    There's not much to love about this audio player.  It's small (about the size of a thick stick of gum), it has great quality, and it look super-cool.  You can listen to songs in the playlist order or have the shuffle mix them up for you.  You can fast forward and rewind a song.  You can skip forward & backward to a new song.  Yes - there is no display, but it doesn't need one.  If it's your shuffle, you know what music you have and with iTunes you can choose what songs to put on your shuffle.  I really think that if you want ALL of your music with you - buy and ipod mini.  But, how many times do you really need that much music with you?  The ipod shuffle is great for errnads, exercising, working around the house and sitting in your room, and it costs about 1/2 of what a mini costs.  Three cheers (again) for Apple.  They truly are an innovator!

<Title>Best MP3 Player.  Period.
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was a bit skeptical about the shuffle at first, but I decided to go buy the 1GB version and just try it out.  I immediately fell in love with how small it is, which is a huge selling point for me because I only use it for when I'm walking around campus or when I'm at the gym.  The iPod MINI is still too heavy for me-- I don't want it weighing down my pants (I'd put it in my pocket) when I'm at the gym, and I just don't want to deal with the belt-clips.  The Shuffle doesn't weigh anything-- you could even just let it hang from the headphones if you wanted.  I don't need to listen to every single song that I have, so the 1GB gives me more than enough room for my favorite 130+ songs.  I've had it for just over two weeks and I'm still not tired of the songs on it.  You could also use the random-sync mode in iTunes to add songs at random to the player so that you get a surprise you turn it on.  Also, what's really incredible is that other than transferring the music to the device initially (it got a slight charge on the first day), the battery light still reads as "green."  It's supposed to go "green, amber, red" to let you know how the battery is holding up.  This thing has an incredible battery life, since I have been using it every day since I bought it for several hours a day.  The specs say 12 hours (I think) until the battery goes dead, but I'm sure I've been listening to it for way more than that.  My best friend bought one the same day (also the 1GB) and his battery has lasted a long time too.  We love the shuffle.  The only complaint that I have is that you have to use iTunes to get the music onto the device.  I'm not sure if there is any 3rd party software out there that will let you get around this, but I hate iTunes and so that's my only complaint.  The way I see it though, I'm only going to sync it every once in a while, and it's something that I'm happy to put up with in order to use this awesome MP3 player.  My other complaint is about the white iPod headphones that come with the Shuffle.  How can I put it nicely-- THEY SUCK.  They have absolutely NO bass response and they flatten out the tone of almost every song.  At first I was disappointed with the sound quality of the MP3s through the shuffle, but I switched to my good Sony headphones and there was a tremendous difference.  The songs sound so much better, and I felt relieved that it wasn't something wrong with the player itself (because there is no equalizer on the shuffle, but it's not needed).  Despite the fact that the iPod earphones look good and they have a short cord that doesn't get all tangled up all the time, I think that they are uncomfortable and don't sound good at all.  I've been looking for a great MP3 player for years, and this one definitely wins me over.  If you are in the market for an MP3 player, and you want something for the gym or something active, or if you just want to be discreet and not have some clunky player attached to your waist, this is definitely the way to go!

<Title>Practically Perfect...from a new iPod nut
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the 1gb iPod for a little over a week now, and this little thing has definitely changed the way I listen to music.  Not only is the design nifty, but it's INCREDIBLY easy to use, even without looking at it. The quality of the music is absolutely superb. I accidentally uploaded a sound check track from my home theatre system into it, and when I listened to the guys voice through the ear buds, it was *LITERALLY* 3-D sound. It raised the hairs on my neck! It's small and I wear it around my neck at the office (I'm a graphic designer...on the computer all day). The best use that I get out of my shuffle is at the gym. I can run on the track and use the eliptical with no problem, and then when I'm on the free weights and weight machines I can still listen to my music. Before, my jog-proof CD player was too cumbersome to keep up with when lifting. Right now I've got 260 songs, over 14 hours of music stored in here, and it's pretty much maxed out. I think there are 8mb left. So...maybe one more song. Ha ha.  As much as I'm in love with my new little toy, it's not without downfalls. My biggest concern is with the software and compatibility. I have Windows XP on my computer at home, and iTunes is CONSTANTLY bombing my system. I've read a few hints, tips and suggestions from others that have this problem, but it's still *very* tempermental. The only time it crashed is during transfers or iPod updates. The best tip I've learned is to uncheck the "connect to the internet if needed" box, but even with that, it's only at about 50% of what it should be. Something else that's not so much a complaint as it is a mystery...is that you're unable to fast forward through some songs. For example, I'm able to fast forward through all of the songs from RENT, but when I get to John Mayer...nada. I don't know if it's the way that the songs are coded, but it's an enigma nontheless. To some, the fact that it doesn't have a display is discouraging. I thought so too, until I was able to play with it. Even with 250 songs in mine, they're all alphabetical, and it's easy to locate them by toggling through them with the wheel. So, I can jump from Avenue Q to Jason Mraz with no problem. I rarely use it in the shuffle mode.  So, that's my honest review in a nutshell. Not without dissapointments on my end, but once the music is loaded, I'm in music wonderland.

<Title>The "Pet Rock" of mp3 Players
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a stunning example of marketing creating irrationally strong demand for poorly designed product. Despite the obvious visual design flair of the shuffle form factor for which Apple is famous, this is also an example of form over function. The lack of visual feedback (screen)is a stunningly poor ergonomic design choice...and one that is completely unnecessary. Potential buyers need to be aware that there are superior light weight flash memory mp3 players with screens, tactile buttons, and other features. And they are from mature companies who started making such players before the iPod was a gleam in Apple's eye. Somebody needs to say it. Despite Apple's legendary marketing hype, this is a very poor showing for their first generation flash memory player. Next they'll be touting the "zen" computer that is only a thin alabaster cord of finest imported synthetic polymers that plugs into nothingness. Hey, but it weighs almost nothing! Caveat emptor.

<Title>It seems that some people don't grasp the concept.
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, those of you who do not own the shuffle should not be writing reviews on the product. I've come across many reviews stating assumptions on the Shuffle's abilities/features. Just to clarify, the Shuffle does not have to play in Shuffle mode only! The idea of the Shuffle is to provide a cheap, effective flash drive media player and in this Apple has succeeded. Because the objective was to make it cheaper than other flash drive models, features were cut. There is no LCD and there is no EQ but do we really need to know the name of the song we're listening to? Despite the fact that the Shuffle lacks an EQ, the sound quality is superb. The beauty of the Shuffle lies in its simplicity. One of my roommates has an MP3 player by another manufacturer for which he paid more than I did and got 1/4 the song capacity of my Shuffle. The only difference between my Shuffle and his MP3 player; he has an LCD with 256 MB whereas I do not have an LCD but I do have 1 GB song capacity and paid 49 dollars less for my Shuffle. Decide for yourself if the LCD means that much to you.   I've had my Shuffle for a little over two weeks and the only foreseeable problem thus far is the USB guard (a small piece of hard plastic covering the USB) may become lost as it is not actually attached to the Shuffle itself; my roommate has already lost his and as the Shuffle hasn't been out for very long, Apple has yet to monopolize on the sale of extra guards. As for the Shuffle not being able to play some MP3's, the solution is simple; in the iPod options window make sure that it converts all other format songs to 128kbps AAC and all songs will play. Perhaps one other problem with the Shuffle (and I'm sure Apple will fix this with the next generation) is the play selector (shuffle or continuous) because it is flush with the rest of the Shuffle is kind of difficult to select the play style if your hands are wet or cold. Other than that the Shuffle is a great product in my opinion, but decide for yourselves.

<Title>iTunes for the road, at the right price.
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Shuffle is a great product not only because it is a great music player (the sound quality is fantastic), but because it greatly reduces the mobile price point for users of the best music service around - iTunes.  For $99, you can now export your iTunes library for listening. At that price you can buy one for you, your spouse, and each of your kids.  The unit works great. One thing which is mentioned in other reviews and worth repeating is that you do not need to play your songs in random order. Just add the songs you want to an iTunes play list and select that play list to fill your Shuffle. You can now play your Playlist in the order it appears in iTunes, or, if you prefer, in random order.  Either way, the Shuffle is a great product at a great price point. So far I can fit more songs than advertised, and the battery life looks like closer to 14 hours per full charge.   This is a great product which substantially reduces the affordability price point for iTunes, and I highly recommend it.

<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My friends campaigned me for several years to get an iPod. I was not a fan until I switched to the iBook and got iTunes, which helped organize my music tremendously. I saw this player the other day and decided to purchase it. While it holds around 240 songs, it's perfect for vacation or jogging. FYI, this is not the iPod you want to hold your entire library. For that, I'd suggest the iPod mini or 40GB.  It's great for jogging or commuting on the subway. While there's no display, the weight(or lack thereof) makes up for it. Plus, at $150, it's a great value and you can partition it to store data files. So essentially, you have a 1GB flash drive with music player, definitely a great accessory for work or travel. I guess I've officially switched to Mac!

<Title>Wonderful little piece of little plastic :)
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After weeks of waiting, I finally got my hands on an Ipod Shuffle. And I adore it. No LCD screen? Who cares.  1) If you haven't been living under a rock, you must know beforehand that the shuffle has no screen, so no need to complain when you look down and see nothing but white shining back at you! Most people put songs they know/like onto their playlist, so the lack of LCD isn't such a big deal. If you're looking for something with a screen, I don't know why you'd even consider buying the shuffle.  2) For those who bypass the worry of not having a screen: Apple sells the "Life is random" deal hard, but maybe you all don't enjoy constant randomness. I find the "nonshuffle" and "shuffle" to be fantastic at wiggling around to a set of songs I'd like to hear at the moment. (Beware: may take some patience, but out of 250 songs, which is enough for me, it only takes a couple of clicks.) When initially setting up my Shuffle playlist, I placed my songs in alphabetical order by author and grouped them all together. Simple enough. So when you put them onto the ipod, you know that songs by the same artist are together. (Note: if you typically like one song from each of your favorite artists, my method doesn't work. Sorry) Once that is done, say you're shuffling and feel like listening to only (insert band here). Find one of their songs, switch off shuffle mode and enjoy (insert band here) heaven. I said you have to be patient, but when dealing with fine things, patience is a must.  3) Who can resist the sleek look? Tell me! I couldn't. Call me a sucker but I have a weak spot for those beautiful Ipods.  So... yes you can find a similar product cheaper, I'm not going to lie. 1GB, that's nothing you might say, but I can't even name 10,000 songs, so 1GB is just enough for me, and maybe for you too. I've heard that the shuffle is great for people who exercise. I wouldn't know, you can ask someone who exercises. The shuffle also functions as a USB storage thing (you know what I'm talking about) that can hold files. Most laptops don't have A:/ drives anymore and a lot of people go out and buy those USB storage things to save or back-up files for around $50, give or take.   Function over form? Point is, the shuffle works and looks great. Sound quality is as good as a regular ipod and it just slides into your pocket. Say that the Ipod is "over-priced"? Buy a CD player then.   *Edit: woah, I just saw the guy's review above me. Apple really screwed over people who just bought an ipod recently. Good going Jobs... Anyway, I guess the mini is now only $50 more, not bad.

<Title>Great for what it is!
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my ipod shuffle for about 8 months now and I think it's just great. I usually use it at the gym and just put the songs on that will really get me going. Also, I will occasionally hook it up to an old set of computer speakers I have, and listen to it while I'm cooking dinner or in the bathtub. The sound out of the ipod itself is better then that of any walkman I have ever had.  The headphones they give you with it are flimsy and fall out of your ear easy (sound quality is just ok with them as well). I STRONGLY recommend you spring an extra 10 bucks on a pair of Sony headsets (the best in the industry in my opinion). I have had many many headsets in my day, and I can tell you that these last forever and the sound quality is outstanding (especially the bud-style ones); you will really get the most out of your ipod if you switch headsets. As mentioned by other people, there is no visible display for you to scroll through, but I don't mind this because I don't keep very many songs on it. For some reason, I have noticed that sometimes after you put new songs on it, unless you play those songs off the ipod while it is still plugged into the computer, sometimes the ipod will skip over the whole new sector of music as if you never put them on, looping back to the beginning. Some people seem to mind that it only holds a gigs worth of music, but I have yet to find the need to carry my entire music collection around my neck. I also highly recommend getting the battery life extender with this (its not very expensive, and 1 AAA battery extends the life of this thing by about 15-20 hours-great if you are a power runner)  But for what this thing is, its actually rather incredible. Its only 100 bucks (saves you about $250-$350), its very portable, and holds a gig of music (I have about 87 songs on mine at the moment and it's not even half way full). Bottom line: If your not looking to run a disco and just want something with some excellent sound quality to it while you are at the gym, walking to class, etc., this is a great buy.

<Title>Perfect for the ride to work
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use my shuffle mainly to listen to podcasts on the ride to work and back.  Radio broadcasts in my area are little... well boring.  The shuffle ends up working out perfectly.    Since I only carry about 5 podcasts at a time (each typically being a little over an hour long) I really don't miss having an interactive screen ala the 1G Nano.  I know what's on there and in what order so I save the extra $30 and bought a nice case (red Griffin metal case also sold on Amazon and its WONDERFUL!).    My only complaint would be that the slider on the back for the Off/On/Shuffle modes is a little too easily shifted into the wrong position but I'm really nit-picking here.  All in all a great product and worth it for those who don't need an interface or have a desire to store a ton of podcasts/songs.

<Content>I love the Shuffle.  It's easy to download and use.  It's lightweight so I can take it everywhere without feeling weighed down.  However, I was sent the wrong software, so it was an exercise in frustration getting started.  I had to IM Apple to receive the correct software.  It makes me want to get one with more memory.

<Title>How i see it
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been reading some reviews on this and it seems some are knocking off points for things that are not included on it. It's like buying a base model car and then giving it a poor review because it didn't happen to have power windows or heated mirrors.  The Apple Shuffle is a very simplistic, well thought out and great sounding device. It does not have a display window, an equalizer, folder options or an FM Tuner and microphone.I have a Creative Zen Micro that is nice, but this has better bass and a louder volume and is infinitely easier to use while I'm outside working or hanging out .I bought the Micro because I didn't want to be one of those ipod people but this thing is just perfect for  what it is . When I put it around my neck I forget it is there it is so light , and when I need to use the fuctions, I press the buttons over my shirt without having to look . People don't like the shuffle function? Well, load your songs up in the order you wish it to be in through your your Itunes and don't turn on the shuffle option on the player.It's only an option, not a conspiracy to keep you wondering what is coming up next . I have a dual layer silicone skin with it and i can bounce it off a wall, have it land in a puddle of water and wipe it off, turn it on and it will still play. I love this thing for what it is and you can keep your bells and whistles and love what you have ... but leave this one alone . It rocks.

<Title>Vastly inferior to the Creative Zen Nano
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At the same $99 price point, the Creative Zen Nano has twice as much storage; a display screen; the ability to record via built-in microphone; the ability to play protected WMA files without converting to Apple's crappy AAC format, the ability to load MP3s directly into the machine without having to install Itunes, and the ability to tune in to FM broadcasts. Buy that product instead! The only reason to buy the iPod is if you want to be trendy and look cool by having the apple "name brand" item instead of a competitor.  (And if you're that hard up to look cool,  my sympathies.)

<Title>Beware the Blinking Lights of Death
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I fully enjoyed this product. I'd even go so far as to say I loved the shuffle. Up until the day it stopped working...  13 months of bliss only to reside in a landfill. There appears to be a defect with this product that Apple doesn't seem to acknowledge. Basically it stops playing music, computers refuse to recognize the USB device, and any button pressed on the shuffle results in blinking green/amber lights. For more information on the problem see: discussions.apple.com/forum.jspa?forumID=823. 400+ complaints of broken shuffles.  Luckily I had an extended warrenty on the device and replaced it with a 1G nano.  It was quite the utilitarian product. Loved the USB drive + music player idea; however, this is pretty much a buyer beware product.

<Title>The latest news about iPod family
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>**** LATEST update to iPod family **** - iPod & iPod photo lines merged; no more iPod photo 30 GB - iPod comes in two capacities - 20 GB ($299), 60 GB ($399) with color screen & photo support - U2 iPod (20 GB) down to $329 from $349 - with color screen & photo support - iPod shuffle 1 GB down to $129 from $149 - iPod 60 GB down to $399 from $449 - new version of iTunes (4.9) that support podcasts *************************************** This is not a review of iPod shuffle as such - great reviews are available already.  Here is some information that might help in deciding which iPod to go for.  Apple announced a major upgrade to the iPod lineup today (23 Feb 2005).  The biggest advantage is the reduction in price ($ per GB) and improvement in battery life. Another significant change is that USB 2.0 is being emphasized although FireWire continues to be supported. AC adapter is USB based instead of FireWIre and the FireWire based AC adapter still sells as a separate product.   The impact on iPod mini:  > A new model, iPod mini 6 GB is introduced for $249  > iPod mini 4 GB now priced at $199 ($50 down from earlier price)  > Change in colors - now mini is available in new shades of Silver, Blue, Pink, and Green (the Gold color is discontinued)  > Major improvement in battery life - up to 18 hours (was 8 hours earlier)  > AC adapter ($29) and firewire cable ($19) no longer shipped with mini (you may not need them really)  > iPod mini 4 GB and 6 GB now ship with only three things: earphones, belt clip, and USB 2.0 cable > The indicators on the click wheel now match the color of the iPod mini  The impact on bigger iPods:  > iPod 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 40 GB is discontinued  > iPod photo 30 GB (new product) replaces the 40 GB iPod photo and the regular iPod 40 GB  > iPod photo 60 GB now costs $150 less -- $449 instead of $599  > iPod photo 30 GB costs $349 ($150 less than iPod photo 40 GB and $50 less than regular iPod 40 GB)  > iPod dock ($39), AV cable ($19), carrying case ($29), and firewire cable ($19) do not ship with iPod photo (you may not really need them)  > Now we get three things with iPod photo: earphones, USB based AC adapter, USB 2.0 cable > In additon to the above, a firewire cable continues to ship with iPod 20 GB & iPod U2 edition > iPod photo Camera Connector is introduced - this can be used for connecting your digital camera directly to the iPod   With these changes, there is an interesting $50 gap between:  > iPod 20 GB and iPod photo 30 GB  > iPod mini 6 GB and iPod 20 GB (as earlier)  > iPod mini 4 GB and iPod mini 6 GB  > iPod shuffle 1 GB and iPod mini 4 GB  > iPod shuffle 512 MB and iPod shuffle 1 GB (as earlier)   Price, size, weight, and ease of use are major considerations while buying an iPod shuffle.  If price is the only factor, iPod mini could be a better choice over shuffle.  I have all the models of iPod (shuffle, mini, regular 40 GB, and photo 60 GB) and I find myself sticking to the iPod photo 60 GB since it carries all my music and has a better, color-based user interface.

<Content>The 1 GB ipod Shuffle is my first MP3 player.  What attracted me most was the small size and the reputation of Apple.  I absolutely love this thing!  The sound is great and i tunes is very easy to use.  Loaded software fine.  It rips CD's quick and no problems using this with XP.  I did not want something complex and bulky.  I have a long commute and have no problems with battery or the capacity.  I would suggest the 1 GB unit.  I also purchased the docking station and case for using the unit when skiing - which this thing was absolutely made for.  Buy one if you can find one!!!!

<Title>AAC Misconception
<Date>Fri Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just recently recieved my iPod shuffle and am very pleased with it.  Once again, Apple's attention to detail is readily apparent.    One thing I have noticed in some of the reviews is the misunderstanding of the AAC format which is the prefered format to use on the shuffle (although MP3 and other formats will also play).  AAC in a nutshell is the next generation MP3 format.  You could almost call it MP4.  AAC stands for "Advanced Audio Codec" which just means it has higher audio fidelity with the same size files as MP3.  Apple did not invent AAC as explained in the following quote from their website: "AAC was developed by the MPEG group that includes Dolby, Fraunhofer (FhG), AT&T, Sony, and Nokia-companies that have also been involved in the development of audio codecs such as MP3 and AC3 (also known as Dolby Digital)." [...]    What Apple did add is AAC with digital rights management, which is for songs bought on iTunes. It prevents excessive copying of the files to prevent pirating.  Pretty much all online music stores use some type of digital rights management.  The shuffle will play AAC with DRM, basically iTunes purchased songs, in addition to many formats for non DRM songs.     As for the person who had problems playing MP3's on their shuffle, I would suggest converting all their MP3's to AAC format which can be easily done in iTunes.  Remember to set the import encoder in Preferences to AAC not MP3, and the select in the Advanced menu, Convert to AAC. Of course Apple should and probably will fix this problem with a software update for the iPod.  These software updates are free and load into the iPod from iTunes.  Sometimes Apple will even add features to existing products with software updates.  I hope this was helpful.  Still loving my Shuffle.

<Title>Good choice for my needs
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have read several reviews of this player before purchasing. Some gave bad reviews for lack of LCD screen or FM player. It is obvious that they do not own this player, and are just giving bad reviews because of the absence of these features. Reviews should only be provided by people who actually have purchased and used the device.  I currently own an Apple iPod 20 gb 3rd generation, and I love it. I was going on a medical mission trip to Honduras, and I just didn't want to take my harddrive based player. I also wanted something to take to the gym from time-to-time. I purchased the iPod 1 gb Shuffle player. I have just returned from my mission trip, and I must say thet it met my needs as expected.   - Works flawlessly with iTunes and did not cause any problems on the computer where I have iTunes installed for my iPod 20 gb. I can just transfer the songs in my current library that I want to listen to manually, or it can chose songs for me automatically at random.   - Does not have a FM tuner, but so what. Not much FM music I wanted to listen to in Honduras or on an airplane.   - No LCD screen to see what I am listening to. So what, I am trying to relax on the airplane, in my room, or working out. Also, I should know generally what songs are in my library. I shouldn't have to look to see what I am listening to, and I wouldn't want to interrupt whatever I am doing just to check out the name of a song or the artist, etc. I can do that later if I want.   - It is very light.   - Controls are simple and easy to use.   - Battery life is very good, 11-12 hours of continuous playing. Recharges in about 4 hours.  Recommendations:  - If you own an Apple iPod, and want something light to take to the gym or commuting, than I would recommend the iPod Shuffle. Works flawlessly with iTunes and your current library.   - If you don't own an Apple iPod, and/or you want a flash-based player with an LCD and FM tuner, then go buy something else. Just don't provide bad reviews on something you have never tested yourself.

<Title>this little thing rocks my world
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my iPod Shuffle after spending a week debating between it and an iPod mini.  I'm an Mac-user, and I used iTunes long before I thought about buying the Shuffle, so there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to buy an iPod of some type, because I feel from my experience that Apple products are very high quality.  Luckily I had two friends: One with a iPod Mini and one with an iPod Shuffle, both of whom were very satisfied with their respective products.  I didn't buy the iPod mini because I felt the Shuffle was exactly what I was looking for and the iPod mini was a bit too much for what I wanted, but the Mini's are very cool.  However, I have not for one second regretted buying my Shuffle.     For a simple, cool little Mp3 player, the value of a Shuffle can't be beat.  First of all, the value of using it as a flash drive is almost alone worth the price.  1GB is a huge amount of storage for something this small.  It weighs next to nothing, and if you don't watch, you'll leave it in your jacket pocket and lose it.  However, good things come in small packages and the sound quality is just plain awesome.      With their "Life is Random" slogon, it is amazing that Apple has launched such a great advertising campaign based upon what many see as a flaw: the lack of a screen.  I feel that this actually benefits from the lack of a screen.  It wouldn't be as light and the battery life wouldn't be as long if it had a back-lit LCD screen, and in my opinion the screen on most flash Mp3 players (telling you only the name of the song that is playing) is kind of useless and pointless.  I've had my Shuffle for a month, and I've never felt that I once desired a screen.  Sometimes I let the iTunes software fill it up with autofill and it's cool to listen to it on shuffle mode and get surprised with what comes up.  iTunes will also let you set up a playlist in order which you can play straight through.    Other flash players in this price range do not have this much storage.  I'd honestly take the extra space over a un-necessary screen anyday.  All of my friends with non-Shuffle flash-based Mp3 players are jealous of my Shuffle.    Some people sometimes complain that the only way to charge the Shuffle is through a USB port unless you buy an adaptor from Apple.  To be honest, there are computers everywhere today, and almost any one around will be able to charge the Shuffle.  The battery life is really 12 hours like they say it is.  The fact that the USB port is right on the Shuffle is much nicer than a real iPod if you want to use it as a flash drive.  If you want to use a real iPod to transfer data, you need to carry a USB cable with you.  The shuffle is much more convenient because it plugs right in.  The connection may or may not be as fast as firewire, but if you've got USB 2.0 ports on your computer, it's plenty fast enough.         The only downside to any iPod is that while the earphones sound great, they're not the most comfortable earphones.  Some people I know complain that they always fall out.  I don't have this problem, but I find that they feel uncomfortable after a couple hours of being in my ears.  It's not enough to make me buy a different set, but it's sometimes a bit annoying.  Still, if you factor in an extra $20 for the cost of different set of earphones, it's still well-worth the price.  This is a great Mp3 player if you want something to run with, fit in your pocket at work, listen to on the subway, or use also as a quality flash drive to store data on.  This is NOT for people who want to put all of their music on it with 70 different playlists to choose from and keep a calendar and everyone's addresses on it.  Get a real iPod if that's what you want.  If you want an ultra-portible, great-sounding, good-value-for-your-money music player that is easy to use, doubles as a convenient flash drive, has good software, and has good battery life, by all means go for the Shuffle and you'll love it.

<Title>Does Exactly What Apple Says
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is ideally suited for sports and uses where you just press play and go. If you really need a music player with a display then buy one with a display, do not show your ignorance by faulting a system for not doing something it was not designed to do.  People do not accuse the Porche 911 of not being an off-road vehicle or a boat, so why would you expect a music player designed around not having a screen, to have a screen.

<Title>Had initial compatability issues with Windows
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Out of the box this was very difficult to get working on a modern windowsXP machine - this for someone with a masters degree in computer science who's had absolutely no trouble using a variety of USB devices (including music players) with this computer.  I won't go through all the gory details but in my case getting the latest copy of the "Apple ipod updater" put me on the path to success.  It's hard to believe they did any serious windows testing, especially based on all the Windows people with similar problems on the Apple shuffle message board.  Now that it's finally working I've liked it, has good sound quality, very easy to operate and especially easy to fill it up with music.  Press one button and it will fill it with music from your itunes library or any playlist you want.  I like that it charges itself from the USB port as well.  Windows users, especially novices, might want to wait a bit for them to update the software that ships with the players - on my configuration there was absolutely no way to make it work using what shipped on the installation CD.

<Title>It's so very wee!!!
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a 20 gig iPod, and I often worry about messing it up by accidentally dropping it or something. I go running regularly, and it occurred to me that if I dropped the iPod while I was running It would be a goner for sure. With its moving parts and harddrive, it was way too vulnerable. I saw the iPod shuffle, which is a flash memory player, and I knew that I had to have it. It is not invincible, but it does not have the moving parts that my 20 gig has. Also it is half the price of the other, and it is so very portable. It is fantastic. Some skeptics commented to me about the lack of a screen, but when I am doing something, I usually don't have time to check the screen every time a new song comes on to see what it is. Also, wouldn't you know what songs you have? THis player holds around 200 songs and that may seem like a lot, but it is not. You should know what songs you have, it is not as if there are thousands like on a regular iPod. SO in conclusion, this mp3 player is totally awesome.

<Title>It's very coooool, it's very cute, BUT...
<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player for myself this past Christmas. I looked at the iPod Shuffle because it was very cool looking, very light, very elegant, very small, about the thickness of 2 sticks of chewing gum. I rate this 2 stars just because of the coolness and cuteness factor.  Then I dug deeper, looked at the Apple iPod site and started to think. - What if I don't want to hang it around my neck? I probably will need some kind of case to protect it. They seem to sell cases only in 3 packs, costing $25 - $30. And the cases seem to come only in cutesy colors like bubblegum pink, lime green, grape purple. Or I could spend that same $25 - $30 on an armband / beltclip type of case. - What if I'm on the road and cannot get to my computer to charge up? No problemo, I could fork over another $25 - $30 for a standalone charger. Or I could buy a twin AAA battery pack for another $25 - $30. But with that twin AAA battery pack, the iPod shuffle would be just like any other MP3 player, except it doesn't have a screen. But adding a battery 2-pack kinda defeats the main selling points. It would no longer be ultra-small, ultra-thin, ultra-light and ultra-cool. - What if I want to listen to a certain tune? Without a screen, would I have to blindly fast forward through all my 240 tunes to find the one I want to listen to? - The biggest problem was that internal battery. Eventually, you will no longer be able to charge it. And you will need to replace your iPod Shuffle. For me, that was the deal-breaker.  The owners have these comments in general. - Some people don't get the 12 hours of battery life that is promised in the ad. And everytime the battery runs down, they'll be without their Shuffle because it's recharging. And recharging takes 4 hours. And they'll be tying up one of their USB ports. - Some people are not too happy about being forced to buy a new Shuffle when (NOT IF) the battery can no longer be charged. The battery replacement fee is about the same as the cost of a new iPod Shuffle. - Some people write that a screen is not necessary, that if you didn't like the tune, you shouldn't have loaded it and that they aren't looking at the screen anyway. I agree with everything. However, some of us have a life. When I work out, I want to listen to my high adrenaline tunes. At the end of a workday, I want to unwind with my mellow tunes. When I'm concentrating, I like to listen to classical music at a very low volume. And my MP3 player has all my favourite high adrenaline, mellow and classical stuff in separate folder (playlists). But I still need a screen to fast forward to the type of tunes I want to hear depending on what I'm doing. - Some people have a hard time setting up, getting iTunes to work properly with their iPod Shuffle. - Some people think the cost of those extra iAccessories is outrageous.  Random may be the New Order, but hey, LIFE IS ABOUT CHOICE!!! To quote Shania Twain, "That Don't Impress Me Much".  So, if you're an iCult member, and you need a cool, cute, light, small, trendy, elegant MP3 player which will hold about 240 tunes and you don't mind the "I'm-stuck-with-iTunes-my-iAccessories-are-expensive-I-need-to-replace-this-in-3-years" concept, this is the perfect device for you.  I bought the SanDisk 1G Silver MP3 player. It's not as "in", not as small, not as elegant, not as hip, not as cute, not as fashionable, not as thin, not as cool, not as light, not as trendy as the iPod Shuffle. On the bright side, I won't have to replace it every 3 years. It takes good ol' standard 1.5V AAA batteries so I'll never have to wait for it to recharge, never worry about being out of power. I always carry a spare battery or 2, I just pop in a rechargeable battery (which takes about 3 seconds). I can be running my MP3 player non stop. And no matter where in the world I go, I can always find some AAA batteries. It has a screen so I can easily find the tune I really want to listen to at any time. It also has a radio which I can listen to for a change of pace and to get the news. And I can record with the built in voice recorder. Oh yeah, and the SanDisk 1G Silver MP3 player costs less too! :) And That Do Impress Me Much!!!

<Title>IPod shuffle over hyped product
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>iPod shuffle has a major flaws. If you are updating your music and you accidentally remove your ipod out of the USB, iPod will be damage.In short you cannot anymore use your iPod. Secondly, if you have multiple computer at home, say desktop and laptop, you can not use your iPod to both computer. It is only dedicated to one computer only. If ever you choose to go ahead and try to use the other computer, which was not the initial computer you use your iPod, you end up over writing your current iPod music. This royally suck. My advise not to buy any product from iPod. Best choice is SANDISK product.

<Title>Good Product
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The apple ipod shuffle is a good device to have if you want something that is small and protable but can also hold a sufficient amount of music.  1GB gives you enough music without having a very large device.  The major downfall to the ipod shuffle is you cannot select music.  You have to scan through the music if you are looking for a specific song.  This is a good product and I would recommend it strongly.

<Title>Perfect for the gym
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Working out in the gym with my 40gb Ipod became dangerous. I dropped the thing more often than I personally cared to. I even went and bought a metal titanium case for it and I continued dropping it so frequently that the case is now dented and scratched.  I bought the shuffle for the following reasons. I wanted something small and something I wouldn't freak out about if I dropped it. The shuffle met both of those criteria.   For me it holds 13 hours of music, which is more than enough for the gym and it comes with a lanyard so I can wear it around my neck. Yeah, you look a little dorky with the thing around your neck, but it's great for cardio and for weight training. The headphone cord never gets into the way when I'm lifting. I also use it when I'm boxing and hitting the heavy bag. Again, it doesn't get in the way. There are armbands available for it as well, but I'd give the lanyard a try before spending the money and see if you like it.   I'm not at all bothered by the fact I can't see what track is playing on a screen mostly because I'm using it at the gym and I rarely looked down at the screen of my 40gb ipod when I worked out with it. It's simple to use and it connects through my laptop's usb port when I want to change the music on it and charge it. The battery lasts a long time. If I charge it once a week (and I'm using it every day) it's a lot.   If you need something with a screen spend the money and get a nano. If you don't care about that and just want your music portable this is great. I do think it's better for people who are going to the gym or running or doing any activity with it. It seems perfectly suited for that. I don't see people being happy with this as their primary MP3 player.

<Title>Great for people who just want music without the fuss or price.
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Shuffle is great!  I am the type of person who really doesn't care what music comes on my MP3 player (This is because I loaded the music in it).  So seeing the title and the artist really doesn't matter.  I creat the playlist in iTunes and update my Shuffle with the appropriate Playlist for what I am doing.  1 GB is plenty for your everyday activities.  Who needs to carry 5 GB (who listens to that much music running or bike-ridding?)  I am training for a 26.2 mile ruck-march and my Shuffle carries more than enough music to keep me going.  Battery time is more than adequate.  The size is also another great feature.  I can attach it to my arm-band or just stuff it in my pocket.  Overall, a great buy for those who preffer to just listen to their music, not watch it.

<Content>The review below is very complete, but it neglects to include my personal favorite thing about my iPod shuffle.  My shuffle has accidentally been both run through the wash in my pocket and run over by my car.  It still works perfectly, and bears only a few pockmarks on the corner.  When I got the shuffle, I was debating between upgrading to nano or not, but now I'm glad I didn't, because I doubt the nano could have taken such punishment.

<Title>A good buy for first time MP3 Player buyers
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my IPod Shuffle for about week now.  The price is extremely decent if you're not looking to spend $300 on an MP3 player (I know I wasn't).  I know there's a lot of rumors going around that you HAVE to play your music in random order, that is totally a myth.  You have option to pick what goes on your IPod and whether you want it to play straight through or shuffled.  Another cool feature is that you can have ITunes randomly fill your IPod with music from your library, but it's not necessary.  The 1 GB size is plenty if you don't have too much music that you want to carry around with you, I don't think I've even manually filled up my IPod yet, but then again I don't have much music.  As for the issue of not having a display screen, I can see how that would bother some people, but so far, it hasn't been an issue with me at all.  If you're new to the MP3 player world, I would recommend the Shuffle as a starter, the price is right, and there is still lots of room for music.

<Title>SHUFFLE ROCKS
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Finally, an MP3 player that fits the "pocket". The iPOD Shuffle weighs only 20 grams, costs only 149.00 USD (1 GB), plays great music and doubles up as a USB (2.0) storage device.   Controls - Intuitive: ------------------- Front:  A circular control handles the Volume Up, Volume Down, Skip, Repeat. At the center is the Play/Pause button. All accessible at the touch of the thumb.   Back:  A sleek slider control for power off, play shuffle mode and play continuous mode, ensures that you don't accidentally switch the player on/off. Also at the back is the battery status button.   Uploading Music - A breeze: --------------------------- Uploading songs to your iPOD Shuffle is a breeze with the bundled iTUNES, an award-winning digital-jukebox software.   iTUNES:   - Library, a great music organizer. Add songs individually or by the folder.  - Drag and Drop the songs from your iTUNES Library into your iPOD Shuffle - that simple.  - Search songs in Browse mode by Genre, Artist and Album. The quick search filters the song list as you type which is very fast and effective.  - Import/Convert Audio CD into pristine-quality AAC file format.  - Burn custom playlists to CDs and MP3 CDs.  - Party Shuffle, which keeps a queue of songs at the ready that you can rearrange.  - Radio, more than 250 free Internet radio stations.  - Also nifty playlists being "My Top Rated", "Recently Added", "Recently Played", "Top 25 Most Played".   Charging and Battery Life: -------------------------- Plug it into the computer USB port or alternatively via the iPOD Shuffle Battery back (sold separately) and you are ready for up to 12 hours of pure music.   Headphones: ------------ The signature white earbud headphones deliver a sharp sound quality.   I was looking for a simple yet sleek, light, inexpensive mp3 player that plays good music and the iPOD Shuffle delivers just that. Not having an LCD screen on the iPOD Shuffle does not bother me a zilch. I have been using the iPOD Shuffle every single day since my purchase (well almost) and not once has it jumped a song.   Simple is beautiful and Apple proved it once again.

<Title>This player is awesome!!
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>And not just as an "entry level MP3 player"  If your looking for a player that you don't have to worry about damaging in hostile environments and takes up nothing for space, this is the one. The controls on this player are actually very conducive to being used while working with gloves on, mountain biking, skateboarding, etc. The control wheel is so simple; you can operate it through your pant leg while it's in your pocket. The battery has lasted me well over a 10-hour day.  I see complaints of NO DISPLAY here, why?   Why do you need a display? You don't know what songs you've loaded? You can't hear the volume level? It has a button and an LED light on the back that checks the battery level. It has an LED light that alternates colors/patterns based on what the player is doing.  WHAT A STUPID COMPLAINT!!  A display would only further tax battery recourses. I suppose you want it backlit too??  I'm not sure if the play list mimics the order shown in Itunes, but mine, when in non shuffle mode, plays in order based on artist, I know what I loaded in the player so I know how many times to push the FWD button to get to the song I want, HOW SIMPLE IS THAT?? There is NO need for a POWER DRAINING DISPLAY!! I use this player during all manner of work including construction (with only one ear bud in for safety) and only a few times has moving and leaning against framing or a ladder caused the buttons to be pushed unintentionally. The player is so light it can hang from the headphones and not come unplugged, it' so small and thin you don't even notice it in your pocket when your climbing a ladder or crawling through things. I bought a RCA Kazoo when they first came out and it only held 64MB WITH an expansion card, to get any decent number of songs on it you had to compress the songs into oblivion with MP3PRO and they sounded like poo. It HAD a DISPLAY and ran on 2 AAA batteries and they didn't even last a WHOLE DAY. The controls were such that you had to pull it out of your pocket and look at it to navigate. This Ipod Shuffle ROCKS!! You can wear it on an amusement park ride and the buttons are so easy to use, you can hit play right before or sometimes even while seated on the ride to start the music.  I rip all my CD's at 192kb and I use this Ipod for my car stereo now, it works great. In my truck I have a system with a crossover, 2 amps, 2 sets of mids and tweets and 2 10" subs, I took the AM/FM/CD deck out completely, and bought 2 cords from radio shack with RCA's on one end and a mini jack on the other, one for the car and one for my home stereo, the Shuffle plays perfectly in both environments.   Itunes on the other hand is not all that. I've been using Windows Media Player to manage my digital music files and Version 9 or 10 both flat smoke Itunes. Updating songs in Itunes is hit or miss, sometimes they show up, sometimes they don't, the spreadsheet style of sorting being the only option blows. The folder/tree style of Media Player is light years better and better emulate a computer's file handling style. I got no warning deleting a song from my library in Itunes, that it would also delete it from the physical disk. Media Player asks when you delete a file, "From the library only, or from the physical disk also"   The most annoying thing I found with my Shuffle experience is, during the installation of the Ipod software I noticed the Ipod becomes available as a "removable disk", so I thought COOL!! I can just tag the songs I want and drag them to the removable drive, what could be simpler than that?!?! Nope. Once Itunes loads it removes the "removable disk" icon from "My Computer", that's weak. I even tried to go around it and install the drivers and not Itunes, I can load the songs on the Ipod but they wont play, and I had to reformat the Ipod to remove them.  All in all, this is a great player if you're looking for a true pocket sized device that holds a lot of music, you have to think to yourself, self, remember when I owned a CD case and CD Walkman? Well, with this player, I can carry about 15 CDs and the Walkman in my pocket, and still work, or run or whatever. Once you get play lists worked out that you can load to suit your needs it's even better.   I would give the player 5 stars and the Itunes 1 star if that was an option.  I am running windows XP with all the current patches and transferring songs in Itunes works without issue. I had to get a USB 2.0 Card because my notebook only has USB 1.0, the Ipod works great on the USB 1.0 port, it's just slower.

<Title>Just Got My 1Gb Shuffle
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just got my 1Gb Shuffle and what can I say that has not already been said. This little iPod is beautifully designed, easy to use, sounds great and seems to run forever on a charge. I've run mine on the studio sound system all day long (14 hours) and it's still going strong! The documentation only claimed 12 hours per charge, but I'm guessing that I'll leave before this thing runs out of juice. It sounds great too, perhaps better than my Mini. Is there a negative? Not really, but if I were to grouse a bit it would be about how long it took me to get mine. I ordered it 6 weeks ago! As for the shuffle itself-the feature that converts high res mp3s to 128mb AACs took a longer than I thought it would-almost 1.5 hours. However the non-conversion auto fill ran acceptably fast (7 minutes). My hat's off to Apple-you guys make great things!

<Title>True Genius
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple combines three brilliances in one: superb industrial design, excellent engineering, and perhaps most impressively, marketing that targets (and helps foster) consumer desire/need like almost no other high-tech company.  One the design front, Apple has reduced the already intuitive iPod interface to a level of simplicity that's just a half step short of a one-button mouse. The slider switch on the Shuffle's rear provides two modes: shuffle or linear play. The buttons on the front give you the sort of controls every tape deck or CD player makes familiar: play/pause, next track/fast-forward, previous track/fast-rewind, volume up, volume down. That's it - that's the entire Shuffle interface.  Deskside, the iTunes software is also very simple to use, and the linkage between iTunes and the Shuffle is effortless. You can create a specific list of songs for the Shuffle by dragging and dropping from your library (which you can populate by ripping your own CDs or seamlessly downloading from the iTunes store), or even better, you can let iTunes fill the Shuffle with a random selection of songs from your library.  The marketing brilliance is two-fold: on the hand, Apple has realized that many of us who own traditional iPods typically listen to them in shuffle mode. I rarely listen to albums on my 20GB iPod, and I rarely use playlists. Given that, and given that I've selected all the music on my iPod, I don't really need a display. I rarely want to look for a specific song, and I never need to be told what's playing.  Second, 1GB = 240 or so songs, which is more than enough for a cross-country flight (or an international flight, really, given that you don't listen to your iPod every minute), or a good day's roadtrip. I typically travel with a laptop that holds hundreds of CDs worth of material from which I can refill the Shuffle every day. If you're listening at the gym for an hour or two, you wouldn't even need to reshuffle your Shuffle more than every few days.  These marketing innovations - no display, and no moving disk - greatly lessen the load on the Shuffle's battery. That allowed Apple engineers to get enough of a play charge out of a small, very light battery. The result is that the Shuffle almost ceases to exist when carried on its lanyard or in a pocket. I now find it impossible to "lug" around my regular iPod.  Apple's entry price for the 512MB makes for flashy ads, but it's worth opting for the pricier 1GB model. As delivered, they're both usable, but most users will find charging the Shuffle off a computer's USB port to be onerous and slow; thus a $29 charger is needed. Those buying a Shuffle for use while running will also need to invest in an armband. Each of the increments is small, but before you know it, the flashy entry price point has more than doubled. Is it worth the final price? Absolutely.

<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just picked one up for my son's birthday, being he's turning nine I figured I'd make sure I could figure out how it worked.  It took me a minute to get everything firing on all cylinders, but I think that was mostly due to the fact that I've been rejecting Windows updates...once I updated windows things got easy.  Obviously, this is all of the good things that you already know: Portable, durable, affordable and really decent amount of storage for the price.  Don't be put off by 'only' 1/2 a gig in the $99 model or 1 full gig in the $149...there are mp3s on the market upwards of 40 gigs, but you don't need all of that.  I got the small one, put about 6 hours of music on there and it was half full..it's plenty.  This is my first mp3 player, but I really like it and plan on going and getting myself one tomorrow morning.

<Title>well designed and fills in some of the gaps that ipod leaves
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had an ipod that died shortly after 1 year of use.  The hard drive died.  That was a big bummer for me as I thought the initial investment of $470.00 was worth it.  Now I know better, albeit a week out of warranty.  So, vowing never to purchase another ipod, I find myself with one.  My original ipod was well taken care of and was never dropped or even removed from it's case.  The thing is that I run and walk alot.  I walk at least 3 miles a day and run for 45 minutes.  The hard drive on a regular ipod has movable parts and can skip.  I didn't know this when I bought it.  I thought, when I bought it, that I would be listening to all my CDS and needed to fit them in my pocket.  What I found out was that I neither wanted to listen to the bulk of my collection nor wanted to wade through screens to get to what I wanted.  Also, the battery life was dismal, I always had to connect to a computer anyway, and usually when I did I would just make my new playlists on there, as opposed to the ipod itself.   Since all my music was encoded in AAc format, I knew I had to get a player that would play my files.  So, after looking at several other flash-based players, I did choose the ipod shuffle, begrugingly.   Really, a flash player was what I needed all along, I just didn't know it.  What I like about the shuffle is that it has the one-handed, in your pocket convenience instead of a touch pad (I had the 30 GIG model).  It is now much easier to move along to the song I want.  The sound was really, really crappy when I used my $100 Sennheiser headphones with it (sounded like mono spilt to stereo signal), but it sounds FABULOUS with Apple's earbuds, which happen to be too big for my small female ears.  I've developed a callous on my ear from trying to shove it back in a million times while I run.  Which brings me to: if it's meant for people who are active, wouldn't you provide more secure earbuds, like the ones that clip on to your ear????    There is no perfect product out there, but assessing what you essentially need a product for will help determine whether an ipod shuffle will fit the bill or another player.  If I wasn't Mac-based, I would consider other flash players that use rechargeable batteries that you can replace without sending it in to Apple.  Addendum:  After just a few months of use, the shuffle will not mount on my G5.  Apparently there is a hardware error that prevents it from mounting.   It shows up on the system log.  Of course, there is virtually nothing on Apple's site that goes into this problem, but on other sites it is well documented. The shuffle works fine, but I cannot add anything.  So, it's going back to Apple, where others in my situation have been told that it's a "hardware" error.  Basically, the operating system doesn't want to recognize or mount the FAT drive. Wish me luck!

<Title>Ok, everybody think of its actual purpose.
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Will this thing play your songs out of the box? No, you have to use iTunes to set it up. But isn't that true about every iPod? Or for that matter every MP3 player. That's always hit me as the "weak link but not quite" in the MP3 player realm. If you can set it up beforehand on the computer then what's the point, as the capacity of MP3 players gets smaller, of setting up the MP3 player through the unit itself? I can see the need on high capacity MP3 players, but there's only so much you can set up on smaller capacity players that the setup options tend to get in the way since there aren't that many songs on it anyway.  How I think about this is this is like a portable radio with one station tuned in. Your own. And when you think about it, since you already know the names of the songs anyway you really don't need to know what's playing to enjoy it. You don't have, on traditional radios, anything more than the dial to show you what station you're on.  And again, there are a select few songs downloaded to this player to begin with. It's not meant to hold your entire library. It can't. Physically it can't.  The iPod Shuffle is for quick runs around the park, trips to the grocers, errands that don't take that much time, work that doesn't last more than 8-10 hours. that kind of stuff. It's certainly not for road trips, long plane flights or extended listening (over a week or more).  It has a very specific use that the original iPod is just overkill for.  And man is it tough. I must have dropped it more than 4 times in the time I've had it and it plays as well as it did when I first loaded it up. It's scratched a little, but I don't mind. I'm just handling it more gently now and I'm going to buy a "skin" for it. But despite it being scratched a little it still looks cool.  The sound is extraordinary! I found that the earbuds that it comes with are the best for it. My big earphones barely pick anything up. And my other various earbuds from other devices also barely pick anything up unless I turn the volume way up. Nice bass, nice tone.  The interface is logically possitioned.  The one gripe. The lanyard. It plugs into the USB plug. Not to the player itself. So if anybody comes along and snatches it it's pretty easy to do.  And if you want, get the "dock". It's not really a dock except in physical design. It's more of an extension cord. And I've used many other devices through it and they work just fine. It turns out to have a practical purpose beyond the designers' intention.  I just wish people had a better understanding of the differences between MP3 players and what dirty tricks other companies use to fit the claimed amount of songs on a 256MB player.  Just be aware that other companies are using dishonest marketing tactics to fool the public as Apple comes out with these products and services and gobbles up more of the marketshare than the rest are comfortable with. Last I heard it was 92% of the market.

<Title>The Ipod Shuffle
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to say that when i bought this i was very excited to be able to run with this while listening to music.  It's a hardy little item, but now, you can get much more for your money.  The thing with this, being that it was one of the older orginal ipods, is there were still some "bugs" that needed fixing, for instance whenever i tried to download updates on my ipod shuffle with the new software it never STAYED downloaded, it would download, but once i unplugged it from the computer, and then re-plugged it, it would say that i still needed the same update.  Also some songs caused the ipod to freeze up, im not sure if this was the songs or the ipod though.  It's a cute item, and with the apple case you can buy seperately it stays spotless and its splash-proof, but compared to the new ipods it's old news.  However the new ipods scratch easily, so i suggest waiting for new ones that are stronger and more durable than the the nano, and video ipod. Also, if you wait for apple to fix its current problems, you could win free items like the nano among other things(viza gift cards, psp's, etc.) just by searching on this engine powered by google(its legitimate, i was very skeptical at first to)---->  http://www.blingo.com/friends?ref=JgVcU4-cRE5XGTQ-1ZyZ_sCHwTg

<Date>Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this Shuffle after my Nano broke, to act as a relatively inexpensive "replacement" iPod until my Nano is repaired. This is a fun little music toy! Per the product description, it isn't much more than a 1GB Flash drive that randomly plays the music loaded onto it, but it performs that particular function very well, and the sound is quite good. I like it because it's so much more portable than my Nano, and it's so light that I hardly even notice I'm carrying it half the time. Best of all, I keep smacking it into things and it's hardly shown any wear and tear at all. Great, durable little toy. After I get my Nano back from repairs, I'll probably continue to use the Shuffle quite a bit -- possibly even more than the Nano!

<Title>Brilliant little piece of technology
<Date>Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod Shuffle for my 18th birthday last year, and since then, it hasn't let me down once. I've read about people complaining that it breaks after awhile or the batteries die fast, but I've had no problems and certainly no complains to make.  Everybody know the specs of the shuffle, you've read all about it, so I won't bother to talk about that. I'll just give my opinion on the features of the shuffle.  I love the size - when I'm walking, I can put it in my pocket without a worry - when it is on shuffle mode, I hardly need to take it out at all. When I choose my playlists in iTunes (that comes on a CD-ROM packaged with the shuffle - brilliant programme &lt;3), I have all the songs I need and love, so there's no need to be changing songs all the time. I love the fact that it doesn't skip or jump like discmans do, and it's very portable and easy to use. With the earphones wrapped around it, this thing is tiny and easy to pop in your pocket.  One negative thing, of course, is there is no screen. But I reckon that's the whole point of the shuffle - to have random songs and not know what's coming up next. Another bad thing, is the largest size it comes in 1 gig. I have over 3.5 gigs of music on my computer and choosing only 250 songs out of almost 1000 library is very hard. So it ends up being my 250 favourite songs of the time, then I just change them when I get bored.  The battery life is phenomonal on these iPods - 12 hours of non stop playback. I don't use my iPod THAT much, so the long battery life lasts me ages, I don't need to charge it up often. That brings me to another point - it charges up through the computer, which is convienent for me as I always have my computer on anyway. And I don't know what people are on about when they say the shuffle breaks easily - I've dropped mine numerous times (sometimes on concrete!) and it hasn't broken. I don't like the white colour though, I want to buy some covers but they're expensive. The white gets dirty easily, especially when the shuffle is just sitting in my bag or my pocket.  But apart from the small negative points, this iPod is durable, portable and good for people who don't want to lug around a large music player. 5 stars!

<Content>Ok, I'm not on the iPod hype wagon.  I've been doing portable MP3 players for over 5 years.  Since the Nomad days.  This thing is nearly perfect.  The size and weight makes it almost negligible to carry.  The small ear buds fit inside my motorcycle helmet.  It works extremely well.  I'm totally satisfied with it.

<Title>iDeal iPod for athletes
<Date>Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the iPod Shuffle before I got an iPod Nano because, as an athlete, I like to go to the gym and use it for running.  Unlike the Nano, I don't have enough time and I don't want to stop mid-run to fiddle around to choose a song; sure, it lacks the trademark LCD display screen--but that's minimal in terms of downsides for this product, folks.  Trust me, if you like to go to the gym and run this is the ideal iPod for you.  If you like to just "chill" and become one with the music, get the Nano or the Video.  Either way, iPod is in.

<Title>Great Sound Guarenteed!
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow!  What put me off the Shuffle at first was the fact that it didn't have a screen but it really doesn't make much difference!  In my opinion if you're gonna be listening to the music whilst walking, moving or anything it's more convinient to get this one as the ipod video is LARGE and the Nano is still a bit big.  The shuffle also comes with this thing you could stick on it so you can hang it round your neck and unlike a CD player it doesn't give you a neck ache!  Also i think this is the only ipod you can hang around your neck OR stuff into your pocket..all the rest you gotta put them in your pocket or hold them or put them on a table..so it's not very convienient..for me!  I also love the sound the iPod's got ..it's GREAT!!!  I would really recommend this to anyone (oh and another good thing about shuffle - no screen means less chance of it breaking!!!)

<Title>Good at first...
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got an iPod Shuffle about a week before the release of the Nano, great timing on my part. At the time, I had a rather small music library, so the small capacity (I got a 1GB model) wasn't a problem. All of the music on the device was music I liked and would like to listen to at any given moment, so the lack of screen wasn't a problem either. Unfortunately, this did not last. On a recent 5 hour busride I had a rather large problem with my iPod. The new music I had JUST put on it that morning took 2 1/2 hours to find! (stopping to listen to other good songs it brought up of course) I have my eye either on a Nano or Video these days. I am actually looking to sell my shuffle. It is a great product and I highly recommend it, but it is quite simply below my requirements at this point. If you are interested though, drop me a line at invidleader@yahoo.com it only has slight wear/tear and my replacement warrantee expires September of 2007!

The fact that the mechine , automatically downloads  from where ever in the computer , randomly so that you do not have to specify   the songs , if you are lazy and time constrained... works well.. and you can star  grade songs you want often.  Good battery life ...  Have fun... Con: Accesories are outragiously expensive...May be you , need a stand alone chatrger , so that you dont have to have the computer on ,...

<Title>Great for What It Is
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, this is not tradition ipod.  It does not have a screen, scroll wheel, or 20G hardrive.  If you want that, go buy a different ipod.  The shuffle is very small and simple to operate.  It has a switch on the back to turn it on and to switch between shuffle and playing the songs in order.  On the front are five but-tons arranged in a circle allowing you to play, pause, fast-forward, rewind, and adjust the volume.  The shuffle comes with two caps that can be easily and securely fitted onto the USB jack on the bottom.  One that is just plain and one with a lanyard attached.  You also receive the famous headphones along with all the software you need and instructions on how to use the shuffle.  Using the shuffle for the first time is fairly easy, but you will want to make that you will be able to plug your shuffle directly into the USB port on your computer.  Otherwise you may be in for a bit of a wait before you can use your shuffle.  The ports on your computer cannot be sunken in, because you will not be able to plug you shuffle in directly.  If your ports are sunken you can use the USB port on the keyboard (this leads to very slow data transferring) or you can order a short length of USB cable.  Apple also has some solu-tions, but just ordering a cable is far cheaper.  Other than that using the shuffle for the first time is fairly straightforward.  I bought this ipod to replace my CD player and it does the job perfectly!  It holds enough songs that you can listen to it all day before you start hearing songs again.  The shuffle is so small that you can fit it just about anywhere.  Making it easy to use while doing other things.  You can quickly change the songs on it and its batteries last far longer than twelve hours.  The worst complaint I have is the initial difficultly I had in operating the switch on the back.  I found it a bit stiff and hard to put in the right spot.  Other than that I have been fully amazed by this product and would recommend it to anyone with an ailing CD player.

<Title>Give 'chance' a chance! (Yes, I stole this line from an ad)
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, people. First of all, you all need to keep in mind that for $99, you can't get everything you expect from the $300 models. I guess when it comes down to it, the iPod shuffle isn't for everyone. If you really feel like you can't live with ALL 15,000 of the songs on your computer (even the ones you NEVER listen to - come on, admit it!), and you can't stand it if you don't know what's coming next, then DON'T BUY THIS. But don't get upset with it for not being able to do that! I love my iPod shuffle for the following reasons:  1) I'm cheap. 2) I find that I listen to the same songs over. And over. And over. And over. And... (repeat). 3) It's tiny and light and adorable and you don't have to carry it!  4) You can put the *most* favorite of your favorite songs on it - good for when you don't want to keep pulling it out of your bag/pocket/wherever to change the song - oh, but wait: it's already hanging around your neck!  5) Did I mention that I'm cheap?!?! 6) In a way, you *can* know what's coming next - you can arrange the songs in a specific order on iTunes and (if you have a freakish memory like I do) pretty much know what's going to play and when. And if you get tired of that - shuffle!  7) If your most favorite of favorite songs change, wipe out your whole list and start again!  When it comes down to it, what do you really want? Your favorite music everywhere you go, the chance to dance down the sidewalk, chill on the subway, stay awake in class (etc etc) - the iPod shuffle lets you do this, only without the frills of all the other (ghastly expensive) iPods. For $99, it's an amazing deal. ^^

<Content>and that's all you need to make a hit.  Pros: Small, cheap, and it doesn't skip.   Cons: Where do I start? You have no idea what song is coming around the corner. OMGz0rs WHAT AN ADVANTAGE. You can hear a song you don't want to listen to instead of a song you want to hear. The fact that Apple licenses the hell out of this fact is sickening. People don't want to hear some random song. They want to have an mp3 player that let's you choose a song from a menu. Every mp3 player has a shuffle feature. You don't buy an mp3 player specifically to use a shuffle feature.  The Creative MUVO on the other hand has a screen, supports WMA's and works with more than one music program, FM radio and recording, cooler looking, and cheaper.   Anyone who actually praises this over the MUVO is an idiot, plain and simple.

<Content>My subway commute is now forever changed.  Thank you Apple!  I love this iPod Shuffle.  It is so small and lightweight, I can hardly believe it still sounds so good and has such good battery life.  Basically, at the beginning of the week I charge it for four hours and fill it with my 240ish songs.  It lasts for my commute to work, my time at the gym, and my commute back home for the entire week.  Sunday night I charge it back up, burn a few more of my CD's into my computer, put a new mix in and I'm ready for a new week.  The Shuffle is close to perfect.  The only thing I'd like Apple to do is to ship Shuffle with the in-ear headphones.  For $150.00, it sure would be nice to have the better headphones.  I'm going to shell out the extra $40.00 for the in-ear headphones, but I wish I didn't have to.  Other than that, bravo to Apple.

<Content>This is a wonderful little piece of machinery! My tiny, 1G-240 song iPod Shuffle has 270 songs on it, and that's more than enough. 17+ hours of only my favorite songs! It's like having a personal radio station that only plays what I like. And I don't care if I don't know exactly which song is coming up next because I know whatever it is, it's something I like listening to over and over anyway. This you use for songs that you absolutely love and never skip over when you play the cd (but there's a "fast-forward" button anyway). It's tiny, easy to load (and/or reload), and the sound is great. And let's face it, who's got time to sit and download and then listen to 600 to 1,000 songs all the way through? I've had my Shuffle for a week and still haven't heard every song I've loaded.  I was slow to get on the iPod/MP3 bandwagon, but with the iPod Shuffle I think I'm on it for good now.

<Title>A blind ipod. Another arbitrary design decision from Apple
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>We've seen it many times. The iMac's round mouse went against all we knew about ergonomics but it "looked cool". The ipod shufffle does it again: 240 songs that you will have to guess their name/artist/album because this little devil ain't telling you. Hey Steve, one thing is to "think out of the box" and come up with really clever solutions as you guys have done in the past, but selling a blind 1GB monster is going to go down the same alley that the eMate and the Cube went. I guess these are the risks of "thinking laterally": once in a while you ignore commonsense and end up with plain blunders. Go Creative (MUVO) instead.

<Title>Who needs a screen?
<Date>Sun Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Other reviewers have covered the Shuffle extensively, so I'm focusing on the most controversial feature: the lack of a screen.  As a Shuffle owner, it's become clear a screen is not necessary. The 1 gig Shuffle holds 250 songs and users have complete control over which songs are loaded. If you have trouble keeping 10 albums worth of music straight in your head, I don't know how you can handle the unintuitive and clunky interfaces of non-Apple MP3 players.  Not having a screen is the Shuffle's greatest strength. It allows an incredibly small and light player at a great price.

<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've never owned an MP3 player. I bought my iPod shuffle after doing a good bit of research on both hard drive and flash based systems. My primary interest was to have a device that provided quality music during a workout or run. Prior to this I was struggling with poor FM reception - both in the gym and outdoors. I was uncomfortable trying to adjust my FM headphones while at full run on a treadmill. As a result, the lack of a screen had no impact on my purchase. Navigation is intuitive and requires little effort.   What I've really learned to love is the fact that I am re-discovering my CD collection. Thus far I've converted over 3000 songs into iTunes. I let the system autofill my shuffle, and I personally love the random play. It's like radio but with no commercials and excellent should quality.

<Title>Incredible sound - Almost nonexistent size !
<Date>Thu Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was using my AudiovoxSMT5600 for some tunes as an add on feature - I was never a bg mp3 listener. But I liked having some tunes available in a crunch.   Then I got my wife a Shuffle as a gift. I listened to it one day - and was hooked. The sound and bass response is incredible. And the thing is so light - you don't even realilze its there.  No LCD, no voice recorder, no games - just great sounding tunes with the flip of a switch - in order or at random.   On that note - a helpful hint - one way to get to a tune you want is to set options to 'shuffle by album'. Keep your songlist in iTunes by album. Then when listening to iPod, set switch to 'shuffle'. It will randomly go to the next song in another album altogether. Then set switch back to 'play in order', and then just back/next to the one you want. With the 1G model, you get about 20 albums. This makes it easier to find a specific song than going through 240 songs at random or in order.  Great for working out, running. I'd highly recommend. Go Apple.

<Title>Dont waste time on this
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just bought iPod shuffle. Looks sweet but is my most frustrating technology experience since ZX spectrum.   First, I was asked to plug in iPod shuffle for the first time, but when I did (yes, into a USB port) my computer just switched off.   Ok, s..t happens, I switch it on again. Start over, but then, iPod was not detected when in the front USB port. Ok, try the rear one,  and amen! finally it was picked up.  Ok, after some fiddling with iTunes (duh!) I've managed to make it figure out where my files are. That was ugly and frustrating but at least it worked. Having said that, it only worked to an extent. I cant see the filenames anywhere and many songs are scattered randomly. I want to only see files and directories!  Anyway, time to get songs onto the iPod. How? After reading documentation, I see that iPod should appear in the sources. Unlucky, it's not there. Unplug, plug. Not there. Try again, on, off... Close iTunes. Plug in, open itunes, and finally it is there. My retrying expertise has paid off.  And this is where the most frustrating bit begins. iTunes starts blurting out Updating iPod. Update complete. Updating iPod. Update complete. Updating iPod. Update complete. Updating iPod. Update complete. Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete.Updating iPod. Update complete. . . . . .  I let it be for a while, assuming there really is something to update. But after 15 minutes of this, considering my nerves are already strained by the installation, I had enough.   It's not just that it shows these misleading messages, iTunes also flicks the whole user interface every few seconds. While "updating ipod" is showing in the top bar, iTunes shows library tab. When it shows update complete, it switches to iPod tab.   I can't use 'shuffle' without iTunes? Well, you know what? I am taking this back to the shop and getting a proper player that will actually work and not lock me into buggy software which I don't want to use.

<Title>iPod Shuffle rocks!
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has released a ground breaking product in terms of mp3 players history. The shuffle is a fabulous achievement of Apple's engineering and marketing skills. The electronics inside the shuffle are very refined and its remarkable how this manage to fit it all in such small size.  Pro's, 1. Elegant, minimalist and ergonmic design. 2. Lots of memory for an affordable price (remember those 128MB players for same price last year?) 3. Built in rechargeable battery, hassle free. 4. Charging from a USB port instead of a bulky wall adaptor, unlike most other electronics items. 5. Very good sound quality. 6. Excellent build quality and full one yr of warranty support. 7. Works as a portable flash memory drive, plug-n-play. 8. Compatible with iTunes Music Store, the only reasonable & legal source of music downloads. 9. Very good battery life. 10. Easy to use during activities like jogging, gym etc. No skipping like CD or hard drive based players. 11. Perfect gift item. Comfortable to carry, looks attractive and a joy to use.  Con's, 1. Shuffle doesn't have a LCD display, depending upon your needs this maybe a disadvantage. 2. Only one color, unlike mutiple mini colors. Ofcourse this is just a cosmetic issue and would likely be fixed with next generation of Shuffle. 3. Priced very close to iPod mini 4GB, for only $50 more you go from 1GB to 4GB with screen.  Apple waited for the flash memory prices to become affordable and finally released the Shuffle with 512MB/1GB. Anything lower would have resulted in poor user experience as majority of other players out there (don't they end up in drawer?).  Buying an iPod Shuffle is a very easy decision to make. It looks great, works with ease, is competitively priced and easy to find at most retail stores. Enjoy!

<Title>Cannot share MP3 library with friends thru Shuffle
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought a Shuffle and then realized that I cannot transfer music from my friends into my Shuffle or vice versa.  When I plugged the Shuffle into someone's else machine/iTunes, it said the Shuffle had been initialized from a different machine/library, and asked if it's ok to delete all the files in the Shuffle.   Fine. So I went ahead and delete the original files and copied some MP3s from my friend's PC. The catch was that I got to keep those songs only if I don't plug the Shuffle back into my own machine. Once I plugged back into my own laptop, iTunes deleted everything I had copied from my friend.  To me that's a ridiculous constraint from Apple, that a "mobile" device cannot be used to transfer files?! I mean, why shouldn't I be able to get music from my friends and copy them into my own library (especially music ripped from CDs we paid for)??  So the hack I'm using now is to format 30% of my Shuffle for DATA and 70% for music, copy as much of my friends' files as possible in the DATA partition, copy the files from the device into my iTunes library, AND THEN copy the music into my Shuffle. Hell of a work for something I shldn't have to be doing in the first place...   Other than that, the thing looks nice and is featherweight and all.

<Title>Frustrating
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, let me say that the sound from the iPod Shuffle is great. OK. Now that I have the one good point menitoned, lemme go to the cons.  And to be honest, I have but one.  If you don't have all your mp3's in a constantly available source, you cannot keep songs on your iPod.  I connected the iPod to my pc and finally figured out iTunes.  Not hard.  Once I got songs on the shuffle, I played them and felt good about the sound.  When i plugged it back up to adjust the equalizer (not alot of bass on the default headphones) iTunes couldn't find the mp3's I had put on the shuffle on my PC (I have a server that stores my Mp3's that wasn't connected at the time) and removed the songs automatically.  So i dind't have any music.  When i tried to copy the Mp3's to the shuffle's folders manually (without iTunes) it played ONE song over and over.    To me, i do not see the point in having an MP3 player that won't allow you to keep songs on it and just add new ones at your leasure.  This is a good player, but a BAD design.  Too much copy  protection BS and not enough usability.    This is my last Apple product.  It is going back to Best Buy today.

<Title>Great depending on what you want
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this little gadget.  The size is great.  It is incredibly light.  The design is cool.  With no display, a simple design and the ability to hold about 240 songs, this is great for sports, food shopping, or just walking around. The shuffle feature is perfect for these events.  And with 240 songs, so long as you do not have a device filled with singles, you will be able to skip from artist to artist by simply not setting it to the shuffle setting and clicking through your lists (so long as your artists are arranged in alphabetical order).  Just be prepared to manage  your playlists actively.  But realize the limitations.  If you want to use this for travel where you can put some opera, some classical and some rock on one device, I say forget it.  When I am running around, it would drive me mad moving from Bach to the Clash.  Not only that, 1 gig is manageable with no display but at 2 gigs, I need a display of some sort.    Therefore, if you are looking to have a variety, say for that long plane flight, you will wish for one of the other iPODs instead.  So the answer is you may need the shuffle and a regular iPOD.  Depends on your budget.  For me, size is critical and budgets should be adhered to so I will have to toss a Bach CD in my bag on the next long plane flight and for now be happy with listening to punk in the produce aisle at the supermarket.

<Title>Awesome, by far
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didnt come here to write a full review..just to tell you some things about my shuffle: most songs people ( i guess 17 year olds like me) listen to arent 4 minutes long, so as of this very second, i have: 248 songs on my Ipod 6 pictures 1 2 min. wma video clip of me biking.  and my ipod says that only 672MB of my 1000MB (1gb) are used so far! this thing is awesome. I can fit another 2 or 3 cd's on it  dont mind what everyone says about not having a screen. put songs and cd's you listen to. I haven' had to second guess what im listening to yet.  The battery is amazing. i havent charged it since i've had it, and thats been a week, and the battery still says its green (good)  the only bad thing i can think of is the fact that when on shuffle mode, you will sometimes get a repeat song before you hit a song you haven;t listened to yet.but you can just click and switch the song.  It also gets loud as hell. cd quality.  dont second guess. you will love it

<Title>The little stick of fun...
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The most amazing thing about the Shuffle, bar none, is its weight. Actually, it's weightlessness. You don't know that you are wearing it. If you pick it up, it feels like a piece of plastic holding air. At .78 ounces, that's the equivalent of 20 small paper clips.   The first time I held one in my hand, I knew I had to have one. Never thought I could convince my wife to spend three H's on a big iPod, and with a cell phone and a PDA already, didn't need another weighty device hanging off of me.   Enter Shuffle.   I've had it for the past few weeks. The lack of a screen is a small minus. Sometimes it would be nice to know what's coming next, or find a particular track. But it's easy enough to skip if you hit one you don't want to hear -- which is rare, because after all, it's your music.   Sound quality is fine. Battery life is OK, too, about 10-15 hours.   Now, for the quibbles. Charging the Shuffle is a pain. You have to have it plugged into a USB port. I don't know about your desktop, but mine is on the floor, and it's a pain to plug and unplug. It's no problem on the laptop. Also, it takes 4 hours to fully charge. That's weak compared to the competish. (It's like, who cares that you have USB 2.0? You could USB 0.000001 and still transfer the songs in 4 hours.) There should be a quick charge option, an adapter, or something similar. You can get a docking station, but that defeats the $99 price point. Sony's offering a similar enough player with 70 hours (!), although it's a bit heavier and doesn't work with iTunes.   Transferring songs is also a pain. There are hacks using the Shuffle in disk mode -- others here or on iPod web sites can tell you how to do it -- but directly uploading songs from Shuffle to computer is made difficult as a bar (albeit a low one) to piracy. I'm sure Apple is trying to keep the record labels happy, but it should be easier.   Anyway, the last few weeks I've rediscovered my music collection -- another plus of the Shuffle. Although you can set up playlists, I prefer random. I've listened to great tunes I forgot I had. Old Santana, Marley, Zeppelin and U2 mixed with a little Green Day turns my grocery shopping into a groovy concert. And I've had probably 20 people ask me what's hanging around my neck. (19 positive, 1 jerk who joked that it looked like an alarm for elderly people for when they fall and can't get up).   Final thought -- get the 512, not the 1 Gig. There is no point having more music (16 hours) than battery life (12 hours) without a screen. 120 songs is just fine 99 percent of the time.   Enjoy!

<Title>Works for the meantime but...
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Oftentimes, you notice what you don't like about something, not what you do like. I've noticed a lot of things about the ipod shuffle that I don't like, but none of them affect its playing quality. It is easy to use, as well as the software. I have had some problems with it though. Mine will actually only hold a bit over 800 MB instead of the full 1GB. The itunes software has no solution to fix this, which is probably extra stored data or something that I can't find. Secondly, I would recommend with any ipod product to buy new headphones. These are the most uncomfortable earphones I have ever used. My doctor told me that they are actually pushing my jaw socket and to buy new headphones. I have not spoken with anyone who ones some form of Ipod who liked the headphones. Also, it bothers me that none of the awesome extra things you can buy to go with Ipod are not compatible with shuffle, like the radio or the speakers. I did not want a full sized Ipod because I don't like enough music to fill one up; I don't even have 20 Gigs of music on my PC. There are a lot of little inconveniences like that that go along with the shuffle. It doesn't really shuffle well either...it tends to repeat the same songs a lot and not play others at all. I would seriously recommend getting another version of an iPod, because the sound quality and the playback is excellent, but the shuffle itself is not the best they have to offer.

<Title>Shuffle your Life
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Mixing the unpredictability of the lottery with the compactness of a pack of chewing gum, Apple has created something much more enjoyable. 	Apple mixed the versatility of the original iPod with some randomness, and came out with the smallest, least expensive iPod- the iPod Shuffle. Smoothly making the transition to mp3 players without screens, Apple created an eye-opener with this new item. The distinguishing features of the shuffle are its simple, easy-to-use controls, small dimensions (3.3"x0.98"x0.33"), and the unpredictability of its songs. The Shuffle is reasonably priced with two storage options, the 512 MB version, which can store 120 songs or the    1 GB version, which can store 240 songs. The controls are well placed. A Pause/Play button in the middle surrounded with buttons for skip, fast forward, and volume control help the busy user quickly browse to the level they want. The backside of the player sports an on-off slider. Users can either face the unpredictable and slide to the shuffle mode, or know what they're up against in the "play in the order" mode. On the bottom is a USB port, compatible with USB 1.1 or 2.0, that allows users to quickly sync their songs and download new ones using the award winning iTunes software, which is included with the iPod. Apple's signature white earbud earphones accompany the iPod, along with an extra USB cap with a lanyard. 	The Shuffle is a jewel of an mp3 player. It packs an enormous amount of punch for a player so small. I found the buttons easy on the touch, and simple to navigate. Even without a screen, the iPod is suitable, because you can control what you will hear on the computer, unless you really want unpredictability. In that sense, who needs an electricity-sapping screen? The storage was good enough for me to download my albums of songs into my 1GB, with some space left over. I especially liked the size, the weight, and the new flash drive. The miniscule Shuffle could fit in tighter spaces, making it more ideal with jeans that are jammed full with other items. The weight is like a feather-literally. 0.78 ounces does not bother me running, hiking, or doing any kind or exercise I want to do. The flash drive is the best new technology on the market. With the Shuffle, Apple decided to invest in this growing share, and they hit right on the spot. The 1GB is right around the maximum of storage a flash player can have, and since iPod users usually gobble up a large amount of storage, this option fits those people. More frugal people, however, will go with the 512 MB version, which is still a large amount. The flash capability offers more features on its own. It is harder to jar, unlike the hard drives in the older iPods. Also, the "extras" make the Shuffle versatile. Don't want to risk scratching in that overused pocket of yours? Just put the lanyard cap on, instead of the regular cap, and it can go snugly around your neck. The battery meter on the back gives everyone, with a press of a button, whether the Shuffle needs charging, or if it's still going strong. The iPod's earphones deliver great quality, and with extra ear mufflers, I could choose whether I wanted to put them on or not, and if I lost a pair, there is still another pair waiting in my box. With this new iPod, Apple has again foiled the music world, coming out with a low priced, on the go iPod to complement the full size iPod and the best selling iPod mini.

<Content>I got this for Christmas yesterday. I immediatley took it out of its box and installed the software on my computer. After plugging the IPOD in the USB slot and going into ITUNES nothing occured. I thought maybe it had to be charged so I let it charge for the entire day. Last night I tried unsuccessfully 3 times to install the software again. The computer wouldn't take it. Now my dad has spent 2 hours of his life calling Apple (who were quite helpful) and getting the SHuffle ready to be sent back. I will probably be getting a 2GB nano. A bit more money for a screen and the abilty to pick your own songs.

<Content>I purchased two apple products this year.  A Ipod shuffle 1gb and a Ipod nano 4gb.  The nano was doa and the shuffle died this week it's also doa.  don't think i'll buy anymore apples any time soon. Now the best part: whent to the apple store in the Houston Galleria. At 1:30 I signed usp for the next available appointment (8:00 pm).  I waited and waited untill it was my turn.  The teck agreed both were broken.  However, the service side of the store had nomore equipment and would have to order replacements, but the custom engraving would be lost.  The solution was for me to contact the online store and return my Ipods to them. The store had a stock of Nano's and Shuffles, but the service side and sales side  of the same storefront were different...............

<Title>This is a great little thing!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Actually before buying the Ipod Shuffle, I read all the reviews on Amazon about it. Most of them were good, so I decided to buy it at Best Buy. It was so easy to work! I thought it would be hard to get I-Tunes started, but it was easy! For now, I just have songs that were on my CDs. I haven't bought any off of I-Tunes. But I definetly reccommend this Ipod! It holds 120 songs and is smaller than the Ipod Nano [not in width size, though]. Even though it doesn't have a screen, it doesn't matter at all. Actually, as I am writing this review, I'm listening to Ipod Shuffle! It's on 'shuffle mode' right now, so it just plays random songs. Right now it's Avril Lavinge, and the next song will be...WHO KNOWS! That's what I love about this Ipod Shuffle. And plus, it was only $99, where others are $250 and $200. Buy this RIGHT NOW! You won't regret it.

<Title>Apples new "Gadget"
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have to admit the iPod Shuffle really isn't tremendously interresting. I mean it has no screen, not alot of features-and this can be a real downer for some people(including myself). But there are also some pretty cool things about it to, like it comes with a lanyard,the classic white earphones, a Cd to install the software,stickers and an information booklet and it is suprisingly easy to use. You just flick on the back switch pick if you wan't it on shuffle or regular mode and you're set.To charge it you just put it into this little slot in your computer.Anyways if you are lucky enough to own a real i-Pod or i-Pod nano you will probably notice that this  is a lot easier on the wallet(cheaper). Sorry if I'm wrong, but I think the 1GB runs from about 140$ to 180$ depending on where you buy it from. It holds about 240 songs.It also looks really cool, like when I pulled it out of the stunning green box a I'm just like, "Hey, this looks kinda cool!". It is also the smallest and lightest i-Pod yet. So there you have it, my review for this new  "gadget", and even though it's not suped up, like all the other i-Pod's it's still is a cool and "cheaper" gift to give to anyone who is a fan of i-Pod's.

<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I liked Ipod shuffle 1 GB so much that with in weeks I am buying another one as my earlier one was given as a gift. The best features are lightest possible weight, lowest power consumption ( yes lack of display is better for long battery life), and excellent integration with itunes. It just so happens that the kind of music I listen to (old songs at low bit rates) it can also take almost 700 songs. In accessories, an external charger is a must as that makes charging convenient ( as opposed to plugging into the computer for hours, though that will work).

<Title>iPod Good, iTunes Bad.
<Date>Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Good:  My Shuffle sounds great and does exactly what I want it to do, which is keep me entertained during workouts.  I could not care less that it doesn't have a display.  I went from an MP3 player with a display to the Shuffle, and I don't miss the display at all.  The Bad:  I'd give the Shuffle five stars if I didn't have to use iTunes with it.  Sadly, there is no other way to put music on a Shuffle.  iTunes is truly a nightmare of a software package.  Your MP3's must be added to the iTunes library, and this can take some time (#1 pain in the a**).  Then you must Autofill the Shuffle or drag and drop MP3's one-at-a-time to the Shuffle.  You will be old and gray by the time you fill the 1G Shuffle this way (#2 pain in the a**).  And getting the songs you want on your Shuffle using the Autofill feature is tricky.  Then, beware if you've changed anything in the iTunes library by the next time you plug in your Shuffle and open iTunes.  The Shuffle synchs automatically.  If your library is empty, your Shuffle will also become empty, and you will be powerless to stop it (#3 pain in the a**).  If the song exists on your Shuffle, it also MUST exist in your iTunes library AND in your music folder - otherwise it's gone forever the next time you plug in the Shuffle and open iTunes.  For this reason, I can see no way to share MP3's with friends who also have Shuffles without giving them the actual MP3 first.  I understand why this is so (copyright protection, I'm sure), but it sucks the fun out of sharing a great song with someone else.  Importing new songs into from my music folder into my iTunes library is hit or miss.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't (#4 pain in the a**).  And for some odd reason, the same two songs on my Shuffle update every single time I make a change to the songs (not those two songs) on my Shuffle (#5 pain in the a**).  iTunes is garbage.  Possibly the least user-friendly software I have ever used.  Sadly, learning the hard way with iTunes seems unavoidable because the help files are less than helpful (#6 pain in the a**).

<Title>Gum-stick sized shuffle way ahead of the curve
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the ipod Shuffle after being frustrated with different brand mini MP3 player (that had a small memory size) and have never looked back. I just love this little thing. I'm obsessed with midget-sized items. I travel often, and always with electronics and between the books, laptops, paperwork, phones and other things to carry, I don't want to load myself down with yet another item. But, having my music on these boring trips is essential, and the Shuffle is the ultimate solution.  The great thing about the Shuffle is that its virtually weightless, and fits just about in any pocket, It it can hold 1GB worth of songs, without burning a hole in your pocket. Granted, it has limitations to what you can do with it: you either play songs in order or in shuffle/random format. You have the option of blasting it loudly in your ears or playing it at a more decent level, and you can skip through songs (forward and back), but that's it. You don't get to choose your favorite song or artist as with the other ipods.   However, these limitations are greatly compensated for by the fact that I manage to squeeze some 270 songs on the gum-stick sized item, and that the battery lasts up to 12 hours (longer than the ipod!). I never, ever get bored listening to the songs on all my journeys because it takes so long to get through them all. And if you do finally run out of battery power, you just stick it in a USB slot of your (hopefully midget-sized) laptop or PC/Mac.  And it won't burn out to be replaced like the ipod battery.  I use the Shuffle with my i-tunes and find it very easy. You stick it in the USB, and select "refill" to load it up with a bunch of new songs. Though I find that sometimes I have to erase everything on it first. You can choose it to fill up with  more of your favorite songs, or you can just dump whatever you want on there (in case you aren't too keen on your partner's favorites as in my case). I don't know how it would work if you don't have a mac with i-tunes, so that could be a drawback.  The shuffle is my savior for all those boring, long trips, delays, study time, etc. I would no more choose to do without it than the books I read for pleasure.

<Content>Preview: You will likely notice there is a wide range of user ratings. I submit that you consider the "reviewer" when you read as people have a tendency to review the company, the brand and their own expectations instead of the PRODUCT. I will review the product here.  Review: The unit is small and light. The case is clean and the use of buttons is efficient. It hangs on my neck with no noticeable weight. Manipulation is easy, functional and fast enough. It holds plenty of songs and is easy enough to swap songs using the iTunes interface. It sounds very good and the volume manipulation occurs in small intervals, which means I can set it to my exacting taste without big jumps in volume. I do wish it had a grip of some kind on the on-off button. I'll stick something there; enjoy.  Note: I don't use Mac. I don't like the lock-in issues with the AAC format. I'm not happy that I can only import to iTunes and not export to MusicMatch or WMP or other player programs, but that about the program not the product. I point this out so as to help you consider the validity of my review of the iShuffle by itself. END

<Title>Really easy to use...
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I picked this up with the sport case, since my ipod has been hijacked by my 4 year olds playlists, and bedtime song lists and so on, and I wanted something less fragile than the ipod's hard drive to take to the gym and walks.  We already have a few ipods, so its a no brainer to pick this one, since you can use the same playlists etc...  CON: my 6 month old HP has a funky well shaped depression on which the front USB ports were inset, so I couldn't insert the IPOD shuffle straight in and had to pick up a powered USB 2.0 hub to be able to connect it.  I ripped most of our CDs in apple lossless format, and the nice thing about this shuffle, is that I can downconvert automatically to 128 bit to fit more songs into the shuffle, so that it works out to hold quite as many of the songs I want as I could on my ipod (given that I have to have raffi and pooh bear, and beethoven on hand for my son on my regular ipod as well, and lossless format worked out to upto half a gig per CD)  Saves me from converting whole playlists to MP3 and then loading them etc...  This(setting yes to downconvert to 128) does mean slow transfer time, so maybe load it up last thing at night.  Sport case is a good buy.  no display is one less thing to get broken/scratched up etc...    Have owned various RIOs/archos etc in the past, and I'm hooked on the simplicity of the ipod, and now the shuffle's interface.

Besides, I can keep the order of the 15 albums or so in my head.  All in all, the perfect little mp3 gadget.

<Title>Apple Fanatics Only Need Apply
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is one of the worst mp3 players I've ever heard!  I currently have three other mp3 players not including this one.  First off, there is no built in equalizer.  The music is the most important thing and it is flat and uninspiring.  Even songs that have loud thumps when played on my computer are flat in this thing.  You need to adjust each song individually within iTunes before loading them into the shuffle.  With hundreds of songs, I spent a few hours adjusting the volume and equalization of about 50 songs.  Now those songs sound like garbage played through my computer on iTunes but sound good in the shuffle.  Why can't they sound good in both???  There is a pop/click in between songs.  It is very slight, but audible when listening to it in anything other than a subway station.  No display is aggravating.  This thing holds a couple of hundred songs and I sometimes have no idea what's playing.  Second, iTunes has to be one of the worst music management programs I've ever used.  It is truly sad.  Importing my mp3 library into iTunes was laborious and often failed.  Most of my mp3's are on CD's because I simply don't have enough hard drive space to store them all.  iTunes loaded mp3's from a CD, then promptly deleted those same songs the next time I plugged in my shuffle.  Supposedly because the songs must be available when you sync your shuffle.  Most of my mp3's are also ripped at 320k.  So I tried to import them into the AAC format at the iTunes preferred AAC format so that I could fit more songs on the shuffle.  Well now I have two of everything in my library.  Whoever designed this program should jump out the nearest window and save us all a lot of trouble.    The design is simple yes, but not my style.  White is not a color.  If you are not one of the Apple faithful, think seriously before you order this.  There are several other players for around the same price.  I got suckered into to all the hype and now I regret it.

<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I LOVE my i-POD!!!  It mixes up your music, but if you listen to it non-stop for a while, you can see that somtimes the music is played in the same order, even if it's on shuffle mode. If you load the software, which on the first computer took 3 times to load correctly, on two computers, and them put the i-Pod in, you lose the songs you had on the mp3 player. Overall, other than the software mishaps, you'll love it so much, you will want to name it, and you need to,for xample, mine is named Ippie. You need to let it charge for a few hours at a time,to let it work to it's highest potential.

<Title>i love it
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>ok, now i want the nano... but this thing is tough, sounds great, gets great battery life, and is rather affordable. also, it is very helpful as a jump drive. no extra features, but i don't think i need other features. i don't mind not having a radio, voice recorder, or screen.  its tiny, light, cute, and simple to use. the only drawback is those times when you really, really want to hear a particular song (like when you want a friend to listen to a particular song), then, the 1gb of music is torture to skip through.  still, a 5 star product.

<Title>DO NOT BUY: Batteries do not stay charged
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the same experience listed as some of the other reviewers. It is amazing how frustrating something so small and compact can be. I got this as a gift. I opened it and recharged the battery on my USB port. That charge did last about four hours or so... and thats it! Done! Have not been able to recharge since. I have not gotten this "sweaty" as what the problem was attributed to in other cases. Although I used it working out the unit sat on top of an eyptical training not touching my person ever. Until I kept trying to get it to work. It know plays a song for approx 45 seconds then turns off. I just "Recharged" it again for 4.5 hours and then it played almost 1 song and died. I have heard from friends that apple has problems with batteries. So glad this was gift else I'd be really angry!

What is better in shuffle than a muvo ? + Simplicity + Looks - very sleek + Durability and long lasting (thanks to simplicity) + In built rechareable battery (No battery cost), but what is the cost of replacing it if the in battery dies ? + Better sound quality  Why do I like my muvo better ? + FM, FM, FM - muvo comes with FM player - and I love FM, keeps you up to date with the latest music on the street + Voice recording + Song and singer title display

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Tue Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Look, if you're looking to get a great mp3 player and thinking "aha!  I can save money and get a multifunctional mp3 player" then this is not for you.  Quit being a cheap whiner and fork out the dough for what you want.  The shuffle works well and serves it's purpose, but not beyond that.  It is nice for workouts and for when you just need a nice mix of familiar music in no particular order.  I do agree that $125 is way overpriced.  I would not have bought it in any case.  I got mine for free so I like it quite well.

<Title>Nothing but problems
<Date>Wed Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this iPod shuffle for Valentine's Day.   By mid-March, I was experiencing problems charging it (it would no longer charge).  This was purchased with a warranty, so I was able to get a replacement shuffle by late March.   In mid-April, my second shuffle broke as well; if I attempted to use the forward or backward buttons, it would turn the iPod off completely.  Or, it would play a song for about 20 seconds, then turn off completely.  Highly annoying and frustrating.

<Title>Can't be beat for price point
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My ipod shuffle is great!  Having a screen would, of course, be a little more functional, but for the price, (as compared to the new nano's), it can't be beat! And the iTunes gift card offer really sweetened the deal.  I think it depends on what you'll use your shuffle for.  I use mine primarily to download a series of podcasts that I listen to when I'm at the gym.  It's great for that kind of listening!  Working through an audiobook, however, is a bit more challenging.  I have a "learn italian" audiobook, and you can't easily peruse the chapters, unless you have your shuffle docked.  Unlike the Nanos, which I hear are scratching way too easily, the shuffle has held up well under a lot of wear and tear.  Again, I think for the price point (and if you're willing - *gasp* - not to have the "latest and greatest" from Apple), the shuffle can't be beat!

<Title>Great unit but does not charge as advertised
<Date>Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love the iPod but I can't use it because it will not recharge.  The shuffle says it will charge through your USB port and having a brand new laptop I figured the USB port would charge the shuffle.  However, now I find that my USB port only outputs 500mAmps and needs to have at least 1.0 Amps to get this charging.  I am buying a iPod USB Power Adapter for $30 and hope this will solve the problem.  I am still disappointed because the cost of the charger negates the value of this product and would have  been more effective to buy a larger iPod that included a charger to start with and would have had other features as well. This unit is great but if cost is your concern- you might want to price this with a charger versus other models/packages out there that include a charger because it is unlikely you'll be able to charge this using your USB port alone.

<Title>I'm surprised how much I love my shuffle
<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I first saw the shuffle, I thought it was the dumbest thing ever.  Why would you want a 1GB flash player w/ no screen? Now I know.  I already have full sized ipod and a bunch of music ripped to itunes, I wanted something small for the gym, the shuffle is perfect.  Now that I have it I find I use it all the time, I can fill it with songs from my "top rated" list and have a nice greatest hits soundtrack that's easy to carry around.  If you don't use itunes, there are probably better flash players, but if you're looking for a second ipod for exercise, etc. the shuffle is really great.  The simplicity of it is actually its strength.  I find myself just kinda staring at it and admiring its design.  No screen, nothing to scratch when you throw it in your pocket.  If you use shuffle play on a normal ipod frequently, you'll love the shuffle.  If you need track info and instant access to a large library, you won't like the shuffle.  one other thing, I saw another review that suggested that the shuffle is essentially a disposable player, and I'd have to agree with that.  Once the battery dies, it's going to cost as much as a new one to replace it.  It annoys me that apple refuses to make their batteries replacable, but I love the ipods enought to deal with it.

<Title>Shuffle Still A Great Choice
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When the Shuffle came out early in 2005, it had its day as the newest and coolest in the iPod lineup. I was an early adopter. Since then, the Nano and the video iPod have arrived. So how tempting is the Shuffle almost a year after its introduction?  I remain a Shuffle fan. I would buy it again even given the choice of the newer models. It's not just that it costs less -- I prefer it even without factoring in the price.  The Shuffle is a real workhorse and a tough unit -- there's no need to worry about scratches. I've used mine without a case, keeping it in pockets and bags with keys, pens and other sharp objects, and have never obsessed about keeping it pristine. Despite this, it still looks good. A case for a Shuffle is completely unnecessary. With a Nano, by contrast, a case is, by all accounts, a necessity if you want to avoid scratches that spoil the look and, moreover, reduce the functionality of the tiny screen (which is a pity because a case hides the Nano's good looks and adds to its size).  I use the Shuffle for audiobooks and podcasts as well as for music. It is an excellent device for these purposes. And the sound quality is just as good as on a bigger iPod.  Battery life has been good. I get the rated 12 hours, if not more. (I did buy Apple's AAA battery adapter for use on long journeys, but have never actually had to use it. That said, the fact that you can use AAA batteries is a plus over the other iPods.)  I also I like the fact that one can plug the unit directly into a computer without wires. Wires, like cases, complicate the iPod experience - more "stuff" means more mess and more not to have with you when you need it.  The absence of a screen does not bother me. I regard iTunes on my computer as my way of looking inside the Shuffle -- there, I can decide what to manually place on the Shuffle and in what order. There is no need to have iTunes randomly fill the device with the "autofill" feature, although that can be fun when you are in the mood. Likewise, there is no need to have the Shuffle play what is on it in a random order -- if you prefer, you can play it in the order you established using iTunes.  The 1GB capacity is plenty for the way in which I use the device. I keep my library on my laptop and, using iTunes, simply decide what I want to have on the Shuffle at any given time. I don't see the need to keep everything on an iPod at once so long as it is on a computer to which the Pod connects.  In short, the Shuffle's simplicity and elegance define its appeal. To complain about the features it lacks is to miss the point. It's like complaining that the Mini is a small car. Simplicity is the Shuffle's whole point. In a world of clutter, the Shuffle is a tidy device that works. The fact that it is the least expensive iPod is a bonus.

<Title>Perhaps mine is defective...
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a complaint about my iPod Shuffle: the forward-reverse navigation buttons are slow to respond, and it usually takes several tries to go backwards.  It's a real pain in the keister if you want to find a specific song, even more so since there isn't a display.    Since navigation is a feature I was counting on, this is a big disappointment.  However, if that's not so important to you then this is a nice little toy.  It will play your songs randomly or in squential order (though how you control the order has remained a mystery to me).  The sound quality is excellent, and it is a no-hassle storage stick as well.  And it is very cool that it doesn't need a battery.  Oh wait, I have a second complaint, about iTunes - it erases my iPod shuffle immediately when I plug it in, despite my instructing it not to.

<Title>Great, Smalll & Simple Shuffle...but Apple can do better...
<Date>Thu Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros:  Superb AAC audio quality(despite no sound enhancing equalizer), easy to use controls, THIN and LIGHT, long but a reasonable length that fits comfortably in the hand, nice lanyard that's included, easy to download, good download speed(but not the best), and it's a flash based player which provides skip-free playback compared to other iPods with a hard disk, better bass response than its predecessors, overall easy iTunes interface.  Cons: Easily scratched if not careful, no sound enhancing feature(ex: equalizer, sound check, crossfade), long unusual pause between songs, a daily battery charge might be needed(12 hr. life = a day), you could hear a small amount of noise coming from the 'processor' of the shuffle, headphone length is a bit long for even 5"5' people.  Overall, the iPod Shuffle is great and cheap! Its small size and simplicity packs excellent audio quality and has a reasonable battery life to size ratio. However, the LIMITED features Apple designed on the 1GB shuffle lures many people to the Mini (if you can fork over another $50, you mind as well get the Mini for an LCD screen and a lot more features!). Therefore it's either the $100 Shuffle or the $200 Mini you should be deciding...but I think that Apple could do better next year...

<Title>Shuffle vs iAudio U2
<Date>Sat Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before I bought my Shuffle, I read every review here, and was disappointed that nobody had compared it with other flash players.  So, I ended up doing some comparisons, and thought I'd post the info for others in their mp3 player search.  Let me first say, that if I were to buy a hard drive-based mp3 player, it would absolutely be an iPod; they're just the best.  However, when it comes to the flash-based players, the Shuffle has a good deal of competition out there.  The players I looked at were the Shuffle, the iAudio U2, the iRiver iFP 799T , and the Creative MuVo TX FM, all 1GB models.  The first choice I made was whether or not I wanted an internal battery or a AA or AAA battery.  There are pro's and con's to both, which I think are pretty intuitive.  I ended up wanting an internal battery because I wanted the lightest player possible.  However, the iRiver was a real contender for the simple fact that you can get a waterproof case and headphones, so you can actually use it while swimming!  After looking at the iRiver, I didn't like how the player was designed.  The buttons were hard to operate (I wear size 10 gloves-XL) and it appeared that it would be awkward to use while running.  I didn't like the Creative because it felt low-quality and the design of it coming apart wasn't appealing.  Thus, I was left with the Shuffle and the iAudio U2, both of which I bought and used, with the intention of keeping the one I liked more.   Accessories: Shuffle - came with decent headphones, and a heavy string-like lanyard.  Not included were a case $26, or an armband $30.    iAudio U2 - came with a sport case, decent headphones, a very nice lanyard (looks like a silver chain), firewire/USB adapter, firewire/USB corded adapter, and depending on where you buy it, a free armband ($7 retail).  Sound Quality: I should start off by stating that I am an audiophile, so I used a pair of high-end Shure E3c earbuds ($180) in my evaluation.  I also used the stock earbuds for both players briefly.  Both work fine but just aren't up to the level of what I desire.  Also, it should go without saying that the quality of the mp3's that you put on your player have the biggest impact on the quality of the sound.    Shuffle - Not bad, but could be better.  It would have been nice to have been able to adjust the highs and lows.  Due to the design of the Shuffle, you can not adjust the bass or treble.  iAudio U2 - Wow, to say it was good would be an understatement.  It was very rich and deep, with excellent high and deep lows.  Because the U2 has a display, you can go into the menu's and make an incredible number of adjustments to the sound.  If you have an ear that can tell differences in sound quality, then take a hard look at this player.  Design/Features: Shuffle - I like the shuffle design a lot, and I think their case is the bomb.  We all know it doesn't have a display or a radio, so enough of that already...  If you want a display or a radio, then get something else instead of venting on this forum.  One feature that I do LOVE on the shuffle is the built-in USB port.  It is VERY nice to be able to take the end cap off and see a USB port on the end.  Also, because the Shuffle is thin, it's easy to plug into a laptop USB port without it blocking the other port.  On desktops, you might need a cable since the configuration/design of desktop USB ports is hit and miss.  Of particular disappointment is the on/off switch.  If you use the shuffle in the gym, and you get sweaty in any way, you're not going to be able to work the on/off switch very well.  It's very slick.  Why does this matter?  Well, if you're on random mode and you want to put it in continuous mode (perhaps you want to hear more songs from the current artist playing) then you inevitably turn it off.  Of course, once you turn it off then you've lost being able to listen to that artist.  I do like the control pad on the shuffle as it's attractive and easy to use.  Whenever you shut the Shuffle off, the volume goes down to 0.  Every time you turn it on, you have to push the volume up button about 15-20 times (not an exaggeration).  Because of this, you don't know if it's playing or not, and it can take a few moments until you know if you're going to be hearing music.  I'm sure with more use this would be less of an issue, but I used it for a month and it still bothered me.  In this case, a display would be nice (okay, I said it.)  Also, because I have over 500 cd's, it is nice to be able to look at the display when I forget the name of the artist/song.  This would probably be much less of an issue for someone with a small audio collection.  iAudio - Very sleek and impressive.  It has a FM Radio; recording from mic, radio, or line in; a graphic equalizer, many pre-set eq settings, date and time clock, fun visualizations, left/right speaker display, volume display, name of song display, and is backlit.  The display crams a great deal of information in the small space, but because it's razor sharp, it's useful.  The backlight is nice and very bright (it's not always on).  The radio works fine, and the recording capability works well too.  The menu's are many and go deep.  The case is made to be more durable, and as a result is a neoprene-type material with rubber, but it has cutouts for the controls.  With the case on, it makes the control stick a little more challenging to use, but it's not by any means difficult.  It does not sheild moisture as good as the Shuffle case would.  The U2 case is better suited to being dropped and looks as though it'd absorb shock better.  The way you recharge the U2 is to use it's firewire port.  It comes with a rather fat firewire/USB adapter, so you may have to unplug your other USB accessories for it to fit.  However, that's if you use the small adapter, if you use the adapter that is corded (both are included), then this is not a problem.  The U2 uses a control stick in addition to a few buttons.  Most tasks are accomplished using the stick, which is very easy to operate.  I was expecting it to be sensitive and difficult to use, but it is not, and I have fairly large hands.    Battery Life:  Both are internal and seem to get about the same 10-12 hours of play, however, the Shuffle can take an optional battery pack or an external adapter for plugging/charging it in a wall outlet.  Both of those features totally rock.  However, the iAudio can have the battery replaced for $40 as opposed to the Shuffle's $99.    Software: Shuffle - It's iTunes or it's nothing.  And not just iTunes, but iTunes format which is NOT mp3, it's aac.  If you have all your audio files in mp3, then iTunes will convert them to aac, but you lose audio quality that way (not an option for me).  If you want to reburn all your cd's into aac format, then you can retain the audio quality.  If your files are already in aac, then the shuffle is the player you probably want.  Also, when you burn a CD in iTunes, it burns it as aac.  In order to get it to mp3, you have to burn it to CD, and then copy it back to the hard drive.  AGHH!!!  The madness!!!  Why does Apple have to be so difficult?!  The only positive I see with using iTunes is that its interface is nice, and it runs fast.  If the Shuffle would play mp3's, it'd be MUCH more of a contender in my book.  iAudio U2 - The U2 shows up as a hard drive and you can drag and drop files into it (any kind of files), without having to install any software.  However, if you have a huge audio library, then that just doesn't work as it's too cumbersome.  The U2 comes with audio management software that will find your music files and you can manage it that way.  It's fast, and works well, but it isn't as nice as the iTunes interface.  Musicmatch is my mp3 software of choice, and it is very slow when compared to iTunes, but it's much more versatile for my use and is compatible with the U2.    Overall Assessment: The Shuffle IS very cool looking, and if we are buying the latest and greatest flash player, then we DO want it to be cool, right?  However, even though I think the look of the Shuffle is awesome, especially with the cool case you can get for it, I still have to side with the U2.  I really wanted to like the Shuffle, I really did, but when I took it into work to listen to some music, I couldn't because of the aac format of the files.  And when I discovered what you had to do to change those files into mp3's, I was frustrated; it's just not versatile enough for my use.  Also, because the audio quality of the U2 is a step above the Shuffle, that's what ultimately swayed me, so I kept the U2 and returned the Shuffle.  The Shuffle's audio quality isn't bad by any means, it's just that the U2's is really, really good.  If you have any doubts about my ravings over the audio quality of the U2, just search the web and look at other reviews.  Also, because of all the accessories that came with the U2, it was also the better value.

<Title>Nice player but terrible compatibility problems
<Date>Sat Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The ipod shuffle has big compatibility problems. Before you buy it be careful of the following: If you have a laptop, make sure that it has USB 2.0 and they are powered, or you won't be able to charge it. Also, look at Apple's discussion fourms and check the hundreds of people that have problems getting the ipod recongnized by windows and then by iTunes. Make sure your computer's configuration does not appear there.  The software provided with shuffle (as of april 1, 2005) does not work, so you have to go to apple's website to get a new one.  I have two computers, a hp laptop and a dell desktop. The ipod shuffle does not get recongnized by the laptop at all and only sometimes by the desktop.  If you are a previous ipod owner and did not use itunes to load your ipod, you can't do that with the shuffle. You can use it as a flash drive, but the songs won't get recognized automatically.  The ipod itself is a nice gadget, but because of drivers, software and firmware issues it's been a source of a lot of frustration for many users.  I'm returning mine.

<Title>The perfect companion to any hard drive based iPod.
<Date>Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Since the iPod shuffle lacks a display, I wouldn't want this to be the only MP3 player that I own but I think it's the perfect compliment to any existing iPod. I love the fact that I can drop it in my pocket and I can't even tell that it's in there. Now I have access to my music all the time no matter where I go. I was worried about being able to go back and relisten to a section of an audible book if I couldn't hear what was being said but you can just press and hold the back button and it rewinds a few seconds at a time so no worries there. If you really want to listen to something in order you do have that option but even on my larger iPod I nearly alwasy listen to my playlist on shuffle mode. I also use disk function to shuttle documents that are too large to email between work and home. I absolutely love this thing.

<Title>Shuffle beats all MP3 Players in sound quality
<Date>Wed Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Recently I read an analysis by Bill Machrone of PC Week that showed the Shuffle's ability to maintain a perfect square sine wave even under load. For the uninitiated, a square sine wave means sound is being reproduced perfectly. Well, most -if not all- MP3 players on the market cannot reproduce the lower spectrum very well when a user plugs in earphones. So you end up with good middle and high range and varying forms of messed up low range reproduction. NOT THE SHUFFLE. It manages to go from a positive to a negative load in millseconds and maintain it perfectly for the necessary length of time. This is a marvel of engineering. So what does all this mean? Get a Shuffle and a decent set of earbuds like Sony's Fontopia and you have quite possibly the best audiophile MP3 setup available as of today. And  you can have it all for less than $200 . Don't believe me? Try it!

<Content>I love this little gizmo!   I don't need a 40G ipod, because I use my computer to store my music. What I wanted was something tiny and light, something that wouldn't skip, something that I could stick in a small  pocket, and that would hold enough music to get me through the day. This little number does the trick perfectly.   I don't mind the lack of playlists - I always use shuffle at home anyway. But for on the go, trekking around the campus, hiking, shopping, ignoring strangers on the train, etc, this is the perfect ipod!   Installing the software was a snap, and the earbuds are more than sufficient for my ears. Also, the lanyard is quite cute and useful - turning your ipod into a pendant and a handy conversation piece!  For the money, you would be hard-pressed to do better. Go ahead, spend the dough - you won't be sorry!

<Title>TERRIBLY painful earbuds!  Ouch!
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple's lawyers ought to review the design of these HARD earbuds.  Really bad!  If you wear these for an extended time, your ear canals will be quite sore...and any slight movement of your head will remind you.  Get earbuds you like (try some first), too bad they'll likely be BLACK while the iPod default is WHITE.  Also, some earphone draw more power...my nice Sony Noise Reduction over-the-earphones (A must for flying) couldn't give me the volume I wanted....  The machine is fine, although it does not put out much volume.  It would be nice if the ITunes software could equalize all the songs to the same loudness level.  I found I had to frequently adjust the volume - perhaps no fault of Apple.  It's ok...it's cool (now anyway - everyone gawked at it on a recent international trip), and it fits in your pocket when not being used.  Battery life is not bad.  I charged it up in an electronics store when it died... 5 minutes in a handy laptop USB port gave me about another hour of playing time.  Wahoo!  It's good for me, an adult.  I like it.

<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod shuffle is $150, and holds 250 songs. Its has no desplay, and has about 4 buttons. It's not worth it. This is perfect if you have a big ipod already, and need somthing alot more portable, for sports or somthing. But You should DEFINETLY NOT get this for your only mp3 player.  I would suggest saving only $50 more to get an ipod mini, to hold 4 times that space, have a display, and a touch wheel. Cummon, they are only $200 bucks,(amazon is actually having a sale for even cheaper,) they look cooler, and you still don't even know it are in your pocket. Unless you are using this for sprts and have a big iPod already, dont get this. Get the mini.

<Title>What's the fuss about?
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my Ipod shuffle a few days ago after weeks of agonizing over what kind of MP3 player I should get. Here's what I have decided:  Pros:  1. Small, cute, unobtrusive. Gets mega-points for form factor.  BUT it would be nice if the sliding switch on the back had a raised bar on it for traction, also the tactile feedback on the buttons is a little shallow, but livable.   2. Works well with Itunes, and Autofill makes quick work of usually a time-consuming task.  3. Flash based media won't skip   4. USB charging good for those who don't want extra cables (like me)  5. Can be used as a jump drive. In fact, you can adjust your settings to reserve space for music, and the rest for data.   CONS: 1. Can't tell if the darn thing is on.  In direct sunlight with sunglasses on, you can't really tell what color the indicator light is. It pauses for a second before playing the song, so I end up hitting the play button twice and it pauses. This is further confounded when I tried to hook my shuffle up with an FM transmitter, while driving. After nearly endangering my life and the lives of others in the car with me, I decided to just stick to the radio.   2. No multiple machines. I have a laptop, and a desktop. The desktop has most of my media. The laptop has about 6 gigs of music that I use while I'm in school. Apple has a "One Shuffle, One computer" policy. How can you reconcile the two? Choose one machine, and migrate files regularly.  3. Itunes must be closed to use as a removable HD (aka "jump drive") This is more of a "programming quirk" than a gripe. Once you get used to it, it isn't a big deal.   4. USB 2.0 is still slow I know its the standard, but it still takes about 10 mins to load up your Ipod Shuffle with a gig of music. I understand its the best simple solution out there, but I'm impatient  5. Is it done? I leave my machines on all the time, and when a machine is on and the shuffle is plugged in it will treat it as it is accessing a drive (hence, blinking orange light). Unfortunately, that's also the light pattern that tells you "charging". Who knows when your Ipod shuffle is fully charged? You got to unseat it and check the back, or plug it BACK in and if it blinks green, you're good to go.   This fares better than other mini mp3 players like the Panasonic SV-SD80 that I had becuase:  1. Itunes software is intuitive and elegant vs. Panasonic's clunky, slow andproprietary Real Player software that you can't re-download (which is why I had to get a new mp3 player).  2. Doesn't need a docking station to recharge 3. No proprietary media reader  Otherwise, they're about equal, and in many usability respects the SV was better.   Moral of the Story: There is no perfect MP3 player out there yet.

<Content>This was a waste of my money. It is only compatible with computers running Windows 2000 or XP and those that have USB 2.0 ports. Nice of Apple to advertise that. Now I'm out $150 and have a music player the size of a gum pack. I've always hated Apple and their pretty but useless products. I got duped on this one, but never again.

<Title>Good iPod Experience
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Shuffle was announced and made available, in January 2005.   I received my iPod Shuffle, about five weeks, afters its introduction, so I have been using it, for over seven months. I should point out that I already had a full size iPod, but I wanted the shuffle, for its small size and extreme portability.   The shuffle is incredibly impressive, when you first receive it. Its tiny size and light weight really strikes you as unbelievable.   The shuffle charges and syncs to your iTunes library by USB 2.0. Charging takes about three hours, if you want a full charge, and the syncing of songs is pretty fast. You can have the shuffle select the songs randomly from your iTunes library, or choose your own custom mix.   I find the lack of display on the shuffle to not be an issue. The reason being is that this shuffle holds about 240 songs, so there really isn't a need, for a display. After all, who wants to be looking at a tiny display? I just want to listen to my music. You can have the shuffle play your songs in the order you setup in iTunes, or have it mix things up, with a random shuffle.    The shuffle has been reliable over the past six months. It still works great, looks great, and the battery still lasts close to the specification 12 hours.   Overall, I still use my full size iPod, for the majority of the time. However, when I want extreme portability and something that is not weighing down my pocket, I use the shuffle. It is also nice to use, if you're going to be an environment where you're concerned about damage or theft to your iPod, since the shuffle is less expensive. The iPod Shuffle makes a great second iPod, for iPod fans. However, it makes a great first and only iPod, for many people too. The iPod Shuffle brings the convenience of having any song (up to approximately 240 on this model), from your iTunes music library with you, wherever you go. Music makes life a lot of fun, and this shuffle helps bring the music to you.

<Title>Pretty cool, but keep in mind...
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My 1 Gig shuffle has served me well. It's best aspects are its lightness and portability. The lack of a display is what made me decide to upgrade - if you have a lot of music or if you like putting new stuff on your Ipod, you'll probably want a display so you can see who is playing what.   1 Gig may be too much storage for a unit like this. Why? Because you probably only want your favorites on this device since it's pretty much impossible to find a specific track without skipping and skipping and skipping through all your songs. If you just put what you want to hear on it with no surprises and not too much random crap that you may or may not want to listen to, then it works fine.   Podcasts work on this too, but of course they're difficult to find if you have a bunch of music on there too.

It is very small and light so you can hang around without worrying about it.. Definitely a must if you like music, but not if you like tons of music and wanna see each song name or artist (as you don't have a display)  This iPod is for people who like to be dynamic and random.

<Content>I was on amazon searching for the smallest mp3 players they got out on the maket. So, i looked up ipod and they had the ipod shuffle. It looks awsome. Super small, light weight, but no screen. COME ON APPLE! This made me mad. Sorry apple, with no screen i will take my buisiness elseware. There is a Creative Zen Nano for only 100 bucks and it has a screen. If u want money, make a screen on the shuffle, if u don't want more money and u are too lazy, its not my problem. Cause the Creative Zen Nano holds 1 gb and has a screen and costs less than apples shuffle. What are u paying for in the shuffle, it has a shuffle feature, big whoop, all u pay for is the little apple simbol and the apple name. It's retarted.  If u want the same quilaty mp3 players for less, look up creative zen mp3 players and they have some very good and cheap ones. I have bought the creative zen nano and i think its awsome, has a screen, and it costs less. HELLO, APPLE!, get a screen on the shuffle and MAYBEE i will consider buying it, or getting it as a gift for someone!

<Title>Sweat will kill this little puppy; customer service issues in Seattle
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had the same problem described by a recent reviewer: sweat will corrode the Shuffle to the point where it stops working. I used the Shuffle on the treadmill at my gym for only about two weeks. It first started turning off by itself and eventually wouldn't work at all. I took it to the Apple store in Seattle and the customer service rep was rude and told me that it was my fault for breaking it because it was obvious that it was caused by "user-initiated water damage". I then spoke to the manager named Susan Bell and she said the same thing. She told me she goes to the gym all the time (which I'm sorry to say I don't believe judging by her looks) and hadn't had that problem. Even though I've only used it for a couple of weeks, she said there was nothing she could do because it was my fault. How is it my fault if the Shuffle is advertised for recreational use? I can't believe these penny-pinchers!   Apple: you just lost a customer for life.

<Title>A Nice Small Device
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's time to review the newest gadget in my life, the 1 gigabyte iPod Shuffle. Overall, I have been very impressed with the device. The device does have a few drawbacks, but for what I've found it's perfect for my usage style.   I'll start with the positives and there are quite a few. Judging the size and weight, the device is amazingly small and light. I can easily shove it in my pocket or put it around my neck (with the including lanyard) and within seconds I'll forget it's there. This is a large plus for me, as I want to be able to carry it everywhere effortlessly. A nice feature that avoids bulk is the cover for the USB connector is an interchangeable piece that can either be a flat stub (how the device is often pictured) or the lanyard clip, like I wear it. Most of the accessories take advantage of this space for their connection to the iPod.   The storage capacity of the one-gigabyte version is perfect for my use. I have personally rated most of the music in my iTuneslibrary over the past year (8000+ songs) and use the autofill option to fill the device with music from the "My Top Rated" playlist. I can pick and choose music I would want to include and then autofill the rest of the space, but I rarely go that route. The autofill feature is flawless and ensures a steady variety of good music from my collection. I can go for a couple weeks at a time (or a sixteen-hour drive to North Dakota and back like last weekend) without hearing the same song twice, because I have roughly 220 songs on the device at any time. The battery life seems great to me, it lasts at least the 12 hours Apple says. The battery charges when plugged into any USB port, making it easy to charge anywhere you are. The USB drive function of the device is an added plus, I can carry a gig of data with me at any time if need be and I can play the music on the Shuffle in MP3 software on any computer I plug the device into (like I do at work).   My heaviest use of the device occurs in the car. I want to be able to sit-down, pull the device out of my pocket, plug it in to my tape-deck adaptor, and jam away. That's exactly what I am able to do with the Shuffle. The device pumps out some pretty good sound quality at a volume much higher than my previous MP3 device (Palm Zire 71). I think I would have a much harder time doing this with the other iPods and any larger MP3 player.   Comparing the device to the other iPods and most of the upper-tier MP3 players, it has that nice factor of not having to worry about it. If you're at all like me you want to take good care of your portable devices (PDA, cell phone, digital camera, etc), the iPod Shuffle makes this easy. The device is light but of decent size, this makes it a perfect size to stay in my pocket without annoying me. Because of the cost and size of the device ($150 for the 1GB version) I don't panic when I fall over and have it on, it's small and is not going to set me back a month's salary if it gets damaged. I have successfully (unfortunately) bumped the device into numerous things including the basement and my car door, and when I expected it to quit working it has kept on jugging.   On the negative side... If you're one that has to have your entire collection with you (I can only see this if you are gone for days at a time), this device is not for you. If you're one that needs the screen because you can't handle a random song, this device is not for you. If you're one that really likes big bulky device, the Shuffle is not for you.   If you are one that finds anything I said before remotely applicable to them you may be interested in the iPod Shuffle. It has been definitely been a great device for me, and I recommend it to anyone out there looking for an MP3 player to take jogging, carry in their pocket, or to replace their existing USB flash drive.

I bought an Ipod Shuffle for her and it piece of cake to use. You do have to use Itunes to download music, but that is easier to use than the other programs out there. The size is amazing and there isn't small hard to read digital screen. It's either on or off and easy to understand.

<Title>Hyped Junk by Apple
<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has realized that most people would rather be "in" than get what is useful. It has been working unfortunately and that allows the company to peddle cheap items and a market up price.  There is almost nothing unique about the shuffle other than a minimalistic case which exemplifies the lack of features within. There is no way to navigate to any song you want to hear because Apple saved money in by not putting in an LCD display or navigational system. This glaring omission is hyped up the wazoo with "random is the new order" and other clever marketing slogans before the next version where random will be out and common sense will be in. Ever wonder how long it took to cycle through 300 songs, one by one?  You cannot control playlists either and the great portability for sports/gym workouts is also gone. You cannot regulate the tone quality either so you are stuck with how the sonic quality plays, which is adequate. What are the pros? None that are really unique to this device except for a pleasing shape, relatively good battery life, ability to play much of your music that you have in an iPod and that the battery can charge in your USB port. You are overpaying for an item with no radio either.  WHAT SHOULD YOU GET INSTEAD OF THIS OVERHYPED INADEQUATE DEVICE?  Well, I ended up settling on the Samsung YP-MT6Z. THIS is the new order and there are plenty of other similar devices. It's just a wee bit bigger than a single AA battery, which it takes and lasts over 40 hours. No, I'm not kidding as I've tested it myself. You get various different EQs, effects, truebass, SRS, WOW, ability to set playlists, random (if you really need to be in the "new order"), 1GB of memory to store songs in any format, an FM radio, a voice recorder, A-B repeat (cool!) and it also acts as a USB memory card. It also has cool colored lights if you're into that sort of thing. I can say that it is the best musical device I have ever purchased and it is a joy to use as an ultra portable music player. Look elsewhere. Don't support Apple's bottom line by buying into their marketing junk.

<Title>worth every penny
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Is the iPod Shuffle perfect?  No.  Is it somehow still flawless?  Absolutely.  This little device has changed my life in the same way TiVo has changed it.  I am freed from the constraints of technology and my life is better.  My husband got me the Shuffle while I was in the hospital and it got me through some tough times, being able to listen to my favorite music.  Now that I'm home it's no less valuable, allowing me to walk around the house early in the morning or late at night, or even sleep next to aforementioned husband -- listening without disturbing anyone else.  Ten years ago I took a vacation and wanted to bring my favorite music, and wound up lugging around a bulky tape recorder with tinny speakers and a bunch of batteries; now I can just toss my Shuffle in a pocket and go!  As usual, the Apple Corporation has designed a beautiful and functional piece of technology with a vision rarely found in other companies.  The design is superb, with intuitive controls that even a sick person can operate right away.  While ads say you get 12 hours of music per charge, I tested this out.  I let my Shuffle totally run out, recharged it in my computer for 2 hours, and then played it non-stop for 17 hours!  I've also dropped it and the replay didn't even skip.  The volume control has about 40 clicks, so you get the sound level just right.  The earbuds are very comfortable and stay in place well; Consumer Reports recently rated tham as the best headphones on a music player.  This is a sturdy, well-designed music player with great sound quality, intuitive controls, huge capacity and .... it's beautiful!  The Shuffle will not be for everyone.  I like it because I want to load it up with a couple of hundred songs and then just let it shuffle.  I don't care if I see the title on a display.  My husband wants to be able to play a favorite album or two, or have a mix ready for when he exercises, so he has the 512 Mb Shuffle.  We are both very happy.  The Shuffle comes with a software disk, a reference card, headphones with adapters, instructions, Apple decals and a lanyard for hanging the Shuffle around your neck rather than tucked in a pocket.  Many accessories are available, including many types of adapters, carriers, docks and speakers.  Superb.  Couldn't be happier.

<Title>iPod Shuffle makes the way small and easy
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my iPod Shuffle for one week now.  I think it is great. Its small, easy to use, and the battery seems to last a long time as I haven't run the battery out yet.  I like the fact that I could play my music over the radio if I purchased the accessory.  There are also many ways to carry the iPod with you, around the neck (which is how it comes), a couple of different arm bands or a couple of different clips that can attach it to a shirt, waist, or other place (but these are extra, and i haven't decided how I want to carry it around in the gym.) I also like that it plays a variety of music formats like MP3 or the iTunes format.  I decided to keep a little space on it so that i can carry documents and files back and forth between the office and home, and I haven't even come close to using all the memory on it.   I like to load it with the songs that I want for that day, run, or what ever.  It is pretty quick and easy to change the songs on.  I've used both options for playing songs - shuffle or in order.  It just depends on my mood at the time or with those particular songs that I've loaded.   Remember it is very small (I was surprised how small it is even though I looked at the pictures of it) and plugs into a USB port to load or change music as well as for charging up (no changing batteries, unless they wear out, and then a dealer would have to change them.)  If there is any problem, I found that on my Gateway Desktop at work I could not plug the iPod Shuffle into the front USB ports. (I had an extra USB hub that solved the problem for me, so just beware that the edges of the iPod Shuffle may stick out just enough to cause problems with were you want to plug it in.)   The music quality is good and i can use it with the headphones or with computer speakers.  I plugged it into the JBL Creature 2 speakers, as well as my regular stereo system via a headphone plug to RCA adapter, and both sounded good.  Added later:  I've found out that the Shuffle is susceptible to moisture like sweat, and decided to protect it with the DLO ActionJacket for the iPod Shuffle.

<Title>Great for Music, but a Major Bug with Audible Audiobooks
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As others have covered here, it's a great and simple Music player.  Sounds excellent, screen or not.  However there are many problems with Audible files.  The biggest problems are with Bookmarking.  Many people in the Apple Discussion Group (including myself) report bookmarks, skipping ahead several minutes, being forced to sync with the iTunes bookmark, losing the bookmark all together.  The Shuffle fast-forwards and reverses Very Slowly.  Can you imagine having to hold the reverse button for several minutes every time you switch on your player or switch from music?  What if you're five hours into a ten hour book and suddenly your bookmark is Gone!  This is what is happening to users.  Some users say that they work best with Type 3 Audible files, but this is only true for some and usage is still not nearly perfect.  Apple claims full compatibility with Audible files, but that is not the case.  They either need to fix the problem or take this claim off of their documentation.  Search for "Audible" in the Shuffle forum at Apple.  This player is not for Audiobook users...yet.  Using iPod Shuffle http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@220.IhmBaMf0TSP.0@.68a37f5b

<Title>Great for the car!
<Date>Sat May 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my Shuffle for about a month and a half now and I am really enjoying it!  I use mine mainly for the car.  While some may complain that it is a "dumbed down" version of the IPod, I think it is actually really cool that the music is random, and that you don't know what will be played next.  It makes driving a lot more fun and exciting simply because of the anticipation.  I think it was an ingenious move of Apple to create an IPod that doesn't cost so much money, so that "average Joe's" could afford a nice machine at an affordable price.  Actually, having the IPod Shuffle has increased my awareness of how wonderful ITunes is, and the purchase is really leading me to wanting a full IPod so that I can carry my whole 1000+ song list on one machine.  So, if you are looking for a small, pocket-size machine that has good looks, a nice sound, and doesn't take your whole tax return or paycheck to purchase, then the IPod Shuffle is right for you!!

I kind of wonder about the reviewers who say that there are other flash based mp3 players that cost the same but have more features and anyone who buys the shuffle is ... (substitute your favorite ad hominem attack). If you want those other features, don't buy the shuffle. But, I don't want a screen (prone to getting scratched or cracked), an FM tuner (I don't listen to the radio), voice recording (um, just have no use for that in my life). For what I wanted, this is THE perfect device. Sound is great even with my cheap Koss ear phones. Size is amazing. It's the perfect player for grabbing and dropping in your pocket.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I needed something that would allow me to listen to music at the gym (since I workout 6 days/week). I looked at the other options, the Shuffle fit the bill. I was originally going to get the 512mb version but opted for the 1gb model since it's not much more.  Pros: -This thing is tiny, not much bigger than the USB thumb drives I use. -No moving parts means no skipping while I'm on the treadmill. -Very easy to use and install (took several minutes). The shuffle I purchased needed an update to Itunes, which was a quick download. -Ready to use out of the box. Includes the Shuffle, headphones, 2 sets of pads, some Apple stickers, manual, CD all in a very bright green box.  Cons: -Small enough so you don't know it's there, gotta be careful not to sit on it.  A lot of folks seem to be concerted about the lack of a screen. If I'm working out I don't need a screen. No reason to complain about lack of a screen if you look at it and see THERE IS NO SCREEN. Buy one of the other models if you need a screen.  When you register it you'll be required to enter the serial number. It's located on the Ipod itself and is tiny but it is also on the bottom of the box next to the barcodes and is much easier to read. I've seen (on other sites) people complaining about the side of the serial number on the unit. You now know that it is on the box. :)  After you install it it will need to charge, so don't plan on using it immediately.

Its fast and easy to use, doesnt take any setting up and is ready out of the box.  The only problem I have found with it is that the shut off switch is on the back and its hard to remember to shut it off everytime I'm done with it, which leads to the thing being compelety drained.  But, it's easily solved because the thing charges very quick. In fact, I'm using it right now... I'd pretty much recommend this to anyone that is considering getting a mp3 player of any type, even over the larger bigger ipods... espeically since you dont have to worry about it breaking or the screen fading... cause it's cheaper and quite durable.  A must have for any sport enthusist... runners, bikers etc..

<Title>Best on the market as of August 8th 2005
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yesterday I learned that Apple was releasing their latest iPod family member: the iPod nano.    First of all I must say I disagree with those reviews or reviewers which complaint about things they knew before purchasing the item: yes the shuffle lacks any sort of display.  Fast reviewed facts:   - Ease of use: this is the real plug&play thing.  It won't get any easier to use, yet it comes with a pretty good menu of advanced features in case you might want to customize your iPod shuffle so that I will store both data and mp3s.  Charging is also simple, come on I hate all A/C adaptors, you can really forget about wires, voltage etc.  Yet this might be a drawback if you lack a USB port around, but... how would you transfer songs in anyway?  - Reliable: even though this is not a waterproof or shock resistant player, I take it with me while doing downhill bicycle riding and I have been under heavy rain and rough terrains yet my iPod has never failed (although it has been quite wet).  Also batteries last as stated in the technical specs, perhaps 30 mins less (this will depend mostly on the volume you listen your music at).  Size and weight:  simply small and light.  In my opinion the iPod shuffle player is the best for use while doing any sport.  I ride bycicle quite often and I couldn't care less whether my mp3 player had display or not, because I wouldn't be able to look at it anyway, yet the weight of a normal iPod would actually bother me.  I also enjoy of listening to my songs randomly but hey! you can also organize all sorts of ordered playlists.  Only drawback:  iTunes could be a bit complex sometimes, the latest version iTunes 5 just came out, I'll have to try that one out.  But as I started my review i must finish by saying that this iPod is more that I spected, therefore no reason for giving it less than 5 stars, I only review items I own and use.

<Title>Beware if using iPod Shuffle as a USB jump drive
<Date>Sat Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just wanted to add what I have not noticed in other reviews: if you intend to also use the iPod Shuffle as a jump drive, it's NOT compatible with multiple operating systems (or even multiple versions of an OS)! Apple tech support confirms the Shuffle formats itself based on the first computer you dock with, and must be reformatted on another computer to use the data storage feature (assuming that other computer has iTunes installed).  Leave it to Apple to take the 'Universal' out of 'Universal Serial Bus'.

<Title>The Fun I-Pod
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Dear all, Amazon asked me if I��d like to post a review on the purchase of my I-Pod shuffler. Here it is, the I-pod shuffler is for the most just as I expected, light and look sophisticate. So in order to make this review as complete and simple as possible I��m going to use the pros and cons approach.  Pros: it��s sleek, looks better and is way more fashionable than other mp3 player. Weight close to nothing, can be plugged directly to an USB port and the sound is GREAT!  You can use it as a shuffler or just play your song in the order. And finally, it has a full assortment of accessory.   Cons: considering the some what low price of the shuffler the accessories tends to be expensive, take for instance the I-trip system to connect your I-Pod to your car radio, cost about $60 that is half of the price of your device. The USB connection on your I-pod is some-what shorter than the regular USB plug, and had a hard time to connect to my Dell, so I had to get the desk top connection, you may just use a USB extension cable, but they come out to be about the same price. No way to predict the next song, but hey it��s a shuffler and is what I like about it, we are not looking for mobile DJs here!  The I-Tune software is not as easy to use as the window media player, but that is just me��  In conclusion I��m very happy with the look of the I-Pod shuffler, the sound is great and it turns heads some-what. I would definitely recommend this product to somebody who goes to the gym, or like bicycling and is not looking for something complicated to use.

<Title>IPod Review
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great little music machine!  It's small, can be charged directly on the USB of my computer, and it holds a lot of songs.  The only thing we don't like is that you can only download songs from one source (library).  If you want to go elsewhere to download, you have to delete what is already in there.  I don't think this is operator error, but I could be wrong.  All in all, it's fabulous - great sound quality!

<Title>GREAT PRODUCT...GREAT INVESTMENT
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I must say first that I was mad that I bought this and found out that the new ipod nano is out...I think I might have went with that instead...maybe!  As for my shuffle, it's great.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  I think I should've went with the one that hold 220 songs, but I was being cheap.  Anyway, 120 songs is sufficient.    I love it because: It's small and light weight It looks kewl (lol) Great sound Gives me randomness, never know what I'm going to get:) Sticks very nicely into my laptop.   Why it lost a star: BATTERY LIFE SUCKS!!! OMG, it is awful!  My travel time during anyday is 2 hours.  Then I like to listen to it on my lunch break at work and between classes at school.  So I need at least THREE hours of battery life per day.  I get about 2 hours, some days I get 1 1/2 hours.  When I first started using it I think I got like three hours of life.  I'm not sure what the book says batt. life should be, but I'm tired of my music cutting off in the middle of a good song after I charged it for FOUR hours (that's about how long it takes to charge) the night before.  Grrr!   Moving on, the litte rubbery end of the headphones picks up all the colors of my clothes.  When I stick it in my pocket the color rubs off on the cord and it DOESN'T come off.  I'm a little anal about that and it looks dirty...yuck!  It bugs the heck out of me.   Next, the accesories, as many have mentioned, are wicked expensive.  Lawd haf mercy....the dock-or whatever it's called-is almost as much as the ipod itself.  After you get all the accesories you end up spending more on that than the actual shuffle.   Last, why can we only charge the thing if the computer is on?  I think this is the only way to juice it up..not to sure.  I hate having to cut my computer on just to give it a charge.  And it will only charge if I open up and connect to itunes.  I'm NOT computer savvy so it could be something I'm doing wrong or just missing something in the directions, but I swear this is the only way to charge it up.  Is there no regular kind of charger, apple people, that we can use to gas up our shuffles?  AND it runs my computer battery down waaaay fast when I do it that way.    As for downloading, I have no problems.  I just download from itunes and my CD's.  I'm not with all that high tech I want to download from here there and everywhere, so this works great for me.  Though I'm not too sure how it works when you try to take song OFF of your ipod!    But no matter what it's a great little device.  It's worh one hundred dollars, it gets he job done, and it's so bloody portable it's amazing.  If you are considering a shuffle I say go for it, it's AWESOME!!!

<Title>i-Cheapo
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After owning a regular iPod for over a year, I decided to purchase an iPod Shuffle mainly for active use in situations I would not feel comfortable using my regular iPod. There are obvious missing features on the iPod Shuffle which I was willing to accept in exchange for a more durable device. While feature cuts only make sense given the size and the price of the iPod Shuffle, I believe a couple key functions would greatly improve the iPod Shuffle.   A major missing feature on the iPod Shuffle is some kind of indication of what track number you are on. While a full screen is out of the question on such a small device, I think a simple LCD one would be a huge help in searching through tracks. Second, there is no option to jump ahead more than a single track or jump from one album to the next. This is a feature that could have been easily added in iTunes, so its exclusion is really inexcusable. Third, listening to files from Audible.com is a real pain because there is no option to skip ahead into a track exceeding an hour in length. While simple elegance in design is a key factor in what you get from Apple, I believed the possible features I mentioned could have been easy been included in the iPod Shuffle design. For instance, a track number could light up and show through the surface of the iPod Shuffle without the need for an actual screen. Jumping from one album to the next could have been accomplished by holding the forward and backward track buttons for a second or longer and skipping forward through a long track could have been accomplished with a tilting dial on the back of the iPod.    Speaking of the back of the iPod Shuffle, I believe the toggle switch between off, repeat, and shuffle functions is difficulty positioned. Currently you need to flip the device over in order to select one of the settings. While a small detail, I think a switch on the edge of the iPod would be much easier to use.   In terms of size and sound quality, iPod Shuffle cannot be beat. It's just plain practical for no matter where you happen to be. It is small enough to fit in a pocket and not notice it and large enough to comfortably hold and operate with a single hand. If you want music on the go, in a small package, this is a great option. It also serves well as a flash drive, crossing between mac and windows. You'll soon love having this little sound stick in your shirt pocket whenever you need it.   In conclusion, I'm happy with my purchase, but I think the functionality is not up to typical Apple standards. Apple finally released Mighty Mouse as their first two-button mouse. It's about time we see a Mighty Shuffle.

<Title>Great Little FRAGILE device
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, I just had to get this little thing. Suffice it to say, that I have had at least 5 different mp3 type players.. and they were all at least good, some were frustrating, but good. Some better than others...   BUT!!!   If you prefer an Mp3 player that does NOT have confusing menu's .. useless menu's, or menu's that just seem to be outright dumb and nonsensicle... some menu items and screens are there I feel, for self serving promo reasons (with our mp3 player you get 10 thousand menu options!!! -who cares)... but with this device, it is all about the music.   All of the menu options (and no silly screen to tell you the name of the songs that you put on the player..) you will use. Volume up and Volume down. Previous song, or in case one stinks, Next song. A little sliding device in the back so you can have either shuffle, or not shuffle. So, what else does a human need? NONE MORE FOR ME PLEASE.   I bought the gig version to get the max out of it, and I am presently listening to u2 right now.   I found it funny that when I Auto filled the shuffle, the first song it played was u2. Ha.   O, yes. The iTunes software is quite good. You can autofill from your library, or you can make a playlist of whatever you want, and have the default fill from that .... quite nice.   easy.   Have fun.   &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&   UPDATE    I originally owned the 40 gigger iPod. It was a monster. And I enjoyed it for a month until it just up and died. After getting this iPod Shuffle I was confident that it would hold up better.... but, while Autofilling the Shuffle, it died too. Good news is, Target exchanged it no problems. but, I only owned it for a month and a half.   So if I could change my stars, I would give it a three. five on the sound and portability and overall 'coolness' but ZERo on toughness and durability.   And with Sony releasing a smaller version that gets 50 hours with battery life... the only question will be, is Sony's little Mp3 player more durable than Apples... lets hope both offer better quality in the durability department.. because Apples is very nice... just very fragile.. and I'm not doing anything but carrying it around in my pocket playing music on it, and autofiling it...fragile indeed.   Have fun

<Title>ITunes suck, but you don't need it.
<Date>Tue May 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The player is great. I never used iTunes, but as far as I'm concerned I'll nerver have to. I hated my previous sony mp3 player because the softwere had, just like iTunes, a lot of copyright bouls***t. When I won my shuffle as a gift, I was really supicios that I would have the same problems with iTunes. I use win98 and, as a music fan, I love winamp: it's light, fast, practical... THE FACT IS: SHUFFLE WORKS IN WINAMP AND WIN98. All you gotta do is download the win98 driver and the winamp plugin. And the best part is, it works great! All you gotta do is select the songs you want form the library, right-click and "send to ipod" (winamp is the greatest!!!) It's realible, doesn't have any copyright bouls***t and its fast. I use standard usb, and it takes about 15 min to upload 1GB.  The ipod itself is great. + : Practical, cool, very very light, no unnecessery cables, fine sound quality. - : None.   Waht I think about the lack of display: Some people think the lack of display is due economical factors. In my opinion it was a desing decision. Ipod shuffle is the best looking mp3 player on the market and a display would compromise significantly its looks. As a music fan, I know the name of all my songs, so i don't need a dyspaly to inform me that. The problem of finding a specific song can be solved by loading your songs in alphabetical order.

<Title>Great for exercising, but beware of sweat...
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Shuffle for about 2 months, and I wouldn't want to exercise without it.  It's very lightweight, and very inobtrusive.  It holds more than enough songs to keep me happy for at least a week without hearing the same song.  As far as some of the complaints regarding the lack of a screen, I couldn't care less about not having a screen.  Since I use this while exercising, it is not important to me to know the name of the song I'm listening to.  The selling point for me was the size and weight, and the lack of a screen is a plus for me.  It would be similar to me complaining how much I love my new RollerBlades, but that they are lousy for my morning commute on the highway.  To me, having a screen or 4GB is not necessary for the Shuffle to serve its purpose.  That all being said, you will need to take precaution if you work out strenuously, as the Shuffle will fry if it gets wet from too much sweat.  I originally purchased the Ipod Armband along with the Shuffle, but I fried two Shuffles.  I have since bought another "waterproof" armband that encloses the Shuffle, and that is working fine.  On a positive note, the Apple store has been absolutely great about replacing my previous shuffles with new ones they had in stock.  Great service from the Apple store.  If you are looking for a small, lightweight music player for exercising, I would highly recommend the Shuffle.

<Title>Snaps to you, Apple
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This shuffle ROCKS!!  I have been an iPod owner from the very early days of this wonderful age of music-on-the go.  I only wish I had gone with my gut and invested big in Apple when I bought my first iPod.  The shuffle is special and I would recommend it highly to anyone who travels and/or exercises.  Its portability and (lack of) weight is truly liberating.  Above all is the random thrill of what's next.  I really don't need a display because I spend time every 3-4 weeks to download an eclectic mix of tidbits (8 hours at 192 bits per second on the 1 gig'er).  Switch to random and turn sound check on (which levels the sound levels across songs) and enjoy the surprise of what will be next.  Although the earbuds are very good, if you are doing any quantity of listening and don't care about be sociable - consider upgrading the earphones, as this stick will push better headphones very nicely.  Though it is a matter of personal preference, I recommend the Etymotic ER-6i cans.  They are (a little) pricey and slightly awkward to insert, but you'll be walking through an airport with a secret that 99.9% of the Type-A's will not fully understand.

<Title>GUIDE TO IPOD SHUFFLE AS A SECOND IPOD
<Date>Sun Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Breaking news: The price on this recently dropped from $149 to $129.  It is now very compelling to buy this 1GB model given the small delta to the 512MB.  This review is for current regular iPod owners that are attracted to buy an iPod shuffle as a second player. I own both a 40GB iPod Photo and one 1GB iPod Shuffle.  Initial reactions out of the box: Out of the box it is as simple as any other iPod and its documentation is simple yet effective. Loading the songs (on a USB 2.0 PC) is slower than the regular iPod charge, which is blazingly fast.  It takes several minutes to load the 240 songs on the 1GB model (mine took more than 10 mins on the initial load).  The autofill menu is simple and lets you choose from your library or from one of your playlists, either in sequential order or at random.  I'd personally would have liked more flexibility (e.g. to load several playlists into it).  When loading it is useful to select the option to reduce high-resolution MP3 into lower rates.  The Shuffle only supports AAC and MP3 files up to 320 kbps, which is much more than what most people use (it also supports MP3 VBR files).  However, if you do use higher resolutions, there is an option to load everything on 128Kbps AAC.  Sound quality: Once I have loaded it fully, I have tried it with several types of speakers and earphones.  I first tried it with the standard white iPod ear buds which are very convenient, but come across flat, similar to any iPod.  I then tried it with a pair of BOSE Acoustic Noise Canceling headphones.  The results with the BOSE headset are pretty good; you can not tell a difference from a regular iPod.  The music comes across well defined and bass comes across rich and full.  This is at the same level as regular iPod, but I somehow expected a less full sound.  Finally, I tried it on a set JBL Portable OnTour speakers and again the iPod shuffle stand up really well related to its 40GB iPod Photo sister.  I used the shuffle for a while and I can tell you, the sound quality is pretty good.  Apple has done a great job reproducing the same high quality sound as in any iPod, which is much better than many low cost MP3 players out there.  Synchronizing both players: Then I focused on Synchronization with iTunes, synchronizing both my regular 40GB iPod and my shuffle intermittently.  I didn't notice any interoperability issues.  You can own both and synchronize both and run into any issues.  Remember that iTunes does not allow you to synchronize two regular iPods into one iTunes library (I guess to provide some protection to the music), unless you buy one of the 3rd-party software programs out there.  In this case (iPod and Shuffle both on one iTunes) both players can synch with the same library.  Usage models that best fit each player:  iPod Shuffle: -	Exercise at the gym.  It's so light and convenient you won't go back to a regular iPod. -	Trekking and walking.  -	Short flights. Even with just how easy is to operate a regular iPod you still have to go through a little procedure to get it out, select your music, put on your headphones, and look for where to put it (challenging if you are in coach).  You can easily board a plane with your lanyard and turn it on as soon as you can. -	Reading books in the park, your house.  Why bother carrying the big iPod if you are basically going to use if for background?  Regular iPod: -	Long trips (e.g. transcontinental) - you are likely to listen to different types of music within the trip. -	Parties (you do want the flexibility or changing your playlist if the mood of the party changes!). -	Listening to specific songs or albums not in a list.  Don't even try on the shuffle - the lack of a screen will definitively frustrate you. -	Car trips.  Use Smart playlists to make shuffling a more pleasant experience. Use Smart playlists.  You can easily organize your library by genre, personal rating, time of publication and many other parameters (or several of them at once).  If you have a large music library you can easily build smart playlists for "Top rated Rock", "My top rated Songs", "60's Latin" (Bossa Nova lovers) or "90's Soundtracks".  Then when you autofill your iPod shuffle simple pick the music that suits your mood and you are on.  Changed your mind in the middle of your flight?  Simply use your laptop to reload from a different list.  Definitively a winner as a very convenient second player. If you like shuffling on a regular iPod, don't even think about it and get it as a second player for those times where being light is worth the loss of flexibility.

<Title>The killer app for an MP3 player: Playing Music!
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The discussion of screen vs no screen is a smokescreen! Apple sells several iPods with screens. If you want a screen, buy an iPod with a screen-they even make one which displays photos.   However, if you believe that the killer app for a music player is to play music, then you should pay serious attention to the Shuffle. No screen! Few buttons! See the big one with the Play/Pause arrow on it? Push play, listen to music. 240 songs, in order or random. Enjoy.  P.S. If you like tiny cell phones that just make calls and don't browse the web or receive email, then you will LOVE the Shuffle.

<Title>5 stars for the product, 1 star for the Memory space = 3 stars
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Do you remember when walkmans came out? They were a must have for anyone. Same thing for portable CD players. Well MP3 players are the new Walkman, and I can't figure out how I lived without one. The IPod 1GB Shuffle is a darn good product. It is designed to be a portable source of music that doesnt require a PhD to figure out, and doesn't cost half your paycheck. Though a great product in terms of use and functionality, its storage space is simply not worth the money for an extra 100 songs. The purpose of a flash memory is to be able to constantly change it. If you want to store lots of songs, upgrade to a Mini.  Good Things:    1. Portability: This thing is unbelievably small and light. It fits in a pocket and you forget its there. Perfect for the gym or jogging, perfect for just sitting in the book store.   2. Ease of Use: This thing is incredibly simple to use. Play, Pause, Volume Up, Volume Down, Track Forward Track Back. Shuffle Play, Playlist Order Play. That's it. No scrolling through endless menus, no struggling to learn the functions.   3. Compatibility: USB port to upload and download music, acts as a charger, simple as that. Software is incredibly easy to use, and very well organized.   Negatives:  I don't understand why Apple limited this to 1GB when for $50 more you can get the 4GB mini. NOTE: APPLE RECENTLY REDUCED THE PRICE OF THIS DEVICE, LIKELY BECAUSE OF COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE.  A FM tuner would be nice but I can live without it. It really depends on your personal tastes.   Loading from another ITUNES Set up you cant transfer to yours due to Flash Memory.  Personally, I think if you are going for storage space, then its worth it to get the IPOD mini for $50 more. If its portability and ease of use, then go for the 512MB version and use the $30 you saved on some tunes.

<Date>Tue Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a 512MB shuffle and within two weeks the battery wouldn't charge up anymore.  There was a brown stain coming out of the unit on to the USB port interface.    I returned it to Best Buy (where I bought it and they said the battery leaked).  I choose to get a new 1GB shuffle and again, within 3 weeks, it one crapped out with the same exact problem.    I fear it is due to my sweating on it.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I even bought a little cover for my second one and that didn't help.  I really like this unit a lot.  It is so small and light and the necklace is really comfortable for running, much better than armband or belt attachments.  I think Apple really needs to make a Shuffle Sport model.  A friend of mine said her iPod mini got wet in the rain and quit working.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player. I own a cobbled up/souped up Dell PC. I purchased this yesterday and in less than 30 minutes I had downloaded the software, registered and installed my shuffle player. About another 30 minutes I had downloaded into my shuffle about 50 of my favorite songs that I transfered from my windows media player into itunes software library (it was a zinch!). This morning I took my brand new shuffle to my gym for my morning workout and it was simply AMAZING! I have never bought or used a MAC product before, but I am a firm believer now. This is my favorite techy item and I love it. Im excited to purchase more music and create new play lists to download into my ipod shuffle. Thank you amazon (for your speedy delivery) and apple for this incredible little piece of technology. I am a customer for life.

<Title>a great little device
<Date>Mon Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've got about 200 songs on this tiny little device. (far more than what apple suggests is the capacity)  The great thing about this is that, you just put in your favorite songs, and it will play them randomly (or in order).  Its like having a personalized radiostation in your pocket that only plays your favorite songs. I've been a fan of randomized playlists for years. You never know what song will come up next. Part of the fun is not knowing what song will come up next. Not having a screen is no big deal, its not like i'm afraid the next song that plays is gonna be a song i dont like. (because i select what songs go in the player)  Plus its virtually weightless, and it has amazing sound quality. If you dont feel like lugging around a heavy ipod or risk breaking losing your ipod) then get this.  I would buy a bigger capacity ipod shuffle if it was ever released. My only beef with this product, is that i wish that i could prevent the player from playing the same artists within a span of 10 minutes. A minor concern.

<Title>Depends on What You Want It To Do
<Date>Fri Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Whether the shuffle is right for you or not depends on how you interact with music.    If you want to have an extensive collection with you all the time and always select the specific CD or songs you listen to, one of the regular, HDD based iPods is better.  If you want a device to provide background music while concentrating on other activities, the Shuffle is perfect.  I fall into the latter category since I use the Shuffle to provide background while working out or on airplanes much like I use satellite radio when driving or the radio streams of Rhapsody while at the computer.  (Some reviewers here who have slammed it don't seem to understand that different people have different uses for a device).  In addition, if you are away from a computer for a long period of time, the Shuffle might not be the best since a computer is needed to refresh the songs on the Shuffle and is the easiest way to recharge it.  I seldom am so this is not an issue for me.  As noted by others, it is extremely small, easy to use, and inexpensive.  The sound quality is good. I have about 1000 jazz cuts on my computer and let iTunes randomly select 150 or so to fill the Shuffle every few weeks.    Some reviewers criticize the Shuffle for not including a voice recorder and FM receiver.  I guess this is valid, but irrelevant for me: I have two digitial voice recorders, plus my Blackberry, wireless phone, and PDA have that capability.  I didn't need a sixth one.  And I seldom listen to FM anyway.  If I did want FM away from my home or car, I'd get a better quality receiver than the small one on a flash MP3 or AAC player.  I haven't had the Shuffle long enought comment on durability.  (I have seen this comment that it can only be charged 144 times then the battery has to be replaced, but have found other sources which say this is simply an urban myth).  While I expect it to hold up because of the absence of moving parts, I have some concerns about iPod quality: my daughter's iPod mini is going back to the shop for the third time in six months.  So, the shuffle isn't right for everyone.  But it is great for those looking for a great player of background music.

<Title>An ounce of music
<Date>Sun Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Highs: Great little unit.  The tiny light weight design is really great. It almost is like you are not carrying anything extra. The Apple iTunes sofware is very easy to use, almost don't need a manual to use it.  Good battery life.  Lows: The headphone wires are always getting tangled.  The power switch on the back is difficult to slide with no rubber gripper or even notches for your finger nails engage.  An LCD would be nice to know battery life, song selected etc.  But with only 1GB of space you basically only load up songs you love so it's not a real big deal.  It would also be good if battery charge could be checked while pluged into the USB port and using iTune software.  Overall: Highly recommended.

<Title>Great Value
<Date>Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple continues to lead the pack with attractive, well engineered products and excellent functionality. This small MP3 player will hold more music than you can listen to in one sitting or workout. The musical clarity is excellent and the battery life is very good. The controls take a bit of playing with to understand - the middle position in the "on/off" slider allows you to run through your songs or podcasts in sequential order whereas the full "on" position will present them in shuffle or random order. You can also fast forward in a song by holding down the >> "ring" or click it and advance to the next song. I am very pleased with this unit and consider it an exceptional addition to my collection of MP3/iPod/MiniDisc players.

<Title>Just looking for something to play music?  This is for you
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you just want something that is small, affordable and will give you some variety in your music, then the iPod Shuffle is for you.  If you're looking for something with a lot of bells and whistles, then you're better off looking elsewhere.  The deciding factor for me was that I didn't want to fork over the extra cash to pay for features that I would probably never use in the first place.  Pros: - Small, portable, easy to use - Allows you to play songs in order or in random/shuffle mode - Great sound quality, considering there is no equalizer - Software is very easy to use.  It's all drag and drop - The Autofill feature will randomly load songs to the Shuffle if you don't feel like adding the 240 songs yourself.  You can also do a combination of hand-picked songs and Autofilled songs. - Battery life is on par with the advertised 12 hrs  Cons: - Fingerprints show up very easily.  If you're not a big fan of smudges and the sort, you may want to get a skin. - If you turn off the Shuffle after playing in Random and then you turn it back on, you will repeat the songs you already listened to before you get to new songs.  This is a little bothersome - You will need a dock/USB extension if your computer is tucked into a corner or enclosed space.  If you don't, it will be a pain to continuously reach behind your computer just to charge/swap songs.  I went with the extension cable as it was much more cost efficient than a dock.    Summary: This is a great base mp3 player at a very affordable price.  Most of the cons can be remedied so that helps a lot.  If your main priority is to only listen to music and you know your music library like the back of your hand, then don't pay for another player with more features.  The Shuffle will do fine.

<Title>A Great Compliment to your iPOD!
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You really need two iPODs! One for all of your tunes and the iShuffle for when you're on the go. Let's face it, when you're out and about a display doesn't help. You need a simple interface that can be operated without taking your eyes off of, well, whatever it is that you're looking at. The iShuffle is light, it is rugged and is ideal for the person on the go.  I did some battery life tests. Apple claims 12 hours. I got between 16 and 18 hours depending upon my mode (MP3 128 kbps, or AAC 64 kbps). Apparently Apple learned their lesson with battery duration numbers. The battery will degrade as you use it, but you'll have to do a lot of listening before the capacity drops below specification. (Battery life will be less when it is colder out.)  Here's an iShuffle trick. Encode your tunes at 64 kbps AAC and double the capacity. The sound won't be quite as good as 128 kbps AAC, but it probably won't matter. You're on the go and your tunes are in competition with all the rest of life's sounds. So get 1GB performance from the 512MB shuffle and try 64 kbps AAC.

<Title>The best purchase I've made in a while. 
<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have wanted an iPod for a while, but only recently started researching them. After much agonizing, I decided that the Shuffle was best for me and I couldn't have been more right. My primary needs were durability and portability, and the Shuffle satisfies both with flying colors. I didn't really need a screen because I happen to be familiar with my own music and I don't load my shuffle with songs that I don't like. I love how simple it is to control. I never have to take it out of my pocket to operate it, and when you're on a stair climber or treadmill, this is very handy. It is also perfect for my car. Before the Shuffle, I played cds in my car on an old Discman. The bad things about that were the fact that the Discman skips, and I have to carry multiple cds around with me, if I want to hear more than 15 or so songs. The Shuffle eliminated both of these problems. Flash memory NEVER skips, and I can load at least 20 cds onto my shuffle, so it'll be days before I tire of my music. If you enjoy music while at the gym, walking the dog, mowing the lawn, or driving, but would rather not carry your 20 favorite cds with you at all times, the shuffle is an absolute necessity.

<Title>"Simple" is the key
<Date>Fri Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having won one in a drawing, I cannot say I actually shopped around for one. In fact, I had written flash memory-based digital audio players off the list. The reason for this is simple: flash memory, once it is gone, is gone. With a hard disk you can identify the bad sectors, flag them, and work around. Flash memory, while it does have a fair degree of durability, will die and take everything down, the bad bit with the good. There are some tricks implimented by the manufacturers to get around this, and it will only ever become a problem if you happen to rewrite everything in memory every day (all 1 gig) for, say, 10 years or more. Still, I wasn't going to just jump in for one. Hard disks are a proven technology (if you put any value in that) which I feel more confident in dealing with. HD players looked better for this reason, despite their weight.   Which brings us to the first great thing about the unit: it is not only compact (the size of a USB flash memory stick), but light. HD players are like a walkman. In a pocket, they feel like a rock. The iPod? You'll forget it is even there.  Speaking of the USB connection, it is a standard plug connection like anyone would have on their computer. Nothing special. As long as you have the software on the machine you are connecting it to, you can take it anywhere. It also charges from USB, meaning no extra adaptors. You still need to have the computer on, though. Small tradeoff.  Once connected, the device is easy to manipulate through the computer. Creating playlists is easy, and downloading everything to the iPod is simple.  Simple pretty much sums this up: simple looks, simple controls, simple everything. This goes right down to simple functions. Play, pause, forward, back, vol. up and down... and? No on-the-fly editing, nothing that would have required, say, a display.  Missing a display is not in and of itself a bad thing. Frankly, if it is my device, I'll know what track I am listening to on what album. I don't care how long it is because I am going to listen to it until the end, or not. Fancy graphics are fine if you are staring at the thing, but that also kind of defeats the purpose of it being a mobile unit, as in "walk around with".  The bad thing with no display is, once you've filled it up to capacity (all 200+ songs), you have to then flip through them all and make 200+ button presses to find just the album/song you want to listen to at the moment. This is where simplicity starts to lose its appeal.  I admit that if I were going to buy a flash player, I probably would have gone with one that at least has a simple display. Beggars not being choosers, I can learn to live without it.  Quick note on audio quality: adjust it when it is connected to a computer before you take it on the road. That is the only time you have to do so. If you get it right before hand though, absolutely no complaints.

<Title>Light, easy to use.
<Date>Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The first thing you notice is how light the thing is!! (a definite plus) then when you use it, it is amazing how simple it is. I like how you can add songs randomly from itunes, no work involved! You can learn the controls in ten minutes, no weird surprises, easiest portable audio ever. 2 negative points I have though, the 1st, a minor problem, I think this needs a "repeat" mode. but not really a problem, the other thing though, is just how frustrating it can sometimes be when you're looking for a specific song!! If only this had a screen it would just make a huge difference. My solution was to just make a playlist on itunes for my ipod, and just keep changing that, so that the different bands on my ipod are in alphabetical order. sounds like a pain, but its quite simple really. I use this every day, and it has never disappointed me once.

<Title>Another great product
<Date>Thu Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was a little hesitate at first. That's until I got my wife one. The shuffle is the perfect MP3 player for the gym, park, or other place that you don't want to take your LCD screen player and if you have a single Mac or PC. No LCD is one of the drawbacks. That's why I recommend the shuffle in addition to your other screen player. I will take a shuffle places that I would not take a regular iPod. Also, it seems more durable and with no moving hard drive there are less parts to break. The prefect gym companion or even boating, provides you kept the volume low enough to hear your surroundings.    Majors Pros: durable with no HD to skip.  Cons: Does not sync with multiple Macs out of the box. Apple needs to fix this. Also, no screen to see what you are listening to on your Pod.

<Title>simple, elegant and guaranteed to be the object of conversation...
<Date>Fri Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>that is, if like myself, you carry it around all the time!! Just like others, i was skeptical at first, i figured, it'll skip, i'll sound horrible...yada yada..but the ipod shuffle has proven me wrong! Let me begin by saying that i looked around for the best mp3 player (since i'm that kind of gal)and for under $100.00 the ipod shuffle is worth it. lightweight, small, portable and durable...sometimes i even forget it's around my neck. It's simple and yet, unique...sound is great,too! while it may not have a display, which yes, could come in handy at times, it's really isn't a big deal if this is your device. while the shuffle option is there, i still rather do it the old fashioned way, this way you know what's playing next. there is two things i love about this ipod..one is the fact that you don't have to buy batteries after batteries, instead, all you need is a free usb port to plug it in. i usually charge it overnight, every other night. I go days without having to worry about charging it this way, however, when i bought it, the girl at the store told me that it was best to buy a protection plan, since they would replace the product if it ever went bad (maybe it's just their way to get you to buy their product plan, but still, not bad at all to have)she did mentioned that there were some people who took them back for a replacement after their battery died and given that it is an internal non replaceable battery, the ipod was useless, so it'll be a good idea to keep it charged and maybe getting that plan wouldn't hurt. also, you might want to invest in some more comfortable earphones, ipod sends a pair but they are somewhat uncomfortable..other than that, this ipod is a very good buy if you are like me, always on the go. (i even took it to the courthouse and they were fascinated by it, it'll definitely attract curious people)

<Title>ELEGANT AND FUNCTIONAL
<Date>Sat Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In true Apple tradition, the ipod shuffle is clean, simple, elegant and functional. The fact that this unit lacks a screen was absolutely not an issue with me, because I was looking for a light, durable unit to download some podcasts and music and away I go.  When I'm out and about doing stuff listening to the ipod, I don't want to take time to rummage through menus finding a song or album because everything I download to the shuffle I know I am going to enjoy.. go figure. So the fact that the shuffle has no screen is a great thing for me. Again, clean and simple.  The iTunes software makes management of the shuffle a pure joy, and further reduces the need to have a LCD screen. The sound quality is superb and powerful. The shuffle is easily controlled while not having to look at the unit (which is nice if you are working out, jogging, cutting the lawn, driving, etc.), as you would an ipod mini or color with all of the various menus and such.  The unit is durable and so lite that it almost floats around your neck! There is also a lot of useful accessories to toss in the Apple shopping bag for the shuffle. I would recommend a colorful protective case, the shuffle 'dock' and something to interface the shuffle with your car stereo.  I'm currently managing my ipod shuffle with an XP machine that works very well. I also have an iBook running OSX Tiger that I use to manage an Apple Airport Express w/ Air Tunes. The Airport Express is another astoundingly cool product from Apple that you should look into if you want to play iTunes music wirelessly through your home stereo. Truly revolutionary, but that's for another review..  If you need to haul around 20 to 60 gigabytes of music with you everywhere with pinpoint music selection accuracy, then yes you should look into one of the larger ipods as they are terrific products as well.   But for price, simplicity, and core functionality, you can't beat the ipod shuffle.  Cheers

I now perfer to download them from the iTunes Music Store then burn a backup CD just in case. I have music that I hadn't listened to for years because it was too much trouble to find, now everything is there NOW! Even cleaning the house has become easier to do with an iPod.  Erick

<Title>iPod Shuffle - A Great Solution for Young Music Lovers
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this as an inexpensive version of an iPod for my 9 year old niece.  It was a great solution.  I looked at the other flash drives, but I wanted 1gb minimum to hold most of her music at once.  This is the right size for the right price.  It's also easy to use (a necessity for a nine year old), and with the lanyard, it's easy for her to carry around.  The lanyard also helps prevent her from setting it down somewhere and walking away - it's always around her neck.  She's happy as can be to have an "iPod" and I'm happy to have spent less than $150.  As it was on sale at Amazon, I was also able to buy a five pack Shuffle Bumperz so she can dress it up(...).

<Title>iPod Shuffle rocks--but there are some rough spots
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have nearly 4,000 classic rock, classic jazz, classic blues, and classical numbers in my collection, but I rarely listened to them because it was inconvenient to do so. It would take a half hour or longer to find the CD I wanted, and then I had to connect 30 feet of headphone cable from my CD player (in my bedroom) to my living room sofa, where I listen to music.   The iPod Shuffle changed all that. I bought it to use at the gym and for jogging, where a regular iPod wouldn't do. And I wanted something small. Once I got all my music into my computer using the excellent iTunes software that's part of the iPod Shuffle system, suddenly every piece of music I own was instantly at my fingertips. Cool!   There are, however, a few rough spots with the iPod Shuffle. First, the battery. The battery is unremovable, except by Apple technicians, which means you need to send your unit in to do it, and that will set you back 60 bucks. Also, the battery is programmed to be charged 144 times. Then it dies. So if you attach the Shuffle to USB cable to change your playlist, that counts as a charge. So in order to conserve battery life, you must limit changing playlists to the times when the battery has run down, which it does in about 12 hours (which is okay but not great). So you really can't change your music selections as often as you wish if you don't want your battery to die prematurely.  Another rough spot: Apple advertises the iPod as perfect to use at the gym. Well, at the gym, many of us sweat, and the little Shuffle cap that protects the USB connector doesn't have a rubber gasket to prevent sweat from leaking inside. When I removed the cap the other day to recharge my Shuffle, I found the USB connector had a significant amount of rust from my sweating. I've only been using it for about two weeks.   Yet another rough spot is with the iTunes software. It's an elegant and simple program, but it's a memory pig. I have 512 megabytes of RAM on my desktop computer, and when I'm loading music into iTunes, there's no memory left to use other programs. When I tried, iTunes went haywire and started screwing up my playlists.   Still, this is a marvelous little gadget in its first iteration. And hopefully these problems will be ironed out in the future.

<Title>defective product
<Date>Fri Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just purchased an iPod shuffle after months of research on MP3 players.  I decided to buy the shuffle because I have an iMAC G5 and I didn't want to have to deal with converting my existing music into another format.  However, I brought the shuffle home yesterday and the computer did not recognize it.  My boyfriend has the shuffle and his works great on my computer.  I contacted Apple's 24 hour online chat service and the guy told me to reset the unit.  We did and the shuffle still did nothing.  The only way I knew that the unit was even operable was a faint green light on the front of the machine.  The agent told me that I bought a "defective" unit and that I had to go back to the same store and they would replace it.  I am very disappointed.  I just wanted to report on this in case other people have experienced similar problems with this product. I am giving the player 2 stars because the service agent was available and helpful and I am hoping that I do not receive any problems trying to replace the unit today.

<Title>I Now Know What That Pocket Is For
<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have you ever owned a pair of jeans with the little pocket inside your right pocket. That pocket is for holding YOUR AMAZINGLY SMALL iPOD SHUFFLE. This iPod is by far my favorite. I have had the first generation iPod and the first generation mini. I have broken both of them. I do alot of bicycle commuting to work. A twenty mile ride round trip. The other ipods never lasted. After about two months the hard drives broke because of all the skips and stuff. The iPod Shuffle uses flash memory which has no moving parts in it. While the ipod is a mini hard drive and if you hit that right bump the small needle like device that reads the data from the plate can put a scrath in the hard disk. This can sometimes be deadly for the iPod. So alot of sports and activitys should be preformed with a Shuffle. Now for the qucik pros and cons  Pros: 1)Its smaller than most flash based players, about the size of a pack of juciy fruit 2)Comes with a cool lanyard 3)Hold switch is pressing the Play/Pause button for 3 seconds, no annoying switch to slide 4)You can either shuffle or play your music in a playlist 5)Great sound quality with the included earbuds. It sounds better than my friends mini and my old mini 6)Replaced my ugly keychain Lexar Jump Drives  Cons: 1)No Screen is a con for most people, not me. I got used to not having a screen within the first hour of play. Its nice to not be attached to a screen and constantly looking at your ipod. It looks tacky to always be reading this device. 2)No Charger Inditcator to tell me when it almost full. You have a light on the back of the ipod that tells you if your charge is good, getting low, or really bad. But I wish when I plugged it into my computer it would tell me if it was just almost full so I dont walk away right when it finishes charging. 3)No dock, it should come with the extra dock because when I plug it in it hogs the space of two USB ports but only uses one. Small deal i know. You might benifit from buying a powered USB hub made for the shuffle. These normally have a port on top for a jump drive or shuffle. Great deal.  I would definatly buy another shuffle if this one broke tomorrow. But I think I would get the 1GB modle next time.

<Title>TINY I POD SHUFFLE PACKS A PUNCH
<Date>Mon Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i researched extensively before buying an mp3 player and have no regrets with my choice, in fact im joyful.  i was concerned about interfacing an apple product with windows - seamless result.  all my mp3s transferred easily into itunes and itunes rips cds quickly.  the drag and drop feature makes loading songs onto the shuffle easy.  okay, my only complaint is...sound quality. while loud enough, the bass is lacking.  even with plugs, even on my car stereo, i cant extract more three dimensional sound.  hence 4 stars rather than 5.  but i am in love with my little shuffle nonetheless.  i run with it around my wrist (wrapped in plastic to keep it dry), blast it in the car, and take it everywhere, really.  what a liberating invention for music mavens.

<Title>Who wants to find 10000 good songs  for an ipod?
<Date>Sun Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The silly thing about an ipod is that it stores 10000 songs.  How boring would that be? You might even have to buy willium hung's  CD to take up all that space. So 99% of the songs you are listening to you will not like. trust me. my friend has an ipod. It takes forever to navagate to the song you want. If you really want a variety of songs, try a radio.  For the Ipod shuffle, Since there are only 240 songs, you can do the best of the best, and have fun swiching out songs. Furthermore, it is very inexpencive and small, and you do not have to worry about if the screen breaks. (that would be bad) And even if the shuffle breaks, you can get another for a low price. and you should not be worried about no sceen. If you have lots of favorite songs, and not just 12, you will like all the songs you put on the shuffle.  SYaNora!

<Title>pretty good
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's small, sleek, simple.  Anybody who appreciates simplicity in electronics will enjoy the iShuffle.  For audiobooks, there's no real competition:  Audible book support and playlists really make my day. Essential features: -low low price. -pretty small without being clumsy. -EASY navigation.  Forget joysticks and tiny unreadable screens, you don't need 'em* -decent capacity for a flash player -indestructible.  This is based on estimated usage, not attempted sabotage by a professional preschooler -AAC support.  Low bitrates actually sound tolerable (compared with WMA)  Problem areas:   -awful battery life only covers my 8-hour shift, nothing more.  However this allows me to have a life, which is a worthy tradeoff :D -it's not an iRiver (love that iRiver sound quality!) -crappy earbuds.  Get something else, mate. -requires iTunes....  this is basically a deal-breaker for anybody who hates awful software, but it's not so bad if you were already using it.  * unless you actually DO need 'em :)

<Title>Compact, sleek and no screen!
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My friend just got his iPod Shuffle and lent it to me for a couple of days. I was'nt ready to buy one myself, but after trying it out, it does seem pretty good. It's just another ordinary flash mp3 player with an iPod logo. I've given a breakdown of some, not all of the aspects of the Shuffle. Here goes:  ---Design--- A really neat design(always expect something new from Apple), small and lightweight.Its roughly the size of a keychain and is very light. Navigation is easy, 4 buttons, Next, Previous and volume up/down. A nice tab at the back allows you to shuffle your playlist(not playlists) or play them in order.   ---Compact--- Carrying around the iPod shuffle is really easy. No worrying about dropping your iPod and breaking the silver cover or the screen. Really fun and practical to use while jogging or in the gym. The strap which comes with it is a bit tacky and not too useful since the Shuffle can very easily slip into you pocket. Actually, it's so light, that you might even forget that you're carrying it.  ---Battery--- Amazingly, I churned out 10 hours of playback on shuffle mode. There are two reasons behind it having a reasonably good battery life. Firstly, since it doesn't use any screen(which really eats up battery), and because it uses flash memory;no hard disk spinning and thus, battery usage is kept to a minimal.   ---Cost--- [For a low price] you get an iPod, with 12 hours of playback, with a nice shuffle option, with 1GB of flash memory and no screen. Flash memory is old stuff now...hard disks like the Mini's are small and hold up a massive amount of songs. Then again, this is supposed to lightweight and a cheaper alternative to the Mini and the iPod. Lastly, if you already have a Mini, skip this one. If you have an iPod, and need something light to use at the gym or for jogging, this is a very good backup player.

<Title>Just got mine, and I love it !
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Despite what some might says, this iPod fills my need for a portable MP3 player. It's just about how you want to use it. For me, it's put it on my laptop USB port, clic Autofill, which selects my favorite songs in my librairy, and go. When do I use this iPod ? Sport training, metro and much more.  The lack of a LCD screen ? It is disturbing for about 10 seconds. Think about it : a one line LCD screen (about all you could fit on this tiny tiny iPod) would only show the current song, and I'm sure  you know you library song when you hear them.   iPod 'classic' idea is to bring your entire music library with you. Shuffle idea is to bring "Music for today". Select which one you need, it's up to you !

<Title>Great MP3 Player, But...
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If I didn't have as many Cd's as I do, this would be great. If you like to do sports that require alot of movment (skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, rockclimbing), this will be the perfect MP3 player for you because this thing is light and tiny! You won't even be able to tell that you have anything on you. But like I said, I only get use out of this when I play sports, but hey, that's what I have 40GB Ipod for car and plane trips.

<Title>A perfect addition to the iPod family
<Date>Sat Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Some people may buy this as their first experience with Apple and the excellent iTunes/iPod system of music storage, play, and portability.  They will get an outstanding player with awesome sound, extremely light weight, easy-to-use controls, and all around good looks.  In fact, those who already own an iPod can benefit even more from this clever device.  You have already created playlists by artist, or for going to the gym, or for your different genres of music.  Don't be put off by the name - you can play your music in exactly the same order as your playlists.  The Shuffle allows you to pull from these lists and take hours of music in a package that is even more convenient than the larger iPods, which now feel a little clunky compared to this slick device.  And the battery life is outstanding!  Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Shuffle versus other iPods is the sound.  It is amazingly rich and full.  I am not sure if Apple is using a different process to convert data to music, but the Shuffle handles everything from classical to rock with total ease.

<Title>Good for what it is -- a dumbed down Ipod in a small package
<Date>Sat Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an amazingly small version of an Ipod that can hold a fair amount of music (about 12-15 CDS or so)   and play it back with the really great sound that Apple's much pricier Ipod players have.   The great thing about an Ipod is that you can essentially load your CDs onto it though Apple's Itunes software and then use your Ipod to access the CDs or lists of songs you create from these CDs on your computer.   The negative of this  the Shuffle player  is that you basically load down a batch of CDs or lists of songs from your computer and   have pretty limited control on how you access them - either just shuffling though them on a random basis or skipping through them in order.   Is this a bad thing?  It depends on what you want.  If it is a chance  to have a good batch of songs to play through without a lot of need to select specific songs, it is great -- kind of like a super radio station that can play selections  you want to hear, either randomly or in some basic order.  If you want to create a music library in your pocket to easily select from a mix of songs, the Shuffle doesn't work well.   The unit is great when you want a mix of music (say for a plane trip or for a week of daily runs) or a program in a certain order (say a talking book).   The unit is incredibly easy to load up (just plug into the USB port of your computer -- also charges here) and Itunes software is a cinch to use to import music from CDs (or purchase music files from Apple).    Given the price, it is (by the standards of Ipods) a good deal as a way of getting great sounding music in a small unit.  It presents a nice alternative to a heavier and much more expensive Ipod   -- good things as long as you accept its limitations.

<Title>Overpriced, and worthless
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Where does apple think they are getting off with this product.  150 dollars for a 1 gb player, that doesnt even allow you to see what is comming up next on your playlist?  For 150 dollars you can buy a 15gb player from dell, with a backlit screen, nice interface, and wow, it shuffles too!    I am a fan of the ipod, and I have nothing against apple, but this is proposterous.  They are actually advertising and using the fact that you don't know what you are going to hear next as a selling point.  Oh, the revolution of shuffle.  Granted, this is a product oriented for people looking for a non hard drive/ flash based player, but in the end, it's just another way for apple to grab your money.  But, if you are a mac user, you probably have tons of money anyhow.

<Title>Perfect
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this for a few weeks now and actually like it. I thought I would not like the random order of songs, but not I love the random order and could care less if I do not know what the next song is.   I find the negative reviews of the iShuffle interesting. Their basic complaint is the iShuffle has no display, is a Flash player, is to expensive, etc. In other words, that the product does exactly what is says it does!   If you do not like it, then don't buy it. Only a total idiot who did absolutely no research before purchasing this would give it 2 stars or less.

<Title>Will Appeal to 1st Time Buyers and Many Veteran iPod Owners
<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned everything from the original 5gb iPod to the iPod mini to the 60gb iPod photo, but I have found that I use the iPod shuffle more than any other iPod I've ever owned.  Why?  Because it is the easiest, simplest way to to listen to your favorite tunes.  The combination of the lanyard and light weight makes the shuffle convenient to carry around.   The 1gb size is perfect for those who encode music at anything at or above 192kbps instead of the 128kbps used by Apple.  Why?  You can get more songs on your shuffle without iTunes re-encoding your music to 128kbps.  I tried re-encoding my high bitrate songs and it took far longer than I cared for.  At 192kbps and a few iTunes128kbps songs I can get 175 to 200 songs in my shuffle.  A 512mb  shuffle would store 100 or fewer songs at the higher bitrate.  Not only is autofill feature nice, I've enjoyed creating several playlists specifically for the shuffle.  Of course, you can autofill from your entire library or from pre-existing playlists (I have many).  All in all a great product that will appeal to first time buyers and veteran iPod owners who want quick, easy and convenient access to their favorite music.
