<Title>Don't buy this player
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently bought this player, charged it and played the first song and it sounded great.  That was it.  The player froze on the first recording never to be used again.  Do not buy from this company, their MP3 player is crap and so is their customer service.

<Title>Decent player
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All-in-all this is a decent mp3 player. It does everything that I need it to do.  The sound quality isn't bad at all. There are only 2 complaints that I have. 1: The battery life isn't that good. 2: It takes quite a while to switch songs because the player has to load all the song info before it can switch songs, turn up the volume, stop the song, or pause the song. But for the price and the amount of storage one can get out of it, I would say it is a pretty good buy.

<Title>ARCHOS success
<Date>Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I found this player online looking for a replacement for my old Lexar MP3 player, it looked good and had a great price.  When I got the Gmini I was surprised by its small size and the clarity of the screen. After charging it up(which takes a relatively short amount of time to get to full battery) I synced it  without problem. It goes smoothly(I just used the automatic function in WMP to do it).   Using the Gmini is quite easy, but I have two complaints about it  - It didn't come with an actual manual to describe all of the functions, so it was left to me to figure out all of the different features it had, and that is not easy as this is a very good MP3 player with lots of options. The only form of a manual is an  Adobe Acrobat file on the hard drive.  - The amount of time to load the information for every song is a hassle. If you are flipping through the songs then it can be tedious waiting up to 5 seconds for each song to load the information.   Even with these quirks, this is by far one of the best MP3 players on the market for the hard drive range. It can easily go head to head with the iPod Nano and other players on the market.   *UPDATE*  After having this player for 6 months, I have found very little to complain about. The aforementioned quirks are still evident, but I have easily been able to work around them without much difficulty. I have put this player through a lot of heavy-longterm listening and it has held up very well.   I have one spot on the screen from contact with another hard object, but this is understandable for me being a student and I can easily read the text anyways. Even so, a protective case might be a good investment, but not really a necessity. It has taken its fair share of knocks and kept functioning.

<Title>Do Not Buy This Product
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered this product becuase of the price, memory, and how compact it was.  I recieved it, and about two days later, it broke.  I called Archos to see what could be done , afer about 20 minutes on hold, he said the hard drive failed and i had to send it in for a repair, I asked if I could just get it replaced but he said he could'nt do that, which is weird, so I agreed and sent it in with all of the paperwork and acessories it came with. I waited about a month and I still did'nt recieve it so I called and they said that it usally took 1 to 2 weeks to get it fixed and they would try and speed up the process.  I received my product a month later on a saturday. I opened the box and much to my surprise it was still broken, it was this time when I started to get mad, I called Archos to get a refund. They said no one was there becuase it was saturday.  So I called on monday, and becuase i recieved 2 months before it was too late to get a refund and i could only get it replaced.  Overall this Product is a waste of time and money, I wouldn't recommend this product to anybody.

<Title>Unreliable product and bad customer service
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Surprisingly or not, I had the very same experience  As Mr James Hughes above. I bought my player from EBAY. I was brand new, I've charged it and listened. It sounds great and even pushed my HD600 very good. But, when I've tried coping song to it, the transfer was very slow (60 minutes for a song???) and most of the time the USB connection was broke. The HD was making sounds like a DEAD pc HD. Tried it on my laptop, and still the same problem. I've contacted the customer service, and they told me to send it to them for repair. I've waited for 6 weeks until it was send back, spent half a day at the Israeli customs (because the guys from France didn't mentioned it was a repaired product) and got home just to find out it has the same problem.  Now I'm looking for a new player. Obviously it will not be an Archos.

<Title>Terrible Customer Service
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one of the (relatively) newest mp3 players on the market several years ago. It was a Jukebox Studio 20 from Archos. I wrote to them as I was experiencing some problems with charging the batteries and told them I used an Apple computer. They gave me a return authorization, I shipped it in, they charged me a fee for the fix, shipped it back. I wrote back saying I couldn't get the unit to work with an Apple and they simply replied that Apple's OS wasn't supported. I wrote back saying that I had specifically told them I used a Mac but never got a reply again... Maybe I should have reported them with the Better Business Bureau. You can save yourself a headache (and being robbed) by simply not buying any Archos products.

<Title>Cute player, great value
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Have had this player for 2 months now. I think it is a great value for the storage and really easy to use. The display is nice and gives lots of info in a small space. 4GB should hold about 1,000 songs in mp3 format, which is plenty for what I use this for - traveling. This isn't the player for you if you want to store your entire music collection. The ear buds are okay, but if you want better sound buy a different pair. The only thing I was dissappointed in was this player doesn't come with an outlet charger, the only way you can charge it is with the usb cable, so you need to be by a computer. The old archos mp3 players used to come with outlet chargers, so it seems they are getting a little cheap now. Also, they used to include a case for the mp3 player and this one doesn't come with that either. So factor these two items into the price when you are comparison shopping. If you are looking for a player in the 4GB range this one is great and the price is a lot lower than other players of the same storage capacity. If you want to store a good amount of your favorite songs to take with you, I wouldd strongly consider buying this player.

<Title>Archos performance
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Archos was an unknow label to me. But I decided to try and bought this player. For the price is very good. The quality of sound is very good, the headphones are quite good also. And the size is perfect for someone who likes small gadjets. I think Archos Gmini is as good as iPOD or other mp3 player. Give it a try!
