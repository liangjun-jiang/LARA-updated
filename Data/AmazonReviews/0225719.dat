<Title>It had to be MICROSOFT! Incompability with other languages
<Date>Fri Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune itself is great, but since it's microsoft I was afraid something would not work. Quickly it got me right... If you conect the ZUNE to a PC with windows XP in any language but English it won't work, so watch out latins or Canadian people, if you don't have Windows XP in English you will have a problem. I can't believe the "Microsoft Zune" has imcompatibility issues with "Microsoft Windows", and Microsoft hasn't published any solution, any patch, anything..

<Title>Not user friendly
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very excited to own this product. But when the setup turned into a laborsome 7 hour ordeal, I began to wonder why I had spent all that money for something that should be a piece of cake. Oh yes, and don't forget about the big hooplah that you have to go through to download, transfer, and eventually find out it doesn't use all the different formats that music is available to us. Great concept Microsoft, but the typical consumer doesn't have time to jump through hoops and tame lions just to listen to music or watch videos. I returned it.

<Title>A Great Product Indeed
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A few months ago I was going back and forth on which player I should get: an I-pod nano or a Zune. My brother got an 80 gig Ipod and he was telling me I should get one of these jump offs (the 80 GB was too much on my pockets though and the nano was more affordable). So I considered and thought maybe I should since my CD player had been broken over a year, and it's boring traveling without music. Then I saw my friend's Zune and fell in love with it. I liked the big, bright screen and the fact one can customize their screen and what not. But I was still torn, seemingly leaning towards the Ipod nano.  Eventually the price of the Zune went down to the same price of the nano in early June and I bought it. I thought what the hell, I'm paying $199 and some change for a player that holds a lot more songs than the nano, plays video, has a screen that can be customized, and has an FM tuner. I'm getting a lot more for $199. I might've had a more difficult choice if the price of the 30 GB Ipod went down to $199 but it probably never will.  Installing the software was pretty much a breeze. It wasn't hard to understand at all, so it's surprising some people actually had difficulty installing and setting it up, and I'm no computer genius either. After I installed the software (I downloaded it directly from the Zune webstite btw), I burned all my CDs and downloaded all of the songs I could ever want until my money was right. I was pretty much prepared before I got the Zune. Synching all the music to my Zune was quick and easy. I've had no problems with my Zune as of yet.  Now I'm not going to debate on which is the best MP3 to get. There's no such thing as the best MP3 player because to tell you the truth, it's all opinion. Just go with what you think suits you. I know the Zune suits my needs the best and I'm very happy that I made the decision to purchase it in the end.

<Title>Zune Rocks
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zune a month ago, and I love it.  And I loved it right away. I could not stand to look at another iPod after them being the default music player and having two of them break on me.  Why should I buy something so it can break a year later?  So I figured the Zune must have something really special to be trying to compete with iPod. And it does, it's SO much better.   It has radio and you can preset stations so you aren't stuck with only the music you have on it.  One thing that I love is that you can change your background -- and to whatever you want.  I uploaded a high resolution beach picture that is my background right now and it looks awesome.  It definitely beats looking at a plain white background on an iPod.    You can scroll through the menus at the top of the screen instead of always having to go back to the main menus to swith from say Artist to Album to Playlists. Everything is visually pleasing on this thing. It sounds great too.  The earphones that come with it are MAGNETIC!  Have you ever spent 5 minutes untangling iPod earphones?  It sucks.  A lot.  This helps prevent that, and it was very smart.    When you scroll quickly through songs or artists and it starts going too fast to read the names, it displays a big letter on the side showing you what letter of the alphabet's section you're going through.  I always found that on the iPod you end up at Z when you were trying to get to R because you had no idea where you were.  Also you can scroll from Z right back to A, instead of having to go back up through the whole list, like on iPod.  There are so many smart things like this that just improve the experience of listening to music on something like an iPod.    It has nice video playing on the wide screen.  It comes with pictures, music, and videos loaded on it.  Overall, I think it's awesome.  It's way better than iPod.  I can't express it enough!    Oh, and some people say the layout is confusing, and those people must be technologically challenged, because not even for one minute did I feel confused about which buttons I was supposed to press.  If you're under 90 years old.. it's very easy.  And some people think a click wheel is so much better.. but really how much of the time do you miss what you're aiming for with the click wheel?  I think this is better actually.  You have better acuracy, and there is nothing about these buttons that cause this to be slower than a click wheel.  It's better all around.  Seriously.

<Content>I love this item better then my ipod nano. I love it, because I can store more music. I can also download albums from the zune store and I can share those downloads with my husband's mp3 player. At the zune store I found all the albums I wanted new and old. And with unlimited downloads for an affordable monthly fee. I like the size of the screen and also that it has FM. The tuner is great, because if theres a song playing it tells me the name of the song and who sings it. Now I will always know who sings that song!!!!! I find it easier to put pictures. Just everything seemed so much easier to understand and to do. I read that some people had problems downloading the software, but I didn't. And I love love love the color.;o)

<Title>In Love with my Zune
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Zune for about a week now and I absolutely LOVE it!  This was my first MP3 player (with the exception of a CD player that also played MP3 CDs), and I bought it so I would have music during a long plane ride I'll be taking next month.  I did my research, and I thought that the Zune would give me the most bang for my bucks. It hasn't let me down!  I had no problems installing the software, and my music uploads have gone smoothly.  My only complaint would be that you can not play your Zune right out of the box, it has to charge a little first (also, your computer won't recognize your Zune until it has a charge). I love the big screen, and the quality of the pics and videos is awesome.  I also like that you can add your own pic as wallpaper.  Sound quality is good, and the Zune plays music pretty loud (I usually have the volume at 1-3).  I like the headphones that come with the Zune, and find them comfortable. As for battery life, I haven't let it run completely down, but yesterday I listened to music for over 10 hours and still had a quarter charge left.  Note- you will save battery life if you turn off your Zune's wireless capabilities. Also, my Zune came with a little felt pouch that you can keep your Zune in.  Since I bought a protective case for my Zune, I use the pouch to hold my headphones and USB cable. I am extremely happy with my Zune purchase.  It is a great, easy to use product.

<Content>I am happy with the Zune that I recieved about 2 months ago. It performs well and it is easy to navigate. Don't listen to all those hate information about the Zune, its great! I'm sure the ipod is amazing as well but the Zune is definitely right up there with the ipod. I love how the screen is large and the fact that it is made with scratch resistant material. I suggest this to all musicians, I feel like it has a system that can be easily browsed and also 30 GB is the perfect size because its not too small of a memory but not too big. Plus its only now $199.00? Can't get any better than that!

<Title>Music Must Stay on Your Computer
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I thought long and hard about which MP3 player to buy, not being too much of a fan of the iPod and already burning through a Zen in six months (battery), I went with the Zune.  The one bad thing I have to say about it is that if you delete/remove the songs that are already on the Zune from your library, it will remove it from your Zune the next time it is connected.  I don't like this at all.  I want the music on the Zune to stay on the Zune until I remove it regardless of what goes on with my computer or if I want to add music from a friends computer.  It is rather large and bulky but otherwise feels nice.  The battery seems to keep a good charge and it is rather simple to use.  The screen is vibrant and your album covers look nice but that's not all that important to me.  I'd say the software is seriously lacking and I do hope it is changed.  But I'm keeping my Zune, this isn't that large of a deal where I'd return it.

<Content>This is the greatest thing I've ever bought - and I've had four apple iPods.  The screen is huge and the video looks great.  Syncing is so easy with the Zune software.  And for $15 a month, I can listen to as much music as I want, as many times as I want, in the Zune marketplace.  With a simple piece of downloadable software, I am able to convert all my dvds on to my Zune.  So far I've put on at least 5 movies and 75 albums and I still have 17 gigs left over.  The material it's made out of doesn't pick up finger prints or scratch.  All in all, it far out-weighed my expectations!  I love it!

<Title>Don't buy it unless you like to resolve tech problems
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune was on sale so I bought it rather than an Ipod. BIG MISTAKE!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4797417-0130561">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a> The Zune has serious sotware and licensing issues. I purchased music through the Zune site and couldn't download it. Tech support finally got the licensing issue to resolved after three tries, but in the meantime they had me reload all my sofware, web browser and media player taking shots in the dark to try to get the music to load. Now my PC will not recognize the Zune device and Tech Support couldn't fix it. The real problem was the licensing/royalty issue with Zune Marketplace and not my PC. On some songs it took reauthorizing the song three and four tims just to download. Now Tech support is scratching their...... heads trying to understand why they screwed up the Device Manager and cannot get it to update.  Bad Karma at Microsoft....Poorly designed product and big compatability issues with Windows. Really bad first level tech support and long waits to get to second level. Don't buy it, it's a headache to deal with.

<Content>I recently received this for Mothers Day from my children and one of them installed a program to convert any dvd movie to play on my ZUNE, so this is much better than an Video Ipod, as the screen size makes it very enjoyable to watch movies on ! How smart of Microsoft to introduce this color before a major 'Holiday'! Be sure to purchase a screen cover ; a small square of thin plastic that protects it from scratches but will not be noticeable during movie or photo playback. A case with a kickstand to hold the Zune horizontaly is nice as well as keeping it covered when not in use. All in all ,I am very pleased with my gift,no matter what the color!

<Content>I am an owner of a zune for a second time. I bought one, but later returned it because I wanted an Ipod, all the buzz around me had me covinced that I needed to have one. But, it was right after Christmas and Ipods were out of stock everywhere. I had never heard of the zune, but I figured I'd give it a shot since it was from Microsoft. After sampling the Ipod for about a week, I was very disappointed, the zune was full of so much more! I returned the Ipod and repurchased my zune. The picture quality is amazing and the zune marketplace is awesome. I love being able to download an entire album with one click! I am not one who has a lot of gadgets, I am actually new to the "digital revolution" but the zune has bought me up to speed.

<Title>Easier to operate than others.....
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have my pink Zune for week.  Let me preface by saying I am technically challenged so I thought I would be stressing out the entire Memorial Day weekend. I have an ipod nano for almost 2 years and still have issues with it.  I took it out of its beautifully packaged box (much more friendly than an ipod).  Read the one page instructions and continued to install the Zune software on my laptop.  No problem at all.  I checked out a couple of download sites and decided to pay at one time, all you can download music, video, games, etc. for $43.00.  Best buy I ever made.  Downloading, installing and syncing music and videos took me no time at all.  I had no meltdowns over the weekend.  The downloaded software comes with album art and I even downloaded Borat, this took quite a while but was well worth it.  Don't get me wrong there were a couple of issues but they were pretty much resolved after I reloaded or resynced.  The screen is crisp, large and the resolution is great.  The sound is far superior to an ipod as well as the controls which are so much easier to use than the ipod.  No touch sensitve, which I hate.  The case hardly picks up a fingerprint and finally there is a radio built in for listening to baseball games which sound great on the device.  I love it and recommend it to all.

<Content>This is my second mp3 player and I'm so happy that I bought the Zune. I did a lot of research before I bought (i.e. iPod or Zune?) and the Zune just has a ton more features to it. I love that it is a windows-based product (I hate macs - sorry!)and the nice big color screen. You can set your own wallpapers and you get to "name" your Zune whatever you want. The Zune marketplace is great and easy to use. They also give you a 14-day free trial. The navigation is very easy and fast to search for songs/artists/etc. It's just so much nicer to look at than the boring old white iPod. Uggh.  And seriously - I love the pink color. Go buy one before they run out of all the pink ones!! They are planning on releasing more new colors soon. They have also started selling a lot more accessories. I was worried about that before I bought one, but I've been able to find every accessory that I wanted. I bought the FM transmitter for the car and an armband/holder thing for jogging.   It's just an all-around great product. Easy to use, friendly user-interface. I highly recommend.
