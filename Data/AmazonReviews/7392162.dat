<Content>I bought this thing at Best Buy...it was priced great at $80, and it was very easy to use with Windows: plug and play, like a USB drive. Switch it to a different mode, and you can download directly from itunes. It loads quickly, and volume level is pretty good; better than it was with my old Creative Zen Micro. Good sound, too. PLUS, it has expandable memory, plays video (the screen is amazingly watchable for being so small) and an li-ion battery that lasts a really long time. Maybe not 20 hours (as claimed), but long enough.  But here is what I hate about this thing, and it's such a lame little niggle. I'd like to throttle the designer and product planners for this. To fast forward, you ahve to hold down the slippery, cheesy-feeling thumbwheel, and it is only about 2.5-3X speed. This means if I want to FF through the first half of an hour-long podcast, I have to hold down this little thing for almost 15 minutes! Thumb cramp! And if you accidentally double-click the wheel--which is very easy to do--you bump to the next track, and when you go back to the first one, you have to start from the begining. Evidently, the product testers didn't listen to NPR podcasts. The irony is that videos and audio books FF at a much faster speed. What the fu$&?  I just hate that, and that's why I'm looking for a new MP3 player. Otherwise, I really like this product.
