<Title>Good bang for my buck...after a little help
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Gigabeat a year ago because I needed an mp3 player and didn't want an iPod like everyone else.  I have Windows Media Center on my laptop and really liked that the Gigabeat came with Media Center Portable.  A decent battery life, large screen, video support, and TACTILE controls got me hooked.  I had absolutely no trouble transferring my music and movies to it and playback was excellent.  I used my own earbuds as the included earbuds are awkwardly spaced.  The large screen is beautiful and colors show very well on it.  This kind of screen attracts scratches like nobody's business, so I purchased some Palm screen protectors and cut them to fit.  All was well except for one thing: my battery would only last for three to four hours.  I contacted Toshiba, worked out a plan and sent my Gigabeat in to have the battery fixed.  Not three days later did I receive it back and working as advertised.  As I am patient and willing to work things through, this was a good investment on my part.  But now that the price of the Gigabeat has dropped over $100, I think that at the new price it is worth purchasing.  Every product has a few in a batch that do not turn out well, but that is part of manufacturing.  As far as iPod alternatives go, this is currently the best choice out there.  Pros: Good battery life (c. 10 hours)     Tactile controls, easy navigation     Mp3/Wma support     WMV/MPEG video support     Large, bright screen     Good tech support  Cons: Had to use tech support...     Scratch-attractive screen     No car adapter

<Title>Actually has everything a PMP should
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this product recently from Amazon, but never got it. Then it went out of stock! I dug around a lot on the internet and finally found it - I now have it, and its actually really good. I was apprehensive because its a Toshiba, not an iPod and everyone always talks only about iPods. Anyways, I've been using this for almost a month now - and it has everything! FM, Video, Images, works seamlessly with PCs. The screen is delicate, but I've heard every PMP has that problem. To me this beats the iPod because it has FM and you can create playlists, it also has a quick playlist which is kind of like your favourites section. Since it works seamlessly with Windows Media Player, it can synchronise everything automatically.   The transfer speed is great. I could have done with better headphones, and the black ones don't go well with the white player!! I think its one of the best PMPs around.

<Title>Don't buy, too many upsetting flawls....
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know where to start with this thing. When I first got it I thought it was great, well other than the rediculously short battery life. Unless you just play all your music non-stop and don't skip or choose songs (press any buttons) the Toshiba won't last more than 4 or 5 hours at best listening to music alone. But the extremely short battery life becomes more and more annoying as you use the product. Well I thought I could put up with that, and I did. But then it started placing album art from one artists to other artist's albums and even though when a song played it would list the proper artist as who the song would be by but it would be listed under another artist's album when you went to look for it. Other times I would only put one song on the mp3 player by an artist and the artist would be listed twice along with the same song. So it became extremely frustrating to find and upload music on the Toshiba gigabeat. Then to top it off, it died on me one time while listening to it and then after recharging it I turned it back on and it automatically deleted all of the music and video files I had on it and I had to put them all back on one by one. The problems kept occuring so I decided to get an Ipod and just give up on it. It's not worth the frustration and stress it causes. My advice is to stick with an Ipod or maybe a Creative.

<Title>Great idea, terrible performance
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, let me start with the things I really DO like about the GB30. The user's interface is simple, the graphics are crisp, and it is ridiculously intuitive to manage and transfer music as a Napster Ready-to-Go device.  However, the battery performance is pitiful. After 10 days (painfully aware that I am outside the window to return this for a refund from my seller), the battery would drain despite the fact that the unit was turned off.  After reluctantly returning the unit to the Toshiba repair depot, I received it within another 7 days only to find that they did not fix the problem.  So, I give up. I keep the unit fully charged by keeping it plugged in to the wall outlet between uses.  However, I will never by another Toshiba product nor would I ever recommend this seller again.

<Title>OK, good value, but a battery eater
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this on clerance at a national store, and honestly it is identical software and set-up as the microsoft Zune (window's mobile), but unfortunately harder to find accessories.   The best thing is that you  you can get these online here at amazon.   It operates Identical to the zune, my friend has one. Advantage over Ipod, don't have to convert all my old MP3 files. disadvantage, it eats the battery up.  there is no actual stop button. The off button turns the screen off, but keep the player loaded to the last song. I claims 20 hours of playtime, but I am lucky to get 4, or to keep it charged for more than a night.  I have to turn off the main battery button.   I don't know about the Ipod, and I might expect the zune to be similar.  So, look around. Overall I am happy so far, just have to bring a charger along and charge before a trip. I expect in the next couple years the prices will continue to drop on Ipods and Zunes, as well as creative's , and these will all be relics.

<Title>High Quality, Battery Problems Fixable
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before purchasing this product I did some research on it, and heard it was a high quality product but that the batteries sometimes lasted only about 4 hours. I ordered my own and am very pleased with the device. Everything works well, nice interface, and I was extremely impressed by the resolution of the screen.  The primary reason I am writing my own review however is my issue with the battery. My battery also lasted only 4 or 5 hours, dissapointed I called customer service, expecting to have to exchange it. However, this is what they told me to do: unplug the device, turn off the battery switch, plug it back in, wait for it to boot up, turn on the battery switch, and then turn the device off, letting it power for 3 to 5 hours. I did this (at least 5 hours), and then I got about 11 hours out of it (12.5 was advertised, but 11 is close enough for me). In short, at least in some cases, it seems the battery problem is largely fixable and just requires a really good initial charging.   My own largest concern when purchasing this product was the faulty battery issue. I've heard of people also exchanging them in worst case scenearios, but it seems most of the time the battery problem is fixable, and I would highly recommend this item to anyone, at least if you're content with a battery life of about 12 hours.

<Title>True Ipod Killer
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Micrsoft might have pulled the plug on Personal media center by going the Zune route, but this device is a nice implementation of PMC.  I have an ipod and I bought this for my sister as a present and spent a few weeks loading music and testing it out.   It beats the ipod classic on many fronts.  It was $50 cheaper for the same capacity (30 GB).  Dedicated controls beat the wheel any day.  I know the wheel feels cool for exactly 1 week, after that its a pain.  The ipod wont scroll up from 'A' to 'Z'. This will.  The sound quality was great with good earphones. The supplied earphones are just adequate though.

<Content>Battery life is absolutely atrocious.  I have had the battery replaced twice, and still I have less than 2 hours battery life.  And when the battery drains, all music/photos stored on the internal hard drive are gone....have to reload from a PC.  Worst product I ever bought.

<Title>Everything an MP3 player should be
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just recently burned my 30gb gigabeat out and downgraded to the 30gb zune (mainly so I could get a case that fits). Everything about the gigabeat is far superior to the zune in so many different ways. I'll just make a short list:  -Can sync files from your computer to it while using an application that you like -Windows can recognize it without being forced to install mandatory (and really lame) software -Able to convert the bitrate while you're syncing -Able to use it as an external HDD. Can drag and drop any file you want in or out -Intuitive, responsive buttons that any idiot can figure out -Decent FM radio reception -Get this, it comes with an AC adapter! -Perfectly adequate battery life -It's small, light, and very portable  I'm still beating myself up over not getting a new one. Asside from the "accessories,"  there is absolutely no reason anyone should consider a zune over the gigabeat.

<Title>Wonderful device, but not perfect
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device is beautiful. It sounds great. Photos and video look great. It is a breeze to navigate. Once you use the device, you realize the care taken in the design of both the physical product and the user interface. The click wheel was novel in its day, but in all honesty, Toshiba's plus-button control is more elegantly executed. It seems that many MP3 players try to wow with touch sensitve controls, but the Gigabeat S demonstrates that good old-fashioned buttons (with some intelligent software in support) get the job done best.  And why not five stars?  Well, the battery life frustrates often. There are ways to conserve battery (dimmer display, lower volume listening, lower bitrate music). Regardless, I doubt anyone can squeeze even 8 hrs of NORMAL audio use from a single charge. I recommend this device despite my less-than-wonderful opinion of the unit's battery life.  And now for the nitpicking. Some UI complaints (which diminish battery life) I hope are addressed in firmware updates:  If the screen is off, side buttons turn on the screen. I don't need the LCD to increase the volume or skip a track. Just a waste of battery to light up the LCD.  On the same note. When the unit is locked (on hold) button presses still turn on the LCD to alert that the unit is locked. Again, a waste of battery.  Nitpicking over.

<Title>Dont be like everyone with an Ipod.  Be Better!
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I didn't want and Ipod cause everyone has one.  I have been waitting for a Mp3/video player and when I saw this on CNET I bought it that very night.    I have the 60gb (black) and I'm writting this reveiw after owning it for about 2 weeks.  Pros.  IF it can play with windows media player it can play on this player!! Divx hint hint.  Connects perfict with windows media player and Media center Pc's.   The USB cable charges the unit so I leave this at the Pc all the time and the powercable I just leave at work. Navigation is so simple you can hand the unit to anyone and they will figer out how to find what they want in seconds. Small size for a unit that can hold tens of thousands of songs and pictures as well as a library of your favoret movies. Screen resaloution is very good but not excelent. Turning it on is practicly "instant on". Connects with Xbox 360.  Listen to your music while playing a game and navigate with x's controlers. Album art can be displayed full screen. Suports WMA lossless a very high quality audio codec that audiophiles love. TV out.. Play your music and watch a slide show of your vaca on your TV.  Watch movies. Radio Turner.. extra bonus for when you want something differnt or hear a beasball game. Unit comes with A/V cables. Scratch resistant case. TIVO and Media center Pc TV recordings compatable  I loaded many differnt Dvix formats AVIs on the player and they all work perfectly.   Cons.  Buttons on the right side seams to be silly placement. Sreen color Res. and well as TV out is not at full capasity its good enough but not amazing. No way to change screen format for widescreen movies. Some pictures are misplaced even though they are all loaded on from the same folder. Some files.. even though I rename them then load them on still retaine there original name. Very limited accesories available.. Waiting for a good set of powered speakers. No mass storage mode. (no dumping a file and transfering it to another pc) Unit dosnt not come with a small Lanyard.  (strap for your wrist)  Ok so theres a few things that are not perfict about this player. *The most important is Video color resoultion.  Its been stated that it's 65k for the units screen and for TV out.  For the units screen this is perfictly fine and most people wont be able to see the color abnormalities.  The TV out on the other hand you will see the graduation of color change in places like the sky and dark back grounds.  People who dont know what I am talking about it when you see each color separate in the transtion from darker to lighter.  Though you only see this 10 to 20 % of the time.  Watching video on a larger screen will make this problem more annoying.  The only thing to do about it is ignore it and pay attention to the movie.. Also an important factor is the quality of the video your watching..  If you download a movie and the party who "ripped" the movie did a crappy job well that what your going to get.. a crappy looking movie.  So look for high res. movies when downloading. I have to say when veiwing pictures through TV out isn't nearly as bad.  Its Very good.  *This isn't a fully portable HD.  Your not going to bring your library over to your freinds house and dump your files onto his PC. (theres other ways to share music anyhow)  But anyhow putting work files and spread sheets wont happen. *Video format.  Ok so the movie I am watching is in widescreen mode.  The player dosnt have the option to add black bars to the top and bottom so the video is out of perportion.  Though if I play the movie on the wide screen TV this isnt a problem.  Inprovments.  *Gray background.  For audio a gray back ground is drab.  Custumization would be best.   *Infared port.  This in conjuntion with a small remote (that and be stored in the player?!) with same face button config for easy control over the device from across the room. *SD card slot.  Mini or mico or standard SD slot would make dumping camera photos easy. And would make the unit a limited mass storge device. *Remove buttons on the sides.  This is silly.  Volume should be intergreted with the cross hair control.. I cant see why anyone could see this during the design process.. while I am listening to music and watching movies pressing right or left has a perpose but pressing up or down on the cross hairs dose nothing.. instead I have to look for the volume on the side.  *Color res.  Audiophiles will love the lossless codec but videophiles will literaly puke.   *Battery life.  I didnt place this as a Con cause its not bad at all.  But a longer life is what everyone seeks. *Accessories.  I know these wont develop without sales but I think and hope this player dose. *Reserved space.  So I can put work files and spreadsheets in a reserved folder.  Files that wonts be converted to windows format.  So the device can store other personal data. *Power point/ document veiwer.  Would take this unit ever farther down the road to success. *Games.  This device has a cross hair controler.  Why not develop some games.   I bought this player cause I wanted to have a PVP (personal video player) to bring to a freinds house and play videos, show pictures, and play music.. also some of my own movie maker files. This device is the answer to the wish for an easy way to share a video or movie with a freind with out having to burn a dvd (which isn't a quick process with divx files) Everything you load on this PMP (personal Media Player) is converted to its own personal format... And thats everything.. Photos, Music and Video are all changed before being loaded on the player..  Photos are resized.. not the huge poster quality that my camera takes but downsized enough to still have great quality when vewing on a large TV screen.  This is to save space on the HD.  All and all.   I am Very please with the Toshiba Gigabeat S.  I would recomend it to anyone who wants a video/mp3 player.  I know if this thing takes off there will be upgraded units.

<Title>Really poor quality
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Very happy for the 1st 3 weeks and then problems started to occur.  I put it in my back pocket of my pants and I guess my walking around while listening to it caused some kinda of warping (but MP3 players are built to stand some warping, right?).  First the screen died so I can only use the buttons to navigate to play the music.  Then the battery would suddenly discharge for no obvious reasons.  Now (3 months from the date I made the purchase) the whole player doesn't even work any more.    I am frusrated but I can't return it since I bought it in the US and relocated to Asia.  Don't buy it!

<Title>Excellent windows media based player
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I never have been a fan of the ipod, maybe because I thought that the screen was a tad small for my taste and also the price was a bit over my range... I spent a couple of weeks reviewing the other different players in the market until I came with the Gigabeat. You can find older versions of this player running in the low 200, those are a good deal, but their user interfase is not the best. With this new version they come with a better interfase, now related to the new windows media player 11. Great player, only complain is battery life, lasts about 12 hours playing music and about 3 hours playing videos. By the way video quality is excellent! If you are in the market for an mp3 player and a PVP I think you should put the Gigabeat high in your list!

<Title>Awesome player, works great with Rhapsody
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I got my gigabeat, and I have to admit, at first, shuffling through the screens when you want to go back to the song played got a bit confusing but when you get the hang of it, it's easy and you learn the shortcuts. After trying some other music subscriptions and not being happy with selection or software, I tried Rhapsody because I got a month free with my purchase and boy was I happy I did....it works flawlessly. Downloads are fast and it seems that the gigabeat can hold much more than a similar 30 GB product. The battery life is not great, but I've seen worse with other competitors as well. Overall, I'm very very happy with this product.

<Title>Great Non-IPod option for Windows XP Users
<Date>Thu Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently ordered this product after months of research as to the right PMP for me. Im a WindowsXP MC user, who prefers WMP to iTunes, and especially love the ability to 'drag and drop' files directly to my GigaBeat as I have an external HD I take from, and dont have time to library all 250gigs of MP3 files.  My initial impressions are extremely high. Ive found the interface to be seamless for anyone who uses a Windows OS, and the folder layouts and navigation to be perfect. It does take a little bit of getting used to (going side to side with a menu across the top etc), but I wouldnt trade it.  The video/picture quality is better than I expected after reviews. I have not had time to test a darker movie yet, but all signs point to not having to worry when I do. The picture is clear and bright -- and plenty clear enough to see in daytime or darkness.   The buttons on the side seem well placed to me, though I expect to be more comfortable after I memorize their placements.  Id prefer more background and color options than the standard windows background, and grey visual during mp3 play. But it doesn't affect the usage of the product at all.  I wouldnt have minded the scroll wheel found on ipods and recent ripoffs, but find the crosshair option found on the Gigabeat plenty sufficient. Its just not as 'fun'.  Ive had no issues with the battery life during music play.  The only downside to the player Ive found so far is the lack of made-for accessories. Cases are starting to be made in low supply, but otherwise your options are to look of Ipod capable items (cables etc), and hoping they fit.  I only wish they had the 60gig version available in white.

<Title>Gigabeat battery
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Gigabeat after reading the reviews about this unit being the "ipod killer". First, what I don't like about the unit. The battery, the battery, the battery! If apple can make a battery life on the IPOD that last 20 hours, why can't other manufacturers?  The first week I got the Gigabeat the battery lasted 5 hours, then 4, then 2. Now it doesn't turn on. I had to send back to Toshiba for repair. I am not happy. Where are the accessories? How can you beat the iPOD without accessories? Price - If you want to beat the king you have to be better than the king especially in price.  In operations. If you are not careful you can delete all the music on the player.   Now here is the good: The unit sounds great, nice size screen, works well with Media Player, easy to use.   The bottom Line: This is not an "iPod killer". I should have gotten an IPOD!!

<Title>horrible battery long transfer limited video support
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had a problem both units I have had from Amazon. No fault of Amazon they have been great during all of this.   No questions asked when submitting for the return but each one has had the same promblems.   Why would WMV files need to be converted?  No Divx support.  I even recorded some shows in Windows Media Center Edition and the device wasnt able to read or convert the files from Windows Media Center Edition to the Portable Media Center Edition.  That is the compatibility I was looking for now! God forbid if I try to actually watch a converted video it cuts out and just suddenly goes back to the start screen without warning.   It doesnt seem to hold a charge as long if you charge it through the USB port as it does witht he Wall adapter.  I can understand it taking longer to charge but why would it say that it has a full charge and yet play for less time when being charged through the USB port as apposed to the Wall adapter.  Also if you drain the battery completely down you better make sure that you have the wall adapter you better hope that you have the wall adapter close by because it will not charge through the USB at this point. This will be a constant process of charging and hoping the charge will last at least a little bitI have the USB port charger same that my RAZR takes at work in my car at home but I still couldnt keep the thing charged enough.

<Title>Gigabeat + Rhapsody To Go = Death of the IPOD
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is absolutley fabulous.  I have had it for about four months now and I cant put it down.  I have the Rhapsody To Go service which grnats me unlimited songs along with great album art.  I couldn't be happier with this product.  I had an IPOD before this and I now relize how over-rated the IPOD is. If you are considering and Ipod I strongly suggest that you reconsider because this product is better.  IPOD may have all of the accesories and have ITUNES but ITUNES sucks and is expensive. IPOD=$$$$$$$$.  If you think you wont be able to get the variety of videos that ITUNES has you are wrong. It is the first mp3 player compatible with Vongo a service that sells big name movies for your player at a low cost.

<Title>My Bad
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok. I admit it. I was an idiot when I ordered this thing. It's going back and I already have my ipod.   The unit works great. It sounds great. The battery life is adequate for my needs. It synced with no problems and loaded all the music and videos that I wanted to put on it.  So why am I sending it back?  Accessories.  That's what I meant by being an idiot when I bought the S30. I did not check for available accessories first. There is nothing in the way of accessories available for this device. No docks of any kind. No devices of any description that can connect to the expansion port. None made by Toshiba, and none made by any third party manufacturer.   I have had my ipod for about 10 days and I am totally enthralled with it. Like the S30, it is easy to use and I had no problems syncing my music and video, although I had to buy a $19.95 program to convert the videos to mp4.   The reason I love the ipod is the same reason I am sending the S30 back.  Accessories.   I bought a dock that that I just drop my ipod into, that connects the ipod to my home audio/video system. Then I use the remote to control it from anywhere in the room.   I also bought a car dock that I just drop the ipod into. It plays over the FM radio and the sound is much better than I even anticipated. The dock plugs into the cigarette ligher. It is self-supporting and just sits there and holds the ipod upright and in a perfect postion to operate the click-wheel.   Of course, you can connect your gigabeat to your home audio system and your car as well. You will have a charger and its cable and a FM converter (or maybe a cassette converter or just a cable if your car stereo has an aux input jack) with cables that you plug into to gigabeat's seperate power and audio ports. You will have to add a splitter for your cigarette lighter unless your car already has multiple outlets. The charger, converter, cables all add up to a cable mess in your car, and you have to plug/unplug the cables every time you get in or out unless you want some hood to break your window when he sees the player through the car window. The cables are less of a problem at home, but once you've set it up, you have to walk over to the gigabeat to change any settings. What a kludgy solution.  The availability of the ipod docking stations makes the ipod a rather elegant solution for a complete audio system. The gigabeat has this same potential for use in a drop-in dock, but nobody has made one and as far as I can tell, no one intends to make any.   So, bottom line, if you just want a carry-around device, I can highly recommend the gigabeat S30 (or S60). It works great. But if you want a really nice system that you can use as a carry-around, on your home audio system, your car, and if you can afford the cradle-type accessories, then go for the ipod. It is a much cleaner, organized, easy to use solution.

<Content>I bought this for my 17 year old son.  He had a Dell DJ30 before this which had constant problems.  The Toshiba Gigabeat is everything he expected it to be. Very user friendly, easy to use with Napster. Quality MP3. I would purchase again.

<Content>I have owned this device since Sep06 and am very pleased. The only downside is the lack  of options. No leather case available any place. Also if your battery is fully charged and you do not use your player for a while, and do not turn of the hard to manipulate little on/off switch at the bottom left corner, your battery may no longer be charged. I also wish you could use the device with other media than MS player. Quality player, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>This product is not what I expected.  I had to return the 1st Gigabeat the day I received it from Amazon.  Software issues.  I just returned my second to Toshiba because of battery life issues.  It would get only 4 hrs of play time or would die if disconnected from the charger  for 4 hrs.  This piece of garbage does not live up to the hype!

<Title>Gigabeat 30 gig
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my gigabeat for about 2-3 months now and i'm really enjoying it. It's got a decent lifespan of about 8-12 hours per use after a full charge. I really like the fact that it does not need any other 3rd party software such as itunes in order to transfer music. It is compatible with Windows Media Player 9 (for me at least) and the website says its for sure compatible with WMP10. It's pretty simple to use and has alot of well concieved features. At the time i bought this, the Apple Ipod 30 gig was still around $300-$350. A month later, the new Ipods came out (120 gig and some other one.) so they dropped the price on the new ipods to the price of the gigabeat. Ipod 30gig = $250. Gigabeat 30gig = $250. When i bought this it was a matter of money (it was cheaper then) and also the fact it didn't need other software to work. Now that the prices are similiar though.. i suppose it is a matter of preference. I believe the ipods do not come with a radio feature, i may be incorrect about that, but the gigabeat does. I enjoy it and will hopefully keep it as long as possible.

<Content>This little portable device gave me just what I wanted...something I could carry on a plane or in a car and watch a movie of my choice. I've had as many as 23 movies downloaded at a time...along with about 1,000 songs--and I still had plenty of room on the device.  It fits in my purse and is just slightly bigger than my Motorola RAZR.  Even though I bought a clear case with built in stand for it, it doesn't stand up at an angle very well, but that's a small inconvenience.

<Title>gigabeats best in the market
<Date>Sat May 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the gigabeat is amazingly small and light. the controls with the extra buttons are great. my favorite is the designated power button. as soon as you press it, the gigabeat immediately powers off whereas on the ipod or zune you must hold the play/pause button for 3-4 seconds. comes with many more accessories than zune or ipod. only con is lack of cases in the market. as far as everyone bashing on the battery life, I haven't really noticed it draining quickly but maybe it's just b/c it's new. You can change the display settings for how long the screen is lit ranging from 5sec to over 1min so that should help control the battery life.

<Title>six hour battery life for audio
<Date>Thu May 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this gigabeat for several months now and I'm very happy with it.    The battery life is about what I expected.  Every manufacturer out there lies about the battery life so I knew what I was getting into.  My previous MP3 player a Creative Zen Micro 5 gb got four hours of battery life and they claimed something like 16 hours.  I get six hours of battery life for the gigabeat for audio no matter what I do. I don't believe all those tricks and tips to get longer battery life, they don't work.  At the maximum using those tricks you will get just a few more minutes of battery life.  The only hints that seem to work is what Toshiba says in their manual, that is; turn off harmonics, and  use MP3 or WMA instead of WAV(not that anyone uses WAV anyway). I'm skeptical that other mp3 players out there get that much better battery life anyway.  I have found that when docking it to your computer you should also plug in the charger if the battery is low or you plan on transferring many files because if you don't it may lock up once you detach it, and once for me deleted all my files on it.    I don't use it for video and don't plan to because it doesn't come with any software for it and you must purchase it separately.  It does come with a couple of sample videos though and it looks really good.  Gone is Toshibas own software.  It comes with Windows media player instead, and you have to use that unless you get other third party programs that work with your gigabeat such as Media Monkey.  I use Media Monkey actually, and nothing funny has happened since I've been using it.   The software on the gigabeat device itself is windows mobile and it's very easy to get around and do what you want to do.  It's a lot like windows for your computer, you know what to do immediately.  The sound is excellent even at the lower bitrates.  I generally use WMAs at 128 and there is very little hissing and it sounds bright and clear.  My Creative Zen Micro had quite a bit of noticeable hissing and it wasn't as clear either even when I use the same ear buds for it.    There are many other things I like about it but most of the other reviewers covered it so I'm gonna end it here.  Give it a try.

<Title>Excellent design, once you figure out how to use it
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had mine almost a year. During the first couple weeks I wanted to smash it. It took a few weeks to completely learn how to use it (the user manual is at best a quick start guide), but now that I have, I think the time was well spent. It is an excellent MP3 and WMA player. I have not used it much for video.  Most of the good and bad things you have read about it are true - Poor battery life between charges and, worse yet, the manual says the battery is good for only about 500 charges. I don't care that much about the short battery life because I only use it at home (I use a Creative Muvo for traveling). No support from Toshiba and very few peripherals. No custom equalizer. Cannot create playlists on the device. Cannot delete songs without synching it to WMP. On the other hand, all the good stuff CNet and others have to say is also true. The interface is outstanding. But again, you have to learn it by experimenting. Such activities as synching playlists with Windows Media Player and getting album art to show up are doable once you know how. The infamous spontaneous erasure of all files is avoidable if the battery is FULLY CHARGED and the charger is attached before synching it to your PC. I like the buttons on the side which some people object to.  If there were enough of these to make it worthwhile, one could write a book "Gigabeat S - the Missing User Manual" and it could be about 400 pages long. If you have the patience to figure everything out by trial and error, you will find this an outstanding device. If not, don't buy it. You will be very frustrated. You can get an idea from the thousands of posts in the MyGigabeat Gigabeat S series forum.  It would rate an easy five stars if the battery longevity was better, it came with a decent user manual and there were peripherals available.

<Content>The gigabeat is perfect. It's small, it holds a buttload of songs, and its cheaper and better than the iPod. Not only is it pure awesomeness, but it runs off windows mobile media center software ;)  i dont see battery life as a problem. it always lasts 10+ hours for me. its better than buying batteries  which run out in 5 hours at the store all the time. the sound quality is perfect. i havent tried out video yet, and probably never will, but im sure it would be great since the screen is nice and big. anyway, i recommend the gigabeat for sure! search around though..there are better prices out there.

<Content>This product worked exceptionally well for me, and was a big improvement from the last mp3 player I had (which inexplicably stopped working entirely, and the jerks at the company dealt me a load of bull on fixing it). The user interface was great, the storage capacity was great--and the battery life, while agreeably was a bit short, was good enough for me. However, four months after getting it I accidentally cracked the screen and now it doesn't work at all. Since then I've halfheartedly been trying to find the warranty information so I can get it repaired--but I'm starting to think that no matter what I do any mp3 player I get is going to break within a few months of the purchase, so I think a CD player works best for me. I'm sure anybody who isn't technologically jinxed like I am would love this device like I did, but I personally have given up on mp3 players entirely.

<Title>Good player but battery is not replaceable by user
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this p[layer after reading the CNET review which gave it high marks.  It is indeed easy to use, small, attractive, and performs nicely.  But, and this is a BIG but, the player has both a short battery cycle life, and to replace the battery, it must be returned to Toshiba.  I called Toshiba to find out the price for battery replacement and I was told that the flat rate price is $140.00.  I almost dropped the phone. As I recall, a big complaint with the the first generation I Pod was that the battery also had to be sent to the factory for replacement for $99.00.  I Pod users revolted and so Apple changed the design.  So how can Toshiba, five years later, make a player that does not allow for field replacement, and why should battery replacement cost so much???  Needless to say, I have returned the player to Amazon and I plan to purchase a Zen Vision instead.

<Title>Great for digital photo storage
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the 30 GB Gigabeat to use for storing digital photos my wife and I took on a trip through Ireland and Wales.  In 4 weeks we took around 5,000 digital photos and quite a few digital videos on a Canon S-3.  We needed the Gigabeat so that we could transfer each day's photos off of the SD chip so it could be reused the next day.   We did not take a computer with us. Therefore, having the Gigabeat manual located on a CD was not the best provision Toshiba could have made in terms of being customer friendly.  As it terned out however, there is very little in the manual regarding using the Gigabeat to store digital photos and absolutely nothing regarding storage of digital videos so having a printed copy of the existing manual would not have been of much help.  Fortunatly, the Gigabeat operation is pretty straight forward and downloads were fairly simple but rather time consuming.  The biggest problem was that digital videos from a camera such as the Canon S-3 are downloaded in the same location on the Gigabeat that digital photos are and not viewable on the Gigabeat screen as the digital photos are therefore there is no way to tell if the videos were safely downloaded.  After we returned to the USA we used Windows media player to transfer the digital photos and digital videos onto the computer hard drive and were glad to find out that all of the digital photos were successfully stored and then transferred to the computer and about 90% of the digital videos came through as well. Some digital video files were corrupted for some reason and could not be recovered.  I gave the Gigabeat 4 stars because it accomplished the majority of what we needed it to do.  Battery life could be better.  Toshiba would be well advised to give some consideration to the segment of their customers that are interested in digital image storage in preparing their manuals.  As for using the Gigabeat and other similar devices to blow your eardrums out - well, if that is the only reason you want such a device you won't be interested in reading any information that might help you preserve your hearing so I won't waste your time!

<Title>Anti-iPod...
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really didn't want to buy an iPod because I use a subscription music service every day and wanted something that was compatible.  Since I am paying a monthly fee for a subscription, I didn't want to also have to buy each song.  The Gigabeat was one of the highly recommended devices for my subscription service.  Not only does it play music very well, but as an additional bonus, I can download my Tivo recordings to it.  So, I don't have to pay extra for either music or videos.     I recently went through some very long travel (to Russia from the US) and this thing was a life saver.  The batteries lasted very well during 20+ hours of traveling (not playing it constantly, but pretty often) and I didn't feel like I was missing anything in the videos that I watched.  Even though the viewing screen is fairly small, the picture was very clear.  The only thing I really wished for was a way to set it down and prop it up so that I didn't have to hold on to it.   The 30 gig memory is way more than enough for every playlist of music I have and as many videos as I would ever have saved up to download to it.  I tend to keep a short list of both, however, so if you have tons of either, you might want to invest in the larger memory card.

<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the S30. I'm currently in high school and literally nearly everyone that has seen it likes it better than the iPod. I personally did not want an iPod and went with the Gigabeat. The navigation is very good, closest competition possible to the scroll wheel.  Pros: -Love the d-pad navigation -Great look, stands out from the iPod -Good quality audio -Screen is better than the iPod (not sure about specs, but just from using it) -Very small compared to the Zune -Comes with independent charger, USB cable, and AV cables. Other players you have to spend $50 or more to get that   Cons: -Biggest, battery life, but all you have to do is charge it nightly -Up/Down on d-pad doesn't do much, would be better if it was volume or skip -Fingerprints easily, but so does the iPod -Metal casing dents pretty easily -No accessories, but I don't buy accessories.   Overall I'm very happy with my choice. I highly suggest the Gigabeat, especially if you want to stand out from the enormous iPod group. I would give it a 5 out of 5 for my uses, but many people like accessories and other things that come with having the most popular MP3 player around (iPod).

<Content>They battery life is great.   People need to understand   if you want longer battery life you need more space to hold the charge.   And for the size of the player you can only fit so much MAH into a battery  to fit.   Never really used WMP for anything but after messing with it, I got the  hang with it it works really great.  Almost have my dvd collection on my gigabeat, TRULY A Portable Media Center.  What I REALLY love about this player is that, if someone takes a picture   with you or your family and you are used to telling them send me a copy   to my 'email adress'. Well now you dont have to, just download it to the Gigabeat! AWESOME  I think that over all, this is a good player for the price.   But every manufacturer has problems and youll find all the bad complaints on every single Portable Media Player as you see on this one.

<Title>Great Player Very Happy With Perfomance and ease of use
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned the Toshiba Gigabeat for about 3 months now, I currently have 1000 songs, 20 pictures, 3 tv shows, and several programs stored on it.  I find that it is very easy to transfer media and data files onto this device via wmp10 (windows media player 10) and through windows explorer(copy and paste). Battery life has been fine I have not used it more than 5 hours without recharging it though. The one plus for me was the controls are easy to use, I can scroll through the menu screens quick and easy, I had such a hard time with the ipod wheel. I am also happy with the size and clarity of the screen. And the sound is better than average, I accually love the sound when I connect it to my Home Stereo System.  My only beef with this device is now that the Zune has come out, witch is also made by Toshiba, I am afraid that the support and accessories will be lacked. I have also droped my gigabeat twice already once in a parking lot and another time in a grocery store, the only damaged it recieved was a small dent that is very hard to point out.

<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hello, I would do anything for the Gigabeat S to work properly, it's controls are easier to understand than iPods, and I like the interface a LOT better.  But this device is nothing but problems.  I am now on my SECOND Gigabeat S, and I've spent over $700 to give this device a chance, TWICE!  Right now, for instance, I can't even get the device to TURN OFF!!  It won't turn off, it's in an infinite do-loop of some sort.  Can't remove the battery, can't do anything.  My only alternatives at this point are to let the batter drain naturally, because the on/off switch simply ignores your commands, and the device cannot do anything. If this were my first try, perhaps I could blame the device as a lemon, or maybe blame Yahoo Music Engine (which is no walk in the park either). But this is my 2nd try, the 1st ended in disaster also.  Conclusion:  If you have no respect for your money, and more importantly if you don't value your time, then I recommend you give the Gigabeat S series a chance.  I hope you have a TREMENDOUS amount of patience.  I tell you this, the only reason this device gets any favorable reviews, is because the reviewers haven't owned their devices for long enough.   PROBLEMS PROBLEMS AND MORE PROBLEMS down the road.    No one has tried harder to like this device more than me.  I saw it at CES in early 2006, waited for it all year, bought it the day it was released, and 5 months later I'm staring at "Connected" on the screen with no ability to turn off my 2nd device.  2 for 2 on failures.   I honestly don't know who to blame, Microsoft, Toshiba, or Yahoo Music.  It doesn't matter, the point is, you'd best either go with a Zune player or iPod, because the "PlaysForSure" label actually means PlaysForALittleWhileBeforeSomethingBreaks.  Boy, I really wish subscription music would work.  It's a shame.  How long ago did Napster release portable subscriptions?   All this time, and it STILL doesn't work.    Hey Toshiba, how about making a device I can actually TURN OFF when it has a problem so I can reboot??????  Toshiba wouldn't take back my first faulty device.  I'm throwing this device into a brick wall, and then deciding how I want to incinerate my money next by trying to avoid iPod.  With the money I've torched, I could have bought every song I've ever liked on iPod.  I am an idiot.

<Title>Totally disatisfied with battery life
<Date>Mon Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Gigabeat last September. I haven't used it that much, but from the very beginning, battery life was just annoying: it doesn't last more than 4 to 6 hours, even though Toshiba assures that it lasts 12 hours. This is a terrible investment, because I travel a lot, and I want to listen to music for several hours. I sent it back to Toshiba for fixing, but it is now exactly as it was, so, it's not a problem of my specific device but of this product. I chose Toshiba because I trusted the brand name, but I regret very much not having acquired an IPod instead.

<Title>awesome player
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i just bought the mes30vw after trying out a friends mes60vw over the weekend. I was impressed by the overall form factor of the thing and mostly for the disk space to price ratio!! i'm surprised these aren't selling more... one of the main reasons i went for this was that "everyone else has an ipod" and this one is much better on the disk space: i can fit my entire collection in 30gigs + photos + a video or two depending on what i'm in the mood for.   the earphones are definitely not top notch... they sound tinny and high freqs are really emphasized while bass is reduced a lot (expected from smallish speakers). however, this is *easily* rectified by a pair of phillips bass boosting bud-earphones i already had.   the interface is pretty intuitive and the device just connected to my xp home laptop with windows media player 11 effortlessly. transferring about 500+ songs in one shot took about 10+ mins (don't know exactly cuz i stepped away and it was done by the time i got back).   don't know about the battery life probs that people have been having, but i set the screen to 15 seconds on and reduced brightness by 1 level, vol down to enjoyable level of 4 and it's been over 4 hours and this thing is going strong still with abt 50%+ remaining (i had the same experience with my friend's mes60vw and got about 8 or so hours out of it). haven't watched any videos so don't know about that. might just try Vongo, though i've read about people having probs with it.   the UI is very usable and doesn't get in your way. the buttons are very nice to have on the side and very intuitively placed. one thing i've missed is the ability to page up and down on the list... you have to go down one at a time or hold the cross down to scroll at hyperspeed. it does display the first alphabet of the names in the background, but i'd still like to have the page up / down.    now i'm just looking for a case and a dock... does one exist??

<Title>Love it so far
<Date>Sat Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After being introduced to the Gigabeat by a family friend, I read a lot of customer reviews since I did want to replace my 2 Gb Apple iPod with something a little larger, and decided to go for the MES30VW, which I've had for a little over a week now.  It literally does everything, although I haven't yet tried to download videos but will soon...anyway, on to the features...  I'm not a computer techie or particularly knowledgeable on electronics, but after a couple of perusals of the manual (the FULL manual - not the Quick Start Guide!) it all made a lot of sense.  I like that it uses WMP 10, which I already had on my computer anyway (though it needs to be reinstalled for files specific to the Gigabeat) and the whole thing wasn't foreign to me.  Ripping songs from my rather large collection of CDs is easy, and synching them to my Gigabeat is just as easy.    For whatever albums where the information doesn't show up immediately, I can search and there it is...album cover, song titles, artists, everything.  At first I didn't know this and spent a lot of time manually typing in that information, but most of the time now I can get the information with a couple of clicks of my mouse.  Even ripping CDs I've compiled myself is pretty easy, as screen will come up asking for album name (whatever you want to call it) and the songs, artists, and composers...no more "Unknown Artists" or "Unknown Albums".  Setting the FM tuner was fun, if only because I'm thrilled to have something that not only plays downloaded music, videos, and displays photos, but also gets FM radio just in case having a couple of thousand of my favorite tunes isn't quite good enough - ha ha  At first I was a bit nervous about all those moving parts (not the same as the iPod) and afraid I would disconnect it at the wrong time, but as long as the "Connected" screen is visible, it can be safely disconnected from the PC.   A couple of strange things happened while trying to charge on the adaptor, but I took a chance and turned off the internal battery for a few seconds, turned it back on, and all was fine.  While we're on the topic of the battery, I have to say that I wasn't all that happy with what seemed to be a rather paltry battery life...I was only getting a couple of hours of play/transfer before getting notice that it needed to be charged again, but I did go into my Settings and adjust the backlighting from one minute to 15 seconds, turned off the Sound Effects (clicking and dinging when scrolling) turned down the screen brightness, and turned off the Harmonics.   I really believe that will help conserve battery life.  Even with reduced brightness, my photos look real good, and even without Harmonics the sound is decent for a portable music player, although I really hate earbuds, but the ones that came with the device aren't too horrible.  If you want symphony hall sound, spend a couple of thousand bucks on a huge home system...  I hope my description has been helpful, and if I think of anything more as time goes on I'll give an update.  One rather interesting point here is that hubby got rather envious after a few days and bought a Gigabeat just like mine and plans on also using it in his truck with an adaptor instead of juggling CDs all over the place.  We're both well over 50 years old, and it's kind of funny to see us walking around the house hooked up to our own personal music...so if two "old farts"  can understand how to run the thing, it can't be all that hard.

<Title>DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
<Date>Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is junk.  It would not play music for more than two hours before going dead.  When I called Toshiba, the person that I talked to claimed he wasn't aware battery life was even a problem.  I directed him to read some of the reviews on C-NET, which I discovered after I bought it. (My fault) It was finally returned and the battery was replaced.  Now (after two weeks) it won't even hold a charge.  I'm returning it and will not recommend this to anyone.

<Title>Battery On-Off Button is Too Small
<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The battery on-off button is unlableled and extremely small.  It is almost useless.  It cannot be operated with fingers.  You will need a tool with a very fine point - like a pin and probably a magnifying glass.  Otherwise I like this player.  But come on Toshiba what were you thinking with this battery on-off button.  It is a joke.

<Title>Returning this Item/  Do Not Purchase
<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I read that others had this issue but I thought of course, not me.  And then it happened.  All of the music I had downloaded ( 976 songs) was erased in 30 seconds.  I do not have the time for this BS and the associated explanations.  The product is going back and I will/WILL get my refund.  Also, setting up playlists is not intuitive.  It's my B-day coming up and I will make someone buy me the 60G IPOD.  This product has too many problems and demands too much time to try to FIX.  MS

<Content>Its smaller than Ipod or Zune, but it has all the functionality that Zune has.  (I think because they base the Zune design on Gigabeat).  Loving it!  The only problem is it is very hard to find accessories for this media player.

<Title>The gigabeat is super cool!
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I researched MP3 players for several months on the tech websites (CNet, for 1 example) and finally chose the gigabeat MES30V. It has been very easy to use and operate. It does everything the manufacturer promises. The battery life, however, is very short (5 hours), if you use the Harmonics feature continuously to enhance poor quality mp3s. I can't tell any difference in the sound when the Harmonics is turned off, so I play mine with the feature off all the time and have 8 to 10 hours of play time. Pictures from your computer or digital camera are easily downloaded and are displayed very nicely, while your music continues to play. I have been very pleased with mine.
