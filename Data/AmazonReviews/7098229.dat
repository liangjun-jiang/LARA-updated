<Product Name>Transcend 20GB Digital Photo Album
<Title>Flawless digital picture storage
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently received the Transcend Digital Photo Album as a gift and could not be more thrilled with it.  I used it during my sister's wedding as a repository for all our guests' digital pictures and for my own pictures.  Because it accepts a variety of cards, I was able to download pictures from any camera!  The download time is fairly quick and the device could not be simpler to use.  The screen is huge and has excellent resolution.  I enjoyed the remote feature for playing slideshows on any television.  All in all, this device is an amazing asset to anyone who enjoys taking digital pictures (and collecting pics from others).  When my card was full of pictures, I uploaded them and cleaned the card.  It was truly a blessing not have to worry about running out of storage room.

<Title>Good - but not great

<Content>I first tried a video iPod and found it to be completely unusable even though Apple claimed the Sony Camera listed was tested.  So, I was forced into getting the only available alternative which was the transcend photo album.  It's good, but really clunky in design and usability.  While it has a multi-card reader connection, you never 'really' know the card is seated properly.  It should 'click in' the way a memory stick in a Sony Camera does.  Also, the current level of software implies you can select a copy location, but it always defaults to the /copy folder regardless of how many other folders you created with a computer.  In addition, after one day the cheapo transformer they sent with it died.  After contacting their tech support I was told to go and buy one at Radio Shack - no warrantee on the transformer.  This does not bode well for a device I expect to travel with.  It's a good thing Amazon had a easy way to get it replaced or else I would have not been a happy customer.  Finally, you will be dissappointed with the screen resolution compared to the iPod.  If Apple ever gets their act together and makes putting photos directly on the video iPod easier, then Transcend has an obsolete product.  It's pretty good, but it could a whole lot better considering the competition out there.  Transcend's website says they strive to exceed customer expectations.  Clearly, they are not reaching that goal.  Like I said, it's good, but for the money I expected better.  For now I'll use it but it has drawbacks you need to be aware of when spending this kind of money.

<Title>Mixed blessing

<Content>The first time I used my Transcend box for photo storage was on a three week trip to Alaska.  The device performed perfectly and enabled me to take 700 photos with two .514 gb memory cards.  I was thrilled with it.  The second time we used the device, we took it on a trip to Africa.  We brought only two memory cards with us since this method worked so well the first time.  Unfortunely, the transformer died on our first day and I could not buy additional cards in Africa to fit our camera.  I spent a whole vacation day tracking down a Kodak shop in Nairobi to transfer my pictures to CD so I could reuse my memory cards.  I have since learned that the cheap transformer plug was to blame and I have not been able to replace it with anything since.  I was told to go to Radio Shack but they have nothing there that can be adapted to the Transcend Box.  I have the choice of buying another complete Transcend box with transformer (which I certainly WILL NOT do) or throwing the whole thing away.  I'm really annoyed.
