<Title>Went to China and Back - worth every penny!
<Date>Sun Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I took this MP3 player with me on a trip across China recently.  It was great!  Very small...about the size of a lipstick. Fit nicely into a pocket and held a large amount of music.  Definitely a great value and worth the money.  I was worried about the rechargables since I would not be able to recharge during travel.  The battery should last up to 19 hours and so far so good.  Still on the first battery and used for hours.  Never expected to like this so much.  What a great surprise!

<Title>*Was* Valid Complaint, But Now Firmware Fixed Problem
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"I primarily listen to spoken work programs - audio books and radio shows. If you do this as well, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER. It does not have any resume feature, whatsoever. If you turn it off, you must manually fast forward or rewind to your stopping point. To make it worse, those rewind/fast forward speeds are horribly slow without any menu options to change those speeds. I had the eariler Sandisk 1mb player and it was a much better product."  One of the reviewers mentioned this problem. This was a problem with just about all the MP3 players. I took one of the files from NetLibrary that did *not* resume properly with earlier SanDisk products, but it works fine with this one.

<Title>Great player at an awesome price
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was torn between joining the Apple Borg and getting an I-Pod Shuffle and exploring other brands of flash-drive players.  I knew I neither needed nor wanted one of the huge 20GB hard-drive behemoths, as I needed to be able to take my player to the gym (which the hard-drive models make it difficult, if not impossible, to do) and there is no way I would ever need to sort through EVERY song in my entire CD collection.  A flash drive player was the obvious choice for me.  And so I bought Sansa m240 on the recommendation of reviewers on several different websites.  Man, am I glad I did.  This is a really great player with terrific sound even on 64kbps WMAs (which take up half the space of similar-quality 128k MP3s).  I've got about 150 MP3s and another 100 WMAs stored in the 1 GB of memory, and I estimate I've got room for about another 100 WMAs.  I have no idea what else I will put on this baby, but I'm good to go for now with about two workdays worth of music.  Loading songs is tremendously easy--just drag and drop like you would any other file in Windows.  The operation of the unit is also fairly intuitive, with noncomplicated menus and easy-to-use controls.  I was up and running within five minutes.  The FM tuner works great, although I haven't really used it all that much.  It's a nice feature, though.  The nicest feature of all, though (for a unit this size and price), is the four-band equalizer.  That's something the similar-sized Shuffle does not have (Heck, it doesn't even have a DISPLAY).  I haven't used the voice recorder because I have a PDA that does the same thing,   nor have I explored its audio book and subscription music capabilities.  I could go on and on about this unit.  I've had it a week now and I really haven't found anything I DON'T like about it.  It's HIGHLY recommended if you are in the market for a flash MP3 player to listen to tunes on.

<Title>Sandisk m240 crackles every 20-30 seconds during playback of Audible.com files (AA format 1 and 4)
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The M200 series may be a bad choice for Audible.com listeners -- at least until they release a patch. This review is only about bugs when playing Audible.com content, and some navigation issues with audio books on WMA.  So if you only listen to music, ignore this review!  Sandisk Sansa m200 series crackles every 20-30 seconds during playback of Audible.com files. The noise is a split second interruption, like a click or a crackle.  Sometimes it blanks out half a word, sometimes it garbles half a word.  It took me a few hours to realize that it was consistent, I just thought I wiggled a connector, but it does it when I am still.  I upgraded the firmware (v1.3.0A) from Sandisk after I got it out of the package two days ago (12/20/2005).  Other web forums mention this problem in January/February 2005, but they said the firmware fixed it.  I guess not for Audible files.  I talked at length to Sandisk support.  They were very friendly and I got them immediately, no wait!  This is a known bug with the M200 series for the AA formats 1 and 4 only. I think he said that Formats 2 and 3 have no crackle.  It does not crackle on mp3 and wma.  They are working on this problem with low priority since it is reported infrequently.  Some people can ignore it I guess.  I also discovered a problem when playing WMA's: the M200 has a bug with rewinding or fast forwarding WMA's.  I downloaded a short book from Overdrive Media through the Fairfax County library.  I could play it fine, but it would skip to the beginning or end when holding the rewind or forward buttons.  It would also skip to the end if I paused it twice, or turn the unit off a second time.  The Sansa E100 series is better, but it does not remember where you left off when you power off in the middle of a WMA file.  I tried the same book as above from Overdrive.  It does resume fine for Audible AA files.  The sound quality was great for Audible, no clicks.  The following is the details of my observation of one Audible.com book.  Sandisk assured me that it happens with all Audible format 4, with different timing:  When I play my Audible book on the Sansa m240, it crackles every 25 seconds. It resets this 25 second period when I stop or rewind. It continues to crackle every 25 seconds if I go to the menu and stay at the menu while playing. I noticed that when it crackles, if the back-light is on, it will flicker. The scrolling title is in sync with the crackle. It happens twice during the full scroll. The full title is: "On Intelligence (Unabridged), Part 2 ". The first time when I played it, it crackled as the two L's in "intelligence" scroll off the the left, and then again before the "P" in "Part" reaches the left edge. It crackled every time the title scrolled to those two exact same positions. However, if I stop or go to the menu and back, it crackles at two new positions of the scrolling title.  Hopefully they fix this soon. I think it is a great little player otherwise!

<Title>No bookmark for .WMA files
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For the price, this is a nice MP3 player for music.  However, I was very disappointed to find that it has no ability to bookmark audio files I download from my public library.  The service people say it can only bookmark *.aa (Audible)files.

<Content>I really like the sound quality of this player.  Very easy to use and add songs. Received about 1 week ago and still on same battery.  My only problem is I can't create a playlist.  Followed instructions that came with player but nothing works.  Any ideas out there?

<Title>Worth the price and holds a ton
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My brother did a little more research than I did and gave me this mp3 player for Christmas, and it turned out to be far better than the one I gave him (oops).  I have spent a little time with this since then, and have been downloading large amounts of music to the player with no sign of it having major problems.  The sound quality provided by the earbuds is a lot better than I expected, and the easy controls make this pretty simple to appreciate and use.  Included with my package was an offer from two third party companies worth checking out.  The first was from audible.com for audiobook downloads (be warned that a lot of them are larger unabridged offerings) that has a huge selection to choose from, and the other was for Rhapsody, offering an $80 rebate if you subscribed for 6 months to their service.  I have had a problem getting the Rhapsody website to accept the UPC number from my player required for preregistration, so be aware you might have a problem.  I am planning on taking this lightweight one-AAA battery player out on the ski slopes to have something tolisten to, and think that this will more than capably do the trick.  I strongly recommend it if you have never gotten an mp3 player, because until I got this one, I hadn't had one, and using the USB connection and armband plan to get a lot of use out of this player.

<Title>Well designed.  Great Value.  WORKS WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In an age where half of the Made In China junk you buy needs to be returned, I'm happy to report that the M240 is truly a great product (even though this too is Made in China!)  To start out with, I was looking for an MP3 player that works with subscription music.  Buying CDs or even download music is a waste of money for me because I get tired with most music after about 3 plays.  Subscription music is great because you can download almost anything, then delete it when you get bored and download some more!  I don't know why this hasn't caught on more.  I'd think more people would feel somewhat the way I do.  I've been making the rounds of free trials on the subscription services, starting with Napster.  Now I'm with AOL.  The Sandisk works flawlessly on either of the two I've tried, though Microsoft and AOL can be kind of quirky.  The 128k WMA that AOL provides are just right.  I can load up about 10 albums and only half fill my m240 1gb model!    The sound from this thing is great.  I replaced the earbuds (fall out of my big dumbos) with $10 Sonys and they sound great together.  I also purchased a Belkin Tuncast II (about 33 bucks) for my car, and these also make a great pair.    I also went out and bought a pack of rechargeable AAA batteries. Because the unit does go through alkalines pretty quickly.    The unit is rich in features.  You can access your music by playlist, album, genre or artist.  The FM radio sounds great. I've yet to use the voice recorder.  The backlight works well too.  The display provides a great deal of information, but is a bit small. I guess it has to be on such a small unit.  That's another great thing about it.  When I hop out of my car, I slip it in a pocket and can plug it into my head phones at work or home.    Overall, A great product!

<Title>This may not be an Apple but it's a real peach!
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this about a month ago as a Christmas present to myself, but wasn't sure if I really wanted to keep it...I guess I was a bit too impressed with the iPod name.  On Christmas Day my cousin's kids received iPods so I finally had a chance to see what the fuss was all about.  Needless to say I was not impressed.  So I finally opened my Sandisk and what a surprise!  I just love this thing!  Just to give it a try, I downloaded a couple of CD's I had in my computer.  I was quite impressed with the ease of the download and the instructional CD that came with the unit.  Now mind you I am not computer savvy at all and this was a breeze to do.  I had read a previous review posted here about a cassette adpater so you can use this in the car.  Lo and behold when I was at BJ's the other day they had a Belkin model for $14.99.  Seemed a bit cheap but I thought I would give it a try.  Tried it for the first time today and WOW!  I was seriously considering installing a CD player in my car, but now I can save the hundreds of $$ that would have cost with installation and all.    Can't wait to try the free offers for Napster and Audible.com downloads that came in the package!  Love, love, love it!!!

<Title>Love the sleep function
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: sleep function, easy to use, controls haven't worn out yet Cons: not exactly sleek body design, chows batteries listening to audiobooks  I also have an e260 which has no sleep function, the wheel is impossible and wearing out already.  But these m240s just keep on tickin. I bought two more for my wife and mother-in-law.   Wish they had them with more than 2gb. I've been putting off buying a larger mp3 to replace the stinky e260, because I'm disappointed by all the other options for midsize players. I'm thinking about getting the 2gb and just rotating them out every once in a while.

<Title>Worth its weight in songs!
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player about 2 years ago and use it 3-5 times a week at the gym. It takes its share of abuse and keeps on going. The sound is great and the software that comes with it is fairly easy to use compared to the Rio MP3 player that this replaced after less than 90 days! In my opinion, iPods are overrated and a BIG marketing gimmic. If you're looking for a tough, basic but great sounding player that will last, I would highly recommend this player.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Cheap and Easy to Use
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the Sansa M240 to replace the M230 that I left at my gym. I had the M230 for 3 years and it worked like a champ. It was very easy to operate and upload music to.  The M240 is just as good. It holds more music and even sounds a bit better. Very pleased with the product and would recommend to someone who is not very technology orientated.

It holds plenty of music for a child her age, fits perfectly in her purse or backpack, and the batteries don't seem to wear down to quickly, despite frequent use.

<Title>Nice, inexpensive MP3 player
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa m240 MP3 player was a good solution for my 9-year old boy who wanted an MP3 player, but isn't yet responsible enough for one costing $100+.  It works very well with Windows Media player and has reasonable sound quality for a $40 unit.  The menu is pretty intuitive and so far, everything works just like it's supposed to.  I can't yet attest to the long-term durability.
