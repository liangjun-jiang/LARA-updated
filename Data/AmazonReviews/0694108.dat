<Title>This Item is not well constructed
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sandisk Sansa e280 is straight up garbage.  I had to take it back on 4 seperate occasions because the the memory froze and could not be reset.  when you load all of your songs and movies, sometimes the songs don't appear on your Mp3 player.  you have to load it 3 or 4 different times to get in on your ipod. the buttons on the sansa are pretty damn small as far as the arrows. the volume button and volume button navigation is well thought out but as far as the unit as a whole, I would give a D-. Very sloppy craftsmanship and I think they need to recall this item and fix the errors or else they probable will soon loose repeat business.

<Title>Prettty good - keep trying
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Happy to see that this player (compared to e140) would resume playback where it left off after turning off.  Resets volume to 50% on power up(?) though!  I had the opposite problem than what this is probably supposed to prevent.  I usually am listening at reduced volume so that I can hear what's going on in the background, only to get blasted after turning the unit back on.  Player needs some way easy to bulld playlists internally.  Sound and battery life are very good.  The more storage capacity a player has, the more the manufacturer really needs to think about the interface and software.  But I'm pretty particuar about the order that I want to play back my tunes.  It's not easy being me :-)  Windows Media player for a front-end?  Don't think so!  I may sell this and look at the Creative one even though it' not as small.  I hate their (Creative) software, but at least it has something.

<Title>This is some headache-causing hardware!
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My beloved Zen Micro Photo's hard drive died, but thankfully, I had Big Box Retailer's extended warranty on it. Unfortunately, they no longer stock that unit, so I had to pick out another one. The Sansa looked like the best out of the bunch: Small, high-quality screen, video playback, high capacity, flash-based, and most importantly, it had a built-in voice recorder.  Almost from the outset, there were problems. I don't use any online music services, so having Rhapsody foisted upon me was an immediate annoyance. The media manager application had a propensity to randomly crash, particularly in the middle of file transfers. Not good. The design felt very badly thought out, with a mechanical scroll wheel that feels rough and gets stuck (I see why Apple dumped them!), and buttons that are tiny, hard to press, and don't feel like they're being pushed when they are.   But the real deal-killer for me was a problem I don't think many others will experience: I have a great deal of music whose filenames and ID3 tags are written in Japanese characters. The Sansa's US firmware does not support Japanese (and other Asian languages as well, I'd assume), and as a result, the player will choke whenever it's asked to play a file with even one Japanese character in it. Since about half my music library fits that description, and it would take forever to go back and manually rename all those files in English, I was extremely annoyed. Perhaps a firmware flash would fix it? I tried to get some firmware of Sandisk's Japanese site, but they don't have any direct downloads. Maybe the newest US firmware has Asian language support, I thought to myself. I found the firmware, unzipped it, and loaded it onto my player.  Dead as a doornail. Tried it again. And again. And again. At that point, I just gave up.  Some people don't seem to have any problems with this. Well, more power to you, I guess, but based on my experience, this is NOT something I would recommend. If you're in the market for an iPod alternative, Creative's units still offer the best combination of features, functionality, and design.   Now I just need to figure out what I'm gonna buy after I return this thing.

<Title>Great Alternative to Apple's Proprietary Garbage
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me start by saying that this thing is really small.  I saw the pictures and even some video reviews on youtube, but I was still pleasantly surprised at how tiny this player actually is.  My Motorola Razor cellphone dwarfs it. It's cheap, so unless you're a dedicated Apple user (i.e. have more money than brains), you're getting a great bargain. I got it mainly because of nice size and compatibility (no need for dealing with iTunes - this baby looks just like another drive to your comptuer, which means drag and drop support for files). I wasn't expecting much from video - but changed my mind, after being able to watch tv series episodes on it during my commute to work, or full movies during recent flights.  The resolution/quality of the LCD is simply amazing. FM tuner gets great reception, even in my basement - not to mention the fact that I can quickly record a new song directly off the radio, so that I can listen to it later. The only downside I can list at the moment is the button interface - the rotating wheel could be a little more depressed, to make pressing buttons around it easier, but you get used to it really fast.   Other than that - this device is definitely the way to go.  I couldn't be more happy with the purchase.

<Title>nice feature set, nice look, easy to use
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll admit that I've never owned any iPod, so I cannot directly compare this unit with a Nano.  Why buy a Nano, though, when the Sansa with equivalent flash memory has additional features and costs much less?  Sure, the Nano's interface (the click wheel) is a little easier to use, but that's not worth a 35% premium while sacrificing features such as video playback and an FM tuner.  My previous player was one of the Sansa e100 series.  This player is a definite upgrade beyond the obvious (color screen, larger capacity, video playback).  It definitely sounds much better than the e100 (and I was basically satisfied with that player's sound once I had tweaked its equilizer to my liking).  The interface is a lot nicer than the e100.  As others have written, the buttons around the scroll wheel are small but this hasn't presented a problem so far.  The menu system is so straight-forward that you don't really need to refer to the manual to use the player, though I would recommend looking at the manual at least once if you plan to put any video content on the player.  Contrary to some other reviewers' opinions, I think this player has a nice, not cheap, look.  I don't know whether it's identical in form to the lower capacity players in the same series; if not it seems much nicer in my hand than those players did when I briefly handled them at a local store.  I'm quite satisfied with this player so far, but I've only had it for about one week.  A word of caution to would-be purchasers:  I had originally ordered this from Amazon and, according to their customer service, they don't know when they will get more units in (despite the website saying "in stock").  I was given a delivery estimate of approximately two months away, so I canceled my order and went elsewhere.

<Title>Great player.  No hassle
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall this a great player with many capabilities.  The FM tuner, voice recorder, pics, and video are specs that everyone knows but it comes together nicely here. Replacable battery is always a plus.  Sound is great. If you don't like what you have you can manually adjust the equalizer settings.  There are many to choose from.  You might want to invest in some higher quality headphones though.  The factory set isn't bad at all, but you could go better.  I've heard a lot of complaining about the scroll wheel and the buttons.  The wheel is easy to use and DOES NOT JAM as some other tend to think.  Yea the Ipod click wheel is nice.. but this isn't an ipod is it..?  When pushing buttons, it seems that your pushes does not register but it does.  No issues there.  Battery Life is great.  Running through the menu, playlists, and all the other functions obvioulsy drains the battery but not significantly.  It'll last for at least 9 hours depending on usage.  Ease of use:  You can't go wrong with this player, and it is incredibly straight forward.  The installation cd gives you a user manual just in case you have any questions but you can figure it out yourself by just running through the menus.  File transfer and media converter is straight forward. To easily create playlists the cd will update your windows media player, so make sure you install it.  Media player tends to be moody at times, but once you start dragging and dropping your files, its easy.    Just something to point out.  An earlier review said that the boot time was around 5 minutes or so.  That's totally exaggerated.  I have a little under 6GB of USED space and it takes about 10 seconds max to boot.  Obviously, you should take care of your player.  Buying a case is a best bet even though it comes with a slim fabric case.  Take care of the player and it'll take care of you

<Title>co-dependent
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i must have got lucky i guess cause mine seems to be functioning properly. but i seriously think it's lame not to be able to create playlists or delete media without syncing up to a comp. i never owned an ipod but hear they are pretty much the same. it doesn't work well with windows media player. and i think it's weak for a company to sell a product without proper software included. they tell me rhapsody works better. i haven't had a chance to try it yet. i decided to make better use of my time and came on here to bash it instead. my creative labs is far better with menu options and music access.  the buttons are a little funky but my wheel works great. it does freeze up for a sec when you try and rate a song. it does take a minute to reload after syncing up. which is another reason they should make it so i can create playlists and delete songs without syncing up.  i do like the video, pics, sounds good, light-weight, nice big screen, it has potential, thier customer support seems good, but then when i asked them why you can't delete songs they said cause people used to complain about deleting songs on accident. so now that's my problem. i really appreciate them striving to suit the needs of the underprivledged. i hope microsoft gets the same idea and makes it so i can't create or save on my xbox without my computer. i'm satisfied with my purchase but taking away two stars for lack of convenience. all i want to do is put stuff on it. delete media i don't want when i hear or see it, so i can load it back up with fresh jams when i have time. it is going to take me forever to get it set up how i want it. not to mention adding new stuff yet to come. blah.

<Title>iPod Nano had better watch it's back! The Sansa competes and EXCEEDS in most if not all categories!
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't fall into the white earbud trance any longer!! Wake from your Apple induced slumber people and open your eyes to the SanDisk Sansa e200 Series!! This review pertains to the Sansa e280 8GB mP3 player and let me tell you that the iPod Nano and Apple for that matter, had better watch it's back! The feature set capabilities and price point of the Sansa e 280 should have no trouble making Nano into apple pie as long as users like me help educate consumers to the realization that yes, indeed, there is a whole market of AWESOME mP3 players that in fact cost LESS, have more features, better reliability, and a company that backs its unit even after it has been sold!   For a long while now, many consumers have a certain "fruit" in mind when it comes to the mP3 player of choice. Well, I have news for you. The Sansa e280 outstrips the Nano in almost every regard. the e280 was the first flash player to come out with an 8GB capacity. The Nano soon followed with it's own 8GB (2000 songs) however, the Sansa has and expandible Trans Flash/Micro SD card slot enabling the user to ADD Storage!! Yes I said ADD IT! Currently SanDisk makes a 2GB micro SD card for about 100$ enabling you to add 2gigs to your player(about 500 more songs). Nano doesn't offer this and yet it is still priced the same or higher in some cases as I found my Sansa for under 200$. with this capability, the life of the player should be extended because of increased volumes for SD cards that come out continuously. Unlike with an apple product where if more storage is needed, you have to buy a new player and spend another 250 bucks! You can plug the storage card into the player and all the music transfered to it automatically integrates into your albumn folders which is a fabulous benefit!  Another Nice feature that the Sansa offers is a larger display screen. At 1.8 inches, the colors are bright and crisp. I would have liked to see a higher color resolution, however, still much bigger than the Nano and quite easy to read and see.  The construction of the Sansa is excellent with a poured metal back casing that is virtually un-scratchable (unless you drop it I would imagine) but you really can't scratch it like an iPod or a Zen. It also doesn't use the same plastic as the iPod or the Creative Zen so the front is SO much more durable!!! You would really have to scrape something pretty sharp against it to show scratches on its face unlike the iPod and Zen player in which you just have to place them in a pocket to receive one.   The e280 has a tactile wheel for navigation which is similar to the iPod platform but I find it to be a bit better. The dial has tiny grooves enabling the user to have more control through the screens. Unlke the iPod, the wheel lights up an electrifying flourescent blue color enabling you to navigate in lower light conditions and it also enhances the sleek look of the player.   The Sansa is compatible with Windows Media Player(free) and Rhapsody which is a paid music subscription site just like iTunes. However because this is not an apple product, you are not confined to the Apple platform.    The Sansa offers an FM tuner which is spot on and crystal clear, a voice recorder (useful if you are the memo on the fly type), video playback and photo viewing capabilities. The Nano has video and photo but does NOT have FM radio or recording capabilities. Easy and user-desirable things to add and yet Apple still hasn't caught on.   The cost of ownership for this is already cheaper right out of the gate with the lower price point but also a GREAT feature that Apple refuses to offer as it would effect their bottom line DRASTICALLY is that the Sansa offers a USER replaceable battery for about 19 bucks. You have to send your iPod out to Apple at the cost of shipping and $50 per battery. Not to mention the battery life for the Nano is 15 hours where the Sansa e280 played for 22.5 hours before dying!  All in all I spent 177.00 and got a FAR SUPERIOR PLAYER!! SanDisk customer service is top notch as well. I owned 2 very expensive $300 a piece 20 Gig ipods. in just over a year each(right after the warranty was up) they had hard drive failure which cost 268.40 to repair. I was told it was cheaper to buy another iPod and was sent rudely on my way by Apple rather than their customer service trying to work with me to keep me as a customer. I have done research on every player out there, Hard Drive and flash. I bought a Sandisk. They are the leaders is flash memory for a reason. Not to mention their customer service was STELLAR!! Top notch and happy to have me convert.   In closing, the Sansa is most definitely worth your time and your investment. Don't spend the 250$ on the Nano for your child's christmas present. They will be receiving a far inferior product, will have to replace it or fix it and the cost is RIDICULOUS! Educate yourself and purchase a Sansa.

<Title>Nice, but No Control
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk's other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn't give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped.   It would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. "It's our way or the highway." Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.  It's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won't make much difference if the device won't play.

<Title>Just OK
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had this for about a week, then it crapped out and would not hook up with PC after.  Tech-help had no clue, "Just RMA" they said.   When skipping songs, there is a real pause that is aggrevating.  Scroll wheel is cheap as stated before.  Screen is real nice and video option is nice.  All in all, I returned this for an Ipod Nano 8gb.  No comparision.  Outside of video (which I have no use for) and price, (you do get what you pay for) this player can't even stand in the Nano's shadow.    Get the nano, you'll be glad after you did.

<Title>Completely satisfied
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It came boxed very nicely, the MP3 player and its accessories were safe and snug, and the battery came fully charged. I pressed the 'on' button and it turned on and was ready to go. To put music on, I just hook it up to my USB port (with the cable that comes with, obviously) and drag and drop the songs onto the drive. It's as simple as that. To charge it, just keep it hooked up to your computer. I always recommend reading the instructions with more expensive products like this, though. This thing works just as well as any iPod could, and holds plenty of music. Thoroughly satisfied with this.
