<Title>Excellent video player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 604 30GB is fantastic. video quality is amazing, dvd quality, and it supports DIVX although this is not mentioned in the literature.  The audio quality is very good too, though the earpieces could be more comfortable.  It is a pity that it didnt have a USB input. Note however that recording can only be done if you buy the optional DVR station (which i did, for $100) Downloading movies and stuff is very quick. Synchronisation with Media Player is good but has a few quirks at times.  Battery life for audio is good, but video is just about 2 hours.  The player is rather bulky and not ideal for carrying in your pocket.  You also need to invest in a proper leather case. That which is supplied is pathetic.

<Title>The perfect multimedia viewer!
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm on my second Archos player and this is the one to beat. The wide-screen is huge compared to my old 2.2 inch screen, the controls are simple and intuitive, the KICKSTAND is a Great Improvement (it allows the unit to sit up at a 15 degree angle so you can watch movies hands free), user replacable battery (you can get extra ones too), Excellent photo viewer, NON-proprietary file formats (not locked down to one format for videos), built in speaker and microphone!  The not so great: Lets face it. Earbuds don't fit most peoples ears so great. The supplied ones are good but you should go out and buy a pair that fit into you ears. Sony makes a pretty good, inexpensive set. The supplied case is a dog. It's a nylon sack that offers no protection.  That's it. Go out and try one. You won't be sorry.

<Title>I love it. (repeat 3 times)
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very solid product. Very satisfied.  I did a lot of research (Internet) before purchasing. Was able to play with it in-store before purchase at a Sharper Image. Have not tried any other devices. What was important to me? Size, reputation of Archos, quality and feel of unit, options, many glowing reviews out there, and the ability to transfer photos from digital camera.  Experience so far: Easy to use, great screen, great performance, no skimping on construction - feels solid and looks really great. I bought both plug-ins, as well as the helmet cam.  All work flawlessly.  Tech Support great - I called them with questions about plug-ins before I purchased. Less than 5 min wait, very helpful.  For the money spent, my expectations, and the product delivered: No regrets.  Couldn't be more pleased.

<Title>It's a great little video player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 604 for recording video in odd places, like on a roller coaster for instance.  At first I was quite disappointed becasue it doesn't have any native way of inputing video, you have to buy a cam or adapter from Archos.  Well, when I first got this unit in September I got what I thought was the helmet cam to go with it but it turned out to be the helmet cam for the older av500 series.  Neither the adapter or camera were available at that time.  So after much waiting I ordered the newly available travel adapter in early December, it finally arrived yesterday, 1-3-07.  I am frustrated that it took so long to arrive.  But it works wonderfully, I hooked up an external camera to it (the camera needed it's own power) and it worked great.  I connected it to a TV video source and again it worked just great.   So, in the end, it took 4 months to get the parts together to use it as I wanted but it works very nicely. Yes, it plays other videos I've downloaded to it too and does a good job.  It works as an MP3 player too, but hey, that's what my Ipod's for.   My one big concern it that I live in fear of breaking that nice big screen while it's in my pocket, or fanny pack while using it in the field.  A hard case would be nice but it'd have to fit over the travel adapter too in order to be useful. Oh, one gripe, why o why couldn't they just have included an input jack on the unit for video thus eliminating the need for the travel adapter??? Finally, if you've got the money, and need it, buy it, it works great. Mike

<Title>Excellent Product
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading numerous reviews, and searching for at least a month, I finally decided on the Archos product line.  They have the absolute best bang for the buck, hands down. I won't say anything bad about the other devices that are in the same category as this device.. other than none of them can compare to the features, support, and quality of this product. Let's just say that the screen and menu system is the best that I've found, when it comes to the other ones out there in this models range.  I actually did have to contact support because of a small problem with downloading one of the additional plug-ins off of the web site. I received help, and had the plug-in installed no more than 5 minutes later. Very fast and helpful support team.  The best feature is price vs what you get. Sure, having a record feature might be nice to some, but I'm not one of those folks. Having the ability to buy it later if I change my mind is very nice. I bought it for my wife for her birthday, and she has enjoyed it immensely as well. This device has the absolute best picture viewing ability (zoomed thumbnails on roll over, etc.), which is mainly what she wanted it for.  If you buy this device, or any other Archos product that supports them, I highly recommend that you buy the additional plug-ins. Well worth the small change for the functionality on the device. It would have been nice to incorporate them into the device on purchase, but having them so cheap for what you get was fine by me.

<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From the moment you pick up the Archos 604 from its box, it has the look and feel of a quality product, and by many accounts, it is. The brilliant 4.3 inch screen puts it in a class by itself. This is why I bought this PMP over all the others. The 604 does connect easily to a PC and the transfer of videos, music and photos is quick and easy. I did have to spend a few moments going over the website instruction manual to figure out a couple of things - and it does take about a day to get use to the buttons - but all-in-all, this is a very good Personal Media Player. In a perfect world, I would like to see the screen a tad brighter and the audio output a little stronger. I am not crazy about having to go to the website to pay for a number of firmware updates, but conisdering all the little nice features about this PMP, you tend to overlook some of the short falls. The Archos 604 is a very nice piece of equipment - perfect for traveling or something to use around the home or office.

<Content>Buy this player if you are not sure. I spent a month looking at every review and every spec and this is by far the best PVP, or even mp3 player around. The ONLY thing that I was disappointed with is the charging through the USB cord. I bought a 30$ charger on amazon, and now can charge with any outlet.  The resolution is far beyond what you will ever need, and it stores more than enough video for vacation. Screw the wi-fi model, buy this one!

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good device as a viewer for pictures, however movie downloads are a bit more complicated. We tried to click and drag, use Windows media syncro and it didn't see how to get files into the device (as the files come up separate and don't integrate). The easy way is to buy for $100. USD the Archos docking cradle and record off Dish, VCR, DVD or TV. It is slim and fits into your pocket in it's case, has good resolution for viewing and is fairly simple to learn to use. Picture files are easy to download and has a scrolling picture viewer in 3D or flip and fade. You can also use it to carry business files around if you so needed. Overall is it good technology and seems fairly substancial.     Jazzbebop7

<Content>Incredible device. I have been watching this courtesy of Maxmim PC and they reviewed the 604 recently I decided to get this item ($312). This blows every other Digatal LCD player away. 4.3" WS 16:9 LCD is truly amazing and it reads PDF's, plays music, holds photos, is a sports recorder, a dvr and plays DIVX/XVID avi out of the box. I paid 20 bux for mpeg 4 and VOB support and now it plays dectrypted dvds right out of folders. This is THE device to have ! Amazon was the cheapest by 30 bux and I was shipped fast and arrived perfect. Will shop again!

<Title>One serious little toy
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From the moment I saw it online, I knew that this was my son's Christmas present.  We were not disappointed.  Battery life is good, operation is reasonably easy, good feature set, beautiful screen.  Perhaps most impressive of all is the obvious feeling of "fineness" and quality.  It's not light as a feather or tiny; you *do* have to pay extra for one or two video drivers; and the user interface isn't perfect.  But it gets the job done, and I anticipate that we'll be happy with the 604 for quite a long time.

<Title>Dude, Sweeet!
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This Product is absolutely fab darlings! I've just recently bought my Archos and have had it now for about a month and am enjoying every inch of it. All the great things about it have been mentioned in the other reviews, but the thing that I just went ga-ga for is not having to pay to put movies on this thing. Also, I'm not a big fan of the questionable things we view in movies; every now and then I'd just like to watch a wholesome movie not tainted with drugs, sex, profanity, and violence. So when I'm recording movies on my Archos I like to do what movie makers call, "jump cuts," where I pause the recording when a scene in a movie comes up that I don't care for viewing, and resume recording when its over. So when I finally watch the movie, any contents I didn't want in it won't be. How cool is that?! Works out great with the kiddies.   The Archos doesn't hurt your pockets either. Again, as was mentioned before, its reasonably priced for all the things you can do with it unlike the ipod. Its funny cause each time I buy a media player or MP3 player I compare them to those rinky dink iPods, but they can never measure up. You buy an iPod for this price you get music, videos, and pictures. You by the Archos you get movies, TV shows, music, photos, digital camera connection capability, PDF capability (my favorite), audio recording (also my favorite), TV playback with the DVR dock station, or all these tarveling with the DVR Travel Dock. Is that a Steal or what?   The only things I didn't like about the Archos 604, which wasn't enough to make me get rid of it or not purchase it, is the fact that the buttons don't light up(making it hard to navigate at night or if you just happen to be in a dark area; this can be remedied by buying the Archos' with the touch screens), and it didn't have an FM tunner(not that it really needs this feature, but it couldn't hurt.).   I Compared the Archos to the Zen that I have by Creative. And I must say, although they're both great buys, I use my Archos the most. I don't see why more people don't use these as opposed to the iPod. And if it appears right now that I'm abasing ipod, I'm not. They're just not the better buy.

<Title>Get the dock
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this unit from Amazon last May and use it primarily for travel.  Before a trip, I choose some interesting movies from Netflix, pop the movie in my DVD player and record it to the Archos.  The screen is so nice that people sitting by me on airplanes ask about it.    Since I have used it for several months, I have some observations:  1.  With the dock (which, in my opinion, should be included with it), you can record directly from a DVD player or DVR.  I have recorded programs on my Dish Network DVR and then just played them later, recording them to the Archos.  2.  On an airplane, the audio is really too low (even at full blast) unless you have noise canceling headphones.  I tried the earbuds and could hardly hear my movies.  My Bose noise-canceling headphones give me a great experience with the Archos on an airplane.  3.  I subscribed to Urge subscription music, which was dovetailed with Windows Media Player 11, and subscription music worked fine.  I downloaded lots of subscription music to the Archos and as long as you did a sync at least once a month, the DRM dates would be updated by WMP automatically.  Alas, Urge merged with Rhapsody a few weeks ago and guess what?  Rhapsody is not compatible with the Archos.  Neither is Napster.  So if you use subscription music, this player isn't much good.  Obviously, your purchased music and CD rips work fine on it.  4.  I would like to see a better way to manage files on it.  Deleting files from it to make room on the hard drive is easy enough, but I haven't found a way to delete whole folders.  For example, I can easily delete individual songs from an album, but there's nothing on the menu that lets you delete the album all at once.  Little quirks like that make using it take some getting used to.    5.  It is a little heaver than most similar devices, and I haven't found it very good if I am walking or running ... a smaller mp3 player would be better for that.  But for video during travel, it can't be beat.  Overall, I consider this a good purchase and love my unit.  I bought an extra battery (video sucks battery pretty good, but I can generally watch at least 2 full-length movies before the battery dies) and the dock, and would highly recommend both purchases if you want to use this unit.  Of course that adds to the overall price so keep that in mind when comparing, at least if you want to get full functionality from it.

<Title>Great for watching movies, not so much for audio on the go.
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Archos 604 30gb for about 2 months now, and I've been using it practically every day.  It's a fantastic PVP, and when it comes to watching videos on the go, I think the screen size is right in the sweet spot.  Any smaller (I used to have a Zen Vision: M) and you tend to get eye strain or motion sickness; any bigger and it becomes too heavy.  Anyway, here are my major pros and cons:  Pros *Great screen! The resolution is not the highest out there, but the size and contrast keep videos looking great. I Compared it with my friend's Zen Vision and his resolution was a bit sharper, but the Archos' viewing angle was far superior.  *Audio quality is great, and audio enhancements like an EQ and Bass Boost are included.  *Nice option between Mass Storage Device or Win. Media device.  *Fantastic base price. Mine was a steal at $180 refurbished.   Cons: *Silly button layout that takes some getting used to and requires two hands (one to support the device, one to push buttons) to operate. Very difficult to operate blindly.  *Blasdesign. Ok let me be honest... It's just plain ugly compared to the slick curves of the Zen or iPod product lines.  *Limited video format support out of the box. You can purchase an upgrade for $20.  and the most nagging con... *DELICATE!! I know it has a spinning physical hard drive in there, but this thing is touchy to the point of frustration. Just the slightest tap or bump to the device while it's reading the drive will cause it to lock up, at which point you have to remove the battery (!) and press a Reset button with a pointy object. You don't lose any data except the time and date, but I must admit I feel pretty darn silly dismantling my device and resetting it in the train, on the street, at work, walking around, etc etc. I can honestly say it's crashed 40 - 50 times already in the past 2 months. I'm sure these crashes will destroy the drive eventually as well.  The bottom line: If you are like me and like to listen to music on the go, make sure you stuff this thing into the included case (at which point it's the size of a small book), or be ready for lots of hard disk lockups. But load this baby up with some TV episodes or Movies, find a nice comfy place to sit, and the Archos 604 with its great screen and adequate battery life (about 4 hrs) really shines.

<Title>Archos 604 is perfect for video on the go
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before buying this product, I was actually looking at other DVR's but I didn't like the fact that I could not record all content I can view on TV.  So pairing the Archos 604 with the docking station not only gave me the ability to record anything that I can view on my TV, it also gave me portability.  Another thing that drew me more toward this unit/dock combo, was the price.  Around $390.00 was an excellent price for the functionality and portability and a regular DVR will run you between $200.00 and $300.00.  All and All I throughly enjoy my Archos 604 but I didn't give it 5 stars becasue I expected the playback quality to be a little better when viewing on my TV.  Now I have to mention that I am using the Composite Video and Audio outputs (not the Component output) attached to a 40" SONY Bravia HDTV (KDL-40V2500) and this may be something I can correct by tweaking the settings and using Component video.  I'm not sure.  But viewing on the unit itself is CRYSTAL CLEAR!!!

<Content>This unit is great. Nice heft to it. Does not feel like a cheap platic toy. The size is pefect and while it is a bit too big for my pants pocket, it does fit.  The picture and video quality is perfect. The films do not lag or pixelate in the least bit. Very smooth and easy instructions that will soon become second nature to navigate. Files are loaded with a very easy drag-n-drop feature. The photo viewer and slideshow are very nice as well.  The only negatives I have is that the sound is horribly low (even at full volume) you will HAVE to use earphones or buy an small external speaker at Best Buy for a couple of bucks. Also, in order to play VOB files you MUST download a CINEMA plug-in for $19.99 from the ARCHOS web page. Very easy to install and set-up. I just don't understand wy this wasn't part ofthe program to start with. Kind of cheesy on their part.  Overall, if you love to watch TV or movies...you'll really like this unit. I haven't recieved my TV dock yet, so I can't comment on that.  So far...I am really enjoying this. :-)

<Title>Keep Your Receipt!
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I opened my Archos 604 package on January 11th, 2007.  The machine was sleek, sexy, the protective cover didn't have bubbles (so I just kept it on).  It was exciting.  After having read several reviews though, a part of me remained cautious.  I kept the packaging it came in, the reciept... everything.  Archos simply has terrible customer service, and you have to be prepared!  I let it charge for the 2+ hours it said on the instructions, loaded my music, photos, videos, everything!  It worked like a charm, and I loved it so much! With the PDF viewer, I used it as an eBook as well, taking along my favorite books, comics, heck even a D&D companion guide or two (or ten).  The date is now February 2, 2007.  I've had my archos for less than a month, and now it simply doesn't work.  The battery has always been charged according to the directions. I have installed the latest firmware, and exhausted all of the troubleshooting forums that google could scrounge up, and there is no hope.  The archos turns on, then shuts down after five seconds or less.  That said, why didn't I give it a score of 1?  Here's a list of pros and cons as I saw it.  Pros: * 4.3 inch scratch resistant screen with great viewing angle. * Ultra long battery life * Headphones in the package sound great with their own volume control * Gunmetal exterior is rather sexy * Will actually fit in your pocket  Cons: * Obviously... it doesnt work * Archos has terrible customer service * Navigation is not intuitive * Documentation is lacking * You have to buy accessories to access the device's potential * No FM radio  Overall, until it stopped working, I loved the device. So if you want to risk it, then risk it.  Just KEEP THE RECEIPT!  AND THE PACKAGING IT CAME IN! Make sure you review any return policy associated with the device, no matter who you buy it from.

<Title>Windows, step down. This OS is worse. More bugs than a jungle.
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am incredibly upset with my purchase of the Archos 604. Out of the box, this pseudo-entertainment center rocked and did everything it was supposed to, but about a month into the purchase loomed a very ugly problem. Cut to the chase, this product is horrible. If it's not suffering from one malfunction it will invent another. I've had so many "corrupt files" that I might blow my brains out. For whatever reason, this device likes to shut down in the middle of transferring to and from the computer, making it impossible to get a whole song on, much less a whole album.  Ah, but it gets worse. You only think it's working when all of a sudden it just freezes! Why? I have no clue! It takes forever to load all my songs because it uses a hard drive, it takes forever to find a song because the hard drive slows down when you try to file through 3000 songs, and it takes forever to get used to the HORRIBLE buttons on the side. Half the time I press the wrong button and then my song ends and I can't get the hard drive to load it back up! It drives me absolutely crazy!  Besides the horrible layout of the buttons, the speaker is next to worthless; if you crank up the volume all the way the speaker fizzles and gives you a horrible mess of a noise.  The only good thing is that the clarity of the screen is fantastic. It makes my images look crystal clear and my HD videos look as good as my HDTV. That is, if you can get the confounded thing to actually play my videos. Maybe I got a dud and I haven't tried contacting Archos, but I will asap. I thought I should let everyone know to stay away from this product as I know there are many others out there just like it. I even bought the DVR station (which is cool and would be perfect if the actual Archos would work) but I cannot say I'm pleased in any way with my purchase. I just hope I get some refund for this.

<Title>Returned because of major issues with PlaysForSure media
<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Note:  I updated this review because the problem is more serious than I thought earlier.  Amazon does not allow reviewers to change reviews to one star, but I would downgrade my rating if I could.  -------------------------  In some cases, I agree with many of the positive reviews given by other reviewers.  The screen is bright, the interface is intuitive, and most features work well.  However, since I bought the player I encountered an issue where I would plug the USB cable in, select "connect as Windows Media Device", and click OK.  When I opened Napster or tried to view files on the device, it crashed and rebooted to the ARCHOS logo.  I called tech support, which was very helpful, and they got an answer to me within two minutes: that the cause of my problems is that ARCHOS does not support Windows Media Player 11.  They require everyone to downgrade to WMP 10 and plan to address the issue in a "future firmware upgrade."  However, I downgraded to WMP 10 and the problem was not solved.  I called again and they said I had a defective product.  I returned it and got another, but the same problem exists.  I cannot use Napster with this player, and since I listen to music more than I watch videos, this device is useless to me.  I returned it for a refund and bought a Creative Zen Vision W instead.  It really is a shame.  This would by far be the best player on the market if ARCHOS would resolve their software issues.  As it is, though, there are just too many bugs to make this player worth purchasing.

<Title>Cool device, but connectivity problems 
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Archos 600 mostly for the picture- and video viewing and sharing ability - the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family. The device didn't disappoint - also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation. My opinion quickly changed when I ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it. While I was able to download and synchronize (via Windows Media Player) easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden wasn't recognized as a USB device anymore and also froze the "external hardware" management function on my PC.  Right now I cannot even connect using it simply as an external hard drive, and so far customer service at Archos has not been able to help me, blaming the problem on driver issues on my PC (seems to defy logic - works fine first and then without warning stops), a  really frustrating experience. Seems like this is along the lines of problems that another reviewer experienced, so this may not be as isolated as I thought.

<Title>100 stars
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know what these other reviews about it not working with windows media player are about, but I love this thing. I always connect it to my pc as a hard drive to add files to so maybe that's why mine doesn't crash on me. Anyway, the screen is like a little plasma tv. Not Exaggerating. Very Clear. The hard drive is more than enough space. I record movies from my dvd player (optional dvr station needed to do so, about 70 dollars at walmart) which on dvd is about 5 gigs, but when recorded to the archos its only about 1 gig for a 90 minute movie. Same when recording shows off the tv. If you are thinking about buying a ipod video, i highly suggest looking at a archos first. The only bad things about it are: you have to pay extra for the dvr function the protective bag that comes with it is useless it only charges by usb unless you have the dvr station the speaker is trash, but you can buy add on speakers  Thats about it though...everything else is very good. And also, if you want to play any video format other than avi, you have to download the plugins from their website and they charge like 20 dollars for it,,,,but if you are smart like me, all you need to do is download a free video converter from the net and just convert everything you need to avi. If you record from the dvr station (tv,dvd player,cable box,satellite,xbox 360,etc) then it automatically converts it to avi for you. I can go on and on about this thing, but my hands are getting tired. Please don't let these negative reviews about crashing with windows media player stop you from getting one..just don't use media player to sync your files. Just drag and drop like a regular hard drive. This is one of the best things i have ever bought.

<Title>Excellent Product. Would Recommend with some suggestions for ARCHOS
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own just about every tech device on this planet. My wife and I like to travel and I decided to pick up an ARCHOS 604 for her (so she would be able to watch her favorite shows at the airport). The pictures of this portable media player online does not do it justice. When I opened the box, I was surprised to see how sleek and cool it looked. It even felt good in my hands. The Wide Screen is awesome compared to my ipod and zune. I was also surprised at the sound of it when I used my earphones. Prior to buying the Archos, I read reviews about the soft sound and that it would be hard to listen while in an airport. I beg to differ. The sound is very good and the picture is quite phenomenal. I especially like the way they have the volume control on the ear pieces line. Very convenient! The only reason I did not rate this product as a 5 star is because of the way it is offered to the consumer. I had to separately buy: a better case, a dvr docking station and also had to buy the plug ins to play podcasts and other things on it. This device is so awesome with all of the optional accessories and plug-ins--However, Archos makes it inconvenient for the consumer when they don't include everything in a nice package (I am the type of consumer who likes to have everything ready to go out of the box!). Overall, I have to say it is a winner when combined with Amazon movie downloads and cinemanow. The multi functionality for the Archos makes it the only device you need for your vacations. Plays music, Captures your digital camera pictures and videos. Able to record live TV and back up your DVDs. I have read some reviews about the difficulty of using the graphic user interface and the difficult time people had using the navigation toggle controls--I must say that I don't find anything wrong with them. I am easily able to navigate and use the controls. Sure it is not as easy like an ipod or zune, but it is just as functional and I don't have any problems bringing up the movies, music or photos I want. After working on this Archos for my wife, I am seriously thinking about putting my ipod away and buying another Archos for me! I really recommend this portable media player. I think it is the best out on the market at this time.

<Title>Couldn't Have Choosen Better
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really did my homework before choosing this device, and I'm glad I did. It was time I jumped into the digital age, and for a brief moment I considered buying a video Ipod, but I quickly learned that Archos is the way to go for the movie/TV buff.   All of the great reviews for the Archos 604 stand true. I'm not the most tech savy person out there, and I have a very easy time utilizing all the features of my new toy. There's no software to install; just plug in the USB cord and go. It's user friendly in that the buttons are mostly intuitive, the drag-and-drop capability makes it simple to copy files from a PC, and navigating the menus are a snap. The LCD screen is beautiful. The picture is crisp and crystal clear even outdoors. The external speaker is a nice feature that a lot of other PMPs don't offer, and the sound is okay for what it is, but the headphones offer great quality. The volume control in the cord is awesome. I thought I was going to have to buy a storage case and was pleased to find that wasn't the case. The pouch that everyone hated so much has been replaced by a semi-hard case that envelopes the device. It holds it securely, leaving the headphone jack exposed for easy access. I haven't purchased the DVR docking station yet, but I'm excited to test it out.   Overall, I highly recommend this device. It's well worth the price for the pop-culture fan who's always on the go.

<Title>10 Stars!
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would give this product 10 stars if I could! I've had the unit for 4 months and have absolutely no complaints! I love love love it!  Riding the train to work = TV time. No more in my tent for 12 hours waiting for the sun. Just pull out the Archos and watch a TV show or a movie! Drag and drop your shows or tunes or any files onto the HD. No iTunes to "manage" your stuff. Plays many many formats! Man, I just love this thing! One of the best purchases I've ever made!  I'd buy it again and again. Buyers may want to pick up the 605 which will be out in Sept. which has a little better resolution. I'm such a fan I may pick one of those up too.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Functionally, this product is pretty sweet. It plays videos, the image looks great and the Cinema plug-in let me play broadcasts recorded on my PC with DirecTV.  However, I really bought it for the helmet-mount camera recording feature. And after recording several videos it stopped playing back music and video, would not connect to the computer or recharge and I had to send it in to be serviced. Their customer support has a very frustrating web interface - I wouldn't even bother with it because the info they ask for on the webform, they ask for again by e-mail. I had more success calling the toll free number and waiting for a live customer support person.  Anyhow, I just got my unit back. It was reformatted which I expected - lost many gig of ripped music but my bad, didn't make a backup. However they changed the internal product key (different from the firmware version or serial number) and the $30 Cinema plug-in is keyed to that. So the one I purchased and installed before doesn't work!!!  Hello???  Is anybody thinking up there? If you're going to charge for all these add-ons you should have the courtesty to reinstall them or at the very least enable me to reinstall them.  I just sent another e-mail to their customer support. We'll see what happens. If they can't make it right I will reduce my rating to 1 star. If they are somewhat responsive, maybe I'll bump it up to 3.  I'd like to recommend this product but I think they've spread themselves too thin and are still trying to work the bugs out of their products and support procedures. Maybe they'll get them right eventually.

<Title>Great personal media player
<Date>Wed Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great personal media player, I've used it to play movies, MP3 Music, and podcasts.  The sound quality it top notch, the video quality is beyond that.  If you are looking for a good all around personal media player, you can't go wrong with the Archos.  Another nice feature of this unit is that you can use it as an external USB2.0 hard drive.  I no longer use my thumb drive, I just carry this around with me, and keep my key files on it.

<Title>Excellent Video, Poor Audio
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Video display is excellent even when seen at 45 degrees angle, excellent recording and was even able to record movies I rented from Netflix. I have no technical problems with the unit I got. From personal experience the 30 gb unit could only hold no more than 15 full length 2 hour movies. The only negative comment is the very poor audio. I was on a plane trip to the orient and was very disappointed that I did not heed someone's advise to buy a noise cancelling earphone. An earplug type would be useless. The audio of my home movies was so much better. If you plan on recording rented movies there is no need to buy anything else but the base station which I used to transfer photos, music and home movies. I consider this unit useless without the base station. This product is highly recommended but don't forget to buy the noise cancelling earphones for long plane trips to enjoy your videos.

<Title>Not an iPod Rival
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, this is nothing like an iPod. Archos cleverly are staying away from that battle and seem to be ploughing their own furrow with a portable media center as opposed to a pocket music player. To be honest if you are looking for something to listen too as you head to work then pick a Creative Zen or an iPod. If you travel a lot and get stuck in airports or long haul flights, then this is the beans. Video quality is excellent and the screen is well big enough not to be tiring. It will play pretty much everything although you have to buy a plug in if you want to record in anything but mpeg4. Doesn't seem to be much of an issue to me. I bought the optional DVR station and it does give the unit a bunch more flexibility and worth the few quid it cost. I also bought an additional battery - should give me enough to deal with one long haul flight of around ten hours video. One thing to note for those who don't live in the USA like me, you can choose to record and play in Pal rather than NTSC if you wish, which makes this a pretty flexible bit of gear. For the price it is just stunningly good value and well made with an aluminium case. I don't think it would take a big knock like my Zen has on occasion, but I guess it shouldn't be dropped. I did buy the foldaway case which but to be honest it's not much better than the supplied one with the only advantage being that it (precariously) will allow the player to stand at a viewing angle. If you want a totally flexible media player and recorder in a small package then this is it.

<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I concur with all the positive reviews on this product. But with such a small, thin battery, why not a wall charger (such as comes with all Canon cameras). Archos does not even have an email address online for suggestions like these.
