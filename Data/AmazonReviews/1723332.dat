<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>+ The most important: the SOUND is great (iAudio/Cowon is well know for it). + The resolution of the SCREEN is awesome (better than I expected) and to be able to watch movies in a "widescreen" format is great. + RECORDING from TV is very good, you see it on the A2 like you see it on your TV and it has a feature that lets you program the start-time/end-time of your recording (kind of like TiVo) + The NAVIGATION MENU is very intuitive; my friends use it right away the first time they get their hands on it without the need for explaining. + You'll find the built-in speaker useful sometimes, and they sound loud despite of being small.  - The CARRYING CASE is made out of leather, looks good, but it doesn't provide any protection for the screen, and doesn't have a belt clip. - You might find it a little heavy, but JUST a first (is only a couple of oz more than other PMPs).  A few tips: * You don't have to install the software (which I found useful) if you don't want to, just drag & drop your files using the windows explorer. * Download the DivX movie converter [...]. * Get the "zCover echo for COWON A2" it's great for protecting your A2 and specially the screen (which is the best feature of the player) * There's a remote control available for the A2 (sold separately) which lets you do a lot of things without getting your A2 out of your pocket.  So why getting the A2 instead of an 80GB iPod which is only worth a few more dollars BIGGER SCREEN, lots of useful features (radio, voice/radio/TV recording, download pictures directly for digital cameras, could be easily used as an external Hard Drive). And finally because it has pre-installed Codecs to play almost  all movie and musics files, this will SAVE YOU TIME, just put in the files and enjoy.  ***Keep in mind that this is a Portable Multimedia Player (PMP) so you should get it if you like downloading music videos and have a lot of photos to show to your friends or like to watch movies every time you have a few minutes to spare. If 90% of the time all you do is listen to music and your music library is small, you should just get a 4GB or 8GB smaller and more portable player***

<Content>It seems that Jet Audio may have spammed the jet audio reviews with "quick delivery" items.  I've been waiting 2+ weeks for the Cowon A2 after ordering from Jet.  And getting through to customer service...grab a snickers...  UPDATE:  Dec 14, 2006  Well, we did finally receive the Unit about 3 weeks later than expected...but at least it did arrive!    As for the A2. It's a gem.  Bright, crisp screen and powerful sound output when played through car stereo.  The other reviewers have summed things up well (multi file format support is so nice).  The A2 is highly recommended...

<Title>A great device - particularly nice for cardio workouts
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I workout at an LA Fitness where at least one out of two people have ipods of some variety strapped to some portion of their body.  I couldn't believe that ipod was the best tech out there and I didn't want to be locked into itunes or any other proprietary systems.  That said, I got the A2 with the specific intention of 1) listening to mp3s through my cars stereo and my home stereo and 2) watching shows while doing cardiovascular exercise.  For both of these things, the A2 has been a huge success.  Not only can I watch episodes of South Park while on a bike or an elliptical machine (and I assume running, as well, but my knees forbid it), but if I want, I can switch over to FM where it autoscans the entire FM band in about 10 seconds and picks up all the TVs that are in the gym.  If I'm still not amused, I have my entire music collection.  Not that this is at all a reason to get the A2, but you certainly will feel the ipod envy at the gym from others around you.  I haven't used it for weight training yet (as in, listening to music while weight training), but I don't see this as being a problem as long as you have pockets.  You do pay a price for the 4 inch screen and long battery life - the price is size. [...] - it includes some side by side pics of the A2 with other popular devices (ipod, for example).  The size is not a problem for me but it's something you should, of course, keep in mind before making a purchase.  Outside of the gym, the device has performed excellently.  It's interaction with my PC is simple - just like any other plug and play device, so no proprietary programs.  I haven't even installed the stuff that came with the device as I haven't yet needed it.    The sound quality of the A2 is superb in my car stereo or with headphones and I have also used it to watch shows or movies through the AV out on my TV at home - the picture is great.  Battery life has not been a problem (and I don't think it will be).  [...]  Update: Used it as a VCR last night to record The Office - worked great.  Quality is about the same as a VHS tape when you replay it on your TV, but for purposes of recording shows and watching them at your convenience, it's plenty good enough for me.

<Title>most fun toy ever!
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my A2 for about a month now and I absolutely love it. I've been using a dell DJ almost 3 years now and was ready for something a little more robust. After lots of research, I settled on the A2 and it didn't disappoint. The video quality is excellent. I can keep myself amused with hours of everything from Friends to Harry Potter while logging mile upon mile on the treadmill (the battery life is excellent). Transferring files from the computer to the A2 couldn't be easier. No software required. The joystick is still taking some getting used to, but it's a small price to pay for this little gem. The external speakers are decent if you're in a quiet room, otherwise headphones are definitely required.

<Title>1 year and counting...
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well after more than a year of using my A2, I still love it very much. I use it everyday at work where I listen to music at my desk (battery life still nearly 17 hours audio only). I travel frequently and love how it works so well playing music through car stereo or into headphone for the airplane. The hard drive is handy for moving files off the camera, as well as for when I can't seem to find my USB drive. I enjoy the oohs and ahhs from coworkers and pilots walking by when they see my own background image up, or a series of music videos or a movie rolling. The connectivity is simple and no programs are required since it shows up like an additional hard drive. I even formatted it and loaded the menus from scratch without any trouble. Very easy to use regardless of the gadget factor. I love recording my DVDs for the road, as well as my favorite tv shows, with no quality problems. Video playback is always smooth and all audio file sound as if I were listening to them at my home computer. The protective cover leaves the ports and buttons open for easy access and makes a great handle or stand. Don't worry about drops or knocking it over, usually turn off, and on again, plays just fine (even dropped from about 4.5ft up while on and playing video!). I bought my dad a Creative Zen portable media center, and he still can't keep his hands off my A2. Even my completely technically challened girlfriend loves playing with it while we drive.

<Title>stop doing research this is the one....no doubt
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>after 2 weeks looking at every word written on the portable media players out there the COWON A2 is the most bang for the buck. I LOVE IT. this is the coolest little thing any media junkie could want. i have my favorite movies, music,pictures,auido books...etc right in my hands, my car..everywhere i go. this is hands down an ipod killer. there is other players out there with similar features..namely the ARCHOS line of products..the cowon in my opinion is made better...has cooler features and is more versitile than the archos line.ive had no problems at all with this machine.it performs all tasks with no problem..the firmware update is great and super easy to do.the jet shell software is great and very usefull for working with your files. if there was anything to say it would be that out of 1000 possible corrupted files maybe 1 or 2 agrivates the cowon(it may freeze) and you have to shut it off an put it back on, which in the big picture of electronics is pretty expectable.i bought the arkon car mount for it and now i have mobile video for those long trips or snail crawl traffic days. for the car i figured it would be great to get a bunch of music videos since you cant really watch a movie and drive this is a great option. anyone that see's this thing is amazed by it. most people think all there is are ipods or rip offs of ipods out there.boy are they wrong. also i was worried that if i bought this somthing better would come out soon and make this look elementry,but this is not the case.its so far ahead that it will usable for years.its all you need. if somthing else comes out you wont worry because your already happy with your a2. besides look at all the poor ipod sheep...baaaaaa. make way for the lion called cowon

<Title>Video iPods bow before the a2...
<Date>Fri Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did all the research and this is by far the best PMP out there.  Pros -Excellent screen with high resolution and wide viewing angle -Plays tons of different video formats -Extremely good battery life -Neat video output.  Plenty of times I've been over at friends house at whipped out the A2, plugged the component cables into the TV, and watched movies. -16:9 widescreen is a MUST for movies.  On 4:3 PMP screens you actually lose alot of screen because so many movies are in letterbox format.  But with the A2 every ounce of the screen is put to use. -Tons of extras  Oks: -Some think that 30gb is too small, however I find it quite satisfactory.  Of course you can't put EVERYTING you own on it, but do you really need to do that.   Put a movie on the A2, watch, then replace it with another.  Cons: With the included pleather case (which is nice and protects the screen) attached its a bit bulky...but it cannot helped because of the screen size.  Its still very portable though, especially during jacket weather.

<Title>Why would you want an Ipod?
<Date>Fri Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had very specific criteria when I was looking for my next MP3 player.  It had to have  1)at least a 29gb hard drive, 40GB preferred 2)no software necessary to transfer files, and no restrictions on transferring or playing files 3)video capability without a complicated encoding program 4)built in microphone  For these features, I was willing to pay up to about $400.  My Cowon A2 cost about $270 and met all my expectations.  You don't need to install iTunes, or any other crummy software- you just plug it into any computer with a USB 2.0 port and treat it like a hard drive.  You can put anything you want on there, and hook it up whenever you need it without any software.  The screen is excellent for watching short videos, and it has speakers so you can show other people without needing to pass headphones around.  Even better, it has TV out through a standard a/v cable (like you use with a camcorder to a tv) so you can show your videos on someone else's TV!  It even has a/v in so you can record into it.  I used the a/v in to set up a wireless surveillance system at work.  The battery life is excellent, navigation is easy and intuitive, and the case that comes with the A2 does a fine job of protecting it from scratches.  And ironically, even though I could care less about brand appeal or trendiness, everyone that sees this thing wants to know what it is, and when I show them what it can do, they're always surprised.  I cannot say enough good things about this product.  If you are a power user looking for a media player, you will not regret buying the Cowon A2.

<Title>Worst customer service ever!
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, I wish I had done a little more testing of this unit before the 30 day Amazon return period was up. Tried it out and was very satisfied with the picture quality and sound through the demos. After owning it for about 5 weeks, finally loaded music on it and took a road bike trip for about 4 hours. Battery died at 3.5 hours. Fully charged it up and tried again, this time dead in an hour. Charged again and did a test playing only music, made it about 10 hours this time. Haven't found anyone else in the reviews who has had this problem. The spec says 18 hours of audio and this is due to the larger battery. Never tried the video. Tried contacting CowonAmerica through email, phone and signing up for their online help site. They have to verify your email address before you can enter the site. Got a email verification back and tried to logon, no luck, said email address was not verified even though the email I received from them said it was. I was not willing to take the risk of NO CUSTOMER SERVICE for a device I paid over 300.00 for. I loved the A2 when it worked, easy to load music, great sound, and the video demo was crystal clear. Sent it back to Amazon for a partial refund and will probably buy an Archos, as I was able to contact their service department by phone in about 30 seconds. Great machine bummer service.

<Title>An Awesome Personal Video Player!
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Because I hate boredom when I travel, and I have a lot of digital media, I decided to look for a personal video player. Through a lot of searching, I stumbled onto the Cowon A2. While I had never heard of the company before, its screen size, build quality, video support, long battery life, and positive reviews all convinced me to try it out. Here's what I've discovered:  Pros -- Excellent video quality -- Plays XVID/DVIX files up to 720p -- Awesome sound quality; comes with BBE sound processing (which is really cool) -- Nearly 10 hour battery life when watching videos; even more when just listening to audio -- Comes with a radio -- Can act as a host for other devices (MP3 player, camera, etc.) -- Build quality is very good -- Supplied power adapter is 110V - 220V, despite the fact that the plug says that it is only 110V -- Unit allows you to start watching your videos where you left off if you open files from the "Recent Files" section of the menu  Cons -- GUI is okay; it isn't as intuitive or fast as I'd like -- Joystick's center button isn't easy to press; but after some practice, you get better at it -- Volume can take a couple of seconds to react to your input when you are watching videos -- Fast forward and rewind is non-linear and can quickly zip to the very end or beginning of a video file (respectively); stopping exactly where you want to takes some practice and intuition -- Not great for MP3s; the audio quality and interface are excellent, but the player itself isn't the most convenient way to move through your music without looking at it -- At some point, a few small particles of dust will find their way under the display's glass screen; but this is only visible when display is viewed under direct sunlight -- Watching video in direct sunlight is next to impossible  Despite the cons, which are annoying, I truly love this player. On trips across the Atlantic I can watch movies for the entire 9 hour flight and still have some battery life left. Personally, I would only recommend this player to other people looking for a PVP (if you listen mostly to MP3s, then I would recommend a dedicated MP3 player). All the other video players either have poor battery life or require you to convert all of your XVID/DVIX files to their proprietary video standard, which takes time. So, with the Cowon A2, if you have a lot of XVID or DIVX videos you can simply place them on the hard drive and watch them. However, if you do come across a standard that isn't supported, Cowon does include a free video converter. All things considered, you shouldn't be upset with this player.

<Title>Excellent PMP, but relatively hard to find.
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this item for my girlfriend for her birthday back in May and have used it a bit myself(mostly reading ebooks, but also the occasional tv show/movie). She loves the thing. She hooks it up to the TV using the supplied composite/RCA cables and watches/records shows. She brings it to work and listens to music, and store data on it. Since it supports so mnay codecs its great as a music player but it is quite bulky/heavy compared to an ipod, but, of course, it isn't marketed against the ipod/SSD based media players.  The screen quality is, to me, unreal. Best lcd screen I've ever seen. NO ghosting/artifacts, even during fast motion. Nice vivid colors, and even good contrast(for an lcd). Of course, glossy screen helps the colors stand out, but it can also increase glare, though I've not had that problem, even while riding in a car during daytime(in the passenger seat, of course!).  The speakers aren't terrible, but they can sound a bit tinny (though not as much as I had expected). Still, I've heard worse speakers on laptops, and you can always plugin the adequate, though uncomfortable, supplied earphones.  The thing that really surprised me, however, was the quality of the video-out. Truly excellent! I don't know if there is some upscaler included(though I seriously doubt it), but video comes out looking as good as broadcast(ditto on recording from the tv with it).  Now, while the video was excellent, the sound was disappointing. The tv-out jack has the three sections you would expect from a regular RCA connection(composite video, left &  right audio), but I swear the sound  that the tv output was monoaural, but not just that, it sounded like the actors were speaking from inside a large drum, with a sort of cavernous/echoey/tinny quality that's a bit hard to describe but results in sound that, to my ears, has greatly reduced dynamism/range.  Now, since I haven't used this as much as my gf her thoughts, or at least her complaints, what I can recall of them, would probably be useful. From my recollections, her only complaints are that it doesn't support pdf (this bugs me as well, since you have to convert ebooks to .txt format{i.e., basically no formatting] and you end up with words wrapped over two lines, and footnotes appearing in the middle of a page, etc.), and the hd/battery are not upgradable. Now the hd isn't really much of an issue since she's got many seasons of various shows on it, along with copious music files and books, not to mention the raw data she has on it(I believe she's got a few linux distros stored in it), and she still has many GB of space. The battery, thus far, hasn't been an issue but it's only been cycled, I'd estimate, maybe 100-150 times at most, so maybe in 2 or 3 more years it'll show some wear, but right now you can watch something for about 4-6 hours on a charge, and read a book for around twice as long (you can probably extend it if you turn down the brightness). She also loves the gui. She took to it immediately, and moves about it rapidly.  For my part, I'm not fond of the joystick/button. I find myself navigating the menus and accidently pressing down on the joystick and thereby activating a movie, opening a book, etc. Also, the joystick itself I find a bit slippery, as though my finger will slip off it and punch a hole in the screen (no, I'm not pressing THAT hard, but that is the image that comes to mind). A small mod could fix that bit, however.  Those few nitpicks aside, this is a great PMP, though I have little to compare it to(basically just laptops, and a few portable dvd players that my niece and nephews have), but when I was shopping around for a PMP the things that stood out to me regarding this unit over an Archos were: the fantastic number of codecs that are supported, the near constant firmware updates(I'm still waiting on that pdf update, dammit!), the relatively low price(at the time), and the user(NOT editor) reviews I'd found around the web.

The picture is very clear and colorful and the 30gb hard drive has proven to be more than enough. I use clonedvd to mobile to convert all my movies without any  compatability issues. Very simple drag and drop . I really enjoy the ability to record directly from the satellite with time recording. I would have given the unit 5 stars if the TV function would work in the US.

<Content>I was skeptical when I bought this that the battery life could possibly be as good as they say.  It is. I managed to have videos nearly the entirety of a flight to Hong Kong.  My only complaints are that it can't charge through USB while playing and the battery isn't removable. That means, you can't use an external battery to charge/power it once the internal one dies. But, considering the stellar batter life of the internal, that's not a big problem.

<Title>Such highs. Such lows.
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'll try to be frugal with my words, since I'm sure that most just want the pros and cons.  Pros: -Best codec support for portable device. -Excellent sound quality for portable. -Excellent display quality. -Larger HD than most. -Bundled JetAudio software is robust and great, when it works...  Cons: -Unit began locking up after only a few weeks, and upon reformatting and sending to Cowon, I was informed that they could not replicate the problem (which was odd, because it would happen several times daily when I listened to FLACs).  **I reformatted again, and have had it lock up only twice in the months since. -Somewhat bulky, but what can one expect, given HD and display size? -HD is larger than most, but not nearly large enough.  Unless I want to upload files 2-5 times per week, I'd prefer a minimum of 250 GB. -No WiFi. -Navigation is no picnic.  I don't mind the controls too much, but menu navigation is poorly designed, and menus display file names rather than tags, causing files with long names to be truncated in the menu. -Recent files list is not best method.  The player stores a list of your 10 most recent files played, bookmarked at the stop point.  What would be better is bookmarking the stop point of every file played. -Screen is impossible to view in daylight (but I've yet to see one that isn't) -JetAudio software crashes my PC 25% of the time that I use it (to the point that it requires reboot). -Line-out A/V quality leaves much to be desired.  Using headphone stereo output as line-out to receiver sounds better than the provided A/V output.

<Title>Best PMP in the World!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research of the best personal multimedia player. I considered buying Ipod, Creative Zen and Archos as great competitors of this Cowon A2. I got the 30gb. The reviews not only Amazon but also other website caught my attention. After a year of research,  I finally took the risk of buying something not even so popular in the public. This Cowon A2 PMP is the easiest little machine to maneuver even in recording videos, movies, transfering songs, files is a breeze; it is so easy! no extra software needed;  even a first grader can easily understand the set up of its buttons.  I did not even read the manual and I am not a technology person,  but when I received my Cowon A2, I started playing with it right away upon taking out of the box. Its button set up is very straight forward. The sound quality is amazing! I LOVE MY COWON A2 SO MUCH! It is not cheap, but I now understand why?  Although, I wish someday, they will make a Cowon with 100gb and has the ability to take digital still pictures as well. Highly recommended item! jd.

<Title>Slim, Compact and perhaps the Future of Portable Entertainment
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My daughter just saw my A2 for the first time, (she's 22) and BEGGED my to buy her one. So much for first impressions. The unit is small and sleek and easily transported in a pocket or purse. But let's begin with the manual. It's flawed, to say the least. It doesn't explain all the functions and fails to address several issues.       For example, it shows an item called a DMB and a tv logo. But this is for a Korean who wants to access a tv signal in Seoul. Since I'm in Arizona, that's a problem. The main function button allows things like fast forwarding of videos, yet this is not even mentioned. The manual type is very small and hard to read. The illustrations, likewise. But the player is pretty intuitive to use and playing with it for a while allows you to figure out most of the functions.       Now for the best parts. The screen is crisp and clear. Downloading  from a DVD player or the tv is easy. I can also copy a DVD to my computer and download using the USB to the A2. And I have a Mac, which they says won't work with the software. W-R-O-N-G! It works just fine with my iMac G4 without any special softwware. Downloading does take a while, but so what? You can move items into folders and rename them at will. I dumped the Korean subway maps that are included as photos and popped in my own photographs in the jpg format.       I also have a tip: download the manual in PDF from their website, convert it to a txt file, and move it into the text folder. Then you'll have it on the screen if needed. I figure you can load about 28 2-hour DVD movies and 500 mp3's, which are also a breeze to load. And still I have room for 100's of photos. The sound through the earphones is good and better with better earphones. I can't wait to take it  on airplane trips to avoid the in-flight movies and pick from dozens of my own, played on MY schedule.      A final word. It would have gotten 5 stars if not for the poor manual and tech support guy, who told me it wouldn't work on Macs and not to even try. I did a lot of research before choosing the A2 for it's size, price and features. I wasn't disappointed and if I ever am, a know a certain girl that will love to inherit it.

<Title>The Best Player EVER!!!
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player at the end of last year, and I must say I was HIGHLY impressed.  I carried it EVERYWHERE I went and used it for EVERYTHING!!  Some of the many uses were: -Recording movies and shows from the TV -Holding my files for protable storage -Holding my many many many music files (sorted by artist and type...made easy by folder use) -Reading Dante's Inferno in TXT format -Showing off pictures if my kiddies!! -Watching Sponge Bob The Movie and Bambi using the built in speaker on the LONG trips to grandma's house -Blasting music while cleaning (bought some computer speakers for 20 bucks and WOW!!) -Uploading TV shows on YOUTUBE -Burning DVD's and putting them on the player to view...  Now you may ask why I said in the beginning that I WAS highly impressed...turns out some kids thought it was a PSP and stole it from my bag when I went to use the restroom one day...  I was very very very sad and upset...  But after having an IPOD video with it's awful battery life (this A2 can really really last!!) I cannot go back to ANYTHING else.  I will be buying another one...but this time a 30 GB instead of a 20.. ;-)  Oh and everything you need comes with it..unlike other products (cough cough IPOD)where you have to buy everything seperately...  A++++++++++!!!!

<Title>DOA Sorta - Tech support non-existant
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice picture. Lots of features. Long battery life (sorta, see below). Easy to use. Pushing down on the joystick to select items is a little hard. Sometimes the selecter would move to another item instead of selecting the item that I already had highlighted.  My boyfriend and I bought these for each other for Christmas. We went ahead and started playing with them when they arrived two days ago. They got here about 7pm. We charged them until the light went out which indicated that they were full. Then we upgraded them per the instructions provided. We loaded them up with video/movies. Watched about an 1.5 hours of shows. Shut off the device. In the morning it had 4/4 bars on the battery. I watched 2.5hrs of stuff. Battery was then at 2/4. Turned it off and set it down. Came back 2 hours later and it was dead. So it died in less than 24hrs.  After trying lots of stuff it is still a brick. I cannot reach tech support as their phone number gives you a recording that says use their website. I was never able to get anyone on the "Live Support Chat". I created a ticket on their site which hasn't been addressed yet.   I am very disappointed with this device and especially with their support. I do not like nor do I have time to sit at my computer for hours waiting for them to answer the live chat request. Atleast with phone support I can carry it around and do other things while I wait.  DOAs do happen. I understand that. Its the support you receive afterwards that counts when it does.

<Title>Awesome Player!!  The Best Ever!!
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved the A2 for Christmas and it is the best player ever!!  I was able to upgrade the firmware in just minutes and load music without ever opening the manual.  The screen is just unbelievable, great colors and the sound quality is something I haven't ever had before.  I also have an older Archos product that I thought was great, but Cowon rocks.

<Title>Exceded expectations
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I looked at a number of different players before settling on the Cowon, which I had never heard of before.  I had been looking for a way to "offload" shows from my Tivo, and this player works great.  I just record directly into the player, and then burn to CD.  The CD plays directly on my Philips DVD player.  I also download video podcasts off the net, then play them on the TV through the player, or just use the case as a stand, and watch them (or Tv shows) on my breaks at work.  I listen to podcasts most of the day, and the battery rarely goes down 1 "bar".  The screen is large and clear enough to "show off" anything I have recorded.  I live in the boondocks, so directly comparing was imposable, but I must say that this is the rare electronic item (other than my tivo) that was even better than I thought it might be. I also use Linux most of the time, and this player works well, playing all my OGG files. There are a few "cons".  The joystick is aggravating when you are pushing in, and end up nudging one way or the other.  It might be easier for a right hander.  But once you get used to it, it works.  Also, I have audio sync problems on some WMV files, Xvid and Divx work much better.  Be aware that it won't play .mov or .mp4 either.  Be sure to do the upgrades, and use the "recently played" as a great bookmark, especially when you listen to long podcasts.

<Title>The Best player/recorder 
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player for Christmas and , I must say it was all everyone said and more . It has a super picture and great playback of music and videos , so far I haven't put any pictures on it but I'm sure they will be impressive also . The only con was trying to download movies from my computer , I never got them to download , it came up with errors and I gave up , but I plugged into my dvd player and it was a piece of cake , plus it only took about 800mb compared to 6gb from the computer .

<Title>good pmp
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>+ plays most video and audio (inc. FLAC) formats + nice display + long battery life + fast hard disk + very nice interface + frequent firmware updates with new functions + very good user support, inc. unoficial sites  - too big for a shirt socket - comes without a remote - reads id3 tags but arranges the files only by names, directories or playlists  - joystick (time will show how much will it last) - no real time volume normalizing (some players have it)  summary: real nice PMP. very happy with this product. meets most           expectations. -
