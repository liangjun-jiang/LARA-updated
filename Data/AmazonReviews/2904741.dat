<Content>Great place to keep all of your CD's! I only have 755 songs at this time, and the IPOD will play continuously for 1.7 days without repleating a song! And I'm only using 2.6 GB! Easy to use--nice player!

<Title>Amazing Player
<Date>Tue Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I own the 3rd Generation iPod with the buttons on it and it's amazing. My brother owns this new 4th Generation iPod and it is also amazing. It doesn't come with the dock, however, this is not a much needed accesory. You can still transfer songs onto it and charge it if you use the firewire cable. Amazing MP3 player. It holds 5,000 songs- something you're not going to fill up anytime soon. Mine has about 900 on it and I've had it a year now. Once again amazing product, stop by the store and pick one up for yourself. You'll be doing yourself a favor!

<Title>Excellent Purchase

<Content>I bought an iPod at the Target store that I work at and I love the thing.  I had an old Archos MP3 player that didn't even update itself.  This is so easy to use and charges so fast that you don't even have to think about it. Get one...

<Title>Simply the best.

<Content>The Apple iPod is simply the best choice for anyone living a digital lifestyle. Fit, form and function soar above the competition. Should be on everyone's Christmas Wish List for 2004. I use mine for music, calendars, todo lists, reminders, alarms, backups, and carrying files to read in the Target check-out line.

<Content>I just recently turned fifteen and for my birthday my parents bought me a Sumsung Yepp 256mb mp3 player. it was good with its small design and ease of use, but when it started making noises, i immiediately returned it. I had been saving up money for a new digital camera ,but instead decided to use it on buying my first ever iPod. It's only been a month now and ive already got about 400 songs on it, and i can still fit 4600 more! i like the blazing fast data transfers and ease of use. the click wheel is by far the coolest thing on this 20gb mp3 player. i wasnt happy that the dock isnt included, but rest assured, its on my christmas list. i would highly recomend purchasing this if you are looking for an easy to use, all around good mp3 player.

<Title>Good mp3 player
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you are looking for a real good mp3 player, this is the one to get! It has everything i am looking for. First off it has a 20gb hard drive which can store 5,000 songs. my iTunes playlist has at least 600 hundred songs! second it has the new click-wheel which makes things much more easier to manuver around. the 3rd gen. iPod is real nice too but i don't like that the play, pause, stop buttons are at the top. finally the design is really high-tech looking. It has a nice white coating on the front and a metal finish at the back. it's thin as ever now also! i bought this for my wife for christmas but i also bought one for me too! these 20gb were sold out evrywhere!

<Title>This is a great iPod!!!

<Content>After buying my iPod at the Myrtle Beach, SC Target store, I am very, very impressed with this iPod.  Downloading songs from both CD's and from itunes is a piece of cake.  I have almost quit listening the radio in my car during my daily commutes. I've found it easier to use the itunes music cards than a regular credit card to download musicon Apple's website.  I really like the FM adapter that  I purchased at the store and the ipod player case is a perfect fit.  I just wish that Target carried more accessories like the remote control and the cigarrette lighter adapter.  I got to that my brother, Iman, that works at Target in Louisville, KY for talking me into buying the 20GB iPod instead of the mini!
