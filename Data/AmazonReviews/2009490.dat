<Title>Great little multimedia player
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player in a good deal on e-bay and have been using it for about 5 months now.  The size of the player is just enough to slide it into the shirt pocket.  The screen in this player is big enough.  Double the size of an iPod.  The resolution is a bit low for such a big screen.  It looks pixalated when watching the player very close to the eyes.  But does not matter, the picture is clearer when at a distance.  The interface and the two way buttons on the right are easy to use.  It has got a tiny speaker.  The sound from this speaker is not loud enough but is good to hear in a silent room.  The headphone provided with this unit is of very low quality.  I'm using a Sony MDR-EX51LP headphone which sounds great.  The equalizer in this unit is not very effective.  It does not produce a sound that of a Creative, but the bass in this unit is good.  The unit is capable of playing only a few formats of video out from factory.  Incase you want other video compatiblity, the plug-ins need to be purchased seperately and installed on the player.  I have installed both the Podcast and Movie plug-ins in my unit.  Even then the player does not support some video formats like older versions of WMV like verion 8 and below.  It only supports WMV 9.  This I feel is a major drawback since most of the videos I download form the internet is of WMV8 format and it is not supported by the player even with the plug-ins installed.  The unit comes with a USB cable to connect to the PC.  The connector on the player side is a propretory connector.  Other universal USB cables could not be used with the player.  But, with the DVR Docking Station universal USB cable could be used.  One of the excellent feature of the player is its cabability to record video from any source and playback video.  The DVR Docking Station (to be purchased seperately) is required inorder to make use of this feature.  With the docking station, I'm able to record video from TV and charge the unit at the same time.  It is also useful to playback the recorded video in TV through the video/audio out in the docking station.  I'm not sure if the travel adapter could be used to record video from TV.  But the DVR Docking Station does it all and it also comes with a remote control to operate the player.  This unit also records sound through a tiny inbuilt microphone.  The sound quality of the recorded audio is good.  The player comes with a leather sliding case which is decent.  But you will need to take the player out of the case to watch video and adjust controls.  The case does not have a window to expose the screen or the buttons on the player.  And also when I try to play a MOV video file from a DVD, there is no option to change the language.  It just plays the audio in some language which is not default to the region of the DVD.  Overall this player is good for its video recording and playback capabilities.  This is something that the iPods, Creative Zens and Others cannot do.  Highly recommended if you are looking for this feature in a multimedia player.

<Title>RUN AWAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PLAYER, PLEASE
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't buy it if you don't have time and energy to figure out how to turn it on right off the box. I got my today. After 3 hours of charging, it doesn't bother to be on. I am calling Archos while I type this review. There is no help from them at all ( "your call is important to us...." but I have been waiting for 68 minutes). Why they don't pick the damn phone to talk to me. That is suck!!!  Never buy anything from Archos again. Piece of crab. Run away from it as far as you can, please. Give up on this player. Don't waste your time and money like me!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Really 4.5 Stars
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great Multi-Media player. Huge screen for such a portable size. Easy to use. Decent sized hard drive lets me store all the music, video, as well as store a lot of work-related data. Can also read pdf's though this feature slow as each page loads seperatly. Also with accessories can record and playback to your tv. Very nice. The player is recognized as a hard drive so you can just drag and drop files in windows explorer. In other words you don't have to install fascist software that takes over all the media on your PC and controls what you do with it.   As has been said the internal speaker is terrible, but headphones or portalble speakers fix that. Also, to play .mov and a few other formats requires you to pay more for plugins. You should not have to pay more for your media player to play media!   Overall it is very good.

<Title>Archos devices for do it for yoursleves
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device is perfect for those who really know how to use a computer, so on that note, I am sorry apple users. The company gives you the option to synchronize with Windows Media Player 10 or higher, but it is not essential. Just drag and drop files into the folders inside external drive icon.  It can play several file formats like mp3, wma, wmv, and whatever else. It can't play an astonishing number and you need plugins for a couple of encoded formats, which you can purchase from the company. DON'T WHANT TO? Well then how bout you open the file in a media editing software and render it again in wmv, or wma and compressed it to a 75%(save some space)...It is not that hard People, one of the biggest complaints are that it doesn't play the podcast files you got or something like. Well if you are expecting to let the magic of technology do everything for you then you have a problem with this device, LEARN HOW TO DO SOMETHING YOURSELF!!!!!!  Not everything is Wonderful with this particular model. The 404 has a built in battery, like the ipod when it goes down you have to pay to repair the thing. TigerDirect did a poor job handling my order and return so after I returned it and upgraded with Amazon to a 604 Wifi, for 19 dollars more!!!!! and it has a replacesable battery, so if your battery breaks then buy another one, it is cheaper.  Nice things about the device: Really powerful accesories, The optional port is a great thing to use for do it yourselves.PDF file reader (I got French and Italian comics, e-books and magazine articles in pdf format), if you want all that then again learn to use Adobe Acrobat people!!!! A built in microphone records straight into the hard drive, good for when I am on meetings or critiques.  Archos company: Archos has been making portable devices for 20 years, other than sony and some other giants there aren't a lot of people that can say that.  Again Learn to do some things yourself. This is something not only important for this but for everything else in your life.

<Title>Archos 404 All Around Good PVP+MP3 Player.
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well, I got my Archos 404 30GB about two weeks ago, and as of this point, I'm in love with this little device. It works well for videos and music, and photo's look great.  Pros: Great looking video's and photo's. Resilient LCD, I've used this device quite a lot, and so far not a single scratch. Gapless playback. Portable and Compact. Tactile Buttons- I like these!  Cons: Gets hot, gets hot rather fast. Video Format can be hard to get right, but Total Video Converter works well. AAC, have to buy plug-in for this. Battery Life-Haven't gotten much for video on it....Ah well!  All in all, I think its a great product, but could use some refining! Other than that, I totally recommend this product!

<Title>A multi-functional mp3 player.
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Archos 404 to replace a Gmini402 whose screen broke, and I like the new 404 better in some ways, but worse in others.  I had all of my files backed up as mp3's and was able to copy them directly into the Archos 404 and be up using them very quickly.  The UI is about the same.  I really like the larger color display, and being able to view video's is nice, but I got it mostly for music.  I was able to record wav files into my Gmini402 directly, and they sounded pretty good, when I used an external mixer.  Also, I did like the option of being able to copy my camera's pictures to the 404, which I couldn't do with the Gmini.   The features were not documented well enough on the Archos 404, and indeed I can do the same, but discovered I needed to buy the DVR station to do most of the things I took for granted, and that's a pretty spendy add-on.  By reading the info I could get my hands on, I decided to "cheap out" and buy the $27 Docking Adapter.  With it, I could charge my unit from the wall, and use it to transfer files between my camera and the unit.  It works fine.  I also thought I could plug a audio Line in cable into my headphone jack (with an archos supplied addapter) to get the audio line-in signal into the unit, but after ordering the video/audio cable for $20 incl shipping, I discovered that didn't work, and I need to buy the Travel adapter for another $60 to get that, and only suspect it will work to record just the audio, since I can't find that documented anywhere.  Maybe I should have gone with the DVR station, but I wasn't interested in using the unit as a DVR.    I tried to play some of the video's my little Casio camera took after loading them into the Archos 404, but discovered that the format wasn't compatible.  I figured out how to use Windows Media player to convert the video files to the right format on my computer -so I'll still need to bring it with me on trips if I want to review them in the field, but then discovered I needed to order the $20 Cinema plug-in SW to do view them on my unit even after I converted them with Windows Media Player.  I've thrown another $100 at the basic unit to get most of the functionality I "need", but I've resigned to not bother with anything better than recording from the internal microphone.

<Title>Major output power problem
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am surprised that none of the reviews here has mentioned one truly serious problem with this device. This player suffers from a very low and insufficient output power.  Actually the output signal is so week that even my high power vehicle and home stereo systems can not get the music to loud enough levels ( I am using a direct audio-out cable). When used in sports this gets really irritating. I have been pleased with the various video formats that it supports and I have been using it to watch DVD quality movies while on long flights. I was able to play WMV and AVI files out of the box while for the MPEG2 I did purchase the additional Cinema plug-in from ARCHOS Web site.  The following are additional cons: *	Cumbersome stone age menu and controls *	In video mode the battery dries out very quickly *	No power supply included *	The device crashes from time to time in the midst of playing a file. This does not happen very often but still it might be irritating *	For some reasons it would not play some AVI/DiVX/MPEG4 files. I can't explain this and I am unsure why would it play perfectly some files while fail with some other files.  In summary it is still probably one of the best players around due to the wide range of supported video file formats and outstanding screen quality.

<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned a Zune 30 before i bought this. But the new updated software just killed the Zune. I had been looking at this Archos 404 for sometime now. This blows away any Zune or Ipod and its 4th generation. I forgot how great it is to have a device thats not linked to bad software or any software period. It does everything really easy and video and music look and sound great on it. You can buy the 2 extra plugins for it to give you more codec choice and thats only 40 dollars more,but trust me its worth it. The device will almost play anything. Drag and drop truely is a wonderful thing. I have put my Zune up for sale and i'm glad i finally got the 404.

<Title>pocket full of entertainment
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my perfect portable media player.  Great price.  Big screen.  Fits in your pocket.  If you're too cool for an ipod, or run Linux, this player is for you.  ;)  Great for Mac, Windows, and Linux because it support standard USB mass storage.  Just drag and drop files onto it, no drivers necessary.  You can browse MP3s by artist, year, genre, etc.  You can also browse MP3s by file name and folder.    MP3s sound great, with seamless/gapless track changing.  The bookmark feature is really nice for keeping your place in audio books or long DJ mixes.    The video playback is perfect with all my Dixv and Xvid MPEG4 movies without having to re-encode them.  DVD converter software tips:  HandBrake for Mac.  dvd::rip for Linux.  AutoGK for Windows.  Happy viewing!

<Title>the only portable music/video player to get!
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought this after purchasing both an ipod and a toshiba gigabeat and then returning both.   the ipod was kinda cute and it was really, really easy to use.  but it was extremely limited and for the money, why buy something that had so many limitations.  if you want to be a slave to itunes and want to purchase a seperate digital recorder, then an ipod is a great choice.  of course, you can also purchase lots of associated goodies to make your ipod look even cuter, but it is not going to change the basic facts about the limitations of the product.  but then, i think the simplicity of buying an ipod is one of the main selling points of the product. bought the toshiba and it is a very nice product.  however, i did not receive some of the items - like a docking cradle - that i expected to receive with the purchase and i sent it back.  when i got it, i also began to read lots of reader comments about crashes and failures with the product and i do not want any part of that.  if i spend hours loading up my player with music, i do not want to have to go back every month or few weeks and do it again because my player crashes.  where there is smoke there is fire, and if lots of people are reporting the same problems with a product, you can bet there is a fundamental problem with that product.  i've learned the hard way, having bought stuff - from other mp3 players to cars - knowing full well of the reported problems, only to ignore them because i simply liked the product, its design and how it functioned.  but if a noticable percentage of consumers are reporting similar problems with a product, the odds are pretty strong that you might have to deal with the same issues, if you get that product.  now you might get lucky and not get one of the problem products, but i would rather not take that chance.  spending money to send a product back to the manufacturer gets expensive and horribly frustrating.  the gigabeat seems like a nice little product, but they'll have to shore up their quality control before i invest in one of their units. the archos is just a fine solid piece of equipment.  i've only had it for a week now, and i've not done much with the video, but it has performed flawlessly so far and it will be an incredible little gadget once i get the accessory that will allow me to do lots of other things, like record from the television.  i'm a basketball and hockey fan and i'll load up the player with games and watch them during down time at the office.  that is something that none of the other players in the class - the ipod, the gigabeat, the creative - can do. the video is good, definitely better than an ipods visuals. the screen is appreciably larger. the sound on the archos is about an 8 on a scale of ten.  very good, but not quite as good as creative's.  i've tested the zen vision m and i have a small muvo and i think that creative just knows how to do sound better on these small players.  one added little touch is a small - though very tinny - speaker that allows you to listen without plugging in your earbuds. i find that it is a very convient thing to be able to listen without earbuds every once in a while.  plus you can share it with another person. the earbuds are good, though not great.  i've tested them against several pairs of sony headphones and earbuds and they definitely are better than all of the ones i tested them against.  my one pair of creative buds, from a relatively cheap muvo are better.  but the archos buds have a volume control on them, which is nice. its a nice size also.  about the same basic size of an ipod, though it feels much more solid and substantial.   it just feels like it would survive much more abuse than an ipod would.  not that i would intentionally abuse it, but this is an item that i'll end up tossing in my briefcase and it will, as a result, get knocked around a bit.  it definitely feels as though it will handle the knocks and pings. i also love the fact that you can actually control the machine with buttons on the player.  while the ipod's scrollwheel is cute, i wonder how durable it has been.   while it appears simple in some ways, i just felt that it was the kind of mechanism that might break down or have problems somewhere down the line.  the archos uses buttons that feel rock solid. the one thing i really do not like about the archos is that you have to pony up for another 100 bucks to really use the machine the way it can be used.  in order to record and do lots of other things with the player you have to get the tv docking station - $100 - or one of the cheaper docking stations that run from about $25 to $75.  i'll buy the $100 station because it is most versatile, but it is kind of a drag to have to pay that much extra to completely enjoy the benefits of the toy. also, the screen, though smaller than others in the archos line, is plenty big for me.  the smaller screen also makes the unit much more pocketable.  it also doesn't have a removable battery, though i imagine that by the time the battery's integrity becomes an issue, i'll buy another one of these toys with even more little features. if you're looking at this type of unit, you cannot go wrong with this unit.  it is just a better product than the other products in the same class.  if it had a small, limited docking cradle it would merit a 5, but the barebones package knocks down the rating just a wee bit.

<Title>almost there
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall it is great. Size, features, except the screen. The size is not the issue, but rather the resolution. At 320x24o it is just too low for this size screen. Also the viewing angles are bad, tilt it up 20 degrees and it looks too dark. The brightness of screen is better than the 604 and less than the 604 wifi(i bought them all to compare and kept the 604 wifi). The colors are also too saturated (unnatural). Overall, put a better screen on this, and i would pay 50% more. Are you listening archos?

<Title>Great video player
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really love the Archos 404. It's size is great. The screen may be smaller than the 504 and 604/604 wifi, but it is still great. You have many options to change how you view videos, like volume and video quality. The volume is an issue. Without headphones most videos or music are not loud enough. But with headphones they sound fine. Recording shows with the DVR recoding dock is easy, setting it up is a little harder. There is a voice recorder too for recording notes. The device comes preloaded with music, a couple video's, and some photo's. They are all easy to delete on the player or on your computer.   It is also easy to download videos from Youtube using programs found on the web. The case that comes with it is good. You cannot put the 404 in the case and use the controls, but for protection, the case is a great one to start with. It's better than the sleeve that others reported these Archos players first came with when they were first released.  The price is awesome for what this thing can do, especially if you want a great music, video, and photo viewer on the go.

<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my new toy!  I bought it to replace a big clunky DVD player.  I'm on-call at my job, so I sometimes have 20 minutes of downtime, and this little thing fills the void.  I bought the docking station to record tv shows and movies, and I love the fact that even when you shut it off, it saves your place in the movie-all you do is turn it on and click "resume". The video is really beautiful, very colorful.  The sound quality is good, however, the volume is a little low.  I don't need headphones unless I'm in a room with people talking.  I travel overseas a lot and have several hundred great photos on it, too, which is easier to carry and show than photo albums.  Now my husband wants a toy for traveling so I'll probably give him mine and buy the 604 wifi...so I'll more to play with!

<Title>The Coolest Toy I Have Bought Myself in a While!
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is worth every little penny it costs.  The menu/navigation are fine - it is not flashy but it works.  The buttons a day to get used top as they have dual functions. For example, if you push one button to the left, it does one thing, the same button to the right, another.  It is cool.  Alot of people complain about having to buy the DVR Docking Station in order to record.  Again, who cares. You can record from your TV - for free. NO TIVO subscription or whatever your local cable company offers.  The only downside is that I wish there were a better way to set up the recording schedule.  It used to work with some function of MyYahoo TV or something but it does not support that any longer.  You have to do it manually.  But like I said before, who really cares?  The case it comes with sucks - you need to buy a different one. I have yet to find one that is too my liking.  I also hear that Archos customer support sucks - luckily I have not had to deal with them yet.  I am aware that there a few version of this that are bigger (the 604 and 704 I believe), but I cannot see myself going any bigger with this before it becomes cumbersome to carry. Also, it took me a minute to figure out how the docking station controls your cable or satellite box when it comes time to change the channels.  But once you get it, you are set.  I have had this for 2-3 months and I just love it.  I makes my one hour commute to work even more bearable.    As far as buying it without the docking station, I don't know.  I probably would not do it.
