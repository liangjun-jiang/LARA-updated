<Content>I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with. I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez) Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA8U12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7876944-6599335">Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)</a> Same price but get more, more more! A  little larger, same functions but at 20GB you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of Amazon's very varied music library.

<Title>Keeps on Surprising!
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Where to start? I've bought a lot of different Mp3 players. In fact, you might say I'm obsessed with them. I also have friends who have Ipods. (bah!) The only good thing about Ipods is the wide variety of accessories you can get for them. This little Zen beats them all, hands down! I'll start with the list of cons since there are so few.  CONS:  Touchy buttons. (even with senitivity turned on low, but easy to get used to, and there is a hold button) Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time. (?) Has ability to record, but has no line in.  PROS: (and this will be quite a list!)  Plays WAVE,Mp3,and WMA as well. (I have everything in WMA) Bass booster option. Smart volume option. Sound quality is great. I've read complaints about the bass boost being distorted. Turn on the smart volume and the disortion goes away. Crisp clean treble as well. Smart volume also adjust for different record levels. (quite nice) 5 band graphic eq, as well as plenty of presets. 8 gigs holds tons of music and photos. Very small. (fits in pocket comfortably) Works as an external hard dirve, and lets you decide how much space to use for this. (128mb upto 4gigs) Uses a standard 2.0 USB cord. (big advantage) Charge battery while you put music or photos on it. Not only is the battery rechargeable, but also replaceable. (you can buy extras for long trips) Screen looks bright and clear from any angle. Main menu is very customizable. (options, wallpaper,and colors) Easy to navigate. Almost no gap between songs. (good for Pink Floyd albums) Built in microphone. Seems to record pretty well. Has a calender where you can store reminders and events. Not so important, but it really looks COOL! Not a bad price for all it does.  LAST WORDS: At first I didn't like the fact that you have to use software to transfer files, but now I see why. I have other Mp3 players that are plug and play. It takes them a minute or so to boot up. Not this baby. Turn it on and it's ready to go in less than 3 seconds. The software updates the player when you close the program so that it doesn't have to boot up. I'm not the kind of person who likes to read manuals, and with this player, I didn't have to. It's almost too easy to use, and yet full of features. I've also read complaints about the software. If you know how to navigate windows, then software will be easy to use, and it works well. I've only had it for 3 days, so I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting or haven't found yet. But it just keeps getting better. Has more features than I dreamed it could.  BOTTOM LINE: Buy what you want, but the Zen Micro is BETTER!

<Title>Zen Micro Photo
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this LOVELY new toy for my b-day this past weekend. My best friend has an Ipod which she seems to love but I never did like the whole having to convert my music to iTunes before getting to listen to them. Since I have a ton of music from downloading my cds onto my computer there was no WAY I was going to lose all those hours of downloading because I miss up one transfre to iTunes. My boyfriend is into all things electronic so he told me about the Zen, he had an older model that although it was a really good MP3 player the touch senstive pad would stick. NO such problems with this one. I have been playing with it since Saturday. The one problem I have is the lack of accessories for the Mico Photo, I need a armguard for the gym and there doesn't appear to be one able as of yet.

<Title>Apples are meant to be eaten...
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I dont know what reviewer L. Maxey has been smoking, but hands down, the Creative Zen Micro Photo is a vastly SUPERIOR product to the Ipod...flash player or otherwise. Simply do your homework people and notice the many, many features that the Zen Photo offers compared to the Ipod. FM TUNER, RECORDER, CALENDAR, REMOVABLE, RECHARGEABLE battery (unlike iPods--where you will have to pay to have it shipped and repaired by the factory), AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, you can use it with Rhapsody To Go, which offers YOU, the user, basically EVERY album in its collection (current and past)for a set monthly fee of about $14.95. None of this "PAY PER SONG" BS that iTunes forces on you. Why pay $.99 to download a song when you can load your ZEN with all the latest albums---AS MANY AS YOU WANT---for a set monthly fee??  It comes in 10 different colors to fit whatever your particular taste is, and has a sweeeeeet cool BLUE glow when its on or when you navigate the controls. This player simply offers more bang for the buck. All in all, it's pretty clear cut to me what the superior product is... go do the research and find out for yourself.

<Title>ZMP
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>SOUND QUALity: nice, very nice USER INTERFACE - took me a couple of days to dominate the touchpad but now is very easy to use and manipulate, gotta be too careful not to touch the touchpad while playing though SOME COMMENTS - so far so good, the only weird thing is that sometimes when the player goes to screensaver mode it takes longer than usual, is supposed to be real quick but sometimes it drags for some reason as if it was in slow motion, you can see that the time elapsed is affected too cause it skips a number like so: 12, 14, 16, it only happens sometimes, not all the time, no trends noticed...it froze one time already while fowarding, it happened after using fowarding several times in a row but it was an easy fix by taking out the battery and putting it back in, just hope this little gliches are not a sign of things to come....and the OLED screen is great INDOORS, outdoor however you can BARELY read the screen, I had to change my wallpaper to a black-background just so I can see a little more. SUGGESTIONS - view photos while playing music BATTERY LIFE - approx 5 hrs using SONY MDR_V6 headphones, bass/EQ on, not bad considering I tend to use fowards/rewind a lot and most of mp3 are 192kbs or 256kbs. I left it playing overnight one time and it lasted more than 10hrs.

<Title>It's Great!
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am very impressed with my new Zen Micro Photo.  The 8 GB capacity is wonderful.  I put my entire cd collection on it, and still have room.  It was very easy to figure out and is simple to use.  With a simple cable (which my husband dug out of his box of wires) I can plug it into my stereo and have my entire collection, playlists, etc. playable through the stereo.  I did buy the belkin FM transmitter for the car for it, though my husband is thinking of doing more of a hardwire solution.  The best testimony, however, is probably the fact that my husband (a luddite computer engineer who questions the benefits of new technology and thought I was crazy for wanting one)now wants his own!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player!
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have no complaints with the MP3 player, although the software drives ActiveSync crazy, and I have to end the Creative drivers if I want to synchronize my PDA (this did not happen with the Creative software that came with the player, but with the "update"). Otherwise it has very good sound, good battery life, and it works with Yahoo Music to Go (being this the main reason to buy this player). Why not 5 stars? Well, the "protective pouch" sucks and having to pay extra to be able to charge it directly from an outlet also sucks. It makes no sense to have to carry a computer on vacation to charge this thing! (Hint: I took my powered USB hub w/o the laptop to charge it!)

<Title>Rockin' with Creative
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little 8 GB player is great!  I've got over 1500 songs on my player and more than 1 GB still free.    Pros:  Lots of storage. Small. Radio. Bookmarking. Drag and drop.  Color screen.  While you can drag and drop to the player I recommend using the Creative Organizer software to transfer music for its syncing ability.  Supports several subscription services like Rhapsody among others.  Cons:  Not yet compatible with Audible.com files; hopefully soon.  Does not yet support MPEG-4 files.  Both of these can be fixed with a firmware upgrade when it becomes available.  I highly recommend this player as a great alternative to those not wanting to get tied into the iPod and iTunes.  Plus, this player offers twice the storage as the 4GB iPod Nano at the same price.

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is a piece of garbage.  I had it for 2 weeks and the player froze up on me.  I called for technical support and was able to "jump start" the player.  I used it for another two weeks and it froze again.  I was unable to "jump start" it again by following the same steps as when I called for help.  So I called again and was told that I had to ship it to the company for diagnostic checks.  After owning this product for 5 weeks, I've been able to use it for only 2 and had to pay shipping to send it back.  The company still has not returned my unit to me.  Get an iPod - it's well worth it.

<Title>NOT GOOD FOR AN ACTIVE LIFESTYLE USER!!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got my daughter this for Christmas - No problems if you are sitting quietly on the couch listening to it!! DON'T buy this if you plan on jogging, bike-riding or even driving on a bumpy road!!   Broke within 45 days of easy listening - Customer service was fairly helpful with return of product however.   We have had all types of mp3's in our house including ipod's, creative and cheaper brands - Don't waste $250.00 on this one!!

<Title>Very Happy
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item for my 13 yr. old son.  It was a replacement for a similar unit bought at Best Buy that started freezing up a few weeks after we got it.  BB had little in stock and couldn't say when they'd get more (we could call back if we wanted to check), so we went to Amazon and had our choice of many brands, models and even colors.  Infinitely better selection than the chain stores.  The new Zen works perfect (to date!) and my son is really happy with it. We went with free shipping and it arrived in about 6 days, including a weekend.
