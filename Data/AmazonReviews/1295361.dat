<Title>Very good MP3/Radio shower unit
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been looking for a water resistant FM radio when I stumbled across this unit at Amazon.com. It was on sale for $29.99 and it comes with a built-in 32MB Pavit MP3 player. Who can beat that? I immediately purchased one unit and it's currently hanging in my shower. Very nice. The sound is really good considering the size of the unit. And I love the ability that the Pavit USB drive can be taken out of the system for MP3 file transfer. Aiwa is currently making the 128MB and 256MB USB drive so you can exchange your flash drive easily (I can't wait until they're available).  The user interface is easy to learn. Although, I found the button to be so hard to press. They probably design it that way for the water resistant feature. The small mono LCD screen features 3 lines which shows important info of the system as well as the MP3 file song + artist name or radio station information.  Again, as I say, who can beat the $29.99 price. I would buy this unit for double the price. Get it while you still can. The only reason drawback of the unit that I can think of is its 32MB flash drive. With 32MB, I can only copy about 8 songs at a time. Although to think about it, whoever spends more than 8 songs (about 30 minutes) in a shower is probably a slacker :)

<Title>Great Shower Radio!
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Originally, I had planned on buying a Sony shower radio w/ a CD player for around $100. They were out of stock and w/ the MP3 market these days, I decided on this radio. It does hold about 8 full length songs on it. Uploading songs to the device from your computer is really easy: it just takes a few mouse clicks and about 30 seconds. The radio itself is loud and has good sound quality. AIWA just unveiled their 128MB & 256MB Removable Storage Media devices a few weeks ago so those should be available very soon for those who aren't satisfied with the 32MB. I would highly recommend this to anyone. You can take it anywhere with you.

<Title>Best MP3 Shower Radio
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Even though the Pavit drive only holds about 8 mp3's, as the previous reviewer noted, it's more than enough time.  For a longer soak, you can simply start it up again.  I bought it entirely for its mp3 capability and water resistance and I find these overpower the weaknesses:  1.  Sound isn't great, but the volume can go rather high.  2.  I do wish it had an AC adapter.  But, considering this is in the bathroom, it isn't a good idea anyway.  I've yet to buy new batteries after 3 weeks, but I have not used the radio consistently.  3.  The repeat function should have the option to repeat the playlist, not only a single track.    4.  When the USB drives with more megs come along, you will want to program the tracks.  This option is sadly missing.  Despite these faults, this is currently the best mp3 shower radio for the price.  And, of course, you can use the USB drive to store photos, documents, etc., then come back to use the software to transfer the mp3's for the radio.

<Title>Nice gadget for wet environments
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The quality of the radio reception is very high, in the closed places there is no interferance on the radio, its quite good.The backlight of lcd screen is blue and difficult to read while moisture on the screen!.The player's memory is just 32 Mbytes and it is sufficient for bath time(approx.half an hour) cd quality music, you can save only 5 or 6 tracks to listen.You can buy 128/256 MB version PAVIT from the manufacturer if you want to spend more money to listen long time music.Overall,radio is good, mp3 player's memory is not enough. If you are using shower it's ok.Battery life is normal (15 days), because that.. while in the shower, you need to pump up the volume.

<Title>Nice Clock Radio
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product for about 2 months, and so far it has worked flawlessly.   It would be nice if they offered models with a bigger memory than 32mb.  but for the price, this is a great deal.

<Title>A fine radio, a mediocre MP3 player
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device makes an excellent shower radio. It's FM only. It can store 20 station presets in 2 banks of 10. The volume can go loud enough to be easily heard in the shower. Battery life is excellent (at least 2 months on my first set). It even comes with an external wire antenna in case you need better reception; this is amazing.  As an MP3 player it leaves much to be desired. It comes with a "pavit" which is some sort of USB flash drive. At only 32MB, it holds about 6 songs. Supposedly there will be a 128MB pavit available, but I can't find one for sale online. The player doesn't recognize mp3 files loaded from OSX, so you must use the included Windows software to load mp3s on the pavit. The software didn't recognize a 512mb flash drive that I plugged into the computer.
