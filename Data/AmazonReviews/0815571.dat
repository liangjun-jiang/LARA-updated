<Title>Do NOT buy this product!
<Date>Thu Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Creative Labs Nomad II MP3 player. Do not buy this product! I initially bought this unit because it had &quot;name&quot; &amp; several good reviews.  You can imagine my dissatisfaction when the actual product arrived &amp; did not live up to expectations. Ok, the first Nomad unit that I received was a total failure. Nothing worked. The rechargeable batteries could not be recharged, the &quot;docking station&quot; was &quot;FUBAR,&quot; and the player simply did not work. OK. Trust the company.  Send the unit back &amp; get a new one. Did that. Got a new unit. Guess what? Worked for four hours &amp; then stopped, shut down, quit, for no identifiable reason. Frustration. Conclusion. Do not buy this product. For whatever reason, design, quality control, whatever, this product is FUBAR.  It is totally unreliable! Do not buy it! Do not waste your money!

<Content>Player is great and sounds pretty good with a different set of headphones. I also like the docking station. The software is easy  to use and performs all required functions. I like the ergonomic arrangement of the controls and the overall size. I do not like the cheezy vinyl case that comes with it.  It has no openings to access controls, no belt clip, and closing the flap requires disconnection of the headset. Recommendations for Creative Labs: Get a case that can be worn and that allows access to controls (in leather). Get a better headset.

<Title>Sweet MP3 player!
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Since the day that I got my Rio 500 stolen, I was on the internet looking for new MP3 players.  I came across the Nomad, and I was stuck on it right away.  This is because it comes with a docking port that I hooked up to the USB port on my computer.  While the batts are charging, you can upload/download sounds to and from the Nomad.  This is very easy and fast for me, ..., because I like to download music at the last minute ... .   By the way, the download/upload time is fast!<p>Another thing that I liked about it is that it came with a voice recorder and an FM radio with 32 presets.... . ... .<p>Another attraction to the Nomad is the sleek looking style and color.  One thing that can get annoying is that the buttons are on the sides, but I don't think that that is a problem, since the button locations are easy to remember.<p>... .<p>         MY ADVICE TO U:  BUY THE NOMAD, IT ROCKS!

<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I spent some time doing some research before I decided on buying this product. For the money, features and quality from the reviews that I read, this was it! I'm with USAF in Saudi serving my country, I keep myself occupied by skating and bike riding and always do it with music. Carrying a CD player or tape player is always too bulky.  I had to have my wife order the MP3 from England, have Amazon ship it to New York so her sister could send it to her and in turn she would mail it to me here in Saudi....it finally got here (2-1/2 wks)and so far so good. I was very, very impressed with the size, loading the software was a breeze and getting the files to download to the player was even easier, great sound, enough base for me and plenty of feature.  We get three stations here and no problems at all, crisp clear. I would recommend this to any one interested in getting a good value for money MP3...two things, the headphones are very nice, but the sound they offer are worst then a $5.00 headphones, the carrying case is a joke and definetly needs a belt clip, either on the case or the player itself, I put it in some glue from the inside got on the buttons, so they were sticky for awhile. Big plus....docking station with baterry charger, be careful not to force it when putting the player into the charger. It uses Flash Memory, not Smart Media like it's advertised...

<Title>Ideal
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>There is little to complain about.  Being a college student who is always on the move, I couldn't have asked for a better purchase than the Nomad II MG.  Just about all the specs have been mentioned already at one point or another, and they're clearly quality.  The two things that make this player stand out are the docking port, which recharges batteries (great money saver), and the taken-for-granted fact that with the included software you can rip straight from CDs to the device with no intermediate step.  The equalizer is as effective as the one on a PC MP3 player, and the style can't be beat.  The lousy included headphones can be overlooked; come on, if you're buying an MP3 player, you're an avid enough music fan to already own a quality pair of headphones.

<Title>What can i say, But It
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>So I broke down, and decided to spend some money on something i thought i would use. I never realized how much! Walking a mile to work each day used to take for what seemed forever, and now it's nothing. I always knew what music could do, but never realized how easy mp3 music could be.  You really can't go wrong with this player. I was leary of users commenting on bad radio reception (i'm in the new york area too), but this wasn't the case. The head phones (with my long hair) are perfect, and make the player easy to throw in my pocket.  With a 128 mb card in addition to the 64 mb internal, i can walk for miles or take a 4 hour plane ride before hearing the same song twice.  The recording feature is handy, and is also fairly good quality. The technology is beautiful.<br> Good job creative labs, you guys rock.

<Title>Good for the casual user, but not the serious music listener
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>According to many reviews, the Nomad II MG blows away all other portable MP3 players.  Sure, I'll buy that.  But compared to MP3 playback on my home computer, it sounds terrible.  It has a low frequency rumble that drowns out any quiet moments, even in high bitrate, LAME-encoded MP3s.  A friend of mine with the same model has confirmed this.  Furthermore, the sound reproduction seems to be a bit &quot;thinner&quot; than what I get with my home computer, even when using aftermarket, digital reference headphones.  (The headphones they provide are TERRIBLE.)  The interface on the Nomad is probably the clunkiest and most counterintuitive I've ever seen.  It's hard to pick the unit up without pressing a button (they're on the sides).  I've already accidentally deleted a song, and so has my girlfriend.  The included software is extremely unstable (under Win98).  I've had it crash many times just browsing available MP3s, and others have complained of this as well.  The software should simply be a conduit to the device, but the Creative people have tried to make it do too much, and they've made it very user unfriendly and filled it with bugs in the process.<p>I suppose the Nomad is decent for use during exercise or on the train, but if you consider yourself a semi-audiophile I recommend you do not buy this product.  Wait until the technology matures.  Most studies find that near CD-quality is about 256kbps.  The Nomad will only hold 30 minutes of music at this rate, and will reproduce it with distortion, all in a confusing little package.  I don't think that's worth [the price]; do you?

<Title>Hey..yo!! This is THE best!
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I saw someone wrote a review about this product and wrote about all bad things as possible. But you know what? That is all lie~~~~ I think they don't even have a nomad2MG. They are just jealous about this product. Maybe they don't even have a mp3player at all. or else they are still using 286 computers.. All most every sentence they write about &quot;nomad2ma sucks&quot;  is all wrong! Maybe they are spies from other mp3player  companies. And they wanna sell more..:)<p>Bottom line is --This is THE best product yo!!

<Title>Trouble In Nomad Land
<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>First MP3 player RCA Lyra 2.  Hated it. Cheep quality and sounded funky.  Returned it.  Bought the Creative Nomad II MG.  Loved it, at first.  After one week the left channel started making strange noises.  Sent it back for repair as they assured a `new' unit would be sent to me as soon as the bad unit was received.  Creative had it for twenty-three days and returned the same unit with no explanation.  Still bad.  Called tech support, again.  They said they would send me a refurbished unit.  I wanted a new unit, as the one I had was only one week old when it started having problems.  They assured me `refurbished was better than new as it had been thoroughly tested.'  I fell for it and they drop shipped me a `refurbished' unit.  Disaster!  Scratched, did not work most of the time, locked up, and would not work at all with my 128MB media card.  Shipped everything back to Creative.....  Two months later and I still do not have a working unit.  I am not alone in this, as I have read other reviews on Amazon.com and other places.  Past thirty days so I can't get any money back.  Don't waste your money on this one until they have the bugs out.

<Title>Read the reviews: This thing [...stinks]
<Date>Sat Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Even if it didn't have chronic defects, the Nomad II MG is poorly designed. It comes with a protective leather carrying case that (1) can't be clipped or attached to anything and (2) doesn't provide an easy way to access any of the buttons on the unit. I ended up taking scissors to my leather case to make it slightly usable.<p>The buttons are located on the sides of the unit, where most people usually grab the unit. This results in frequent accidental button presses.<p>A couple of months after I got mine, I had the battery-clip problem that others have described. It was easily fixed with aluminum foil, but honestly, battery clips have been manucatured for decades without much problem; why is it such a recurring problem here?<p>Finally, after a little over a year of use, my docking station isn't acknowledging that the unit is docked. Therefore I can neither recharge the unit nor change the songs. The player is now useless to me. <p>From reading the other reviews, it's obvious the problems I've had with mine aren't an isolated case. So if you want a well-designed, well-manufactured, reliable mp3 player, DON'T buy the Creative Nomad II MG.

<Title>Get To Know Nomad Warranty Service
<Date>Wed Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I formerly owned a Nomad II, which broke after about a year.  I then purchased a Nomad II MG, which I had to return because the charging cradle didn't function.  I purchased another one, and that one stopped working after about thirty days.  I would steer clear of this frail product.<p>(P.S. Why would anyone with an IQ higher than a chimp buy three of these things?  I couldn't find another one with expandable memory and an FM tuner).

<Title>The other reviewers aren't lying.  It stinks.
<Date>Tue Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I owned this player for about 5 months before its cradle stopped functioning.  There are two main faults with it that lead me to advise against this MP3 player.  <p>The first is its poor design.  All of the function buttons are located along its sides.  In order to hold the thing in any natural and comfortable way, your fingers have no other place to go except over the ultra-sensitive function buttons.  The slightest change in pressure will activate any button you are touching.  You'll find yourself accidently pausing, stopping or (worst of all) DELETING a song as it is playing very often unless you adopt the incredibly annoying practice of locking the buttons whenever you aren't using them.  But unlike some other players, this also locks the volume button- which means you'll spend lots of time unlocking-changing volume-locking-unlocking-skipping a song-locking.  Ugh.  <p>And why any designer would put a one-touch delete button right near your general function buttons is beyond me.  Make sure you memorize the layout of the buttons, because it absolutely stinks to delete a song when you just wanted to pause it and there is no second chances once you hit the extremely innocuous and sensitive delete button.<p>The second drawback of this player is how often it seems to break inexplicably.  My player is fine, but if I want to use it anymore I'll have to get a new cradle.  My cradle just decided to stop functioning one day.  It wasn't jostled or banged around, it wasn't dusty or submerged in soda- nothing.  I'd chock it up to bad luck if I hadn't gone on the web the next day and found dozens of unsolved breakages involving this player and its cradle.<p>This unit is slick looking and tiny, but not worth the trouble.  Look elsewhere for your MP3 player needs.  You can do much better.

<Title>Still working after 2 years
<Date>Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Felt I had to add this after reading all these reviews.  I got my II MG over 2 years ago and it still works fine.  Only problem is the display sometimes flickers on and off, but if you tap it it comes back.  I use this for the gym, travel and in my car.  I've dropped it numerous times and gotten it wet and it still works fine.  I have deleted songs accidently as others seem prone to as well, and agree button placement was poor.  Overall this player has been great, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Creative product.

<Title>This little thing works GREAT for me!!!
<Date>Wed Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've been using the Nomad 2 MG for over a year, now. When I first tried to install the software, I had some problems with the docking cradle not seeing the player. I was suspicious that it had problems with my computer hardware (motherboard, etc.). When I tried the installation on another computer, everything worked great! Shortly afterwards, I replaced that original system with a faster one and the software works fine, now, as a matter of fact, the files just FLY to the player!<p>I take that MP3 player with me on rough mountain bike rides, snowboarding, running, commutes to work, and (sometimes) while I'm at work. I've dropped it numerous times, but still I have had NOT ONE SINGLE PROBLEM with it, yet. My cradle has not broken- maybe I'm just lucky. For those who have none functioning cradles, there are updated drivers online for free- that could solve some of your problems. Admittedly, I have deleted a song or two, because of poor button placement, but if you're capable of learning, you're not going to do that more than a few times, at best.<p>For the price and the performance, this unit ROCKS! With its capabilities to expand to the 128MB card, that's a lot of songs! Get this MP3 player! It's totally worth it!

<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This a great product. I have had mine for over 5 years. Still going strong. Recently found these work great with the mac and itunes. Real drag and drop of files to and from it. As a musician the recording feature on this is great. I use is as a notepad for musical ideas. Then plug it into my mac, and drag the recorded files into itunes which plays them perfectly. It's just getting better with age. Buy one if you can find it.
