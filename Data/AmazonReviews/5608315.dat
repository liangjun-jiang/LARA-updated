<Title>Wonderful for travel
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excellent gadget for travel.  It is very easy to use.  You can quickly transfer all of your photos to the ESP and then reuse your memory card.  It is fun to sit around with friends and look at the day's travel pictures.  I carry pictures of my family and pets with me and look at them when I am traveling and (if appropriate) even share a few with people I meet when traveling.  It is amazing what happens when I look at my pictures on an airplane - the Wolverine ESP becomes the center of attention and everyone wants to see it and then buy one after they see what it is capable of.  For me, it is as much a camera accessory as is my camera battery charger.

<Content>I took this device on a trip to France and used it to back up 3 cameras - 1 with an SD card, 1 with an SDHC card and 1 with a memory stick card. All told, I backed up about 10GB of images without a problem with plenty of battery power left. The ESP worked flawlessly.

<Title>Perfect for the purpose
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm an amateur photographer shooting only monstrous RAW formats (13 MP, from a Canon 5D). I bought the Wolverine to transfer the pictures from the CF card to a portable hard drive while in vacations. The transfer speed is adequate (faster than any laptop I used previously) and it does open the Canon RAW formats, just like advertised. I'm very happy with this. The mp3 side is average, but I don care too much (I have smaller players which I carry). I did test some movies - clips downloaded from Internet and works fine, except the ones protected. The charger is good for 100-220 V, so I had no problem using it in Australia. The CF interface is not the sturdiest, attention should be paid when the card is inserted or removed. Recently tried the Wolverine with an SD card from Canon G7, it works just fine. The radio has no antenna - only through the audio output. If nothing plugged in, there is no signal. The built in speaker sound just like a cell phone speaker.

<Content>I love this thing.  I recently went on vacation and never had to worry about filling up the memory on my camera and then having to plug into my computer.  I just shot them and immediately loaded them into my Wolverine.  And I'm putting all my Netflix movies on here to watch when I go on vacation in a few weeks.  I love it.  Love it.  Love. It.

<Title>The Epson Alternative
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked up this storage device for a recent trip, and it was great to have.  This unit makes it easy to download from flash media cards. If you're a traveling digital photographer you gotta have an external storage device as a back up for photos, and this one is great unit to have.  The price is right especially in relation to the pricier Epson devices.  It also does double duty as a media player, for those MP3s/videos that you want to access on the long flights.   Just two minor points: 1 - There's a small joy stick that sticks out - it's easy to accidentally press this button if the unit is in a shirt pocket. 2 - I wish the carrying case was a bit bigger, so it could stash the usb cable and small ear plugs.  Other than that this is a great unit to carry around.....

<Title>Wolverine ESP on location
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The concept of the product is good.  Functionally, it works as advertised.  I recently purchased the 80GB version and used it on location where electricity was scarce.  I uploaded as many as 10,000 photos daily while camping.  I was able to review my photos with ease.  However, upon my return to my studio, the hard drive within the unit failed completely, unable to recognize the primary partition.  My 63,000 plus photos which I could not re shoot were gone.  Thank goodness for third party data recovery companies.  Wolverine tech support was sympathetic and helpful, saying that I should have taken two units with me on location.  They  quickly replaced my new unit with a refurbished one.  Many hundreds of dollars later, I was able to recover my data, but my confidence in this product was shaken.  How can a new unit, less than a week old, always hand carried, fail so completely?

<Title>Just what I was looking for...
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Wolverine ESP mainly for use as a backup for my laptop for storing pictures while on an upcoming European vacation and cruise.  I was intrigued by the large viewing screen, the 80 Gigs of memory, and the built in card readers (one for each of our two cameras).  The trip is still 3 wks off, but I have tested it with a trip to Disneyland, and family gatherings.  It is EXACTLY what I wanted...and more.  I still haven't gotten used to the little 'joy stick' control, and at times I will push it in instead toggling L or R, but that is a minimal concern.  And it seems like the battery wants to run down pretty quick, so I guess I better buy a back-up before the trip.  It doesn't have alpha-numeric key pad capability, so when you 'back-up' your cards they are saved exactly as named by your camera.  It is then hard to tell what is what if you have a lot saved folders.  But then you simply download the pics to your PC, create folders with easy to understand names, and upload the picture folders back into the ESP.  That way you can quickly get to pics of events, or kids (or in my case...grand-kids) for sharing.  I have taken it to work several times (using it as a portable hard drive) as it easily fits in your jacket pocket or it has a belt loop on the case (OK, that is a little tacky...but it works) and then have shared pictures at the same time.  Very cool little toy.  I can just imagine the first night on the cruise when we meet new people at our dinner table, and they ask if we have pictures of the grand-kids...boy do we! LOL  The built-in game, FM radio and MP3 capabilities are 'fluff' as far as I am concerned, and figure it would just be another battery drain (but wait, I'm getting a back-up, so maybe I will start using those features...especially on the long plane ride!)

<Title>Does not support MPEG-2 files
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If all you want to do is backup photos this is a great product.  If you hope to also use it as a portable media player be warned - it does not support .mpeg2 files which is the most common mpg format for video.    It will not play videos taken on some digital cameras.  The resolution is far poorer than that on digital cameras so you are best off reviewing photos on your camera.  In short, if you want a spare hard drive to store your photos on, buy it.  Other than it's pretty much useless.

<Title>Love this item.
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a serious amateur photagraher.  I was looking for a way to store my digital photos from my two digital camaeras without buying numerous cards or bringing a laptop PC.  Each camera is a different brand and uses a different card.  After charging up the device, I was able to quickly download the pictures from each camera.  The device is intuitive to use and I did not need to read the directions and was able to use it in a few minutes.  It allows me to preview the pictures on screen also.  I even downloaded some music and a movie.  For my uses (photo storage) this is an exellent item that beats bringing along a portable PC. There is plenty of storage space and this item performed flawlessly.  I would defintely buy this item again.

<Title>Wolverine does it all for less and is expandable!
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>MP3 players.  I've resisted buying one until they made it perfect.  Wolverine met my standards.  Here's some features you should think about:  Removable, drop out $30 li-ion battery - keep a spare after 14 hours of songs! CF/SD/MMC/and more slots for reading memory cards AND saving photos on the hard disk 80 GB hard disk is user upgradable (instructions in the manual) when big ones get cheaper (which they will - you know it!) Big, BIG screen.  320x240 but wow - it's a display in and of itself.  I use it to review photos on the spot from my 8MP digicam Video - well they  all have video now, so that's an expectation.  it's compatible with itunes, so I'm fine - but it does WMA and PC video too! Microphone built in - record conversations on the spot separate video/audiio outputs for watching video or playing photos - even with a soundtrack! Separate configuration for screen, hard disk, and system power down times. Easy to zoom in/out on photos for focus checking - wonderful feature by itself. Empties both high and low speed CF cards.  My 4GB sandisk extreme III dumps to this fast, letting me keep shooting those big photos. And the features go on and on - too many to list here but I may find the manual to upload.  Basically - you are looking at a video MP3 player on steriods - supports universal formats, has an upgrade path, records audio on the spot, even has a video recording dock and can be setup as a TIVO.  USB, 5VDC, dock ports on the bottom, ear buds included or use standard 1/8" stereo headphones with it.  Uses common li-ion battery securely tucked in the handle.  And with all those fetures, it's easy to use, not too big, and comes with a beltloop case.  When the 200 gb disks come out, there's a button to setup one on it.  No need to buy the expensive 120GB disk today.  The screen color is wonderful and performance is just flawless.  For example - I shoot in Olympus Raw format so I can fix things later without compression loss.  This thing understands most SLR raw formats on the market today!  And it's firmware is upgradable as more arrive (the factory encourages  you to check for the latest version).    I haven't drained the battery yet - but I've moved alot of data to it.  It also charges off the USB connector via a special cable with 2 usb plugs to snag enough power from your pc to juice it up off the USB bus.  It's a winner - Comparing it to my parent's IPOD the size is close, but the functionality is far more impressive.  My dad's camera uses SD cards and it cleared his card out just like my CF card - so we both can use it on trips.  It even works with my micro-SD cards for my motorola phone (1GB).  At 399 - Amazon's price is great.  No shipping - prime members get it in 2 days or less (mine arrive next day for 2 day price - free) and no tax.  I'm impressed - I think you will be too.

<Title>Great for trips
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this device to be a temporary storage device for pictures taken while I travel.  I wanted to travel without my computer, and did not want to buy enough cards for an extended trip.  This device has performed well for that purpose.  The areas I am disappointed in are around the viewing.    First, when viewing on the screen, the picture is displayed as expected for a relatively low resolution device.  I knew this when buying, but I think the display could have been a little better.  Second, the connection to the TV distorts the picture, so the display is much worse than having the picture displayed through the camera (connected to the TV).  These two items are the disappointment, but the device was not bought for those purposes, so I am still very happy with this purchase.

<Title>Excellent, Verstile
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I spent a while trying to find a multimedia device that could read multiple types of flash memory cards (Compact flash cards, SD cards), read the raw files from my Canon EOS 5D camera and have at least 80 GB storage.  This device met all those requirements and also has a big vivid screen. In addition to the above, it is an mp3 player, video player and has an FM radio.  I have the 100 GB version that I purchased from costco for $ 350. I took this along on a long trip (3 weeks), along with a couple of spare batteries.  It performed wonderfully. I downloaded the pictures from my 2 GB compact flash cards at least 15 times. It stored all my RAW files without a hitch. It could also read the raw files generated from my camera and display it. The download speed was very fast.   The Canon EOS 5D generates large files at it highest resolution and fills up my 2 GB compact flash cards quickly. It is too impractical and expensive to carry too many compact flash cards. This device really helps to bridge this gap.  It also has a tetris game, music and video capability in it, to keep my kids happy during long drives.  Highly recommended for digital photographers and also for people looking for a verstile multi media device that can do more than the ipod.

<Title>Very Pleased with Purchase
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife and I ordered the Wolverine for a vacation so we could download pictures from our digital camera.  The wolverine is very user friendly and downloads a 4g memory card without any problems.  We also recorded several movies and tv shows to watch on the plane using the cradle.  We used the large screen to review pictures to decide which ones to keep.  When we returned from our trip, we showed family the pictures by attaching the wolverine to the tv and then using the remote control to scroll through the pictures like a slide show.  I highly recommend this produce.

Mp3 player, Memory Card Reader, Video Player, Voice Recorder, DVR (With optional Cradle), External hard drive, and like always I am sure Im forgetting a few things this little baby can do. I love being able to plop my CF card in and transferring data to it very quickly. I have put images up on my LCD TV that look great and my family has enjoyed my little slide shows. I dont see much that this thing is lacking except an onboard camera, being a cell phone, and a pda but then we would be talking $1000 dollars plus to pack all that into such a small package very nice addition to my tech collection.

<Title>Great way to back up photos - and share them with others
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the ESP 80 primarily so that I could back up photos while traveling, AND see they were actually saved before erasing my memory cards. However, I'm finding that it's a great way to share photos with other people, too. (It also works fine for me as an MP3 player.) It's a bit heavy to carry all the time, or I probably would.   The user interface took a little getting used to (sometimes I have trouble figuring out where you have to be in order for particular commands to be available) but it seems to be pretty consistent once you get the hang of it.  The biggest problem I've had is when people ask me, "What is it?" A photo magazine referred to the similar Epson device as a "storage viewer" and that's what I'm going to call it.

<Title>Pretty cool little gadget.
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased primarily for family photo backup on trips and vacations since it can read and backup almost any card. (ie; Everyone can use it with their respective cameras) I loaded about 15 documentaries into the video folder for viewing at our isolated vacation house. About 20% of them were incompatible file formats so I'm glad it's firmware upgradable. Easily hooks up to TVs for viewing on larger screen. The controls are completely logical. It automatically switches to 'Mass Storage Device' when the USB cable is used to connect computer. The 3.6" screen is amazingly clear. I actually watched a couple of the videos in the car. The Linux operating system allows you to create your own folder structure or view and inserted media card as a separate folder if you just want to view your photos. Great little MP3 player. The AC charger works on 110volt or european 220volt (with a 3d party socket adapter). Finally, can read text files. I dump my entire Palm content into a text file and have it available. &lt;------> DECEMBER 2007 update &lt;--------> Great news. Recently purchased a state-of-the-art 4GB SDHC media card and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Wolverine CAN read it. Not so for the card reader on my Dell Dimension E510. Be sure your Wolverine firmware Version is at least 1.2.8 - available at wolverinedata.com.
