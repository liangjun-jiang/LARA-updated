<Title>Way too much hassle
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So, I got my archos last week and i've been doodling with it - but get this: Playlists and videos don't work nearly as well as they should. Let's examine this:  1) Playlists. Do you want to be able to auto sync your WMP or media monkey playlists quickly to the archos? Sorry, won't happen, not even with the script someone came up with on archosforums. Even if you have your playlist in m3u, it gets converted to a non-playable wla file that crashes the archos. Fun right?  2) Videos. I use Clone DVD mobile to rip 720x404, 1900 bitrate. The videos work fine on my computer, but cut off 4/5 of the way through on the archos?  Are there ways around this? Well let's see. Like I said, someone created a script on mediamonkey to add playlists. I can't get it to work, but even so, why should you need a consumer-made script to get playlists to work? For videos, it's just finnicky with the encoding you use. Any hope for a firmware update to fix all this? Probably not if archos customer service is as bad as people say.  All in all, this was a waste of 380 as it has been more of a headache than a useful tool. Back to the store it goes. Of course, my alternative is an ipod. I might as well eat my own head.

<Title>Worthy new entry in the Archos lineup
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like many others, I gave up on my Amazon order and got it directly from Archos.  I've been happily playing with it for the last couple days and really quite happy.  To be fair, I am upgrading from the Archos 604 Wifi so I am already pretty well familiar with Archos' little quirks and such.   I also have a brand new iPod Touch which is a great product in its own way. Overall I think this product is worthy of a 5 star rating because it offers the most bang for the buck as it were, amazing features at a moderate price.  As is my wont, I start with the things I love:  1)  160 GB, whats not to love about that?  My brand new laptop has only 80GB, crazy to think that this little handheld PMP has more storage than my laptop or my desktop either for that matter! 2)  Awesome screen resolution: Wow thats a lot of pixels for such a small screen. 3)  Touch screen interface, very sensitive, and quite usable with or without a stylus (unlike the Touch which is not so sensitive).   4)  If you purchase the Video Podcast and Cinema plugins from Archos ($40) you can watch just about any video on this baby without any tedious conversions (unlike the iPods). 5)  Beautiful and colorful user interface, nice improvement on 604.  I especially like being able to see what the next and previous songs on the playlist are, the Now Playing screen is nicely laid out. 6)  Wifi is amazing, you can play videos off of your desktop computer or copy files from other computers.  In fact, I was even able to automatically upgrade the Archos firmware just by connecting to Wifi. 7)  Opera browser ($30 plugin) is very nice browser, works well with touch screen and supports YouTube and some other streaming video interfaces.   8)  Fantastic DVR dock allows you to output to pretty much any kind of cable and watch at nice resolution on the monitor of your choice.  This also includes a great remote control with a Blackberryish keyboard; again this is something I don't see available for iPods. 9)  Dedicated volume button (not available on Touch or 604). 10) You can actually edit, rename, delete, etc music, videos, playlists etc. on the  605 itself, you don't have to hook it up to a PC every time you want to make the slightest change or delete something you don't need anymore.  This is perhaps one of my biggest gripes about iPods in general.   11) Built-in viewing stand, how clever is that? 12) Indicator lights: I like the fact that you can see when the battery is charged, when the hard drive is running, if the TV-Out is on or the power is on without flipping through menus or turning the device on. 13)  Playlist editing/saving etc seems to work a lot better than it did on the 604. Just the fact that you can do this on the unit itself is a nice feature in comparison to iPods! 14)  I can use the drive as a data backup and it doesn't messup my music or cause undue delays like it did on my 604.   Of course, for me anyway, 5 stars doesn't mean perfection because there is no such thing in the world of technology.  5 stars means top of its class in my mind.  So with that disclaimer in hand, here are things about the Archos 605 that could use improvement:  1)  Hidden expense: To really get the full experience you should expect to spend an additional $100 to $150 for plugins and DVR dock etc.  Archos, like Apple, just gives you the bare minimum accessories with the product; not really enough to set you up in style.  To be fair, its the same deal with an iPod Touch!  In fact, apple has taken to charging for their new software features too :O 2)  Accessories:  don't expect to be able to walk into any electronics store and buy accessories for this baby.  I have had to order just about everything online -- btw I highly recommend the Noreve case for this player which can be bought on Amazon. 3)   Size:  with a screen this big and a 160GB disk don't be thinking this is just going to slide unobtrusively into your pocket like a Touch does.  It will fit in your pocket but you'll know its there. 4)  Lack of software aka there ain't no iTunes for this thing!  Making playlists is a bit tricky.  You will have to use something like Winamp or MediaMonkey or the player itself to make playlists.  This doesn't compare well to the air-tight integration of the iPod and iTunes system. 5)  No built-in USB port, you have to use the special cable provided or a dock to connect USB (this is a gripe I have about iPods too)! 6)  Volume is a bit on the quiet side,  I just run all my songs through "mp3gain" and set volume to 95dB and is plenty loud enough for me. Or you can use the battery dock which removes volume limiting restrictions. 7) Battery is not removable like the 604 was, its the price we pay for a slimmer profile I guess.  To be fair, this just makes Archos like Apple but I do miss being able to swap batteries.  Fortunately, you can use the battery dock to good effect or other external battery packs such as ones made by Tekkeon to extend the battery life of the unit.  In summary, this is not the most user-friendly player in the world.  But the features are spectacular and cutting edge.  This is not a player for the faint of heart but it is a very rewarding experience if you are willing to take the time to play with it.  Feature by feature it really blows the iPod Touch away.  If you are aware of the quirks of buying an Archos ahead of time, I guarantee you will be quite happy with this product.   Update after 4 months of ownership: still very happy with this product.  I've removed a few negative points because I feel that they weren't really relevant anymore, I get carried away with negative points sometimes!  I have had zero problems with this (making it more reliable than my Touch!) and it continues to be a great product.  In addition, firmware updates have added widgets and seem to have improved the sound as well as fixing bugs relating to ID tags and such.

<Title>An Ipod for adults
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The device is amazing.  It is not apple and so can be accessed as a hard drive by any windows computer (or linux for the geeks among us) and it will do it all.  Movies, music, pictures, videos, podcasts, record tv and playback to TV or Stereo system and it is simply the best media player currently available. The company misses some points but the are largely promotional and availability points not quality.  I couldn't be more pleased.

<Content>Great product!  Huge hard drive, fast load times, great screen (crisper and brighter than my old Zen vision w). Archos is updating the firmware for this thing often.  Did I mention that the Archos 605 supports A LOT of formats!!!  I have used this product for about a week and love it.    The only complaint I have is that I can not use my playlists in windows media player (the Archos 605 supports m3u playlists).  P.S. I typed this on my Archos 605!

<Title>Great but not an iPod replacement
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's a great device but....it's NOT an iPod replacement.  It's too big to carry in your pocket walking around the city.  The bottons are on the side and get pressed easily just rubbing against your leg.  Good thing winter is coming up so you'll have jacket pockets for your 605 so that issue can be avoided sometimes.   Again, for its size, it's too big to bring to the gym too.  This is ideal for plane trips or long commutes on a train.  This is not a pocket device.  As everyone says, the screen is really good.  It has a matte finish so it's not prone to fingerprints.  It seems like it woud be fairly resistant to minor scratches too.  While it can play DVD resolution files, it's limited to files 2GB and under (FAT 32 restriction I think).  So, ripping a 2 hour DVD at 2500kbps will leave you with a file to big to really handle.  Today, I couldnt xfer a 2.34GB file due to file size.  So, you're forced to lower bitrates or splitting files.  Anything over 2000kbps is overkill for the small screen anyway but it's needed if you want to watch something on your TV using the dvr station's video connections.     Speaking of the DVR, seems you're limited to 640x480 recording with a max bitrate of 2500kbps.  The bitrate isnt a problem but the resolution is smaller than what I would consider ideal for playback on my HD Plasma.  Guess there's only so much you can expect from the processor in the 605.  Once again, not a problem when viewing on the 605's screen (maybe a little hazy) but for playback on an HDTV, it leaves you wishing the rez was higher.  DVR scheduling and recording itself is good and very similar to set-top box DVRs.  Gives you warnings for recording conflicts etc.  Can automatically schedule listing downloads via wifi etc.  This is a well executed feature.  Audio functions are nice but one thing I noticed is that there's no instant Shuffle function.  You need to change the play-mode first and then go into the first album in your library to start shuffle mode.  Then, while you'll always hear the same first song in shuffle mode, all other songs will play in random as expected.  I wish it would always default to standard play mode and also offer a one-click shortcut to start playing in shuffle mode.  For unsupported file types like apple lossless/m4v files that you may have from itunes rips, the 605 doesnt handle it.  Rather than skip to the next playable file, it just stops and gives you a warning.  So, you may need to re-rip your CD's into playable formats to avoid this problem.  much of the device is plastic except for the bezel around the screen which is metal.  Seems pretty tough.   The USB connection is proprietary which is kind of a pain but given the connection features, you cant expect it to be anything else besides non-standard.   I wish the connection was on the side or top though.  If it's connected, you cant prop the device up with the kickstand - it stands tilted this way.  not a big deal though.  A secondary, mini USB (data only) connection would be ideal.  Charging with the ubs cable is painfully slow.  You really need the DVR station or other plug-in power sources for charging.  Its not realistic to deal with 6-8hours of slow charging via USB.  Get the DVR station for charging as well as other features that make this device shine.  Other great things about this device is video startup time.   Big, hi-rez files startup in under 3 seconds.  fast forwarding is also super quick.  Viewing photos is also superb - the interface is really nice and pics taken in 8+ megapixels are easy to flip though with little/no delays.  Havent tried RAW yet though.  that's all for now

<Title>Archos 605 Wi-Fi - This is it!
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, waiting for this device was frustrating but worth it.  I originally puchased from [...] but they have no idea what customer service is about so I bought from the beloved Amazon.com.  As always, seamless transaction.  I was so excited when I saw someone had it in stock I bought it.  Should have known better than to not get it from Amazon.  This device is finally it.  After iPods, Zen Micros, PDAs, Media Center Extenders, and all of the other devices I purchase to create my digital library, this is it.    I was shocked how easy the Archos was to setup straight out of the box.  I ordered a DVR station with it and it worked perfectly.  The pass-through allows you to view the Archos on your TV and watch movies, etc.  It took less than 5 minutes to get it to record TV.  Very smart interface and the docuing station can be sitting on top of a cable box and still send signals to change the channel.  To sum up how it works, you sign up for the free tv listing service online by your zip code and service provider, you then very easily tell the Archos what TV or DVR or Satellite box you want to control, test the IR repeater funtion works and youre done. You then view the listings on the screen, click on the shopw you want to record and the device does the rest.  It changes the channel on the cable box and starts recording.  Very very simple.  Video quality, awesome.  Very crisp display and good options for adjusting the picture quality.  My MOST favourite feature is no proprietary formats.  So, MP3s stay MP3s, WMV, Divx, etc.  The folder structure is quite easy to understand.  As soon as you dock it via USB you get folders such as "Data, Music, Pictures and Video" as a drive.  You simply drag whatever and boom, it's there and ready to play.  Sound quality is excellent (with headphones).  And then last night I discovered even a better feature.  Amazon's MP3 service.  Finally, purchasing digital music is without DRM, conversions, etc.  A comlpete package.  And no, I do not work for Amazon but I think they have it completely and totally "figured out".  So I highly recommend this baby.  The only "negatives" are the connector cable (proprietary USB 2.0 unless you have DVR station then it is standard) and a little bulky but worth it.  Everyone at my office now wants one.  I love showing it to the iPod Phone or Touch owners with their 16GB of solid state storage :)  In summary, if you want to consolidate your ENTIRE digital library, this is it.

<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 Wifi ROCKS!! The product is amazing because it offers all the same features as the iPod toutch and more for the same price or lower(depending on model). Flippin overrated iPods dont have a chance against the Archos. I have the 160GB version and I'm surprised of how small it is. Its no thicker than a classic PSP and the screen is amazing. I love how it has a kickstand for viewing movies, rather than holding it in your hands. I like almost EVERYTHING about it.   But the one drawback is that if you want internet you have to bust out $30 more since its not included. If you also have alot of videos downloaded from a p2p program most of them wont play without the Cinema plugin ($20). Other than that I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!

<Content>Got my 605 wifi after waiting over 2 months (way to long), got it charged and had just started loading it when it reset itself and flashed an error message. Gave the option to fix it, but would not called the company and now I have to return it, and it could take up to 45 days (their minimum estimate) to receive a replacement. NOT IMPRESSED.   User guide leaves alot to be desired, but hopefully the replacement will work properly.

<Title>Love it when it works:(
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the Archos 605 160Gb. I love this thing when it works.  I had it for 1 month with no problems.  Took extremely good care of it.  Kept the screen protector on it and kept it in its case in and that case in yet another case.  I put 100 movies on it, 1200 songs, a few thousand pictures, and all my camcorder movies too. I had all the plug ins. They cost..so figure in an extra $100 if you want to make the most of the product. I had the dvr station too another $80.  The DVR station came in with the audio out lines blown. But I used it to convert all my camcorder movies onto the unit; very easily too. Then the problems started. It would not always turn on. The problem got to the point that it came to 29/30 times it would not turn on. The majority of the time the green power light came on...but nothing on the hdd red light. Sometimes I would just get a quick flash or two from the hdd light and (maybe) even get the archos boot up logo. Usually with lines going through it horizontally and then the unit would lock up. This all started at 1 month of ownership. This is when I requested my rma. I kept it a few more weeks to back it up, trying reformats through the unit, and to reinstall firmware. It got to be impossible to deal with at 2 months. I backed up my 100+ gig of data to my computer, though it took me an hour just to power on the archos to do so. It did not seem to make any difference on how full the battery was or not. Now I have sent the unit in next day air to archos. 49 hours after ups tracking shows they got it; their website still shows it not received. Each time I call I waste 30-40 minutes on hold to get through to anyone. They say they have it and it will take (10-15 business days) to test and fix or replace it. Excluding any shipping. This just seems absurd to me. This was a lot of money to me, its new, and now I lose the unit for a month. Should this not be their problem??? Why is it mine? Am I the only one out there that is going through this???  I still think I would recommend the unit.  I just hope you get a good one.  I would rebuy at this point, but not sure if my opinion will stay that way.  I do wish there was an fm tuner, flash capability, and voice recorder.  But for the price, the size of the hard drive, and what it can do;  It is worth it.  If it works!

<Title>Hard to Beat the Versatility
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I finally broke down and decided to upgrade my MP3 player to a portable media player.  I had originally wanted to get an iPod, but was mostly weary of compatibility with my library.  After lots of research, I decided to go with the 160 GB Archos 605 because it was essentially an 160GB iPod meshed with an iTouch.  It also had PlaysForSure backing up the fact that it will play just about anything.  I had some trouble at first with the player.  It took almost a full day to charge the player, and it wouldn't run off auxiliary power from my computer.  I also had trouble syncing it with my Windows Media Player (WMP).  I don't normally use WMP, so I didn't like this feature.  After getting my music on it, I realized that it filed the MP3's based on the ID3 tags (like WMP), not the folders they were in.  Most of my music was sorted by genre on my computer, so I had trouble finding all of it.  Also, it was tough to make playlists at first for this reason.  It also froze and crashed a lot the first few days.  I figured out that this is because once you open a playlist and are playing it, you can't really decide to load a new playlist without closing the old one.  I also had trouble connecting to the internet via WiFi to download plug-ins.  That all being said, I still give it 4 stars.  I have learned to deal with most of the issues above.  It still sometimes crashes when I decide I want to listen to a particular song after loading a playlist, but oh well.  I found out that you don't have to sync it with WMP.  I didn't have any playlists in WMP, so I don't know if they carry over by syncing it.  You can transfer files like you would with any other external device by going to My Computer and draging and dropping files in the correct folder.  This is how I transfered video to it, and how I will transfer all my new music.  This is also the easiest way to update your Archos and buy plug-ins.  I had trouble with Archos' site, but their phone help was very good and even just had me do it over the phone and emailed me the plug-in.  Most of my AVI files played without the Cinema plug-in, but about 40% didn't.  I got the Cinema plug-in and I have only found one particular file that didn't play because of the compression ratio.  The picture is amazing and I like it very well.  The sound isn't quite as good because it sometimes isn't loud enough.  Especially on an airplane, some of my files cannot be heard, even with my noise cancelling head phones.  I will have to edit the file to increse the volume.  I dabbled a little with the online media available for free through Archos' site on DailyMotion.  It dl'ed very quickly and was very good quality for the player.  Eventually I will buy the Web Browser plug in, but right now it doesn't make sense since I have a laptop.  I like that you can plug it in to the cradle or a computer and charge it while listening to music or playing video.  I also got the DVR and it plays very easily onto any TV.  You have to be sure your TV or cable box has an S-video output or you cannot record TV with your Archos.  Mine doesn't, so I haven't been able to try out this feature.  The battery is only about 4 hours for video and browsing, so you have to plan your time carefully.  I have not figured out how long the music is for it yet, but it is plenty long enough.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the player and will be even more satisfied when I am able to record TV.  Tech support has also been pretty good as well, although I haven't had any big problems yet.

<Title>Archos is a winner in my book...
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been mouth-watering after one of these for a while. I finally took the plunge and bought it. It did not take too much time to learn the new interface. I got the 160gb version so I have a lot of storage space for anything from music, music videos to movies and yeah not to forget pictures. Since I watch video podcasts I did have to get the podcast plug in for it so that was extra $20. Then I was wondering about the whole Opera browser so I bought that to for $30. And then since I own a good selection of music videos which are stored in mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 formats, I went for the final plug-in for additional $20. The additional charges aside, the player right out of the box doesn't have its own power supply. You will have to use supplied USB cable to charge it and it will take painfully long to do so. I would suggest getting either one of the docking stations (preferably the DVR one) or get a power supply from Archos website. After that's all and done, trust me, you won't be wondering why oh why didn't I get the Ipod Touch. I was pondering on this a while myself as to which player I want. First of all, Archos has more storage, second it reads more formats, third you can stream videos/music and view pictures from your own network (or somebody else's if you into this kind of thing) using the built-in wifi.   Using the DVR option you can record whatever you want from tv and carry it around with you. Comparing it to the fancy touch screen on the ipod touch, that's where the novelty ends with Apple for me. Archos has a bigger screen and it's also touch screen and it is very responsive.  The headphones that come with the Archos are ok, but getting something like Sennheiser PX100 headphones (which are rather inexpensive and available here on Amazon) will make your PMP sound a lot better. Speaking of sound, the player has a bass boost with several levels as well as preset equalizers to choose from or you can just set your own equalizer to your liking. I've only tried it with MP3 files and I had no problems since sound quality. I guess I am not that needy.   The video portion which I am sure you are most interested in, I did not have too many problems with. I've tried MP4, MOV (h.264 and normal quicktime/apple format), WMV, AVI (xvid/divx) but for now it will only play videos with resolutions up to 720x575. I've tried HD but the player refused to play these files. Archos however, is promising 720p support through either firmware update or a plug-in. It will not play Sorenson Squeeze codecs.  The touch screen will be a learning curve especially if you never used one before; example being the virtual keyboard and navigating the interface. This brings me to the Opera browser and WIFI. Before you can browse, you have to sign yourself into the network which is easy if you are a techie, but if you are not, the user's guide is accommodating and is in several languages :) Once that's all and done, I naturally went for the Google page since it always shows up. By double tapping in one spot (with new firmware update) you can zoom in, but providing you are not far sided sitting in front of it without glasses, you should be able to see the letters on the high resolution (for a PMP) screen. By default the whole page will fit on your screen. Various zoom options are available which show up whenever you are in the browser mode and tap on the screen. None of the Ajax stuff will work properly in the browser (it doesn't work in the desktop version either) so unfortunately Google maps are out of our reach for now. Instead you can use something like [...]. For me, that's where testing for internet browsing ended since the player crashed while browsing Google maps freezing the whole unit. Like most computers (no matter what size) a quick power down and power up will fix that. VP6 encoded flash videos are not supported by this player which is a shame because a lot of content on the net uses that codec. If there is a direct download of other file formats for download, the browser will present you with a choice to either play them (stream it) or download it to your player once you click on any. It would also be nice if the browser be faster because it gets painfully slow sometimes. The pages on websites do render correctly, but long. The browser has no problems with YouTube videos/website either.  Although you can play music in the background while in your PMP's menu interface, once you access the browser, PDF reader, or try to manipulate your files, the music stops and doesn't remember where it stopped. It would be nice if they fixed that with the next firmware update. But if they don't, you can however quickly go back into the song played and fast forward using the touch screen and scroll to the point where the music was playing before. Archos 605 does have up to 32 bookmarks available for position marking for both your music and videos so you can resume it at a later time, only one bookmark per file.  The PDF reader can only be accessed through the file manager discussed later in this review. There is a PDF reader which can be a cool addition for reading books, but loading pages takes what is seems like forever and you can only read pages in 5:3 mode (player's normal holding position) and can't be flipped. There are some zoom options but that's about it for PDF features. You can also view text files all with the help of the browser.  Picture viewer does have a few nice features that do allow you to browse through your pictures using the touch screen by swiping your finger from left to right going forward or right to left going backwards. Bottom to left and vice-versa will rotate the picture 90 degrees. Zooming in and out is better navigated using the buttons on the side however. There seems to be also a limitation on how big the pictures have to be, to be viewed. My own experience taught me that you may have problems with some Jpegs over 7 mega pixels but I haven't tested that further.  File Manager will be useful to copy, delete, and rename files stored on your Archos. From there however you can access much more like your networked files stored on other computers/devices which are sharing allowing you to stream them. If you get one of the docking stations, and connect a flash drive or a hard drive, it will also show up there. Little tabs on the top of your screen allow you to choose which of the two columns you are navigating enabling you to say copy a file from one location to another by opening folders in each.  When you go into the WIFI settings, you can turn on the server option making the Archos a wireless server which can be password protected if you wish and accessible from anywhere on your network.   My overall experience with the player is very positive, I think mostly from excitement, so I can't think objectively, but I think you'll be happy if you get one of these. If you travel a lot for long trips across Atlantic, on a train, or are passenger in a car, you will appreciate lack of boredom :) and you just can't beat the portability of this little gem.

<Title>problematic
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Received the Archos 605 wifi on tuesday. It looked great, the videos and everything. I purchased the plugins (cinema, podcast, webbrowser) on wednesday it was wonderful, downloaded the new firmware, I even tried to convert some Ipod addicted friends to archos. Unfortunatly for me, my archos is no longer recognize by my PC (windows vista) (device not recognized) since Friday. I tried it on a Win XP system but the same thing. (I did the master reset, factory reset, download the drivers on the archos website).

<Title>A stellar personal multimedia player
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If Archos, the company, had competent management, its products would be world class. Unfortunately, the company's management is not overly competent, so it turns out near exellent to excellent products that take a clobbering in the marketplace.    The Archos 605 160 GB is a superb product, but its introduction was marred by lack of availability which created a lot of ill will among people who very much wanted it. Wait times of three or more months were not uncommon - and the company remained silent. Truly a stupid thing to do. Even now, months after release, promised accessories are still not available - and Archos simply doesn't communicate with its customers. If you read the Archos support forums on the web, you also get the impression that Archos customer support stinks as well.    Given all that, I am very pleased with the Archos 605.    The Archos 605 160 GB is everything you'd want in a personal multimedia player. The 160 GB hard drive will hold up to 200 feature length movies at acceptable resolution or more hours of music than you could listen to.    The screen is superb. 4.3" at 800x480 resolution is large enough to display most movies that don't go overboard on dark, moody scenes. Almost all common formats are supported out of the box. Playback is flawlessly smooth.    Navigating the touchscreen is simple. The side mounted buttons are very convenient for controlling most functions. A major improvement is the inclusion of a volume button. The front mounted speaker is surprisingly sufficient, especially compared to the Archos 504. Headphone volume and fidelity is more than sufficient.    I use the Archos 605 primarily for video playback and think it is faultless; much better than the 5G iPod with video. Yes, it is physically larger, but it is far better suited to the purpose than the iPod. The screen is acres larger than the iPod - at least it seems that way when you are watching a video. The speaker is very nice and something the iPod doesn't have. A little kickstand lets you set the unit on a table to watch. Way cool.    Music seems to work well, handling a number of formats and being accessible without the need for special software like iTunes. Just drag and drop. I haven't yet tried creating playlists. Some people have commented that it is a chore.    As a photo viewer, it has some cool features. Just drag left or right to get to the next or previous picture. Drag up or down and the photo rotates. You can zoom the image from a sidebar and navigate with your finger. Cool. And, again, the screen is stunning.    There's also a file manager which comes in handy if you use the Archos as removable storage for your PC. It functions just like any other USB removable hard drive.    One of the other unsavory aspects of Archos management is that they are as chintzy as Apple. For example, you don't get an AC adapter with this almost $400 device. You get a USB cable which you can use to charge the device - and which takes forever.    A number of other features are add-ons as well. Though the Archos is WiFi enabled, they charge extra for the Opera browser, which is more than adequate for handling Flash videos. They also charge extra for plug-ins to access H.264 and MPEG-2 formats. The argument is that Archos doesn't want to charge people for features they don't want. Uh, considering what it would cost Archos to bundle these features, I think the motive is pure greed. (A PDF viewer comes standard.)    Then there are the docks. You can get one to make the Archos into a DVR. Actually you can get one for stationary use or another for travel. There's another dock to that permits you to download pictures from your digital camera. And another that has a backup battery.    Overall, the Archos has the potential of taking a bunch of bucks out of your pocket.    But when it comes to a platform for viewing video or photos, browsing the web wirelessly and listening to music, the Archos 605 is in a league of its own.  Jerry

<Title>Nice, but not without quirks
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned this device for about a month now (after waiting for quite a few weeks for the backorders on Amazon to fill).  Overall I am pleased with it, but I cannot say I endorse it whole-heartedly.  There are enough little quirks and annoyances that I would caution anyone thinking of buying one to reconsider before clicking that Purchase button.   Don't get me wrong: the nice features are very nice indeed.  The screen is bright and clear and the capacity can't be beat.  The UI is pretty and the wi-fi works well.  As others have addressed all of these points, I'll concentrate on the things I found somewhat surprising upon opening the box.  The quirks range from minor annoyances to serious issues, ranked below accordingly.  - The audio is indeed *much* too low.  It's fine for quiet situations, and usually not bad if the particular audio track is recorded at a high level.  However, I have tried to watch certain movies on a commuter train (with what I would call a moderate noise level) and the audio track is completely indecipherable at max volume.  If you're going to use this out in public (and isn't that the point of the whole device?), you're going to need noise-cancelling headphones at a minimum.  - This is a portable device, but I would not call it a "pocket" device.  It has some serious heft to it (especially the 160 gb version) and it's pretty big.  Fortunately, most of the device is taken up by the screen, which makes it more worthwhile; still, this is not at all something you stash in your shirt pocket.  - Plenty of others have mentioned the short battery life, but it bears repeating.  This is especially notable since the battery is non-removable, so you're completely stuck with it unless you're using some external power.  I find it reasonable for most uses, but don't forget to recharge at the end of every day or it will become a doorstop on your next commute.  - Generally the OS works well, but sometimes loads very slowly (hourglass or splash screen for quite a few seconds) and occasionally outright crashes.  I have had to reset the device a handful of times already.  - The audio track on large video files (2+ hour movies) can get out of synch with the picture if you jump around too much using the controls.  This is especially sad because there is absolutely NO "resume" functionality, so you are forced to load the file from the beginning and jump forward if you are resuming watching a file.  - The touchscreen works well overall, but the smaller buttons can be fairly difficult to press.  (The pop-up USB activation button sometimes requires some serious button-mashing in particular.)  - The unit comes with two plastic styli to use on the touchscreen, but there's absolutely nowhere to store them.  (i.e. they don't attach to the device as is the case with pretty much every other stylus-using device.)  It's nice having a stylus but this screams "Lose me."  - The PDF browser is *extremely* slow.  It can take upwards of 30 seconds to draw each individual page, and any slight navigation or zooming can cause it to redraw forever again.  Not to mention it seems like they are just "printing" the content to a PostScript file and then displaying it, so protective "print only" watermarks actually show up on the screen.  I was looking forward to this feature for browsing scans of some graphic novels, but the load times make this far too frustrating to be practical.  - The DVR function is somewhat of a joke.  I'm not even sure why they include the "TV Guide" and timer functionality, since it won't record anything unless your TV and cable box are on the right channel at the right time.  It will record TV shows, but I'm not sure what functionality the "DVR" adds since it's pretty much the same as just connecting the device and pressing record when your show is on.  - On a related note, the optional "DVR Station" is also somewhat of a joke.  I think it flirts with false advertising to label a device as a "TV recorder" when it doesn't even accept a cable signal.  It's really just a docking station with some additonal outputs, and doesn't get around the fact that you have to manually set your TV and cable anyway.    - The manual that explains the functions of the device is wrong in many places.  For example, the placement and function of the LEDs is completely different than the diagram.  (In fact, for some inexplicable reason the HDD light is on the *back* of the device, so you never really see it.)  I suspect they cut and pasted the diagram from another device (the 04 series?) and didn't update.  Somewhat minor, but there are enough functions on the device that this is annoying when trying to learn them all.  All in all, you might find this device useful if the above quirks don't really bother you.  It's still fairly nice to have on a long commute, but it's not quite the "wonder device" that some have painted it to be.

<Title>Great Potential for Gen 6 *if and only if*...
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, this thing totally breaks ground, and will force apple to be more competitive and innovative thankfully.  Mainly I got it to get away from the proprietary crap that apple stuffs in its products.  Personally I go for function over form and branding, and the same people who like Volkswagens like Apple products mainly for form not function.  Anyways here's what needs improvement in the Generation 6 that is not even slated to exist yet.  1) Battery needs to be removeable and there needs to be an external charger so you can always have fresh charged battery to swap out with a used up one, and so you don't have to use the device itself to charge the battery (cuz if its mobile you want to be moving around, not tied down to a PC or outlet so you can have the juice you need).  2) Battery needs to last way longer!  Plain and simple.  The advertised battery times are way off.  I haven't had mine last for longer than five hours ever no matter what I'm doing with it.  3) Make it a multimedia device.  We're going back to windows 3.1 functionality with this thing.  I should be able to listen to music while using the internet...  4a) which leads to FIX THE BUGS! SO IT DOESN'T CRASH SO MUCH!  4b) Actually, the crashes are likely due to an insufficient amount of onboard system memory (aka RAM in the PC scene) and a processing chip that needs more muscle.  It seems to happen any time you try to rapidly move through menus or make more than three touch screen presses very quickly.  The little hour glass that comes up after you make some selections is a clue to this fact.  They must have known the processing would be slightly weaker than instant or else they never would have decided to put the little hour glass symbol into the software.  Again this is something that reminds me of Windows 3.1.  Please make the next device true multimedia (multiple media forms that can be going simultaneously).  5) Standard USB please, no need for proprierary.  6) **HUGELY IMPORTANT*** make a customized rubber condom for the thing that absorbs shock if you drop it, and which allows you to still use it in everyway while the rubber is on it (cuz you're going to drop it and it weighs a ton, so its gonna hurt it unless you have the silicone condom on it).  They have these for Ipods, get them for Archos!  7) As others have said, the user manual is lacking.  Also, how about a paper copy of it in full, or at least a sheet of paper that tells you where to find it on the device (I didn't realize it was in a PDF on the device until a week of using it and recreating the wheel to figure out how it functions).  10) Slot for the stylus!  You lose it otherwise... plain and simple.  11) Get your own sync software please, cuz I don't want to use WinXp which is what I'd have to do to be able to use the sync function on Win Media Player 11 which only works with XP and newer OS.  12) Make the internet more smooth and less power eating.  Its pretty much a novelty as it is.  Not practical to use... so your use of it will atrophy quickly.  It needs to be easier to type and mouse around.  It takes forever to enter in the slightest thing by typing. [The remote for the DVR adapter really helps in this area, but you can't take it with you because the dvr adapter is not portable since it needs a AC power source (plugs into the wall) and you wouldn't want to cuz its pretty big.  The travel version of the dvr adapter doesn't come with a remote.]  13) Audio recording was adverted as being built in.  They didn't tell you  that you need the DVR station or travel DVR to record notes to self.  All recording functionality should be inside the device itself, cuz daisy chaining a bunch of adapters makes an already large and heavy device impossible to bring with you very easily.  All this said, the 605 is an important step.  But, you might want to just wait until Generation 6 comes out if you really want all this stuff to work as it should.  And I'd add that Archos needs to get better information out there about what the device has for functions.  It takes a lot of research to find out good information on what all the device actually does and doesn't do, and you usually have to trust third party sources who don't seem too confident in the info they're telling you, like the folks on the archosfans forums.  It just shouldn't be so hard to get full information on the device!  That said, it works just as good as an ipod.  So, even if some of the archos features don't work in a practical manner, remember that ipods don't have these functions at all (or if they do the Iphone only has 16 puny gigs).  So, while archos can deliver poorly on expectation, it still does better than ipods.   Its up to you.  If you're not doing the mp3 player thing yet and you're thinking of jumping into this game, then I would counsel to wait until the next round of products in a year or so.  There's a lot happening now, but as usual when new stuff comes out they don't get it right the first time.  ***Addendum added after two months of owning the 605: I am very satisfied with my 605 even though it has the problems listed above.  You have to remember that it is way better than an ipod, and realize that this is a great step forward for pmp's and the first step toward a true convergence device.  Without the 605 there could never be a 606 in the future.  While they didn't get everything right, they got most of it.  Definitely glad I got the DVR Adapter with its awesome remote control!

<Title>I love it, but...
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my Archos 605 last night, and I love it. I'm so glad I got it. I had been going so long without carrying my music with me, that something in me really had begun to die.. My 605 is bringing it back to life.  So to make this short (others have already said whats great about this product), you won't be TOO disappointed if you buy this item. Its good, but not perfect.  The negative things I have noticed are that the interface is not all that intuitive. Playlist editing on this thing is no where near as easy as it should be. Its too hard to create new playlists, and add songs to them. Adding a song to a playlist (ANY playlist) should take no more than three steps.  You should download the new firmware immediately when you buy this item.  All in all, I like this item, I'm glad I bought it. But for $400+ (w/ the DVR thingy) it could be WAY better.  UPDATE: I removed the stuff about not being able to resume, and not being able to lock the player; I found those functions after a bit of trial and error. (Thank you to the people who left comments..) Since those were two of my biggest complaints, I have to give the 605 one more star for a total of four now; if only I could figure out how to get Amazon to let me do that. :-/

<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned my archos 605 wifi for about 70 days now. I am a high school student and this gets me throught the day. All I do is record jay leno and conan o'brien at night and watch it during free time in class. The people around me all have video Ipods and were very confused when I pulled out my 160 gig monster. the battery will get me throught the day.I did a battery test because I thought that it was broken but the battery lasted 4 hours 40 min so close to 5 hour on video on full screen brightness. I love this device. I started with the archos av480 as my first inconveniently large mp3 player and people were amazed with that.both of my archoses batteries are integrated. my av480 has a fried battery that will not even power up the device. eventually the 605 will be like that but this one I will get fixed.

<Title>Great Great Product
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this primarily to be able to hook the 605 up to my TV.  I have my complete movie collection compressed to DIVX on external hd's and wanted an alternative to play them on my tv.  This product performs that product perfectly.  I have not tested the DVR function at this time so I have not ran into the problems with the power function that others have.  One thing I was disappointed with is that the advertisment said it would play HD.  I have several movies compressed into an HD format and they do play but the HD quality does not come through the composit video jacks and I have not been able to make the S-Video work at this time... not sure that it works at all.  I would certainly recomend this product to anyone with a compressed video collection.  Plus it charges the unit in about an hour.

<Title>Works great, budget in an extra 100$ for plugins and accessories
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the 160GB 605 for two weeks now and I'm quite satisfied with it. The first one I received had a defective hard disk and had to be exchanged for a replacement from Amazon (which is a quick and painless process by itself), and the replacement has been going great guns so far.  Things I like: - You can navigate without using the touchscreen - the side buttons give you access to everything you might want to do, except perhaps browsing on the internet - If you buy the web browser plugin (Opera, $20), you can browse the web and watch videos on youtube. I was also able to stream music/radio which is a really welcome feature. - Flick through photos on the screen like the iphone - fun! - Oodles of space and a large screen. My music collection isn't so large, but it's good to know that I have the extra space - You can check and download updates directly on the device when you're connected to the internet, so no more fiddling with the PC or Mac - Works great with my macbook pro, showing up as an external disk - Personalization! Some color support, but you can choose any picture or any frame of a video to set as the background for the home screen.  Things I'm not too hot about: - The 20$ for the browser, 20$ to play raw DVD files (in the vob format) - USB charging is pretty slow, and it's 30$ for a mini dock or 50$ for a dock with an additional battery. - Though you can play raw dvds with the 20$ plugin and choose the soundtrack, you can't use subtitles, which I'm hoping comes in a future update. - Recording is only available if you spring for the 100$ dvr base, playback on the tv only available if you choose the dock or the base (50 - 100$)  Overall, it's a great device, and well worth the $480 (device and accessories/plugins) I've paid for it so far. Battery life and general build quality remains to be seen :)

<Content>The device is pretty cool.  The weak battery life is a serious minus.  The TV Schedule upload doesn't work and therefore I cannot use the DVR functions of my docking station...and since getting help from their tech support is impossible (I have been trying to get someone for the past 2 weeks!!!!!!!!!)  I am considering returning it to get a Zen vision even if it only has 30GB (my Archos has 160GB).  What a shame!  This product had so much potential - but the frustration of dealing with such incompetent buffoons has taken all the joy out of the experience.

<Title>Only buy if you need the features unique to it
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>There are two types of people who will not be unhappy with this product. First there is the casual user who wants lots of space, no hassle or forced software to load media up and dosen't care too much about tech stuff like pixel resolution, is not an audiophile and doesn't mind Archos' "nickel and dime" approach to charging you.  Second is the technical savvy geek who needs the specific things that only an Archos can give you. The three things are:  1) Massive storage (160gb) 2) USB host 3) Wifi hard drive  If you fit either of these types of user, then go ahead otherwise you will just be unhappy and join the ranks who wish they bought a Cowon. Why? I only have 300 words so I am going to list it out:  1) Do not let the linux base of this device fool you. This is a locked down device.   2) It only supports 720x480 res video (or the equivelent PAL vertical res if on PAL mode) eventhough the Archos has a 800x480 res. Your video will either have black bars or will be scaled to oversize, your choice.  2) If you want a remote, you MUST buy the DVR station and not the mini one. Only the full DVR station has an IR receiver. The full DVR dock is huge not something you would ever want to travel with.  3) Archos' "nickel and dime" approach to squeeze money out of you is rather irritating. For me its not the money, but it means you have to carry, keep track of, etc these docks when you travel with them.  This unit does not have a replaceable battery, so you NEED the battery dock (otherwise your battery life is terrible).  I've hit the word limit but there are 4 other items on this list.

<Title>The WORST customer service!!
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am fed up with Archos customer service.  The TV program guide feature wouldn't work on my 605 Wifi and it wouldn't accept the firmware upgrade.  Sent it in to Archos (on my dime of course).  They kept it for over 2 weeks, sent it back and it still doesn't work.  No explanation.  So I finally found time to call customer service (It can take up to an hour on hold to get to talk to someone).  They gave me the run around.  My daughter ordered the leather case for me for Christmas.  After the Christmas rush died down and I had time to try it out, I had to cram it into the case so tight I thought it would break.  Then I couldn't plug the cable in to use it in the car since the little hole in the leather was too small and didn't line up.  The whole thing is a bad design.  Also bought a pack of styli which were not the original ones but tiny good for nothing ones.  Called customer service to return them and was informed you have to return within 7 days of Christmas! Period!  Supposedly talked to the supervisor and she was no help at all.  I would NOT recommend buying any Archos product unless you enjoy disappointment and frustration!

<Title>Not a Steller Music Player
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My primary reason for purchasing this unit was for the large amounts of memory and the good reviews.  Once I received it I found how buggy it's operating system is and how user-friendly it is NOT.  I spent at least 20 hours working on it trying to copy music playlists from my computer to the Archos 605.  I tried numerous methods and software applications and could never get it to work.  My daughter showed me her ipod touch and I discovered how much easier tasks are on it.  My daughter and I have had a friendly debate on who got the best product - I had to concede that for what we wanted to use it for, she did.   Also, Amazon willingly took the product back, but it has taken them over two weeks to refund my money to my credit card.

I gave it a few weeks and I had nothing but trouble with it.  Either it didn't charge, locked up, wouldn't sync, you name it.  All calls to their support were pretty useless with the vague answer of "reset" the unit.    If I could rate this with negative stars - I would.  It's not worth the one star they make you select.  The only GOOD thing about the product - Amazon refunded my money.  I switched to a Zen Vision W - 60G - it's AWESOME and their support is great and helpful.    Seriously, I will NEVER buy or recommend Archos to anyone.

<Title>Awesome Player!

<Content>This player is awesome. I almost didn't buy it after reading the negative reviews. I have since realized that many such reviews are by users who are ignorant of the proper usage of this piece of equipment. Archos 605 wifi is more than just a standard PMP (personal media player).   For instance, some complain about the absence of a standard USB cable. But the Archos 605 has features that go beyond what a regular USB cable is able to handle. When plugged into the DVR dock (purchased separately) the player becomes a DVR which records from any television signal.   I was able to attach the DVR dock to my cable box. At first I was unable to get my Pioneer cable box to respond to the DVR. But then I selected Time-Warner cable instead of Pioneer (the maker of the box) and the signals worked.   The dock has an infrared emitter which turns the cable box on and off and changes the box to the channel I have programmed the player to record. The recording and playback itself is flawless. The screen resolution is great and allows you to read titles and text clearly.  Using the built in wireless feature I seamlessly updated the firmware and also updated the cable program guide for Time-Warner NY city area.  The TV guide system works as it should. The guide is up to date and I would just select a program from the guide, touch the record icon, put the player in the DVR dock and forget it. Next day the program, properly titled, is in my REC folder on the player.  The battery life is satisfactory. New users must allow it fully charge before first time use. You should not turn the player off to recharge it. Just turn it on, plug the USB adapter to a PC or the DVR dock, select charge and leave it. The system will go to sleep by itself during the charging cycle. If you turn it off during charging you will not see the blinking fully charged light.  The buttons at the side are very useful when I don't want to obscure the touch screen to activate features.  MP3s sound good and picture viewing was a breeze. I was able to flip through images by just dragging my finger across the touch screen.  I haven't yet used it for internet browsing but will add to this post as soon as I do.
