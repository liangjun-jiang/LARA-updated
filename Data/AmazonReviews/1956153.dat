<Content>When my daughter began downloading music to the ipod it immediately froze and was not functioning at all.The ipod was returned and another ipod(same brand) was mailed to me immediately.A couple of months later it froze again.I didn't bother to return the product and disposed it.

<Content>bought this thing about 3 weeks ago.  And for the first 2 weeks it was fine, and I couldn't have been happier with my purchase, but then during week 3 the Ipod started to freeze up on me, and I couldn't get it working again.  And apple's tech support was no help, they basically restated the same stuff from the support section on their website.  Waste of money....I'm sure there's a better mp3 player somewhere....hopefully I'll find it...this was too much money to spend on something that was just going to break down 3 weeks after I bought it.
