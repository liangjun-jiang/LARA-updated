<Title>Very bad company!
<Date>Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I paid over $200 for this product and have owned it for over a year. It stopped working altogether. No music, no nothing. So what will the company do about that?... nothing! By checking their website, I have found out that after 60 days of use of the product, they charge $12.99 just to talk to you about any problem. So I sent them an e-mail instead. Their website said they would respond for free. Four days later... no response. So what to do?... throw the $200 product away and buy a new one or pay them their $12.99 just to ask them what if anything I can do? The Creative company sucks big time and should be avoided.

<Title>Don't waste your money
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After just several months my Zen Micro stopped working. Won't charge, won't come on, nothing. I never even dropped it or anything. I looked on the web for tips and found TONS of people have had the exact same problem with theirs. I wish I had just bought an IPOD like I wanted in the first place. It also looks like creative isn't helpful at all. Research the web  before you buy this product!

<Title>Reliability Issues
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product over two years ago.  I had to get used to having my music organized by album.  The device has taken its fair number of falls.  My first problem with this player happened a few months into use.  The back battery cover became loose; it would slide off if I kept it in my pocket.  The user replaceable batter was part of the reason I bought the devise.  The battery life is now at around three hours when fully charged.  A replacement battery would be $40 and not worth the price.    There were several times in which I thought it would never work again.  At one point I had to delete my entire library and get new firmware.  One of my friends had to do the same with his Zen Micro.  My friend's headphone jack became loose after less than a year.  The mp3 player is useless when the headphone jack goes.  You can only hear part of the music (e.g. the vocals or bass).  My headphone jack became loose a few months later.  I couldn't just put the device in my pocket and go.  It needed to be held in just the right position for the headphone jack to function.  Now, my Zen only works in the docking station I bought for it.  The docking station is not portable.  I invested over thee-hundred dollars into the device and attachments and it doesn't serve its intended purpose a few years later.  I had expected long-term use.

<Title>Great sound...poor battery life....
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great sound on this sleek Micro Mp3. However the battery charge is poor... it only last a little over 3 hrs of playing your favorite tunes. Then it shuts off.  The AC chargers sold here are not comparable...I already bought 2 and they did not work. I'll have to buy the creative charger connector. Should have bought them in the first place, would have avoided all these  extra$$$$$ cost.

<Title>Creative Zen Micro 5 GB
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The only problem I have with it is the 5 GB isn't large enough for me. I probably should have thought ahead more concerning the disk space I would eventually need. Other than that it has been great. It has a nice battery life that's easy to charge with the USB cable or the separate charger you can buy. It's also really easy to use and has a good navigation system between files. I'd recommend it for listening to smaller quantities of music or as a good 5 GB jump drive.

<Title>useless
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this machine for a while now. I couldnt get it working the first time i tried , so i put it away for a while. I just tried again and it hasnt been any easier. First of all , I am fairly good using computers. I run a clean and lean machine. The software is horrible with this unit. I am having a terrible time making the PC recognize it. There doesnt seem to be any way to simply drag and drop music files into the unit. The zen explorer software is horrible. It is also the slowest to install software I have ever installed. I cant imagine what the resource drain is. It feels like one just goes in circles trying to update files from the creative site and tech support comes in drips and drabs They mostly tell you the same thing over and over anyway. On the machine itself , I can not figure out how to skip a space when entering text info. I also can not figure out how to stop the machine from automaticly playing tunes when i turn the unit on. It seems to rcognize a track #10 and up as the second track rather than 10. Oh yeah , another thing is the battery doesnt seem to stay charged for long at all , way shorter than what they say. I am very unhappy with this $200 purchase and I wish there was a way to get my money back.

<Title>Do the firmware update.
<Date>Sat Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently bought the micro for the daily commute to work. Didn't work well,but then I downloaded the firmware update.Works great now.I use the real rhapsody download service,and can download as many songs as I want.It's a beautiful thing.Some sites say that there is no "all tracks" option,but yes there is.Don't be afraid to push on the pad,as that is how you get control.If you barely touch it,there is no control.Overall a great unit.Great sound output too.

<Title>good mp3 player overall
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this mp3 is very nice, its my third in 2 years and is the best over all. i wanted rhapsody to go which works great with this player but i needed a firmwire update, i was quite nervous durring the update because it erases the entire hard drive and reprograms, so if anything went wrong i would have a heep of plastic. but i didnt and the rhapsody service works good with it.  pros- - nice set up on current playing track similar to ipod - battery life is quite good - the touch wheel is nice but a little over sensitive (use lock feature at top) -HAS AMAZING SOUND even with the cheap head phones included - gets great radio reception with the ability to save 32 radio frequences and you can title them all - gets very loud, you can turn it up all the way and not have to use the ear buds - dj feature keeps track of most and least played, plus has an album of the day feature -clock, planner, alarm clock and many other orginizational features  cons- -horrible manual not even joking there are 10 pages in english and it is about inserting your battery and turning your player on so figuring out things is a hassle -battery take about 2 or 3 hours to charge, you might want to get a spare - the case included with some purchases is plastic and hard and always freaks my out when i try to get my micro out of it - the usb cord is hard to detach i always feel like im gonna break it - there have been many reports of the head phone jack getting loose and comming out (but no such thing is occuring in mine)  but otherwise this is an extremly good player with great sound and great features, it has verry similar controls to an ipod (but many more features) plus it works with almost all to go services which is nice because my family pays 15 bucks a month on rhapsody and in the past week or so i have gotten over 300 or 400 songs! no more 99 cent deals.

<Title>Only 3 stars because of certain malfunctions.
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My boyfriend bought 2 of these, one for him and myself.  After three months, I did not have a single problem.  However, his developed a firmware problem last week, deleted all of his files (including those from CDs he lost), and refused to be updated.  He called tech support, but before he mailed it in, the problem resolved itself and he was able to update the firmware (but unfortunately did not recover his files).    Now today, when he turned it on, the headphone jack loosened up, and the sound cut in and out.  He called tech support yet again, got the RMA number, and will mail it out next week.  Again, I haven't had a single problem with mine.  They're the same exact player, color, and battery, and mine takes more abuse because I use it as a 1 GB partitioned flash drive.  It has fallen on the floor a number of times and only received a small scratch on the screen.  This is my first experience with a hard drive-based mp3 player, since up to this point I was using a Creative MuVo Nomad (flash drive based).    I think it depends on a person's luck with products like these.  If you've never had a problem with electronics malfunctioning, there's a good chance you'll love this player.  Final note:  BUY THE CREATIVE PROTECTION PLAN with this player.  And keep your receipt.  Just in case.

<Title>A Good Music Player
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Though outdated now in terms of space, functionality and cost...this player has worked perfectly for me. It's Screen interface is easy to use, even with the clumsy hands I've got and it still has enough weight in it to make it blindly useable (ie. picking it up while doing something else like driving and changing songs without ever having to look at it). I'd maybe guess that Apple's iPOD Nano could do the same thing, but as little as it weighs, I'd be afraid a gust of wind might blow it away, lol. In fact, it's jsut perfect size for me to switch albums while I'm riding a bike, but you should REALLY practice a LOT if you're gonna try that lil' trick....don't say I didn't warn you! It survived a 19 inch fall to concrete with no problems....but I might've been lucky. 'Sides since I'm a mostly happy user of Windows Computers, it didn't make sense to buy something that doesn't support Outlook. The radio recieves "decently" and the voice recorder is swell too. Sound quality is good to me, but I'm not very picky on that subject so someone used to more might be disappointed. My only gripe is I couldn't find the color I wanted at Wal-Mart...Orange would've been interesting:) Battery life is decent, but like most other players I've had it seems to require the light off and minimal changing of albums and the like. I average 5 hours myself.

<Title>Unit froze constantly and died
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really loved this player-when it worked right, that is. Or should I say was. The player froze all the time, usually atleast once a day. I didn't really mind, many of the micro drive players tend to do this seeing as they have mini harddrives in there. All I would do is pop off the back cover slide the battery out just enough for the pins to release off of the battery contacts and restart the player. I got so good at doing this I could do it while running haha. One day while leaving to jog I turn the player on and it freezes. No biggie I figure. Go through the normal routine with the battery etc etc. I go to turn the unit back on and DEAD. This is where I stand with it now. I lost my receipt so I cant return it to Creative for service. I really loved this player. The only problem I had was the freezing. The thing I liked the most about it is that it was LOUD. If you like music loud this is the player.  PROS: Media explorer interface was good. Loading songs onto player was easy. Sound and volume good even with supplied earbuds.  CONS: Unit contantly froze and eventually died.

<Title>No problems for us...
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Maybe we got lucky or something, but our unit never had the headphone jack issue.  It never froze up, or quit working.  The sound was good and the unit performs as well today as when we got it.  After flashing it with the latest system software, it worked well with Windows Media Player, but didn't like the Creative sofware anymore.  There is some updated Creative software for it, but since WMP was working so well we decided not to mess with it.  One star deducted for the smaller non-color screen that's hard to read with my 50+ year old eyesight.  No regrets on purchase.  Upgrading to a Zen Vision M with HUGE color screen!

<Title>ZEN MALFUNCTIONS A LOT!
<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'd rate the Zen Micro 0 stars, but it isn't available. I used to like this player; it was cheaper and smaller than a regular Ipod. The first problem I had was the headphone jack. I had to send it out to get fixed. As soon as I got it back it worked okay. A couple of days later, I noticed that it kept freezing on me. I had to open up the back and take the battery out almost every time I turned on the player.   All I have had was problem after problem with this mp3 player and the customer service sucks! They charge you for the call and then refund you if you have to send your creative product back to them for repair.   DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!

<Title>Worth the Money
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[UPDATE]  Nearly two years later, I still have a working Creative Zen Micro. However, aside from the technical setbacks mentioned at the end of this review, I have encountered a few more problems. After several months of use, maybe a year, the ear buds broke, forcing me to buy a new ones (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JUZE1Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-5016992-6140060">Earbud Headphones - White/blue</a> from Sony). Another problem that I can't seem to figure out is that sometimes, while it is playing a song, it gets briefly interrupted by another song or sound for a brief second and does this repeatedly throughout the song until you skip to another song. Another annoying issue is that sometimes, when I hook up the player to my computer, I cannot organize my tracks with the Creative Organizer because it cannot detect the player for some strange reason. However, luckily, I can still use the Creative Explorer to import new tracks, etc. Though the Creative Zen Micro remains functional for me, I feel that you should probably spend an extra $100 for a better MP3 player, such as the Ipod or Zune.  [/UPDATE]  For a while, I have investigated MP3 players, trying to decide which one I should buy and particuarly comparing them to the Ipod Mini. Based on the information I gathered, I made a unique move by stepping outside of the box and buying a Creative Zen Micro instead. I've concluded that the Creative Zen Micro greatly surpasses the Ipod mini in several categories, making it much more worth my money.  First of all, one of the biggest things to consider is the cost of the item. I was able to purchase my Creative Zen Micro for $171, including shipping and handling, as well as tax. The Ipod mini, on the other hand, is only available for around $240, not including shipping and handling or tax.   For $70 cheaper, I get 5 GB of memory space, an FM tuner, an organizer, 2 separate batteries (each providing 12 hours of playtime), a case, belt clip, stand, pouch, headphones, AC/DC power adapter, and USB 2.0 cable. However, the Ipod mini, at $240, offers only 4 GB of space and only 18 hours of playtime. It lacks an FM tuner, case, pouch, AC/DC adapter, and organizer, which are useful accessories and features to have.   - An FM tuner always provides refreshingly new music, which comes in handy when the songs get tiresome or repetitive when listened to too often. - The case and pouch help protect the MP3 player itself and save the buyer of having the time and money of having to purchase them.  - The organizer is helpful in keeping a record of events and contacts.  - The AC/DC adapter is an alternative way to charge the MP3 player, which becomes particularly useful when a computer is not available.  Finally, one of the main things that makes the Creative Zen Micro so superior to the Ipod Mini is its sound quality. Creative is known for its enhanced sound quality, which is one of the best in the business, whereas Ipod's is simply mediocre. Another additional bonus about the Creative Zen Micro is its compatibility with WMA files, which save the user time from having to convert WMA files to MP3 files. It also keeps a list of the songs that have been played the most and those that have been played the least. This helps the user single out favorite songs and new songs. Though navigation may feel a bit clumsy for some, the Micro's search feature makes finding tracks a breeze, whereas   to the best of my knowledge, the Ipod does not have one.  There are a flaws to mention about the Micro however:  1. Though some people are completely comfortable with the Micro's navigation, I find it is a little difficult. There are only 3 sensitivity settings and all three feel strange to me. The thing that is probably the most bothersome is how the scroller is also the selector, so if you're scrolling and accidentally tap it too hard, it will select something you did not want selected. I also think that the Ipod Mini's circular scroller is faster and more intuitive, but the Micro's vertical one is tolerable.   2. Yes, some people have claimed that their Creative Zen Micro broke within a matter of months or they bumped into some technical difficulties. This is not a myth. I, too, have been a victim, as my MP3 player froze a few days after receiving it from Amazon. However, I contacted Creative and they were very helpful and prompt in responding. Though I did have to pay a few dollars for shipping the product back to them, I received a fully functional replacement that I still use on a regular basis to this day (months later). I have researched a little to see how many people have suffered from any kind of technical difficulties with the Micro and have found that there are indeed a large amount. There are some who are more unfortunate than others, but it is more likely that you will not suffer from such problems and if you do, you will receive an excellent replacement.   Despite these few annoyances, the Creative Zen Micro is worth it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase as I saved $70 while receiving more features than the Ipod Mini.
