<Title>Another Winner from Apple
<Date>Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased my iPod Mini two days after it was released and I must admit, I am blown away by the functionality and style of Apple's newest creation.  Just as a background, I also own a 20 GB third generation iPod, so my comparisons and observations are from a first hand perspective.<p>So, why on earth did I buy a Mini?  Quite simply, I was so impressed with this device that I had to have one.  First off, the scroll wheel is vastly improved over the standard iPod.  The wheel is still touch sensitive for scrolling, but the functionality of the four buttons has been placed around the wheel and can be clicked.  This makes for much easier one handed operation.  The screen is razor sharp and the backlighting is awesome.  The exterior shell is all aluminum and the screen is recessed in the front of the case.  This ipod feels much more durable and resisitant to scratching than my standard iPod.  The battery life is also improved.  This mini played for nearly 8 hours on the first charge.  I typically never get more than 4.5-6 out of my standard iPod.  The biggest difference is the form factor of the device (size and the weight).  At only 3.6 ounces this iPod can be carried in the pocket without noticing it is there.  As small as my standard iPod is, somehow, you always know it is there.  The Mini solves this problem.  After all, what good is an iPod that holds all of my music, if it is not quite small enough to have with me all the time.<p>Perhaps one of the coolest parts is the interaction with iTunes.  My Library is 7.4 GB, which exceeds the capacity of the Mini.  However, when you connect it for the first time, it automatically knows this and creates an &quot;iPod Mini Playlist&quot; that serves as a second library just for my Mini.  Just drag and drop from your main library and the songs transfer to the Mini in a snap.<p>Now, I know what you are all thinking . . . why pay $249 for 4 GB, when you can have 15 GB for only $50 more?  The answer is quite simple.  In life, purchasing decisions are made with emotion and justified with logic.  On paper, there is no disputing the fact that you get far more GB per dollar by going with the standard iPod; and the standard iPod is a terrific piece of equipment.  But beyond the logical considerations lies the iPod Mini.  The way it feels in your hand, the enhanced functionality of the scroll wheel, the great form factor, and the cool aluminum finish.  All of these intangibles create a product that transcends a strict price per GB comparison and makes this iPod worth every penny of its $249 price tag.<p>The bottom line . . . I have 1050 songs on my Mini with room to spare.  I bought the Mini because it puts a smile on my face every time I use it and it is just too darn cool to pass up.  I highly recommend this device.

<Title>The best player on the market
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Its amazing. I love it. I have the 40 GB Gen 3 and I want my wife's mini. The case is very well constructed, it feels solid. The whole thing is made of anondized aluminum and it feels super sturdy. The screen is crystal clear and the perfect size. The clickwheel is WAY better than the current Ipod configuration of 4 buttons above the scroll wheel. The clickwheel feels solid and the clicking is crisp. The wheel doesnt rotate but Im sure you coulda figured that out already. Its touch sensitive for scrolling with the select button still in the middle. And yes you can scroll thru songs super fast like a normal Ipod The color is vibrant and the mini is just the right size. <p>This thing fits in your pocket and you dont even know its there. I put my big ipod in my pocket and it feels like im smuggling a pack of cards. If you got the means, get this player. It doesnt disappoint.   Its like the Prada of the electronics world.<p>And dont let the nonsense you hear about battery life sway you.  The battery is fine, I regularly get 8 hours of play out of it.  Of course in a few years you will have to replace the battery for $59 but thats the nature of ALL rechargeable batteries.  They eventually die over their lifetime.  Its just a scientific fact.  <p>Get the ipod mini now...A++ would buy another one . This thing has COOL dripping off it

<Title>Way Cooler Than Expected
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After all the anti-hype surrounding Apple's &quot;overpriced&quot; low-end iPod, I expected to be very disappointed by this, especially since we already on a full 40G current-generation model; but I was very pleasantly surprised. <p>The mini's smaller size is far more of an advantage than I had expected, making it the first truly pocketable iPod, and one of the nicest pocketable MP3 players ever. The smaller display (which omits album name) is crisp and clear, and the new control, which combines the wheel and select control of the current generation iPods with the four function buttons, is actually an improvement over the full-sized version's controls.<p>In every other respect the mini is indistinguishable from its (surprisingly much) larger cousins, except for two: (1) it is still a bit overpriced (but those who must have one need not hesitate) and (2) it's much smaller capacity may not work for many users.

<Title>Great.. when it works
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my mini the first day it came out at my local store.  I've waited 3 years to buy a player of this caliber, and thought this finally was the one I wanted.<p>It's been 5 days, and its broken!!  It stopped in the middle of a song and froze.  There is no re-set button on this, and the battery is not one that can be removed.   Translation:  needs to be taken back.  This is the problem I feared when I saw that the battery was built in, and my fear was realized not even 1 week into it.<p>When it worked, it did sound great.  I had it hooked up with my Bose headphones and the sound was equal of that to my home stereo system, which is impressive.  <p>My gut feeling here is that it's new and the software probably has some bugs.  I'm going to exchange it and get a new one, and see if this problem recurs.  <p>My only other knock is itunes.  I just don't care for the s/w.. it's not very user friendly.

<Title>WOW.....thats a lot of money
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player.  I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more.  It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style.  I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion.  I just want to listen to music!!!!!

<Title>HERE IS THE SKINNY ON MY MINI
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been waiting for this to arrive and now I have it so let me share with you what I know. This is my first ipod and I am glad I waited. To start with I love the look of it. Pink is the color that I have it is sooooo cute. It dose not hold as many songs as the other ipods so that is something you should know right off. For the price I do think it should hold more. If you are using this with a PC you must have Windows 2000 or XP. It works smoothly and great sound so far, I am very pleased with it.<p>PROS:<p>1. The size, it is easy to carry or put in your pocket and you can wear it around your neck also.<p>2. If you buy this from the Mac store online you can get it personalized free. Wayyyyy cool<p>3.  Ease of operation and good customer help if you need it.<p>4.  You can download books as well as music from MAC.COM<p>CONS:<p>1.  It is pricey for something that can only hold 1000 songs.<p>2.   Would have liked to have  seen a color screen, something I am sure they can do.<p>3.   Headphones could be better. I don't like earplugs.<p>4.   Battery life is only 8 hours.

<Title>Bought one, bought sixty songs from i tunes, can't hear one
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Either I got a defective one, but after 4 hours with 7 different techs on the phone and calls to Apple Corporate, someone has agreed to exhange my unit for another one.<p>My i-Tunes would load all the songs on to the i-pod, and you could pick a song, but it would never play, just go blank.<br>Waited a month, had it engraved, now I have to wait for a box to return it, and then wait for another one and start over.  I think it may be advisable to wait to they get the bugs worked out.  7 different techs could not figure it out.  Or, maybe I got a bad one.

<Title>P.O.S.
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman.

<Title>Great except when it sucks
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved it when it was working right, but 6 months after I first got it, Itunes crashed while updating the ipod and the hard drive got corrupted.  Luckily, you can still buy the AppleCare protection if it's been less than a year so I got it and they sent me a new Ipod.    That worked great for almost a year but then my battery life got really short (1 hour or so).  I sent it back again, since I was still covered by AppleCare, but they told me they wouldnt cover it because it was caused by abuse!  I never did anything "abusive" to it, I dropped it maybe once or twice, and I dont see how that would cause it to work fine except for the reduced battery life.  I realize they dont make this model anymore, but I'm definitely goign to look around at the other makers before I get my next MP3 player.  And apparently it's barely worth getting applecare for the battery issue alone.

<Title>The First Colorful iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Mini was the first iPod that came in colors. So, it was the first iPod I bought--It was pink. I could not resist.  When I first got the iPod, it was flawless performance and exactly what I wanted. The earphones work fabulously, I had all my favorite music, it was small and durable. Some people talk about glitches in it, and yes, mine had some. But my Applecare free warranty was still intact, so I sent it back and was sent a brand-new iPod in 2 days. That works for me!  The screen is old-fashioned nowadays, yes, but its low-key and still fabulous. Sadly my Mini got stolen, so now I'll be needing a pink Nano.   In conclusion, an amazing machine with plenty of memory and good looks to go with it.

<Title>Great....if you don't mind glitches
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first got this pink iPod mini for my birthday last year I was thrilled. The battery life was never ending, it was easy to use, and it looked cute and withstanded constant torture. However, a year later I am deeply dissapointed in this Apple product. I started noticing during the summer it downloaded songs very slowly and constantly froze on itunes. After disconnecting it from the USB it would freeze, just simply switching from song to song froze it. I noticed that the batter was much less than the promised hours and after a full charge the battery would go down after about 5 minutes of use. If I was to leave it alone a couple of days after a full charge when I would turn it back on the battery would be half gone. The earphones that are included with the iPod, just forget them, they are comeplete crap, they crack and break open, and the sound comes through all fuzzy. If the battery was to be completey gone and I would plug it into the computer to charge it would freeze right there and not chrage at all. I would suggest moving on to the more new and improved iPod's that work better and last longer. iPod mini's last a year, two at the most.

<Title>Not Happy with it
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Green iPod mini for my birthday in July 2005. I loved the easy to use clickwheel, and the shiny green color. But around October of that year, it started to have glitches and it would freeze up after being on for only 2 minutes! I took it to Apple and they gave me a new one because of a problem. Then in February 2006, the replacement mini died. It wasn't recognized on iTunes, and it finally showed the sad iPod icon. I put it in Diagnostic Mode (Press Select and Previous) and I did a HDD scan. The scan failed and when I reset it, it turned on to the sad iPod again and the hard drive started clicking and it sounded like it was abour to explode. I went to Apple again and they gave me another one. When I got home (thankfully Apple store only 15 minutes away from me) I charged it, and it worked fine. Now it's February 2007, and the warranty expired today. When I turned it on when I woke up, it wouldn't turn on.   What a waste of time. This is the most UNRELIABLE iPod out there. And Apple says they can only repair it for a fee of $[...]. That's how much I paid for it in the beginning! I'm just going to buy a new iPod nano.

<Content>I had my Pink iPod mini since Feb. 2005. It was fine until it died the next year on the exact day I got it, and the warranty ran out. I got it repaired at an Apple reseller, and then it died again  on the warranty expiration date. What is it with the iPods? It's like they have a self destruct inside! ):-(

<Title>Apple 4GB Mini is OK
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is a good basic unit.  The controls are a bit touchy.  You have to get the hang of skimming you finger around the touch circle.  You also have to remeber to lock the controls while you are listening, or a slight brush on the control surface will change settings.  The iTunes software is nice.  The autosynch feature is easy to use.  Overall, a good unit for the price.

<Title>A Piece of Garbage
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was the worst electronics puchase I've ever made.  When I first got the mini it was great, looked nice and sounded great.  Within about 6 months battery life started to go way down, after a year it was down to nothing, didn't work properly, would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes.  If you're going to take a chance on an iPod, definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one.
