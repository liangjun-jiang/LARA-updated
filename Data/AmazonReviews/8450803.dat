<Title>the best mp3 player I've used.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third digital media player I've owned.  I had a Creative Zen Tough 40 gigs, and a Creative Zen Vision:M 30 gigs before this.  I loved them both dearly but they became unusable a few months after I bought them.  I was super disappointed with the customer service for Creative, so I decided to get a Zune.  I've never had much of an interest in an iPod.  It's not a "I want to be different from everybody" thing so much as Apple just isn't my aesthetic and I wanted all my software to be of the same company.  The packaging is a winner.  I never really thought much about the packaging for a product.  The box it came in was sturdy and attractive and I still have it after two months.  The updated software runs kind of slow but it's still faster than any of the Creative softwares I used.  It helps a lot to not run any other program while you're using it.  Syncing songs to the player takes about one second per song.  Super fast.  The Zune Marketplace is also a winner.  I purchased the Zune Pass and it's really thrilling to use.  All the music I want for 15 dollars a month is a winner.  DRM protection's kind of a drag, but I think it's worth it.  I don't know anything about iTunes so unfortunately I can't compare the two.  You can't put the downloaded songs on a CD or play them on anything else but the Zune software and the Zune, but that doesn't really affect me.    I really love the hardware.  The double shot effect is really neat!  The device feels really nice and substancial in my hand.  It's actually kind of small compared to the huge Zens I used to have.  I honestly don't understand how people say the Zune's too bulky.  There's not too much to say about the firmware.  It's really easy to use, and I like how the letters on the main menu are really big.  It's easy to read, even if you have a lighter background.  It's really nice though, to have the firmware update automatically, because with the Zen, you had to go to Creative's website and download it yourself and put it on the player yourself and the whole thing took about two hours.  It was crazy!  I've always been impressed with Microsoft's customer service.  A couple weeks ago none of the media would play and they walked me through everything and the person I talked to was super nice.  There are a few things that keep it from being completely perfect.  These are pretty minor details though for the most part.  The least minor thing is the quality of the video.  With my Creative Zen V:M, the video was absolutely superb, crisper than a TV.  It was so impressive, and I kind of miss it with the Zune.  I really really don't care about video though, so it doesn't matter much to me, but if video is important to you, consider the Zen.  Another big thing for me is you don't have the ability to turn the zune to the other side so the controls are on the left when viewing pictures and video.  I'm left handed and it's incredibly awkward to use my right hand to control it.  Also, a clock would be such a convenient addition.  Voice recording and the ability to use the device as an external hard drive would be nice too.  The ability to record FM radio like you can with the Zen would be super.  I don't care at all about accessories but that's a huge factor for some people.  There's a company called Vaja Cases that make really super nice custom leather cases for the Zune 30.  I'm not sure they make them for the 80, or the flash drive based devices.  You can find plastic cases at like Best Buy too.  There's an A/C adapter too but I heard that it kind of sucks.  I have a radio adapter that plugs into any headphone jack and I like to use it in the car and whatnot.  Overall though I totally recommend the Zune 30.  It's super sturdy, and the software and everything is awesome.  Definitely consider it if you're looking at hard drive based mp3 players.

<Title>Amazing, Better than Ipod!!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is very Good, Great Sound, and if you buy the premium headphones, you get great sound, plus noise cancelling, great for the gym, or traveling.  Definitely you must get the membership on zune marketplace, were for $15 bucks a month you can download EVERYTHING you want. Rather than Buying from Itunes.  Zune beats Apple in about one hundred ways.  Tip:  You get three accounts for one membership, so you might get 3 friends, and each will pay only $5, for unlimited downloads, podcasts, videos, etc.  Very Cheap!!

<Content>I've had this Zune for a while now before bothering to write a review, but it's definitely worth buying.  The new Zunes are out, and I can't attest to their functionality myself, but microsoft keeps coming up with better and better ideas.  This thing is easy to operate, syncs easily, and is more durable than anyone should probably need.  I've dropped it plenty of times, and it's still kickin'.

<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-6453711-4418523">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Content>I owned a Zen portable media center, and while the screen was bigger, it was not nearly as sharp as the Zune screen. With Zune, both my kids can watch it at once since the viewing angle is so wide. I'm glad I have one.

<Title>Unlike many other reviewers, I actually own a Zune
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many of the reviews here are from (and will most likely continue to be from) people who neither own a Zune nor have they ever touched a Zune.  A majority of the remaining reviews are commentary on the Zune vs. iPod battle without regard to a legitimate compare and contrast of the players themselves (possibly legitimate discussions, but discussions that shouldn't really be regarded as reviews).  My review is intended to be my first impression of my Zune along with a bit of compare and contrast as I make a switch (possibly permanent or maybe temporary) from an iPod to a Zune.  The Zune is a great player.  A large bright screen that presents a great user interface when navigating through your library or settings.  The screen is also beautiful for watching video and in particular works very well with pictures.  Despite it's slightly bulky look and large dimensions when next to other players in its class, the Zune feels just right in your hand.  Maybe a bit large to cram into a pocket, but seriously, it fits your hand like a glove.  Pre-release, many have knocked the brown, but it's a real nice color.  It has a subtle green accent that runs around the edge of the player and the contrast adds a lot of class to the player.  The software is not quite up to iTunes, or in reality maybe it's just that I'm used to iTunes.  The software is simply a better looking version of Windows Media Player (I guess that should be taken as a compliment to the Zune, because it really is a nice looking piece of software).  So, if you're comfortable with that you'll love this.  If you don't like Windows Media Player, you may not like this much more.  The wireless capabilities of the Zune has been a huge push from Microsoft.  This feature has been implemented quite well, but it will take some time for enough Zunes to be out the for the sharing to really take off.  Sound quality is no better, no worse than other players.  Overall the Zune is a welcome departure from the category leading player, the iPod, if for no reason other than it's something new in a category that has gotten a little repetitive over the last couple upgrade cycles from Apple.  The software though not as refined as iTunes, is a bit of a warmer looking alternative and it's UI differences may even grow on me enough to eventually like it more than the competition.  The player's menu navigation has every other player in the market beat.  Picture and video viewing is also at the top of the class.

<Title>Big screen and good design
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've tried out all the iPod competitors.  In general they have all disappointed me, but this is the first one that I really like.  The only downside is that it's not as thin as the iPod, but the iPod scratches so easily that it requires a case which adds extra thickness anyway.  (+) 3" screen is GREAT.   44% bigger than iPod video.  For the first time, showing a friend my travel pictures over coffee, etc. is an enjoyable experience.  You can even zoom into pictures to see details.  And now I can actually enjoy watching videos while sitting in a cafe.  My iPod video's screen is just too small.  I also like seeing the big album art while a song is playing.  (+) It plays ALL my songs and videos iPod won't play any WMV videos, AVI video, WMA songs, etc.  The Zune plays everything I have. iPod video doesn't.  (+) Landscape mode   When playing a video or watching movies, the Zune automatically switches to landscape orientation.  (+) Controls I really like the control layout.  Easier to adjust the volume than on the iPod.  When you switch to landscape mode, it's smart enough to automatically rotate the controls so that pressing "up" always scrolls up.  (+) No scratches. The case is made out of scratch-proof, matte finish material.  It looks and feels good.  My iPod video with it's high gloss finish looked great for the first month, now it's covered with scratches and looks like crap.  That's why everyone's obsessed with keeping their iPod's in a case-- which only adds cost and thickness and keeps you from seeing how shiny it is anyway.  (+) Music Sharing You can listen to your friend's music wirelessly.  And even take it with you for a few days. No need to plug into a computer.  You just stand in front of each other and transfer the music wirelessly.  (+) FM Radio. I didn't think I'd use it, but I do. Cool interface.  (+) Menu design makes sense.  Easy to use.  (-) Thickness The Zune is .58" thick.  The 30Gb iPod is .43" thick. Of course, you have to buy a case for your shiny, scratch-prone iPod and that will add more than the difference in thickness.  (-) Looks like a scroll wheel. It looks like the Zune has an iPod-like scroll wheel, even though that's not how it functions.  They should have done something to make it look different.  Now people will probably think they just copied the scroll wheel, even though they didn't.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As I write this review I am listening to some classic Hendrix tracks through my home-stereo via my brand new black Zune. I've had the product for a few hours now and I've been nothing but impressed. The zune software is very similar to WMP 11 and it was a breeze to set up. In fact, within 3 minutes I was syncing all of my exising MP3 and WMA tracks with the Zune and downloading brand new content from the Zune store for free with my 14 day trial pass. The interface is very user-friendly, and I prefer its look to the increasingly cumbersome interface of the itunes music store.   The Zune itself is just ridiculously cool. The screen is as nice as I've seen on a handheld device, and the interface took me all of 10 seconds to master. Everything about the product makes wonderful sense. The ability to use this with the zune subscription music service is a fantastic feature as I am an avid fan of all-you-can-download music.   So let's recap: Fast, easy, problem free installation of software.                 Ingenius user interface                 Beautiful LCD screen                  Zune store allows subscription downloads   I'm still undecided about sound quality, but so far I can't complain. I also can't comment on battery life because I've only had the zune for maybe four hours now. This product kills all other hard-drive based MP3 players in terms of over-all end-user experience. I've owned an iriver, ipod, and zen nano before and this is my favorite player thus far. I-Pod could compete with this only if they put a larger screen on gen. six ipods and allow subscription based downloads in itunes.   Okay, the wireless sharing feature will be a gimmick as far as i'm concerned because the chances of me meeting many people who also own a zune seem quite remote.. let's face it, not that many people are sporting 250 dollar MP3 players at my apartment complex or my college campus.

<Content>Got my Zune this morning and I like it a lot. Installation is very straight forward. The interface is intuitive and responsive. However I am going to return it because it does not support Unicode. My Chinese and Japanese song title becomes a bunch of squares. It also does not support any lossless format, not even WMA Lossless.

<Title>Does not work with Macs, iTunes, or your new car
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Crazy. Everyone uses iTunes because it rocks, excuse the pun, and has the exact same features on PC as it has on Macs, but this Zune does not work with iTunes, even on the PC. Doesn't work with my Mac either. Nor does it work in my car which has an iPod connector as most do these days. Not really a viable option beyond some marketing guy's white board. Maybe the next one will address these bugs.

<Title>Dear Santa...
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While holiday shopping this afternoon I got a chance to try out the new Zune.  The user interface is extremely easy to use - perhaps even more intuitive than the I-pod.  I'm not as enamored with the "wheel" motion of the I-pod player as some, so I was pleased to find the Zune's D-pad style controls responding as I would expect. Everything had that familiar feel - even for a first time user.    I liked how the menus went both deep and broad - I had the option to drill down into a specific category, but then I could also scroll across song options within that category.  I had a good sense of direction throughout the experience.  The music sounded good and crisp.  The video seemed fluid - I didn't notice any pixellation.  I liked the radio feature too - something I'm more likely to use than the alarm clock or calendar feature on the I-pod.  The addition of games would be nice - perhaps something to purchased off of the Zune Marketplace down the road.  I would have liked to see a Zune player without the wi-fi at a cheaper price point, but we'll just have to wait and see if the wi-fi music world that Microsoft is promoting really takes off.    All-in-all, a good player.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked to have seen a AC or car adapter included in the package - you're looking at an additional $40 for the official Power Kit.    This one is going on my list to Santa (or in my case - Mrs. Claus).  And yes, I'll probably ask for the brown.

<Title>Do not buy first generation of Zune.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well...I know I would regret it and I did. I got myself a Zune and it's going back tomorrow. I wanted to like the Zune because I think Apple needs a nemisis. (competition is good as the saying goes) But, the product feels like a prototype. I placed the Zune next to my IPod. The Ipod looks sleek and elegant and the Zune looks like it's ugly cousin. It's bigger, heavier and chunky.   OK! So it has wireless but so what. How many Zune are you going to find out there. Let's say you want to use it to tape a lecture or a meeting and you want to pass it along with your Zune buddy. Well that lecture or anything you created also dies in 3 play or 3 days. And let's say you play 30 seconds of the song and decide to stop, well counts as 1 play.   The Big screen...Well the screen is bigger but the resolution is the same. The test shot I did didn't look good and the album covers look fuzzier and not as crisp as it did not IPod.   13 hour battery life is not true. If you want 13 hour battery life you have to listen to in default volume and play the same album over and over and turn off the wireless.   It may have an OK interface and the guest sync is good but if you are in the market for a MP3 player, don't go for the Zune. While it has feature Ipod doesn't you won't be sharing anything with anybody because they are not going to be popular. There aren't that many songs, the marketplace doesn't have podcast, tv shows, video and host of other things you can get from Itunes.   In short if you really want a MS product wait for the 4th generation and maybe then you should get it.

<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this item for my 14 yr old son as a birthday gift.  He really wanted one and I was happy that I could get last year's 30GB for so much less than the newest 8GB.  My son used it for about a week and the system crashed.  I called Microsoft and got nowhere on customer services.  After waiting about 3 weeks for a return box to show up, I contacted Amazon customer service and had it shipped out the next day.  Then a replacement arrived just a couple of days later and we were back in business. He absolutely loves it and I was impressed that it was so versatile.  He's got music, pictures and even episodes of his favorite television shows on it already.  I buy on Amazon all the time and the customer service is simple and incredible.  I would recommend this product and Amazon to anyone.

<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Zune 30G as a Christmas gift for my son. Of course, I had to load the software and upload about 100 CD's to it for him. All of this took about a day or so. I didn't have any of the trouble that I see some others have listed on their reviews.   In addition, I bought the PQ DVD to Zune converter ($29.95) online from their site (searched for it by name with Google), and uploaded about 2 seasons of his favorite TV show for him. That took about 6 hours. The screen is perfect for TV shows, but the widescreen movies don't look very good on it. I don't recommend trying to watch those. If you have full screen DVD's at home, those look fine when uploaded.   He used it for about 2 weeks (all day every day) before leaving it behind one day when he went to school. That's when I had the perfect opportunity to use it myself. I took it to work out and ended up watching TV shows through about a 2 hour workout! I loved it so much, I bought one for myself. My second son was so jealous of our new Zunes, that I ended up buying a 3rd as a gift for his 8th grade graduation. Now when they want me to hear their latest "favorite" music, they just wirelessly share it with me through the click of a couple buttons.   I'm a HUGE Zune fan! However, I recommend the following items for optimum enjoyment (which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5):  Book - How to do everything with your Zune Software - PQ DVD to Zune Converter and Windows Vista Charger - I am buying a charger of some sort today because we can only charge the Zunes on our computers. I want to find some way to charge them in the car or just with a typical wall outlet. Battery life is really good on them though. (I only charge them about every 14 hours unless we watch a lot of video.)  Oh, one last thing, don't buy the Zune pass or anything like that until you actually start using the Zune. You may decide you don't really need it. I bought a $25 card to give my son with his Zune at Christmas because I thought he needed it to buy music online. So far, he's only bought a couple of songs. We have so many CD's that he just doesn't take the time to surf for extras.

Any way about the zune it's self it's decent. Like everyone else say's the software is horrendous. I absolutely hate it.  The only reason I got this is because my Creative Zen broke from me dropping it. And It was the cheapest at 99 bucks.  Also Check around for the new Zune's the 80 gigs one's on other sites are selling them for $249. So do shop around.  That's all

<Content>Poorly designed, poorly executed. Is too bulky, is riddled with bugs, and does not work near as well as my 30GB iPod. The wheel is not as easy as iPod's, the battery life is not as good as they state, you have to buy from their store (which is DEFINITELY no iTunes Store!) Overall, I was not impressed with this effort, and would not recommend it to anyone. If you bought it, take it back, quick! Let's just face it, this is yet another so-called "iPod Killer" that falls on it's face. Mr. Gates, give it up. Ande besides, who listens to the radio anymore? This product stinks, and is nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

I picked it up, and I must say, The interface is extremely easy to use and well designed. Sure it uses proprietary computer software, but so does apple. The screen is a good deal larger than the vidio-ipod's, making up for the slight increase in size. The finish is a scratch resistant feeling rubberized plastic, much better than the ipods. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this device. This deffinatly will be a true contender for the ipod.

<Title>Looks awesome. Can't wait to get mine for Christmas.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I'd like to remind everyone who encouraged others to buy an ipod that this is the place to review a Zune. We all know what an iPod is and we all know that iPod and Zune are competing.   I went to go see the Zune today instore and I got a chance to play around with it a little. I read a lot of reviews beforehand and going to see it hands on was the last of my research to see if the Zune is really all that it's cracked up to be. Some reviews from different websites stated things such as:  "You can't view your now playing song"        -Yes you can. Whoever didn't notice this didn't take much time to figure it out.   "You can't shuffle the songs"        -As soon as you click on a catergory (songs, artists, etc.) the first option is to shuffle all.  "The album artwork looks bad"       -No, it really doesn't.   Overall, the Zune is very easy to control and a very nice mp3 player. The pictures and movies looked really good, the radio sounded good, songs sounded crisp and clear, features such as setting pictures to the backround, viewing movies in landscape, etc. are really nice..

<Title>Very nice
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't listen to people who own iPods and write reviews like the previous ones to try and convince themselves that they got the better deal. The Zune is, like I said, very nice. It's extremely easy to use, the software is good, and battery life is good. I've been playing with it all day but had to stop so that I write this review to try to dispel the previous inaccurate and flat out dumb reviews. About the size: It's the same width, 0.3" taller, and 0.15" deeper. I'm ok with that seeing how as the screen on the Zune is 20% larger. The Zune has a built in FM tuner, the iPod does NOT. The Zune has wireless capabilities, the iPod does NOT. The ONLY thing the iPod has that I wish the Zune had is the scroll wheel. There aren't too many accessories out there for it yet, but once word gets around that it's a lot better than the iPod there will be a lot more and they'll be a lot easier to find. So don't listen to these bitter people who have recently spent the same amount on an inferior product.

<Title>Not even close
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I checked out the Zune today at Best Buy. I already have two ipods so was just wondering how the Zune compared. I tried to keep an open mind but this thing isn't even close to the refinement of the Ipod or other MP3 players. They had the black and brown Zune on display. Yikes, that brown is uuuuuugly.  The wheel and buttons felt cheap and the over all look seemed cheap. The only nice thing is the screen.   Size wise the Zune is too big in my opinion. It is the size of my original 5 Gig ipod that came out in 2001. The 30 gig ipod is so much thinner and feels more refined.   I can't speak for the music store but Itunes is so good I can't imagine it being any better.   While I was there nobody even noticed the Zune. No big MS marketing materials pointing people to the Zune. Just two lonely Zunes that didn't stand out at all to the other many MP3's, let alone the Ipod. In fact, one of the Zunes had an error on it and wouldn't turn on. It just kept flashing a battery icon as if the unit did not see the battery. MS has a way to go before people will even look at this thing. When I was there a lady came up and said the the Best Buy guy, I'm looking for a 30 gig MP3 for my son's bday and he wants and Ipod. The guy never even suggested the Zune and so she bought her Ipod and went on her way. I think this will be typical of this holiday season. Most consumers want an Ipod and that is about it. Some people will get it for the screen size but for me, I'd rather wait for the larger screen Ipods to come out.

<Title>What was I thinking!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While I'm not very techy person, I like owning cool gadgets and admit to have spent a good chunk of money on them in my lifetime. So with all the hype around this Zune thing, I had to get one. Close to 300 bucks later, I have my gadget, sitting in my home office desk. But did I get any cool-factor joy for the price?   No sir. For starters, here's my quick findings:  Its huge. What sort of baggy-pants were part of the group testing this product? And you get the same 30G for that extra bulk - where's the progress? Screen seems less brighter/sharper than I expected, especially in unfavorable lighting. Center button looks like a circular scroll wheel but isn't - its a fake (just a cheap 4-corner version). Installation is slow and has a lot of steps with corny pictures of people I don't care about. I still don't understand why I can't use American dollars to buy songs, instead of these "points". Seems like its a ploy to make me spend more money, like casinos with the chips that don't feel like real money.  I could go on and on, but I don't think its worth the effort... I'm sure I'll find some glitches and more gripes over the next few days. Or maybe I'll just put it back in the wrapping and wait for a "re-gift" opportunity.

<Title>Redefine Refined.
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Rarely do you see a product from Microsoft that isn't subject to a barrage of heavily (and I do mean _heavily_) biased reviews, comparing it to other products and services that typically doing whatever Microsoft's products do, only better.  Look at the so-called "credible" reviewers working for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Whatever happened to journalist standard of forming and supporting a credible and unbiased opinion?  Perhaps if you set the competition aside (or look at it on less subjective and comparative scale) you will be able to grasp a fair review of a product.  But may I say that even the Zune does not require this formality, for it is a capable, stable, and solid product in nearly every regard.  Having been looking forward to the November 14th release date for a while now, it was safe to say that I was overjoyed when the day finally came.  After getting up in the morning, eating a quick breakfast, showering, and heading off to my single class for the day, it finally hit me that today would be the day that I would experience the Zune first-hand.  Certainly the harsh words put out by the big-league review columnists couldn't be completely true, right?  Come 10 AM, and there I was standing at the local Circuit City, eager to finally get my hands on the product.  After corralling a service rep to fetch one from the display case, making the choice of Black for color, checking out, getting back in the car, driving home, and getting upstairs to my computer, the time that I had longed for finally came to fruition.  The first thing you'll get with Zune is the brown package.  The box itself is fairly small, and is opened by pulling the top off from the bottom.  Once open, you will be greeted with the phrase "Welcome to the Social," on the side of the inner box.  Open a the flip-out side panel, and you will see your Zune for the first time, nestled in an indentation in the packaging.  A brown cord allows you to dislodge the Zune from the packaging, and two more flip-out panels to the left and right of the Zune house the magnetic black ear buds, and the sync USB cable.  Another opening at the top houses a small instructional guide, software, and other papers, along with a carrying pouch.  Overall, the packaging is nice, and allows you to get to your product fairly quickly.  The instructions are very simple, and you won't have much of a problem figuring them out.  The carrying pouch, however, is too small and tight-fitting, and seems to be provided to prevent damage from scratches, rather than impacts.  Installing the software doesn't take too long, and after a restart, you are prompted to plug in the device.  You will be given the opportunity to name the device, and you will then be guided to setting up a Zunetag account.  I haven't yet set up any online service with the device yet, so I cannot comment on how well the Zune store functions.  The device will automatically synchronize your music the first time out, with the option of synchronizing your pictures and videos as well.  The process went fairly fast, and any additional syncs after the initial load are quick.  The Zune software itself seems to be derived heavily from Windows Media Player 11, as the album-based libraries and options dialog will suggest, and everything fits well and is laid out in a practical manner.  While some may be turned off by the fact that you can't just use Windows Media Player for adding music, it should be noted that you would require a new piece of software anyway if you want to upgrade your devices software when it is updated.  Once all of your media is loaded, it's on to the Zune itself.  Physically, the device is tall, as to accommodate its 3-inch QVGA display, and is semi-thick; no thicker than the size of a small-medium cell phone.  The device is finished in a rubbery matte finish that feels very sturdy and lays true on a flat surface.  The button layout and functionality is well designed, and the only problem you will have navigating the exceptionally streamlined and intuitive menu system is accidentally pressing the center button instead of up on the directional circle, as they are both finished smooth and shiny.  The portrait-based display is very efficient for displaying lists of albums, songs, or play lists, and the album-art centric Now Playing screen also features an thoughtful layout, showing you the pertinent information to your current song.  Video and picture playback forces the device into landscape mode, rotating the screen 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  This allows you to take full advantage of the large screen when viewing said media.  While the Wifi's state in the device is virtually crippled, it is reassuring to know that it may very well be taken advantage of in a more practical fashion through future software updates.  The sharing feature is nice in theory, but the limitations that are imposed even on non-copy protected music seems a bit excessive, especially for elusive tracks that won't be easily found on online music stores.  The FM Radio feature is a very nice addition, and the display of track and station information is incredibly nice and useful.  Reception won't be without occasional static, but overall it is very consistent and distortion-free.  While you cannot record live radio as you can with other players, the ability to view track information is a near-exclusive feature and is very valuable.  Overall, playback is smooth and uninterrupted by jostles and bumps, and the menu system is responsive and polished.  Audio quality is top-notch, with all levels of audio -   bass, midrange, and treble - reproduced accurately and crisply.  The unit allows for several equalizer presets, and each one has a unique sound to it.  The absence of a bass-boost feature may seem like a loss, but you'll be surprised by the amount of kick you receive by the default settings that you'll learn to not miss such a feature.  Video playback is also smooth, but while I haven't encountered a problem yet, you may be prone to skipping or momentary pauses due to excessive bumping or movement, since the device is not solid-state.  The device, while larger than other players on the market, holds a presentable, professional and refined look.  The physical integrity (yet curiously lightweight construction) of the case only bolsters the units longevity and standout power.  The semi-transparent case with a "double-shot" of color looks very cool in person, and the unit definitely stands out among the sea of white-colored devices.  It is also a magnet for popularity at the office, as one person tells another person, who tells two other people about your new Zune...and they all try to use the directional-pad as a touch pad for some reason...  My only gripes about the device come from the people who brush it aside under the veil of being a Microsoft product.  Microsoft isn't printed on the device for a good reason: it's unlike any other Microsoft product you will have ever used.  The intuitive interface is easy and fun to use, the synchronization is fast and seamless, and the product's longevity through software updates gives you reassurance that even though it is a first-generation product, you won't be sorry when they announce a software breakthrough.  I personally recommend the device for those seeking a competent, well-rounded media player.  The combination of easy-to-use software and superb playback is a major strong point of the device, and the Wifi feature, while limited now, will most definitely come into play in more useful ways in the near future.  The only shortcomings of the device are limited format support, and the need for separate software and drivers to make the unit work on a computer.  In the end, the product is a positive mark for Microsoft's Zune initiative, and if the goals of the product are anything like that of the Xbox, then we may have a product with some serious competitive power in a very short time.

<Title>I just got one!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off i want to start off by saying that i have owned a creative vision m mp3 player as well as numerous other ones, but none have compared to the zune that i just picked up. I like the fact that it doesn't get your fingerprints all over it like the creative or the ipod video does. Also downloading and transfering music and videos with the software are easier than any other program out there. Also you can subscribe to download as much music as you want without having to pay a dollar a song like itunes, thats a big plus for me. Add in all the accesories coming out for it, theres just no competition in my book.  To all those saying theres bugs and stuff are full of it. mine works great and looks awesome as well. Plus no ipod user can compete with this screen. Two thumbs up in my book!!!

<Title>****Here's a review from a REAL Zune buyer...not some iFanboy****
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm no tech-genious and I'm not a MS fanboy either, but the Zune has been a good buy so far for me. Sure it's a little bigger than a fraking ipod, but it's not that noticeable. Another good thing is the screen. It's bright and crisp(from what I've seen so far). The earbuds are the most comfortable I've ever worn...I dont know if anyone else cares, but I sure do. I'm not sure how it compares in weight to the pod, but its NOT THAT heavy. The software worked flawlessly for me, in that it automatically imported all of my music, vid's and pic's during the initial setup. I can't compare it with iTunes, because I've never really worked with it. Overall it's a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good player.

<Title>better than some - but not an ipod
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>microsoft is trying, but they still have a long way to go. the zune is noticeably thicker than the ipod and the 4 way control pad is a real step backwards from the ipod's touch wheel. i like the bigger screen, but not enough to suffer through the pain of a 1.0 software release. no thank you.  after criticizing apple for making a closed ecosystem, microsoft abandons it's own "plays for sure" partners and ditches the whole "choice" argument in hopes of making an end-to-end solution that doesn't suck.  keep trying, guys. i'll check back at version 2.0
