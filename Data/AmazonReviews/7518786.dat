<Title>Cheap yet reliable

<Content>I have had this for two weeks, and it has actually improved my life.  It costs about 1/3 as much as an ipod shuffle, but does not need itunes.  It charges quickly, and the battery has never been low for me, even after playing music for 7 or 8 hours straight.

<Title>My first MP3
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never thought I would want an MP3 player because I am not inclined to try to figure out how to make things work.  When I read the reveiws on this product I thought it sounded easy enough for me to work and it is.  The price was right, sound quality is good and it is easy to use.  Some day I may want to upgrade but for now I like this one.

<Content>very easy to use and download music. much better to use than the one I had earlier purchased. also, amazon truly stands behind its purchasers, since my first one conked out on me in about 30 days and I had no problem with them replacing the item.

<Title>Perfect!

<Content>First of all, order of songs is dependent on order n which they were copied to the device.  You cannot reorder songs once they are on the device.  BUT you can cluster songs in subdirectories on the root directory.  The player will not allow you to play only one song, but it will stop at the end of your songs and not repeat.  I don't use shuffle mode - so that may not always be true.  This is PERFECT for my hypnosis sessions - I can copy that track last, fast forward to it, and it will play the hypnosis without looping back to follow it up with rock and roll.  By putting the hypnosis in a subdirectory, I guarantee it is last in the playlist.  BTW this sounds great with my noise-cancelling headphones and worked very nicely on my last airplane flight.
