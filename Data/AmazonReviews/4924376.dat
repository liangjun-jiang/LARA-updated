<Title>Poor Quality and Poor Customer Service
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Decent price when I bought it a few months back. Simple navigation with one or 2 buttons. The expandable SD card memory was of interest. BUT the slightest bump and the unit shuts off. I have to completely restart it to get back to where I was. Customer service is complicated and they mixed up the warranty replacement in simple email contacts. Then forgot to ship me the replacement for weeks while they had 'computer problems'. Terrible customer care. After another email asking about the replacement I had already been 'precharged' for the new unit arrived and 'surprise' same problem! Buy something else, Ive had it with this brand...

<Title>Waste of Money.

<Content>This is a very poor product from Ultra. The voice recording isnt sensitive enough and when recording FM or Voice, the Unit puts alot of feedback/noise into the recording.   The SD slot is a really stupied design and locks up the player every now and then. FM sucks, everyting about this player is terrible. Feels real cheap.  Oh and even though the battery is half way charged, I plug it into my computer through USB to charge  it and it says on the player that its fully charged.  Do not buy.

<Title>Beware - no resume feature
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this looking for an MP3 player expandable via SD memory cards.  The player has helpful features but does not remember where you were in a track when it shuts down -- a feature commonly called "resume" or "bookmark".  If you're listening to a spoken-word podcast / audio file, this means you must write down your place in the file on a piece of paper before you shut the unit down, and then must fast-forward to that place when you power it back up.  One helpful feature is that you can navigate the player via file folders...so you could put several genres of music / spoken word into several folders to find an item of interest easier.  However the lack of the resume feature is a big shortcoming, and I wish I hadn't bought the unit.
