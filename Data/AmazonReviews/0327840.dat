<Title>When things seem too good to be true......they probably are

<Content>I was so hoping this product would live up to the description.  On paper, this product looks awesome, but I was let down and disappointed when I received it.  It was that disappointment you felt when Dad missed your 1st little league game.  This product is NOT worth $219.99.  It is NOT a good product.  While the product design/concept idea is great, the quality/craftsmanship is horrible.  This is my first MP3 player and I was looking for something that had it all and was reasonably priced (I got mine on sale for $99.99). I will list the pros and cons below.  PRO: 1) Has a built in USB connector (Player is designed like a beefed up Thumb drive with display) 2) Easy to learn graphic interface (I didnt need to read the manual, its that easy) 3) At 1GB, has lots of storage space 4) Drag and drop capability (You can use it to store anything) 5) You can delete files from the player 6) Multiple repeat/random configurations 7) You can increase/decrease the tempo of songs 8) Extras like FM tuner and voice recorder  You would think with all those PROs its a good deal; However, the CONs clearly show cheap construction.  CON: 1) Poor materials used for housing (Im afraid of breaking it.  Cheap plastic used.  Item is made in China.  Trim is painted in that fake chrome paint that flakes off given time) 2) USB cover cap falls off (Does not snap into place and if shook, the cap falls off.  You could loose the cap and not even know it) 3) Battery consumption horrible (They claim 12 hours on 1 AAA, when I only get 2 hours if I am lucky) 4) Battery cover loose (Comes off too easily)   5) Shuts off for no apparent reason (While there is a sleep timer, I made sure this function was turned off and it still does it) 6) Cheap headphones 7) Arm band is universal/not designed for player (While exercising, player tends to shimmy out of sleeve)  8) Arm band water permeable (Sweat soaks through arm band and gets player wet)  In short, there are a lot of great features and has the potential to be great MP3 player, but until Visual Land uses better quality materials and work the bugs out...Unfortunately I rate the player as a piece of Junk.  Go with the well known companies instead.
