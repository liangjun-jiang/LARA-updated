<Title>The Best Looking MP3 Player!
<Date>Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I opened the package skimmed through the instruction book and was listening to music in no time. The FM tuner is good, better than any other in my difficult to recieve area. I enjoy the belt clip, presents the joy-stick at just the right possition. I cannot imagine using an arm-band. The sound is awesome. The controls are easy to use. I remain very happy I chose Samsung. I feel Samsung is miles ahead of iMac.

<Title>SUPERB!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
<Date>Sun Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This wonderful tiny unit has it all!  I myself am not an ipod fan.  Yes, they do contain more memory but lack in other areas.  I needed a high quality voice recorder with decent sized memory capacity and this baby fits the bill with extras to boot.  A screen to view text or pictures, FM radio with great reception, time,voice recording and a host of other features which you may need in the future, if not right away. Rechargeable inbuilt battery that can run for 9 hours.  Sure beats having to constantly replace those draining AAA batteries. Its size is fantastic?  Discreet - unlike the somewhat larger ipods, which the same cannot be said about. You can clip this on your trouser loop and no one will be the wiser, and no chance of losing the unit either. I love it and cannot find a fault at this stage.  This lovely audio player is all I will need for some time. I don't know why some US sellers are unhappy about the US price tag.  In Australia the item costs twice as much and I still wouldn't trade it for anything else.

<Title>Feature-laden and good quality
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's great for almost all the reasons everyone else has shared so I won't repeat them here.  So instead... here are the things which I didn't like about it:  - I found the "joystick" navigation allowed for multiple errors which could've been entirely avoided had Samsung used the standard push-button navigation (assuming it wouldn't drastically change the form factor).  Although infrequent, sometimes when I intended to press straight down on the joystick it'd slip in another direction forcing me to navigate back to the original screen and try again.  - I'd prefer a carrying case that's more protective, especially in covering the screen and corners.  The way it looks, I'm afraid the case will break before the player does.  - The carrying hook is somewhat annoying if you don't use the lanyard since it rattles about (and it's especially evident when recording voice).  It would've been nice if it was slightly depressed within the device with a rubber cover over it, like a smaller version of the one on the bottom.  - Playback while fast forwarding or rewinding should be audible, but instead you don't hear anything.  - The headphones are definitely a disappointment.  My pair distorted slightly at middle volume when I turned on the SRS, Bass Boost, and WOW enhancement options.  (Test music was a 192kbs encoded Elliott Smith mp3.)  Also, retractable earbuds might've been a good idea to continue the theme of small and compact.  - Aluminum/magnesium shell is a bit soft, but it's understandable since it was an obvious choice of style over substance.  I scratched it on Day 1 as I was putting the device into the carrying case (you need to make sure that the initial fit is perfect before sliding it in).  Other than that...  this thing rocks.  :)  Samsung should build a phone around this with all the trimmings.  Even with a slightly larger footprint, I'd buy this to avoid carrying multiple devices around.

<Title>Great features, small unit
<Date>Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I also agree with the other reviews so will not say everything over again either.  I will point out a few things I liked that I didn't see in the other reviews.  *Love the FM record feature.  I set it up to automatically record my XM Radio FM mod signal every night and I have a fresh playlist everyday without having to download songs to it (but that's easy, and I still do occasionally).  *Don't forget this works as portable storage too.  You can create folders and move files with it from computer to computer.  *I liked the belt-clip over the arm band myself.  IMO, it makes it easier to remove and replace.  Plus, I just don't like things straped to my arm.  *Very easy to learn how to use.  Plus, you can play with the other features and most of the time be able to listen to music at the same time.  I figured everything out on my first walk.  *Very complete and well written manual.  I would assume someone in THIS country wrote it.    Tip: The manual suggests using the included software to convert CDs to MP3s, but I found it easier to use Windows Media Player.  Just rip your CDs to the WMP library (which converts them to WMA, and then Sync your library with the player.  Works very well, and this way you only have to use one program.  I didn't really dislike anything about this player, although I don't see much use in the text or image viewer.  The screen is too small and not THAT good to do either well.  The hard drive is a little smaller than a comparable iPod or Zen.  Overall a very good value, especially since it's cheaper than the mini versions of iPod and Zen (at least mine was, after rebate) and have most if not all or more of the features.

<Title>bad experience
<Date>Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>well, this was the second mp3 player i bought. the first was a sony  NW-E75 that i bought and it worked great. only reason i decided to buy a new one was because that one only had 256mb of memory and now i was looking for a 1gb player. so i went to circuit city and was looking at the 1gb players. i decided to go with the samsung YP-T7Z over the sony NW-E507 because the samsung looked smaller and more compact. so i bought it, took it home, and wanted to try it out. the first thing that got me was that when i opened it, it said i had to charge it for 2 hours, which seemed odd to me. well i did, and then, i decided to test it out. i plugged in the headphones, and pressed play to hear the 2 default songs already in there. i will say that the sound quality was wonderful and i was impresed. however, when i switched it to the next song, it stopped in the middle of the 2nd song. i thought it was because i acidently pressed play or accidently hit a button, but it had gotten stuck for some reason. i couldnt turn it off or anything. i tried pressing stop several times, nothing. menu, nothing, tried the reset button, nothing. it was just stuck there, the screen still lit up. so needless to say, i was dissapointed, because it would have been the perfect thing to work out with. i took it back to circuit city and just stuck with sony since i already know it. i know its odd to base ones opinion on one defective device, but the sony products i have so far have not caused me any problems.

<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's really kind of cool to have such a small player carrying so much music or audiobooks.  The earbuds seem fine--good fidelity and fairly long cord.  Haven't figured out if I like the clip attachment better than using the cord with the player dangling around my neck--nice to have a choice, though.

<Title>i love it
<Date>Thu Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the player 3 days ago and so far im loving it. I got the 129.99 refurbrished 1 gig one, and apart for a minor very unnoticeable scratch, it feels and works like new. Im very confident that i will not be using the 90 day manufacture warrenty (ill post again if the player breaks down on me).   As for the player, im totaly in love with it. My first impressions when i saw it and picked it up was how light it is, and not to mention very very small (its easy onto the palm of my hand and i have small hands). I expected it tobe much heavier because it was so small.   It has so many functions for such a little player, it can... view photos, text, record voice - fmradio - and directly for another portable audioplayer with an included audio-in wire, there is VERY powerful(the most powerful fm tuner on a player this size ive ever seen, channels are sooooo clear) STEREO fm radio with 20 presets, i think somone wrote on a review there is no playlist...well there is a playist! the player also has a clock and shows the bitrate of the song that is currently playing( a feature i've never seen on a player before).  I've heard a complain its very hard to see the screen, its not bright enough or too glazed. Its true when you dont press anything screen goes very black and its hard to see the screen, but once you touch the navigation button it lights up brightly. It becomes very visible and readable even with a small screen.   Im not sure about battery life, but i've been using it for 3 days without a recharge and its still on full! I think ive used it for a total of 5 hours. I'm pretty sure it will last you a whole 10 work day.  The player also doubles as a usb storage device, it comes with a very little direct connect usb adapter that turns your player into a thumb drive.   As for the softerware i have not tried it yet, but it does come with software for your music, photos, and text.   The only draw-backs are the earbud headphones are not that great.And the player does not come with a case only a belt clip. The player is sooo cute! i dont wanna get a scratch on it. I hope  a 3rd party makes a case soon.

<Title>If  you are a runner, look elsewhere -
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you run, & sweat when you run, this unit will NOT hold up. Samsung will tell you it is designed for sport enthusiasts...it is not. This MP3 (1 year) malfunctioned due to 'Water Damage' resulting from perspiration...not caught in the rain, not dropped in the sink. It is not repairable, not honored by the warrantee, and Samsung basically washes it's hands because of their own poor quality casing design. Guess I'll be 'running' to have better luck with an iPod...

<Title>It's great unit!
<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It plays ogg. on the fly playlist. firmware support. fm/picture/text/music/usb drive...plus voice/fm/in-line recording... hot damn.  All features are implemented quite well even FM radio and FM recording.    I am very picky when come to spending this kind of money.  But I definitely feels that the extra $50 on this compare to the iPod shuffle is well justified.   Only bad: price.  could be $50.00 cheaper.  It also features internal battery instead of using AA/AAA battery. It's a trade off between size and style.  Do expect this unit to die after a couple years of hard use since it's internal battery will eventually give out.  This maybe a buying decision for some of you.  But for now I am happy...somewhat...before I realize how much I spent on this.  Now only if they can put a 20GB flash chip and make it play video...lol.  It's a wonderful ultra compact unit but for a price.

<Title>howie
<Date>Fri Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: It is the one of the first players that is Certified for  MS Windows Media 10.0 play for sure, which mean it will play all existing audio format, mp4, ogg, secure wma, asf,etc.  This is my first FLASH mp3 player. Yes it looks expensive. but the quality is amazing, I am picky to the sound quality. The SRS and WOW, and equalizer feature is awesome. the charger is 120V and 240V also, good for shaver plug in all 3+ star hotels over the world. It also can slowly be charged from any usb 2.0 port too. This unit is very small and looks sharp.  The supplied headphone is superior in quality,  not those cheap one that you need a replacement.  The screen is vivid, and it can play picture and text files too. ( I can download some notes and minutes to read )  It also have a voice recording mp3 recording, and FM stereo recording that is so nice. Language support is wide and all songs id tag can be displayed in its own language.  The belt-clip is perfect for guys that used to wear beeper, the necklace is preferred by the ladies.  It is a flash player so you can jump up and down without worrying the harddrive crash like in those big harddrive based ipods.  The ipod shuffle do not even have a display, does not fit me. The menu control is very innovative, one small menu button, and I can browse through the menu and change setting quick  after reading the small booklet provided.  It will last for 16+ hours per charge.  I called this my silver match-box player. ( a bit more than 2") Oh, the metal shell is made with magnesium alloy, not some plastic casing.  Cons : Be patient on the initial battery charge, it does take me 1.5 hour. And make sure to unlock the HOLD button. A bit expensive, but what the heck, it is a gadget, and you need to get one that really make the ipod shuffle inferior.

<Title>Awesome player...
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this player a little over a week ago.  Here are my observations and thoughts so far:  1) Size: The size of this thing is amazing, so tiny.  You can't even tell if it is in your pocket.    2) FM: I have used this several times in the gym, they have the mini transmitters so you can watch and listen to the TV.  It works great and helps pass the time.  3) FM Record:  Works great, haven't used it since when I was first playing around, but the record quality is good.  4) Line Record: Works pretty much like the FM Record, sounds great, works like a charm.  5) Color Display: HUGE plus. It looks cool, the menus take a bit to learn, but after about 20 minutes of messing around it becomes 2nd nature.  I haven't used it for picts yet, but given the small size, it will probably be more of a "wallet" shot kinda things, (picts of the family etc).  6) MP3: plays most file formats I can think of...the burn software inclued works well.  7) Sound: Using the earphones provided, the sound is very good.  I have yet to hook it up to the stereo, but given the sound quality so far I am sure it is excellent.  The EQ features all work great, lots of stuff to mess around with.  8) Battery: I have had my player for a week, so far I have not even seen a decrease in the power bar. My use so far includes:     - 3 trips to the gym (45 min each time)     - 2 flight SEA-LAX (about 1.5 hours use each way)     - office and home use about 4 hours     - Loaded about 500mb from the USB     - Recorded 2 songs via Line record     - Recorded 1 song on FM  9) Battery part II: I was concerned about the built-in battery and almost purchased another unit with a AA due to that fact.  However, given my experiance so far, the battery life has been excellent.  I also did some homework on the Samsung website.  You can order a replacement battery for about 50 bucks.  If you are in any way mechanically inclided I am sure that it is not complicated to replace it.  If the battery craps out in the near future I will probably go that route.  But given the way technology goes, by that time I may want a new player. :)  I have no regrets in purchasing the player.  The one thing I wish they had included would have been an integrated USB port (ala Shuffle).  While it would have doubled the size, it still would have been nice.  I did have a chance to look at the shuffle and it doesn't compare.  Just that one feature.  Enjoy!

<Title>A tiny, stylish, powerful little player.
<Date>Sat May 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>[[ Pro ]] WINDOWS COMPATIBLE: If you are using Windows XP, you can plug the player in using the USB cable and instantly begin to drag and drop the files. There's no need to install anything.  HOW IT LOOKS: As other reviewers have mentioned, the YP-T7Z is tiny and light. The display screen is about 1/2 the size of the player, and the player itself is about the size of a large eraser, in other words, it's adorable.  SPACE: 1 GB, it can double as a flash drive. This is excellent if you want to transfer movie files from 1 computer to another. Currently I have 226 songs saved, with 70MB to spare.   FUNCTIONS: Impressive. This player is packed to the brim with functions. There's FM radio, voice recording, playlist creation, text viewer, and image viewer. The player also doubles as a calendar/clock--just like today's cellphones. Under "setting >> display >> languages," you can select to view the player in a range of languages, including chinese (S and T), French, German...even Hungarian. This is a really cool function if you want to show the player to your grandmother, who can only read Chinese.   For a college student like me, the "voice recording" function is particularly useful (when I'm not listening to music or the radio). In my experiments, I was able to pick up perfect voice recordings from 1 end of the house to the other. The voice quality was also pure--no static/weird sounds.   FM radio is excellent. When I set the frequency to "high," it picked up many stations around my city that I didn't even know existed. It has 20 presets, which is more than enough for most people, I imagine.  SOUND: Awesome sound quality, especially if you have a good headphone.  NAVIGATION: Very very easy.  TRANSFER: On USB 2.0, the songs transfer almost instantly. So fast. On a slower USB (like the one on my laptop), a full album takes about 2 minutes.   EARBUDS: The earbuds are ligh gray (setting them apart from the white iPods) and are fairly comfortable after putting on the black sleeve/thingy.  BELT STRAP/NECK STRAP: the belt strap is clear plastic, and goes on securely over pants. The neck strap is pretty ugly though (it's a wire wrapped in a clear plastic).  [[ CON ]]  BATTERY LIFE: 10 hours (or so they claim). It feels more like 8 hours to me, but don't quote me on that. I'm having to charge the batter every 2-3 days which is a minor inconvenience. It takes me about 3 hours to fully recharge the battery, which is also a minor annoyance.  PRICE: This player is a bit pricey for a 1G device, so shop around the internet for the best price.  [[ SUMMARY ]]  I love my little Samsung. It's ingeniously constructed, pretty, and powerful. I would recommend the YP-T7Z to anyone who's looking for an alternative to the ubiquitous iPod.  [[ EDIT as of Dec. 24, 2005 ]] I've had this player for close to year now, and it's working fine. The earphones broke, so I got a new pair. Now I realize that you can get even better sound quality out of the player if you have a good pair of earphones. Once, when I accidently dropped it, the screen froze. I resolved this problem by pressing the "reset" problem. I recently took the player to China, and found that I had no trouble charging it using the Chinese electrical voltage.

<Title>You get what you pay for
<Date>Mon May 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Looks: Silver for 1 Gb version, Light blue for 512 Gb version, I have the silver one, has rounded corners and looks decent but not particularly impressive  Features: Plays many digital music formats, radio tuner, voice/line-in/radio recording function, with a touch of image view and text view, all inside the little box half the size of a mini-ipod.  Cons: If you selected the play-mode as "shuffle folder" and then you switch to playing a different folder, then the player doesn't "remember" the previous play-mode setting and would default to playing the songs in the folder sequentially. Also there's limited playlist support, to create a playlist one has to select each song he wants in the playlist and press a button, if you want to add hundreds of songs in different folders into a playlist it'll take forever. Controls are intuitive enough but sometimes I find myself mistakenly pressed and held the 5-directional button when I wanted to simply press it and vice versa.

<Title>excellent but with a few quirks
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really like the fully customizable equalizer to get the sound just the way I want it. I also like that you simply drag files from your WindowsXP computer to the MP3 player.  No extra software needed to move music files to the player.  The battery life is only OK at max 10 hours and it takes several hours to recharge, which seems a bit odd.  The little stick is a bit more loose than it should be -- sometimes you will move it up and it will think you moved it to the right, et cetera.   Still, the sound is so great, these are really minor quibbles.

<Title>Great Flash-Based MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this little guy and I love it!    APPEARANCE: The silver metal casing is great, durable, definitely better than plastic. The color screen is a huge plus, not necessary, but it definitely makes the overall appearance much more appealing. Displays 65K colors and is 1-1/4in in size.  Buttons located on side of player are easy to use. One very minor drawback I feel is the small retractable clasp on top of the player for which a neckstrap can be attached.  When no strap is attached, the clasp retracts, rattles around and is very annoying.     MENU/FOLDERS: Very easy to view and understand. Folders consist of Now Playing, Navigation, FM Radio, Playlist, Image Viewer, Text Viewer, Settings, Exit.   NAVIGATION: Though the navigation takes a little while to get accustom to, just spend a few minutes playing around and you'll figure it out. The only minor drawback is the navigation toggle. It feels a little loose as other reviewers have mentioned, and it tends to misguide you sometimes. An example might be I want to increase the volume, though when I push the toggle up it sometimes might accept the right or left toggle action, thus changing the music track. Again, you just need to play with it a little to get the movement down.  If you have large thumbs....good luck!    BATTERY: Lithium based; Charge time roughly 2 hrs; Playtime is around  8-10 hours.  OTHER COOL FEATURES: Equalizer with SRS and WOW capabilities; voice recorder-great sound quality; FM radio with preset options; Picture viewer-view jpeg images; Text viewer-read .txt files, Doubles as a Flash storage device; Screensaver-displays time and date; Etc.  DOWNLOADING & USB CAPABILITIES: Too cool! This player is designed to work flawlessly with newer versions of Microsoft Windows Media Player. Simply click and drag your music files from your desktop to the player via the USB 2.0 adaptor and you're done...no software needed! Though the Samsung YP-T7Z does come with software to adjust images, create music folders and playlists, if you have WMP you're all set. You can also connect the YP-T7Z to a CD player and it will record your CD music files into MP3 format.  Hope this was helpful!
