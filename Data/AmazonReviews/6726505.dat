<Product Name>RCA Lyra&#8482; 20GB MP3 Player - RD2850
<Title>Great Player
<Date>Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I could not be happier.  Perfect size, great display, and easy to use menu. The Lyra comes with everything you need: Player, AC adapter, Car adapter, clip-on headphones, RCA cables, & software. The only thing missing is the 68 page manual which is online.  Once the software was installed my compter recognized the player as a drive and I could either use MusicMatch to send MP3's to the player or drag and drop any type of file - yep it's a portable drive.  The unit also has a FM radio and you can record on the fly.  Great sound and the LyraDJ software is very intelligent. Highly recommended. Battery was still going strong after 12 hours.

<Product Name>RCA Lyra&#8482; 20GB MP3 Player - RD2850
<Title>Space, Size, and Solid
<Date>Mon Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had spent over 3 months researching players and finally settled on the RCA2850.  There isn't much bad to say about this model, although a few things kept it from getting 5 stars.  My principle concern was space and having 20Gb makes the difference.  I've got over 1200 songs on it already and still have over 14Gb to spare.    Keep in mind however, the majority of my music is ripped 128K WMA.  I've found MP3 at the same rate to be slightly more expensive spacewise, and I personally haven't noticed a sound quality difference.  So obviously higher bitrates will result in more used space.  Physically, the construction is solid.  Metal is the primary material (instead of cheaper plastic) and the controls don't feel flimsy.  The one minus is that sometimes it takes a few times for the control to register with the player.  Don't know if it's a firmware or a hardware issue, but every now and then it can become annoying.  The size surprised me.  It's much smaller than I would've thought and I am very happy with it.  Integration with PC.  Since it's a portable HD, my PC (Windows XP) recognized as such and had no trouble dealing with it as a normal drive.  Drag and drop files as you choose.  Most of my music is already in folders since I've ripped my entire CD collection on it using Windows Media Player and it puts everything in self named folders.  The profiling tool (either on the player itself or the software) does a GREAT job.  If your tags are correct, it'll sort them all for you.  The other minus I see is that when you have so many songs and artists, navigation can slow down.  Albeit, it's still easy to browse, it's just not very fast.  Clearly nothing beats the iPod on physical navigation.  Some pluses.  The display is fantastic.  It's backlit and sizable so normal sized song and artist names show entirely on the display.  While playing, there is a visible progress bar that shows where you are in the song as well as time elapsed, song, artist, genre, year, format, and bitrate.  All very informative.  The sound quality is very good and I haven't noticed drop offs in playback versus the CD.  128K seems to be fine.  The controls.  It would certainly do RCA well to include a manual as there is a bit of a learning curve.  The online manual is fine, but there's something about reading a book that makes the difference.  I have yet to figure out if there's a way to randomize the entire contents of the player rather than by folder (artists, genre, etc).  The are some other quirks with the firmware (as probably all do).  I've had it freeze up once, particularly when using the pause feature when shuffle is enabled.  Again, not often enough to make you mad but sometimes enough to be annoyed.  The FM-record is a nice include.  However, in practice it probably doesn't give you much considering the quality is only so-so.  My primary use for it is to record songs off the radio that I want to remember to acquire.  A voice recorder would do better for this purpose and another minus is no line-in functionality.  Packaging of the player is very good.  RCA did well to include all of your necessary peripherals.  A soft cover case, cassette adapter, audio plugs, headphones, power supply, and car power adapter, and USB cable.  The cassette adapter was very cheap and did not sound good.  I would recommend getting a good one.  And obviously the headphones as well (as most of them are when bundled with players).  Overall, I'd highly recommend this player.  If RCA could improve the navigation speed and fix some of the quirks, I would say it's right up there with the iPod (Obviously, I'm saying the iPod is the top at this point).  I'd also appreciate more format support.  Right now it supports WMA/Secure WMA/MP3.  But if you've been agonizing over a decision, let me sway you toward this model.  This choice wouldn't be good for you however if you needed line-in capability.  Otherwise, go with this model.

<Product Name>RCA Lyra&#8482; 20GB MP3 Player - RD2850
<Title>A solid HDD Audio player
<Date>Thu Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Had I not been able to resolve several issues that did come up in using the player initially, I would consider the RD2850 a below average player.  As it is, I would consider it a solid audio file player with a few limitations.    As I was searching for a hard disk digital audio player, I noticed the Lyra RD2850 came with everything you need to use it universally: ear clips, rca connector for stereos, car adapter kit, and usb to connect to your computer.  This and the size and weight were major motivating factors which resulted in my purchase.  Some of the other hard drive MP3 players force you to purchase these items separately, and virtually all of them are larger and heavier than the Lyra.  Unfortunately, upon purchasing my Lyra and loading it with music files, I discovered a few problems.   Problem 1 - many of my WMA files wouldn't play.  Apparently, the Lyra is not compatible with WMA files created by Media Player 10, which included those purchased from Microsoft's music download service.   Solution - I had to burn all those WMAs and rip them as MP3s.  Problem 2 - when jogging the player would give me a fatal error and shut down.  It would then take several minutes to reload.  Since my primary use of the player was for exercise this was an issue. I called RCA, and was told to reformat the Lyra, but that didn't work, so I sent it back and received a new one within ten days.  The new one was slightly better, but still gave fatal errors as I ran.  I called again, explained everything, and was told that because it's a hard disk player it will have difficulty being bounced around.  I wasn't excited about this explanation, but I will say that it was never difficult to reach technical support.  I reached a technician within a minute on each call. Solution - I have since found a remedy by holding the Lyra as I jog, not ideal but it works.  I believe that an arm strap would probably do the trick as well.  Problems with the bundled software - MusicMatch 8.2, which comes with the Lyra, won't put any Windows Media files onto your Lyra.  However, you can download Musicmatch 9 for free.  My experience was that Musicmatch 9 froze up constantly when I tried to upload songs to my Lyra, besides the fact that every button I pressed seemed to give me a pop-up telling me to upgrade to MusicMatch Jukebox Plus. Solution for me- Use the LyraSync software instead of Musicmatch.  Musicmatch is good for one thing, if you pay for the twenty-dollar upgrade.  If you have old MP3s with no ID3 tag, it will find them and tag them for you very quickly.  I decided it was worth it, because the Lyra groups the songs into categories from the ID3 tag.     Overall, I decided that I could handle all of these issues and I love the sound of the player.  Pros  Many accessories Great sound Windows treats the Lyra like an extra disk drive, so you can quickly copy any song (or other file for that matter) to it. Decent Technical Support Size and weight (small and light)  Cons Shuts down with a fatal error when jogging (unless held by hand). Not compatible with WMAs made by Media Player 10 Bundled software (MusicMatch) isn't very useful

<Title>Great player for the money
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you are in the market for a hard drive mp3 player, avoid the Apple iPod. The reason? Great players are available for less money. This player will hold a ton of music. The menu is very intuitive and easy to use, and the navigation buttons are instinctive. The RD2850 comes with everything that you need, including a case, cassete converter, line out converter, power supply, car power supply, and headphones. Buying these seperately could easily add up to $50. The battery life is great, clocking in at about 10 hours. To boost audio quality, it includes a 5 band graphic equalizer.  Pros -Easy navigation  -long battery life  -includes accessories -huge capacity for the money  Cons -Software is not very user friendly, needs improvement -Occasional error messages  Overall, if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the iPod, I would reccomend the RCA Lyra 20GB Jukebox (RD2850).

<Title>i'd rather have an ipod
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>okay, ipods are more expensive, that's true.  but from my exposure to ipods and this player, now i know why.  i received my lyra as a Christmas present, and i was excited about having all of my music on this little thing.  of course, i'm a big playlist user.  i create lots of playlists and enjoy doing it.  it's one of my favorite things.  well, after having this player for a couple of weeks and spending an estimated forty hours trying to figure it all out, i have still not found a way to have user-created playlist on the lyra that works without having the same song on the lyra twice.  it seems that you have to add all of your music, then the plalists that you add re-add those songs.  well, that's ridiculous.   another thing.  i have tested software for a publishing company for over four years, and i have seen some bad programming.  but the user interface for the pc software that comes with this product is terrible.  it's not intuitive (though the lyra itself is), and more importantly, it doesn't work.  and music match is a disgrace to all pc media players. all together, i'm trying to salvage what i can. i'm probably just going to end up putting select playlists on it instead of my entire library, which means copying songs manually to a folder on the lyra and then just playing it that way.  i played with my friend's ipod, and it worked great.  you can click and drag, that's it.  everything's done.   the one thing i like on the lyra that the ipod doesn't have is the radio record feature.  i record sermons off of the local radio that i could not get otherwise, so that is a great feature.  however, that's about it. basically, if you're going to use playlists at all, spend the extra dough and get an ipod.  if you're not, best of luck to ya.

<Title>Where the heck did my audio book go???
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I listen to a lot of audio books so I suppose the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player seemed like a great Christmas present for me.  And I have to admit that having an mp3 player with more capacity than my PC's old D: drive was a bit of a kick.  The unit is pretty large so it doesn't hide unobtrusively in my jeans pocket like my old Creative MuVo did, but that's ok, I'll clip it to my waistband and hope it stays there. As an engineer, I don't usually RTFM.  I didn't.  The Lyra has a USB I/F and a FAT file system, so Windows 2000 automagically recognizes it as a Removable Disk.  I proceeded to drag and drop 20G of audio books into it, almost 1500 files, into the directory called \MUSIC\.  That's a lot of audio since I listen mostly to low bit rate lectures.  Impressive! A little bit of random button-pushing got the device to profile the contents.  This took a while to complete, but that's fine, consider it part of the initial setup.  After that, some more random button-pushing (a million monkeys, eh?) got some mp3s to play, and even captured my favorite radio show as an mp3. Nice. It was all a bit jumbled in there, though, and sorting by Artist or Artist/Album or even by track title didn't make it possible to locate a 12 lecture series, much less pick out and listen to the 6th lecture.  Hmmm, seems the tags are messed up, I'll have to fix that.  Ok, let's install the software and get serious. Well, that's where the fun began.  The Lyra comes with an application called Lyra DJ.  Lyra DJ has a simple user interface - a big orange button labeled "Analyze Device" and a little gray button labeled "0 Sets".   "The main advantage of a simple user interface is that it prevents the user from actually doing anything." -- banth Push the button and voila'!  Wait several hours for it to analyze the device.  The analysis failed several times.  Ok, I'm a trained professional.  I can handle it.  I deleted most of my audio - a mistake, I realized, but that's what happens when you're wrestling with new hardware at 2AM.  This time the analysis actually completed.  In retrospect, if I had moved the files out of the \MUSIC\ file tree I would have saved myself a lot of hassle. I decided to continue at work, and this is where I realized that having a separate USB cable with a non-standard plug is a disadvantage.  My old Creative MuVo plugged right into the USB port so I didn't have to worry about forgetting the cable. Back at home again I ran the analysis and pushed Lyra DJs little grey button.  It only took a minute or so to create 15 LDJ sets.  The device itself calls these playlists.  Very kewl, *now* I can listen to some audio books... what the....??? According to the blurb, Lyra DJ uses "advanced acoustical analysis" to "create sets of related content".  I'm sure it does, but my tiny engineering mind wasn't able to discern the relationships between the items in the plain vanilla .m3u text-based playlists created by Lyra DJ.  I suspect that if you listen to music and in no particular order, this won't be an issue. I won't bother you with the irritating misspellings on the Lyra DJ app.  Most engineers can't spell anyway. I briefly considered editing the playlists manually, but as I juggled several open files cutting and pasting I realized that I just don't have time to futz with it, especially if I want to load another 18G of audio.  I was going to have to use another app to generate playlists. I also considered modifying the ID tags to enable the RCA Lyra itself to present them in a logical manner.  I don't &$^$ think so. The RCA Lyra also comes bundled with MusicMatch software.  Throw the installation CD away.  Save yourself some trouble and use something already installed on your computer to create playlists.  I settled on WinAmp.  So here's how to do it: Arrange your audio files in a neat, structured manner as subdirectories in the RCA Lyra \MUSIC\ directory. In WinAmp, create a new playlist. Also in WinAmp, Add a folder from your RCA Lyra directory structure to the playlist.  Make sure the files are sorted correctly in WinAmp - if ID tags are messed up the playlist will be scrambled. Still in WinAmp, Save the playlist to the RCA Lyra \lyra_playlists\ directory. From the RCA Lyra menu system, profile the device. It's important to save the playlist to the RCA Lyra so that the .m3u file has the correct paths. Simple, eh? I'm failing to see the benefit of carrying 20G of audio files when a 512M Creative MuVo carries an entire work day of audio. But that's ok, the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player is a serious Guy Magnet. Update 1/28/2006: After having used the RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro for a year I really have come to like it.  I continue to generate the playlists in WinAmp, which is just fine.  I don't use the Lyra software at all, though it runs just fine under Windows XP SP2. My best estimate is that I have over 300 hours of music, lectures and audio books in my RCA Lyra RD2850A 20G HDD mp3pro Player, with a few G left over for schlepping files back and forth to work.  If I were so inclined I could rip my entire CD collection into there. And it's still a serious guy-magnet.

<Title>Not user friendly!
<Date>Thu Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this MP3 player as a gift for Christmas and spent about 20 hours trying to figure it out.  I installed everything with no problem but trying use it was extremely difficult.  The user guide and quick start guide are both pretty skimpy so they were no help.  Trying to get information from RCA's website was difficult as the pages wouldn't load and I kept getting errors.  MusicMatch is their recommended music management tool and whenever I loaded music onto the player from there it wouldn't profile the songs so I ended up accessing only the demo tracks on the player.  I profiled the music using Lyra DJ and that didn't help either.  It was extremely frustrating especially because I was following the directions to a T - I wasn't winging it and making it up as I went along.  This was my first MP3 player so maybe I was making rookie mistakes but I exchanged it for an iPod (20 GB) last night and already have it up and running today - it took about 30 minutes.  The difference in cost was about $60 and, to me, was well worth the cost.

<Title>I don't see what the big problem is...
<Date>Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Windows recognizes this as a portable hard drive, so in Windows Explorer, I drug my music files (only 1250) onto the Lyra (which took about 11 minutes).  The booklet described the one simple step needed to tag them (right clicking on the Lyra logo in the active program bar and  selecting "Profile Device Contents").  (I do not use MusicMatch which is bundled with it).  That took about 2 1/2 minutes.  In all, I had my music library categorized and complete on my Lyra in less than 20 minutes.  The only problem I see with this device that cost it the Fifth star is its size.  Compared to other portable mp3 players, this is kind of bulky.  But oh well, nothing is perfect.  If you have the money, go buy an iPod.  If you feel like saving a  couple of bucks and don't have enough music to fill 60Gigs, buy this (after my 1250 songs, I've still got 13Gigs left).

<Title>Did not work reliably
<Date>Sat Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My Rio Carbon died but I bought the store protection so I went out and bought the RCA Lyra because I wanted to spend a reasonable amount of money, 20 gig was enough storage space for my tunes, and I liked the FM tuner.  I am pretty familiar with MP3 players this is about the 5th one I've owned.  I charged it up and loaded up the tunes.  However, it just did not work reliably.  It took forever to find songs and then just froze all the time.  I don't know if it was because I loaded up 14 gig of the 20 gig capacity or what but it just would not respond.  I tried updating the firmware but it didn't help.  It is going back to the store for a refund and I will try something else.  Too bad because it came with lots of extras including a car charger, one of those tape deck converters for the car, lots of cables, etc...  It also was pretty easy to link to musicmatch which was a plus because I use that.  But unreliable stuff has to go back.

<Title>Good for the price, but not intuitive
<Date>Mon May 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased an RD2850 about six months ago, mainly because of its price, and the accessories that came with it (namely, a cassette adaptor and car charger). A comparable IPod with those accessories would have been around $150 more expensive. While I saved a good deal of money, and am happy with the Lyra, it has a number of problems that one should watch for:  1.) The interface and overall design is completely counter-intuitive. It took me a long time to figure out how to even learn how all the buttons worked. 2.) The device tends to freeze every now and then, and when it does, it lets out a deafening buzz. By far the most annoying aspect. 3.) The headphones that come with the player are awful. While most headphones that come with mp3 players are of poor quality, these are exceptionally bad. 4.) If you subscribe to most music download services (Napster, MSN, etc.), the music format won't play on an RD2850.  If you're looking to save money on a 20GB mp3 player, the RD2850 is a good buy. It has its problems, but it does what you need it to. If money isn't an issue, buy an IPod.

<Title>STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So, I figured that I wanted a compact mp3 player of great quality that would have a decent amount of storage space- HEY THE RCA LYRA 2850 LOOKS LIKE IT FITS ALL OF THE CRITERIA! I couldnt have BEEN MORE WRONG!! After about a month of using this player I would get small things happening like freezing up and emitting an ear piercing noise in the middle of songs. That would happen on and off but wasnt such a big deal. Another month passes and the buttons on the Lyra player begin to stick and sometimes stay stuck. At one point my mp3 player would not turn off because one of the players buttons was constantly pressed down. The final straw was about another month later when i would try to power the unit up and it would give me an error message and when I would attempt to turn it off it would turn itself back on. It did this for a whole day until the battery finally ran out. I have since been issued a complete refund by RCA's parent company (thomson inc), dont buy this player or any rca portable mp3 units, they are not fully tested and if you do have a problem the customer service sucks. If you do buy this unit make sure you buy whatever  warrantee is available through the retail outlet or you will cause yourself much headache- like I did. It took me about 6 months to get this all sorted out. Im gonna try one of the Creative Zen units next.

<Date>Sun Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this for my birthday over a Creative Jukebox, and I've been kicking myself for it since. "Oh, it has a radio in it, that's a big plus!!" WRONG!! The radio is CRAP, and is NOT worth buying the product for. Also, as mentioned by the others, the buttons begin to stick after a while, and the interface is confusing. What's driven me to the point of writing this review is the fact that it won't even allow songs to be copied to it anymore!! And its not even to 1/5 capacity!! Back when I COULD put songs on it, that was just as maddening. I would have to apply intense pressure onto the USB cord just for it to even recognize it was attached. Also, I was charging it in the car once, and it thought it was connected to the computer!! And stopped my songs every 3 seconds because of it!! I have had problems with it freezing unexplicably, or not loading a song for 20 minutes. Another point of notice: MUSICMATCH is possibly the worst music program I've ever used, but it seems to be the only one the device recognizes! It has NEVER worked w/ WMP like it says in the little review above. Don't believe the lies, this thing is not worth $50.

<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this a year or so ago and (unfortunately) didn't get the extended warranty this time. After many hours of downloads, at least 100 CD's, it stopped working. I took it apart and found the tape that holds the hard drive to the battery had come apart in several connections. I called all over, searched the internet, and found someone in Canada who had the same prob w/a similar model. He knew of 2 other people as well.  I (finally) located RCA-Lyra Customer Service and was told after about 20 min on hold to give them my credit card number and they'd bill me $100 then tell me where to send the unit for "repair" I know they're going to just send me another of the same product and I'm going to lose my hours of downloaded music. The buttons DO stick, it takes forever to format the music (it reformats everything in the memory, instead of just the CD or file you added). I am not happy with this item. So now do I pay the $100 and get a new one or just say screw it and buy an iPod?

<Title>Thomson (RCA) Lyra - Used with Linux
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ok I'm using this thing in an unsupported Linux environment, but basically it works. Plug it in and it appears as a USB drive, drag and drop mp3 files onto the device. They play fine.  The battery life is good, a day's play no problem, the capacity is 20Gb and it can handle any type of file so is useful for data transfers between machines etc. It's capacity actually makes audio books worthwhile though it doesn't play Audible's .aa files.  Audio quality is very good, but the earphones you get with the device are cheap, get a decent set.  The user interface on the player kind of sucks. It profiles the M3s into genre, year, artist, album etc based on the mp3 tags, so make sure they're correct or it's a mess to use. If you use Linux, get hold of easytag and set all the tags correctly or use something like Grip which will fill the tags in from freedb.  The big niggle and why it's only getting 3 stars is that you can't play music *while it's charging*. If you try to, it crashes with loud buzzing and has to be switched off/on. It's been back to the manufacturer with the problem but it still exists. This is stupid and down to poor quality control, it makes the car charger useless and it means I can't play music while transferring stuff to it. It just doesn't multitask. Otherwise, when not charging, it's actually reasonably reliable for me. The little niggle is it can't create playlists of it's own, you have to create them on the attached system and copy them with the mp3 files, again something like easytag or rhythmbox can create playlists.

<Content>I had this product for a little over a year without a warranty. I used it primarily for MP3 recordings.  It died one day. The buttons  stick, its operation was confusing, manual confusing, nice screen. Not looking forward to getting ripped off by RCA (again) for a repair. Wish I had bought a more expensive iPod, it would have been cheaper in the long run and without the frustrations.

<Content>I just purchased this product clearence at a local book/music store, and I must say I am impressed so far. 20 GB capacity is a decent capacity. the display is big, nice blue back light easy to read. I have figured out how to make playlists, and it sorts songs by group. you can drop and drag files to the unit, or use Musicmatch to sync with the unit as well. Works a hard drive on the drop and drag. It comes with everything from power/charger cord, connection cables to computer and stero system, and a case.  Also headphones to boot.  Software disc as well. Only drawback is that the battery has lasted me between 5-6 hours when loading songs, have not seen how long it last with playing only. Also, it has locked on me a couple of times, but the reset button works ok without wiping hard drive, but worrys me.  Not a bad player.
