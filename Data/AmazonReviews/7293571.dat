<Title>Put your money elsewhere
<Date>Sun Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have owned an iPod for a little over a month now and still have not gotten it to synch with my PC.  I put my faith in the Apple myth that everything always works.  The amount of time and money I've put into trying to get it to work I could have put my money elsewhere.  Bottom line: Unless you have the time and money to try and make your iPod work, go elsewhere!!!!

<Title>Two iPods don't work: Playlist is empty after unplug
<Date>Wed Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my first iPod (1st generation, 5G, PC version) 3 years ago. During the 1st year, it's barely used. But right after the 1 year warranty expired, it's playlist always becomes empty after I unplug it from my PC.  Then I started running iPod for Windows 1.4 with iTune 4.6. Everything worked fine when I plug iPod and set up playlists and songs under iPod in iTune. But after unplug, iPod just jump to Language selection, browse to Playlist, it has nothing! Browse can see no songs either! I went to &#34;Settings-&#62;About&#34;, it reads: Songs:0 Ca... 4294967295 GB (Can't be!) Av... 4294967295 GB (Can't be either!) Version 1.4 S/N    (some number) Format: Unknown (should be Windows)  I posted help message onto comp.sys.mac.system group, got reply to let me restore iPod software. I tried every iPod update, they all worked the same way. Or I should say none of them worked.  I also walked into Apple store, the technician there said he couldn't help since the warranty expired.  After months of struggles, I finally gave up. The good news is that I can still use it as hard drive. But it has absolute no ability to play any music ---- although all playlist and songs show up when I plug it in iTune.  The story doesn't end here. I thought my 1st iPod is just old, maybe it's time to get a new one. I spent $399 + Tax got an 40GB iPod last week.  Hooked up with PC and iTune, set up my playlist and MP3, unplug for the first time, the lovely playlist shows up! I'm so glad to be able to play music on iPod then.  But on the very first day, the top menu button doesn't response to cilck while playing. This is a brand new 40GB iPod and just started to work for the very first day! I can not do anything but to reset it, ok, it started to work again.  On the 3rd day, I pluged in to update my plyalist again. When unplug, surpriseingly, all playlists are empty! Songs count shows ZERO! It actually has more than 10G MP3s loaded! Do I need to reset it again?  Reset, no playlist still. Reset again, still nothing! Reset for the 3rd time, just behaves exactly as my old 5G iPod --- no playlist at all!!  I have nothing to do again, I'll return it and get other device. It's a really nice-looking buggy crap!!!

<Title>IPOD is great - lthe music lovers product
<Date>Wed Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>enough has been written about the IPOD - I have been using mine for 2 months now - it is really well done - the click wheel userinterface lets me find what I want to hear quickly - I have the 40GB model with about 25 GB of music -   also I have started buying music from iTunes music store - the integration is really tight - although the prices are kind of high...... I did get the presidential debates for free - that was cool  Reality check - the battery management is a little funny - sometimes I pause, put on the controls lock - and then come back the next day to find the battery pretty drained - I do the same thing another time, and the battery has not been used.... also, I find myself taking the ipod out of the 40 dollar belt holder a lot - the weather is cold, so this is kind of a pain - I guess I need to shell out for the remote...  All in all - it is the best player out there for mobile use - but still leaves some room for improvements

<Title>Happily returned it and bought the Zen Xtra !
<Date>Thu Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I started with the 40 GiG Lyra... don't waste your money or time with that one.  Store convinced me to bite the bullet and buy the "end all be all" 40 gig IPOD! Spent 8 hours trying to get my computer to recognize this thing, it charged through the USB, but I kept getting a USB driver not found error after installing the latest update for Itunes, tried contacting Apple, no help unless I send it to them, so I unistalled everything (software, usb ports, drivers) then re-installed, still the same.   Fanatics on the Apple web site responding to this complaint from many people, say things like "buy a firewire card, it is the USB that is causing the problem" and "ipod is worth the hassel". - Ya, for $640 Cnd this thing should be hassell free in my opinion!! but should we expect an Apple product to be 100% compatible with a Windows PC ( I guess not ? )  I Took the "Iprod" back to Future Shop, and for half the money bought the 30 gig Zen XTRA - WOW !!!! - Easy install, easy navigation, replaceable long lasting battery, came with a case even !!!

<Title>IPod has so many great uses!
<Date>Sat Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After reading a few inaacurate ratings here, I decided to set the record straight. How could anyone rate an IPod 1 star, when it controls 93% of the mp3 player market? I have never met an IPod user that complained about software, etc....they all love it.  I have 4 computers, 2 PCs (lap and desk) and 2 Macs (lap and desktop) and am a musician and a serious electronics nut. I have owned Archos players, and as in anything I buy, I did my research before I decided to get my IPod.  I am so happy with this product, it really has so many great features and I use them all! I find that it sounds much better than the PC Mp3 files played on WM.  I have used the heck out of my IPod, I use it in school to record lectures, listen to them later for review purposes, I download audiobooks and the other day I listened to a book while waxing my car! it's so convenient, and extremely easy to use.   You just plug it in, it updates automatically, I use it with my desktop or laptop, and I just can't say enough good about it. The prices on ITunes are great, no need to go to a store and pay $13.99 or more for a CD that's $9.99 on ITunes in the convenience of your home too!   Software is so simple to use, a child could load and transfer, like all Apple products a breeze setting up/in less than a minute I was using it with my computer, after months of use and still my battery lasts the entire day! the Belkin ITalk for mic, and ITunes for FM transmitting, Bose speakers for home are all great accesssories to have.  I never thought I'd use it as much as I do, lately I have been transferring study notes to the IPod, great for studying anywhere! no books to carry! the music quiz game is great! I download directions to it, it's a PDA, a player, a book, notes, I can't say enough, Apple products are the best, well thought out and worth every penny.  Oh, I forgot great for music I have 3500 songs on it, a Dickens novel, many lectures, study notes, and it is only 1/3 full!   GREAT PRODUCT

<Title>Excessive Costs of Repair
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I dropped my new 40 GB iPod in the sink for the briefest of moments.  Believe me, it is not all that difficult to do.  Water rushed into the docking port and the unit is toast.  Naturally, water damage is not covered by the warranty.   But now the bad news ... it costs $249 plus $7 in shipping, or $256 to repair, compared to $399 for a new 40 GB iPod (or $299 for the 20 GB model with the same repair charge).  It is the same charge whether covered by warranty or not.  There is NO credit for being under warranty whatsoever.  Even a battery replacement is $99 plus $7 in shipping.    Apple product support personnel were matter of fact about the charge and the problem of water.  One person told me of an iPod destroyed by being splashed poolside.  Another mentioned that he has raised internally the problem of water rushing into the docking port.  Imagine walking around with this iPod in a steady rain.     My conclusions - the 40 GB iPod is a fragile, expensive piece of equipment with arguably a design flaw.  The excessive cost of repairs undermines its attractiveness.  It was my first Apple product and my last.  Bad show Apple!

<Title>Less than five stars?  You can't have really used one.
<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>At a time when the eye-popping technology advances such as seeing the Internet on an Ethernet connection have slowed to incremental improvements, my 20 Gig iPod is a huge quantum leap forward.  The iTunes software is a near miracle when mated to the iPod's elegant interface.  So what if you have five or ten thousand songs if you can't find them?  I am able to find any album, playlist, or song in literally seconds, using just one thumb to twirl the wheel and push a button.  The versatility is stunning.  You can listen with a headset or on *ANY* sound system, car or home.  With a $7 Radio Shack adapter, I use the iPod as the source to drive a 300 Watt amp and speakers that rock my house, or at least the room the speakers are in, with near live rock-show volume.  The incongruency between my old 60-pound-each speakers and the 5 ounce iPod on which I have my entire CD collection stored (about 300) is like seeing magic.  Or, you show up at a friend's house with your entire collection in your pocket or on your belt.  The fidelity is indistinguishable from a commercial CD.  I also have a mic and intend to record *all* lectures given in class beginning in a few days.  These also can be organized and found with incredible speed and ease.  This is one cool product.  Initially, iPods seem pricey, but Wow! do you get bang for the buck.  The price is very reasonable when you discover the power and control that you hold oh so comfortably in one hand.  I honestly don't see how anyone would buy something else (and I looked at stuff for a month).  You do need a fairly recent (2-3 year old) PC or Mac.  The only negative is the poor headphones that that come in the box, but that's easily fixed with about $15-20.  A Homerun  product .  Everything else is minor league.  The iPod is the show.

<Content>Got one for Christmas. Tried for a week to get the software installed and configured correctly. After many reconfigures and downloading of updates, the best the Ipod would do was skip like a three legged dog. Went online to Apple and found others with similar problems. Called Apple customer service and afer being on hold for 45 mins, the call was droped by Apple's answering service. After that the Ipod was on it's way back to the store and good ridance.

<Content>The iPod is already very nice, though it lacks in some areas.<p>-should allow dragging and dropping of media to drive w/o using special software to transfer songs to the iPod<p>-should connect to digital cameras and other portable devices to allow for storage on the road<p>-should have removable battery (for replacing when it goes bad -is your $400 iPod disposable?)<p>-should have longer battery life<p>-Should have codec support for other audio formats (see below), including MPC, Ogg, and FLAC. This is probably one of the most important<p>Codec (audio format) choice is a very importwhen deciding on a Digital Audio Player ("mp3 player").<p>I recently began looking for the best audio codec to store my large music collection. Nothing quite fit the bill. The thing that came closest was MPC, its ONLY problem was lack of hardware support.  I dont know if you are familiar with this codec but it has many strongpoints that beat MP3, WMA, MP4/AAC. <p>MPC is an audio codec similiar to MP3. The main difference is that MPC is optimized for quality (and is the choice of audiophiles), while the other new codecs are optimized to give acceptable (but not good) performance at low bit rates. For anyone here that cares about the quality of their digital music I would suggest you investigate MPC. It is nearly transparent (indistinquishable from CD) at 140-170. It supports gapless playback and has advanced meta tagging support. It compresses music very efficiently and encodes and decodes amazingly fast. In fact decoding it is so easy on the CPU that if MP3 players offered support for the codec they could greatly extend battery life. <p>You can read more about MPC here:

<Title>Unbelievable Apple Product!
<Date>Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Hey - I have been an Apple and Sony fan for years. I did tech training for Sony when they intro'd CD's in the 80's. So I love innovative technology! And the Ipod is it!  Essentially it is a 40gb hard drive in  a case that is thinner than a pack of cigarettes. You can use it a few different ways... <p>     The easy way is just let itunes put all your music on it and update it automatically. Take it with you and enjoy up to 10,000 tunes at the touch of your fingertips. Make your own playlists, take the ipod in your car and enjoy the drive. The music quality is great - it is easy to use - the documentation is poor as it is with all Apple products but that is the ONLY negative.<p>    I purchased a Belkin FM transmitter and even though I am in No California the music is endlessly repeated here. Now I have tunes in my car again. It sounds as good or better than my factory Honda CD player. So now I listen to NPR and have my music also!<p>    The other really neat thing is that since it is a 40gb hard drive you can basically set it up as a firewire drive and when you plug it into the dock (supplied) your MAC sees the ipod as another HD and you can use it however you like - even as a startup disk.<p>    For me though probably the biggest benefit is that it got me in touch with all my older tunes which I have not listened to in years. Brought back great memories of great music and put me back in touch with my music 21 century style.<p> <p>   P.S. Two kewl accessories FM transmiter for your car and new memory card adapter allows you to store pictures on your Ipod on the fly. Ipod, the missing manual book  (Pogue press ISBN 0-596-00477-x) tells you most everything that the manual does not.

<Title>The Best
<Date>Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is the best digital audio player.  It is better than Dell's new player and way better than Napster/Samsung's player.  (try them out for yourself and compare them to the iPod - if your going to spend a couple hundred bucks at least know what your getting before you commit a large sum of money)Design, ease of use, software, interface, capacity, sound quality, productivity and even battery life (though somewhat diminished since earlier versions due to efforts to reduce the overall size - a fair trade off in my opinion - after all, how often are you going to be away from an electrical outlet for some time.  And there are car chargers and add-on battery packs etc..) are exemplified in the smallest (and coolest) package in this world.  Speaking of packaging, the box that this little gem came in should qualify as art.  What more can I say.  It just works.  And it works so flawlessly, so seamlessly that I find it hard to imagine anything that is as close to perfection.  The touch buttons and scroll wheel, the backlight, the solid heft of it, the shiny stainless steel and high quality plastic.  Every ounce says quality.  This thing will last for a lifetime.  Even the included accessories are of outstanding quality - the dock with line out mini plug, dock connector to firewire cables, wall charger adapter, the case, the remote and even the earbuds!  Those are some great sounding earbuds.  (I've bought tape players and cd players before and they've all included really crappy headphones or earbuds)  And it is more than just the best audio player.  It has the ability to play some pretty cool games - breakout, parachute, solitaire, and amazingly enough a game kind of like Name That Tune - where a clip of a song is played and you have to select the right answer before the time runs out.  It has the ability to store contacts and text notes.  I've downloaded freeware programs that get the weather (- from weather.com)and the news (-from Google) and insert text files in the notes section - very handy.  And if you need to record sounds, Belkin just came out with an add-on microphone for the iPod so you can record voice notes, lectures, whatever you want, straight to disk.  With all these features, who needs a pda?  And let's not forget the software - iTunes.  I bought my 40GB iPod before the Windows version of iTunes came out so I got to experience using the iPod with MusicMatch (which was sufficient).  I've used MusicMatch for quite some time so I was already familiar with it, but iTunes has it beat in almost every regard - interface, ease of use, synching, playlists, searching, organizing.  It all works better in iTunes.  The only area that is better in MusicMatch is in tagging.  MusicMatch's SuperTagging features are excellent.  Give credit where it is due.  However, I have no doubt that future versions of iTunes (which is FREE by the way - MusicMatch, last I checked, was around $30) will improve tagging.  After all, this is (correct me if I'm wrong) Apple's first windows software and at version 1.1 it can only get better.  Overall, this is an outstanding product.  It sets the standard to which all others are trying attain - and the others keep failing miserably.  The iPod IS the best.

<Title>Wanderful piece of technology and style!
<Date>Mon Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Before I've owned my Apple computer I have been wandering why it has been  pricey relatively to cheapo PC. No questions anymore. There is absolutely no way to compare. Apple has proved to me its stunning quality, speed and amazing improvements from release to release. The iTunes software is really piece of wonderful engineering and I have been enjoying it for quite long time. So I've been shopping for digital music box. It is not true to say that I had no concerns about high price of this iPod and carefully checked characteristics and features. Eventually I have decided to try, partially because Apple store has 10 days return policy. The sound quality is nothing to compare to! I own most advanced  KOSS headphones, but after trying those tiny Apple's ear-bugs! WOW! Sound is reach, full of dynamic and exceptionally clear and precise. The navigation is SO SMOOTH that you take it for the first time in your palm and it's it! I'm browsing through huge number of records with 2-3 moves. <br>I would like to say that since I have started with Apple equipment I started to believe again that human being are intelligent! It is not crappy piece of hardware that you have to struggle to make it working.<br>To those who are looking on anything else and maintaining some skepticism about futures/price I would say: try it! It make you music listening just plain fun. You think about music, it's it. The integration of iTunes and iPod is example of well thought engineering.

<Title>First Apple product I bought: 40g iPod
<Date>Tue Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I been using Apple's product, since Apple II and thought they are marketed for the over-spenders.  This is a great product but not as revolutionary like some make it sound to be.  The hard drive is the biggest out there.  I have a 20 gigs Nomad Zen and I will compare it to my new 40gigs IPod.  The iPod is a little smaller and better looking.  I paid $250 for Zen, about a year ago, and got an iPod for a whooping $500, my bank account is now hurting.  The iPod's firewire transfer is a lot better and faster.   I put about the same amount of gigs on each and it took half the time with the iPod.  iTune for Window XP works great.  Both sound qualities are about the same, which is super.  Apple menu is easier to navigate.  The dock is nice, but unnecessary.  Since, it has no added feature then an audio output which is what the iPod line-out is for.  I simply like how it feels in my hand better.  The touch sensitive buttons is very cool and innovated.  Can be use as a external hard drive, but there are limitation on some features.<p>The Cons:<br>The iPod's slip on case is almost nonfunctional.  There is no opening to turn the wheel or see what on display since the remote has no digital screen to see anything.  The remote feels awkward like the old Apple's G3 circular mouse.  The combination of remote and earphone is way to long.  No ON/OFF switch, this can drain the battery if you unexpectedly bump a button.  The features of an FM tuner and recorder are expensive separate add-on so it make the iPod larger  Some of the other MP3 Hard drive players have these features already included.  Battery is not as long as I expect from a 40gigs $500 MP3 player<p>Reason to buy:<br>Why I bought the iPod is of the simple and best scroll wheel out there.  Finding thousands of songs on the scroll wheel is a breeze.  The menu is very simple and the integration of the itune is fabulous.  I love almost everything about this IPod except for the price and battery life.  The design aspect ratio to price favors Apple, not the consumer.  If people feel better, because they bought the word Apple and are willing to paid more, that is fine to.  I am not yet sold to the Apple's Nation with this product.

<Title>My iPod
<Date>Tue Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>As a longtime Apple fan forced to live in a PC world, I was thrilled to finally get my iPod for Windows.  After getting used to the design, it's a great gadget to play with. And let's face it - it's a gadget.  I continually hit the 'menu' button which I think should be a 'select' button.  I can't really call it an Apple flaw.<p>I have not had the freezing up issues others have expressed. Software loaded easily. Musicmatch loaded ok too - but it's not horribly compatible if you're planning on using iTunes.  Drag and drop technology would be beneficial - but these are trivial issues. <p>The 40GB holds so much music - you are almost required to build playlists.  When fully loaded - or anything over a few hundred songs, it can be cumbersome to locate individual songs.  I can't always let it randomly play this or that.  Wayyyyyyy to controlling for that.<p>I have only really used my iPod when travelling.  It's great for plane rides.  I have yet to buy the adapter to use in the car - but when I do, I can kiss FM radio (except NPR) goodbye!  I also have not yet used it while running - but hopefully there will be no issues w/this.<p>It's an expensive investment.  IMO, totally worth it for a music lover.  If you don't feel the need to put as much music on it as I have, save yourself some money and go w/a lower storeage iPod.

<Title>iPod: Update.
<Date>Sun Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Update:  It went dead, probably because of a really bad power surge here, and Apple replaced it without questions in 72 hours. Nice work! My original review is appended. ****************************************************************<br>In what has to be the slickest execution of a new piece of hardware yet, this Apple-linked but PC-compatible product will make all portable music players obsolete in no time flat. I have been following trends in this area for a long time, and my last big MP3 player investment was in a SONICblue Jukebox. Wow, how fast things evolve! That machine, cutting edge 2 years ago, had a 6 gig hard drive and allowed only for rather slow uploading of music through its balky software interface via a USB 1.0. In addition, its organizational abilities were limited.<br>The iPod is about 1/10 the size of the old Jukebox, absolutely ultra high tech looking, with backlighting that awes and controls that work intuitively, and it uploads easily through a firewire or a USB 2.0 (optional) connection. <br>Music can be categorized and recalled quickly, with the scroll control making it all simple to access. <br>Sound quality is awesome, its earbuds light years ahead of anything similar. Capacity is incredible in the 40 gig model, holding 10,000 songs!(the 10 gig unit will hold 2500 songs, 15 gig unit will hold 3,700 songs, the 30 gig unit about twice that number). Battery life (6-8 hours when fully charged) is just fine. The (optional only in the 10 gig model, included with the others) cradle will recharge and synch the unit to your PC, but I bought the optional car charger for longer road trips. I also bought the FM transmitter that attaches neatly to the unit and allows you to play the iPod through your stereo sans wires, though the cassette adapter works better for that purpose.<br>A word about Apple's customer service: WOW! I ordered my unit on a Sunday, with the additional $19 for custom engraving on its silver back. In an hour I got an email that my order was being processed, and in 6 hours I got an email that it had shipped! The email included a tracking link, and I watched it move from Taiwan across the world in 2 days. I got it on Tuesday evening (!) and it was factory sealed/shrink wrapped and in fine condition. When I opened it (even the packaging is high tech) and took it out of its protective inner wrapper, I was delighted to find the engraving was there and was done just perfectly.<br>If delivering a great product and offering perfect service is to be lauded, Apple must be given the highest kudos possible.
