<Product Name>Coby DP-5588 5.6-Inch (4:3) Clock & Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player (Maple)
<Title>Middling picture quality in a handsome frame
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: low price, nice wooden frame w/ clock, plays videos and music, remote control  Cons: no built in memory, inferior picture quality, noisy sound on video playback  Overall this is not a bad gift purchase for our low-tech, elderly uncle.  I like the 4:3 screen, rather than widescreen so I don't have to crop all of my photos before loading them onto a memory card.  I've seen much better picture quality on more expensive units but for the price, it's good enough.  I had a more pleasant experience with video playback (other than a bit of audio noise) than with the $150 smartpants 8" (800x600) frame (a nightmare).  The Coby frame will playback an MPEG-1 video saved at 640px x 480px and the audio stays in sync!  I did find that it would drop the last second or so of audio on some clips.  I did not test MP3 playback.  Conclusion: We are seriously considering a second purchase for the grandparents.

<Title>Coby 5.6" Digital Photo Frame

<Content>The Coby 5.6" Digital Photo Frame arrived very quick and in great shape. It is easy to operate and looks very nice. We did not load the MP3 as we were not wanting this function and had read disappointing reports. The slide show looks very nice and made a great present. Wish there was a larger screen with the same design.
