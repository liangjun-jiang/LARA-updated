<Content>This little beauty plays mp3 and wma files no hassle - very easy to use -great little display and long battery life. has a loop for you to tie it to something of your choice. would have been nice to have a clip a-la the ipod shuffle but quite easily securable by other methods.  for the price you can't buy better

<Title>Useless
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I contacted this company a week ago. I have not received a response.   This MP3 player will not download into my computer.  We are running Windows XP which is listed as compatable.  It is obviously not.

<Title>First MP3 player that I've ever bought....
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love it.  Inexpensive, easy enough to use, and light weight.  Sure it doesn't have a whole lot of fancy gadgets and only plays music, but that beats carrying around a portable CD player anyday.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 is a must. The clarity of the screen is bright and legible. The clarity of the music is great, plays like a CD. It's very simple to handle and use. You can organize your music and jump to which songs you want thought the easy to use menu. It's easy to use for the most technologically imparied. To upload songs is quite easy. Its a basic plug and go with Windows XP. You just drop your music instantly into the apporiate drive and its instantly on there. Just turn it on and hit play and it will go though the entire list. It will accept any kind of song file. Its durible (I've dropped it countless times lol.) Easy to charge, just plug it in using a UBS cord. No BATTERIES HURRAY!  And the charge is long lasting. It holds a great deal of songs. 512 MB. I have had no problems with it what so ever. And it comes with a built in headphone/necklace device you can hang over your neck. I GREATLY recommend this MP3 player to anyone. CHEAP AS WELL!

<Title>It's not an iPod but it's not bad
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is more of a 3.5. It's really small and lightweight. It almost seems toy-ish. I've got about 110 songs on mine, and it's not full yet. It takes a little while to charge. If you're going to use it for running like I was planning on, it doesn't have a belt clip. It's not bad to hold while running, though. I've dropped it a couple times, and it's still okay. No radio. Sound's good. For the price ($19.99) it's not too bad. Oh, but it doesn't work on Windows Vista.

<Title>Great little MP3 player for the money!

<Content>I bought this for my 5 year old son.  He loves music but is terrible with CDs.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money in case he lost it.  He doesn't have a lot of songs so we didn't need a lot of storage.  This is perfect.  It was easy to load, easy to charge, has a easy to read display screen and sounds decent.  I wouldn't say it's top-notch sound, but not bad at all.  He could care less either way.  I haven't figured out all the playlist functions.  I just loaded the songs and he scrolls through.  I like having this more than a radio since I can control what he listens to.  We've had it for 3 months and it's always with him.  It's been to the beach and camping - and has spent a lot of time on the floor of the car.  So far it's holding up - and he's certainly not gentle with it.  I'm going to buy a few more for his cousins for christmas.  I did buy an inexpensive charger kit with a car and wall adapter so I can charge it when I don't have a computer available.  I have not been disappointed.
