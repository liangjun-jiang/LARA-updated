<Title>SAY YOUR PRAYERS, IPOD.
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing does everything the nano does(and things it doesn't like FM tuning and voice and radio recording)for less money.  The only reason to choose an ipod is if you want to be a trendy hipster(god knows there are plenty where I live).  The battery life is great and the shell is pretty scratch resistant.  Even the screen seems pretty sturdy. I found a compatible case logic armband for it at Sears for ten bucks-good luck finding an IPOD armband for less than thirty.  I haven't tried the video feature so maybe the last guy is right about that, I don't know.  But as far as music and photos this thing is great-Sandisc has a new loyal customer.

<Title>Much Better Than the Ipod Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Longer battery life, looks alot better, cheaper, has video capability, easy navigation, radio-need I say more? Ipod nano on the other hand.....has more assessories.  That's it.  Get the e250 instead of the nano.  You won't regret it.

<Title>A great MP3/WMA player
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: In August SanDisk released a firmware upgrade. Now there's a Custom EQ capability and best of all: syncing to subscription based music (URGE in my case) is WAAAAY FASTER. It's almost as fast as if you're adding your own local files. Previously this was the achilles heel, now it's fixed.  SanDisk actually made a good product better. :-) ______________________________________________________________  I just bought this for $150, a great bargain!  I have mostly WMA's and therefore have no need for an iPod. This player is terrific and it works with subscription services. The interface is easy, the screen is sharp and did I mention it's a great deal?   Oh and another reviewer said these things:  "The scroll wheel is a very loose, flimsy, plastic ring. It's also difficult to turn. Often, I need to use both thumbs to turn the wheel."  and  "Video playback is very buggy: A movie is arbitrarily broken into tiny video files, which the player displays and treats separately. It also adds 5-seconds gaps between them!"   I found neither of these to be true --I suspect the reviewer recieved a faulty device. The video playback is PERFECT and the wheel certainly doesn't require "both thumbs" to turn ...?!  And yet another "reviewer" stated this: "Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player" as their review heading. With minimal PRODUCT RESEARCH one discovers that this device charges via USB. Basically that reviewer is asking for something that this product is not advertised to do --and whose problem is that? What's next, being upset that his/her 2GB model doesn't hold 8GB worth of songs?  Helps to read the product description. ...

<Title>Beats any mp3 in it's category, especially the Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it for the ability to play music and it's great. It is far superior to the Nano in everything except the availability of accessories but it's slowing changing. In fact, I had bought a Nano and sold it because this is better.  For instance, 1. longer battery life 2. FM radio 3. recording capability (including from the radio) 4. scratch resistant 5. user changeable battery 6. ability to expand memory by using mini sd cards 7. better price.  Outstanding mp3 player.

<Title>SanDisk has done it again!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I like to read reviews before buying stuff, I've never been attracted to iPod, becuase there have always been better alternatives at a better price. Since SanDisk announced the E200 series  I decided it was gonna be my next digital audio player. well, I got it and it's a great little device. everyone can notice the great quality of this player just looking at it. its metal back and solid apperance shows it's very durable. I like the wheel control, it works great and once you get used to the buttons layout, you'll find it convenient too.  pros. -Eye-catching design, silver and glossy-black look really sexy. -Great quality built (metal frame, liquidmetal back and hard glossy front) -Easy to copy your songs, either by using Windows Media Player or drag and drop. -Gorgeous screen display, easily visible even under direct sunlight. -Great Battery life -User replaceable battery. -Decent earbuds provided. -The right size and weight. -Hard to scratch. -Plays videos, FM radio with good reception, shows pics and records voice and radio. -Easy menu, with practically no hidden or hard-to-reach pages. -Dedicated voice recording button. -Great audio quality.  cons. -No custom EQ, you have to use the provided ones only. The normal  (flat EQ) sounds great, though. -Catches all your fingerprints even if your hands are clean. -It should show more details about the playing song (Bitrate, format, etc.) -It has a clock, but once you start playing a song, you never see it again. -It's been storing some stuff under the screen, it doesn't look like dust, it's like some white crumbs that maybe come from the interior and not from the outside. if it gets nasty I'll take the unit apart and clean it up, I just hope it's easy to do so.  This is a nice player and SanDisk offers feature packed, great quality players at a very affordable price, get it if you can. Sorry iPod, maybe next time...

<Title>iPod Nano Killer
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, I do agree that this is a iPod Nano rip off. But this player adds so much more and has value for the buck.  I just bought this player after a lot of research about this product. Read video reviews on gizmodo and engadget before I got this. I'm extremely impressed by all the things that this player can do namely 1. Music 2. Video (1.8" screen) 3. FM  4. FM recording 5. Photos 6. Voice recording  I got this for $150 and it is surely worth every penny. The mechanical dial can look and feel little ugly but once you get used to it, it is not that bad.   Also this player has same length & breadth of Nano but is almost twice as thick as the Nano. It is also heavier than the Nano but somehow this feels more sturdy than the Nano. It comes with a lanyard and I wear this all day without any problems with weight.  The screen is very bright and the interface is very very intuitive.   The software (Media converter) that comes along with player is simple and easy to use. It converts videos to .mov format to be played. Music can be transferred by just dragging and dropping mp3s. Sandisk also provides firmware upgrades on their website which worked fine. FM recording was great though the FM receiver isnt really good. It also has a micro SD card slot that can be used to add more memory to the player.   Overall, if you are looking for something that can do way more than the iPod Nano and costs $50 less, you SHOULD buy this player. If you want to follow the crowd and cant think out of the box, then you should buy the iPod Nano.

<Title>I already despised the nano, and this is the nail in the coffin
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>NOTE: If you want to be a clone, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER! GO GET A NANO LIKE THE 8 TRILLION OTHER CLONES IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAVE ONE.   Otherwise, this player is the flyest thing I've seen in a minute. I was actually waiting for the e250 to be released b/c in doing research on it, it essentially had everything I wanted. MP3s, photos, fm radio, recording, fm radio recording, and even video! All this in a small but STURDY package. The obvious competitior is the iPod nano, which doesn't even compare to the e250 on any level. The nano would probably snap in half in my pocket if I sat down wrong. The drag and drop the e250 has is so simple my dog could do it (no, really). The only thing that I recommend is looking up the user guide from sandisk.com which has way more detail than the included instructions. Otherwise, buy this! I wouldn't steer you wrong.

<Title>It's great!!!! The best mp3 player i have ever bought!!!BMO
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I have ever bought. I you ever need to buy a mp3 player TRUST ME!! Get this one. I was just a normal person looking for a for a mp3 player. I got it at best buy about one week after it was on the market. I have not had one single problem with it once. I had and i-pod before this. But it broke in the washer, and the sansa could probably be ran over with a car and not break(liquidmetal). It Plays video but you need quick time player 6.5 or more. Save it to that and you're good. The only thing i have a problem with is the music store. Rhapsody is horrible, but windows media player works perfectly. But if you want a music store choose something else. So, an overall preview on it, is,it can store up to 400 songs, plays video, fm tuner and recorder, can store info and pictures, and is great. It also can scroll down very fast. In the box comes a starting disk and manual. Trust me get this mp3 player. It beats the nano by far!!!!!!

<Content>I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books on a long commute, and I purchased this when the last MP3 player I had died after 4 months (with a 3 month warrantee) - Avoid Coby!.  Used that experience to look much more closely at what I wanted - a replaceable battery, easy to use controls, easy to read display, reasonable power consumption.  This has met my expectations and more.  A very solid, well performing player.

<Title>DO NOT BUY, DEFECTIVE
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently got this MP3 player and was very excited. The first thing I did was start charging it. Then I turned it on. The first thing it did was say "Key Locked, System Shutdown". I thought it might have just been one of those random things that happen so I tried turning it on again. Same thing happened. I tried one final time, and IT DID NOT TURN ON AT ALL AND NEVER EVER DID FOR THE REST OF THE TIME I HAD IT. I returned it and in 1 day already had a new one, thinking this one would work fine and the last one just had a defect. It worked great for about 1 week, and then one day I tried to listen to music and it said "synchronize to continue your music subscription" and would not let me listen to any songs. My sister has the same MP3 player as me and had the same thing happen to her and all she had to do was plug it in to the computer and then it worked fine, except for she could not have it on shuffle and she also could not skip songs so she had to listen through songs to hear one that she wanted to listen to. If she had it on shuffle or skipped songs it would give her that message I talked about earlier and would not play the songs. So, I plugged my MP3 player into the computer, hoping it would fix the problem, and it would not turn on at all, and still won't. Also, some of the songs on my sister's MP3 player will still not play. I have gone through two of these MP3 players and both did not work properly, and my sister's MP3 player is defected and will probably stop working just like mine did. Both me and my sister are very dissapointed and are both returning our MP3 players. I am not going to get this one again and neither is my sister. It would also be wise for you to take the same path as us. Do not ever buy this MP3 player!

<Title>WILL NOT PLAY SONGS
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this MP3 player at the end of May, and was very happy about it. I immediately synchronized songs onto it, and it worked very well. The sound quality is very good.   HOWEVER, after a couple weeks of owning this product, something very strange occurred. It was playing completely normally, and all of a sudden when it was going to the next song, it would NOT play and a message came up reading "Synchronize to continue your music subscription". I was very confused; I had obviously synchronized the songs onto the player.  It would not let me listen to any of the songs for the rest of the day. Finally I got home and plugged it into the USB port, hoping that this would solve the problem.  I unplugged it, turned it on, and it seemed to be working fine.  But then, the very next time I used it, the exact same problem occurred.  I found that if I don't have the Music Options set on "shuffle" and don't skip forward, it USUALLY will play just fine. Otherwise, it won't let me play any songs and keeps giving me that annoying message.  Even when I don't use shuffle, however, it still will occassionally not allow me to listen to certain songs.    In the end, I am returning this MP3 player and am not going to buy another one of the same brand.  There are lots of good reviews for this product, but maybe that is just because those reviewers have not yet experienced this problem.  It seems to be defective.  Everyone should save their money and time, and avoid this product at all costs!!!!!!!!

<Title>BETTER THAN NANO!
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>***The person who's title is "DO NOT BUY,DEFECTIVE" is a total idiot. I had the exact same thing happen to me! Guess what I did! I unlocked the hold switch and PRESTO! It magically started working!***  Anyway...this is BETTER THAN THE IPOD NANO. Both of my sisters have a Nano and after I got this and played with it for a while, I looked at my sisters nano and laughed at it! It wasn't near as good! The E250's screen is probably twice the size of the nano, and the bright color screen is mouth dropping. AND YOU CAN HAVE VIDEO! YES VIDEO! It can't hold A WHOLE LOT, but it can still have videos. I am more than satified with this product. Some more awesome features are FM Radio and Voice Recordings. I'm not sure if this is mentioned in the description already but YOU CAN RECORD A SONG STRAIGHT FROM THE RADIO SO YOU CAN HEAR THAT EXACT SAME SONG ANYTIME!!!And you can still listen to that song while you're recording it. Also the Voice Recorder, doesn't sound like a big deal, but mannn is it fun to toy with! haha! Another neat little feature is you can "see into the future". You press a the middle button once or twice and it tells you what song is next! Here, let me break it down for you!...   THE GOOD...  ~BRIGHT & COLORED BACKLIGHT MAKE IT MORE THAN EASY TO READ SONG TITLES,ETC... ~SCROLL WHEEL IS VERY EASY TO CONTROL AND VERY ATTRACTIVE ~THE OVERALL LOOK IS VERY ATTRACTIVE ~SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT ~MORE THAN ENOUGH FEATURES (MUSIC,VIDEO,PICS,RADIO,RADIO RECORDER,VOICE RECORDER) ~VERY LARGE SCREEN ~NICE PICTURE QUALITY! ~THE 2GB CAN ACTUALLY HOLD 1000 SONGS IF FORMATTED TO WMA. ~AND MORE!  THE BAD...  ~SOMETIME YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PRESS BUTTONS TWICE ~CAN SMUDGE EASILY ~HAS TO CHARGE BY A COMPUTER ~UPLOADS MUSIC IN A "WEIRD WAY" BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ~AND THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF!!! (SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YA?)   OVERALL : GREAT PRODUCT - I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!

<Content>I've had my Sansa for about two weeks now, and love it.  The positive reviews here are spot on.  You definitely have to download the full product manual at sandisk.com, or you'll be a little frustrated trying to figure all the features out.  There are also a couple of good discussion forums out there if you search for them. Earphones are crap, but then most every review of MP3 players say that.  Overall, I'm impressed, and glad I bought this vs. the Nano.

<Content>This player is definately worth the money, but there is one flaw that annoys me. The media converter for video (pictures work fine). The video function for me plays well, but without audio. I am still trying to find a way to correct this. If I can get this function to work, I would change my rating to five stars. The screen, music playback, and pic viewer are all great. Technically, the video playback is also clear, just without audio.

<Title>Think Twice Before Buying
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player thinking I would be able to use it to listen to my music and the radio on my daily commute.  The radio worked fine.  The MP3 player worked, but I could not load music on either of my computers.  I have a Macintosh desktop at home. The Mac would recharge the device, but did not recognize it.  The other computer I have is an HP laptop with an XP operating system.  It would not recognize the player at all, I kept getting an error message.  Once, during the two hours I messed with it, it froze and had to be rebooted.  I called tech support and found out that the Sandisk Sansa 250e will not work with a Mac at all.  His other suggestion was that the device needed Microsoft Media Player version 10 or 11 or it would not work.  I checked my laptop and it had version 11.  I sent it back and got my money back.  I bought an Ipod clone that works great on either system.

<Title>Better than the iPod nano, even better with Rockbox
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had limited experience with mp3 players, but have found this one to work very well for me. I had used the iPod nano and the sansa m240 before purchasing this mp3 player.  This player is better than the iPod nano because:  *You don't need iTunes. You can sync files from other music ompanies. *You have a very handy voice recorder built in *You can watch video once you have encoded it to play on the sansa (free software included) *You can (sometimes) get halfway decent radio. (But hey, the nano has nothing so what do you have to lose?)  I purchased this player over the sansa m240 because I wanted to be able to play video. (something the m240 can't do.)  The format of the Sansa is decently pleasing to look at, and I was able to begin loading music within minutes of opening it up. I have always used Windows Media Player to sync my music, but you may be able to do a direct drag-and-drop sync with this player. (Locate the player in the My Computer folder, find the Music folder, and copy your music files right there)   My MAJOR complaint was the EXTREMLY annoying scroll wheel light. It glows blue when turned on and remains on while the player is in use. (Even after the screen light goes off) After using a nano, this light seemed blinding!! This is a huge drawback unless...  You install Rockbox! This free software available at rockbox.com removed the sansa software in the player and replaces it. The main reason I installed it was so I could turn the scroll-wheel light off. But rockbox offers so many more options, I probably would have installed it even if the wheel light was not always off.  You can: *change the font   *change the color of your screen *create your own folders (or use their database)  *flip the screen upside-down  *play games (none come on the original sansa) *and lots more!  I am really happy with this combination of the e250 and Rockbox. Once I loaded the software I was able to sync my music from two different computers. Basically, the computer reads the player as a UBS device, and lets me add and delete music on different computers. I have begun building my own "database" for my music by creating folders and organizing my music. Playing video was a little tricky, as the rockboxed-player will only play mpeg video. I downloaded some free converting software, and once I figured it out it wasn't too hard.    I have only had this player for a few weeks, so I am still playing with all the features. The player would probably be fine with the original software if Sansa would include a wheel-light off setting. The wheel problem is the reason I only gave this product a 4 star. Otherwise a great player, cheaper than the iPod nano, and a good starter player if you are looking for video and pictures on your mp3. If you are interested in Rockbox, visit their website www.rockbox.com and look at their free software. You can load software for other players besides the Sansa e250. Google it and see what you can find!

<Title>Exactly what I wanted in an MP3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one in the first week they came out, but just now am getting around to reviewing it. Why? I've been using my iPod touch, my iPod shuffle, and a few other odds and ends for music, but the Sansa e series does exactly what I want it to do and doesn't get in its own way. Its easy to use, battery life is amazing (about a week at 3 hours a day or radio and MP3) and so far  even after I've abused it leaving in the bottom of my gym bag it's still alive and doing fine. For the commute and they gym, it's my MP3 player of choice. Oh, and I'm a sucker for the cool blue light on the dial. What can I say?

<Title>Affordable, Expandable, Small: MP3 Player to Buy in 2008
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product to pick up right now, in early 2008, as prices drop. The Sansa e250 should be a Nano-killer, and it's a great buy for anyone who wants an inexpensive flash mp3 player for exercising, walking, or general use. I've owned a bunch of mp3 players, including iPods and one Nano, and here are the selling points for this little Sansa e250:  * Expandable memory through SD Flash. Buy a 2GB and by next fall, you can upgrade it very affordably to some mega size (16 GB? flash memory prices are falling). You'll have a cheap flash player larger as big as some iPods.  * Good sound quality. Via headphones, this is indistinguishable from any of the top mp3/iPods I've listened to. Don't know how it sounds in an audio system, but I don't recommend that for any iPod or flash player, just my tastes.  * Affordability, affordable, cheap, well-priced ... This thing is $69 online and at Best Buy. A few players, like the also excellent Sansa Click, are $49, but they are not expandable. For $20, that's a great option.  * One more note on affordability: Flash players and iPods sometimes get crushed, lost, stepped on, or dropped in rivers (did I mention I've owned a few?). That's their nature, or rather, our nature as clutzes. It sure feels better to hear your front left tire crush a $69 player, as opposed to a $149 one. Trust me.  * FM Radio. It's a great option, available on the e250. Works great.  * Usability. Compared to some of the uber-small players out now, you get a more readable screen. The interface is minimal but easy to use - what you want on a flash player.  *  Good size/form factor. It's not the Click, which is perhaps optimal in size, but it's small enough to attach to your clothes while running. I hold mine, which is plenty easy.  * Free 60-day Best Buy Digital Music Store trial (aka Rhapsody). I have gotten this with two of my past mp3 purchases. Have never signed up for the subscription service, i.e., never paid, but I love the 60-day free trial period. It's a great way to learn about new artists.  * Integration with Audible - pretty standard these days, but well done on the e250.  Negatives? There is not as wide a range of formats as you can play on a big old iPod or larger digital music player like the big Sansas or iRivers. But hey, this is your flash drive, for working out - for your selected collection, not the whole thing. And if you're strictly playing .wma or .mp3 files, you can in fact get the whole thing on there, using an SD flash card.  Bottom line: Probably the best deal out there now in the combination of features (FM, expandable), affordability (just $20 more than the cheapos), form factor/usability, and the not-to-be-overlooked sound quality.

<Title>Nice MP3 player for those on a budget!
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This Sansa MP3 player is a nice, rugged piece at a great price!  Pros: Solid metal case feels substantial, long battery life, nice screen size, cool blue backlight, plays videos, lots of accessories available, great volume Cons: Controls difficult to use for someone with big hands/fingers, no ac charger included(charger included works off of PC USB port)  All in all, this is a very nice Ipod-like MP3 player. Make sure you buy a case and AC charger with it!

<Content>Once I figured out how to convert videos, it was simple and easy!  You have to download the software for it b/c it doesn't come with it.  I contacted the company on a sunday and it was very quick and painless.  They were very helpful.  The videos are VERY clear and the music is a cinch to add.  Also gotta love the expandable memory. One way to save money up front on buying a larger memory MP3 player.

<Title>Excellent value for money; potential i-pod killer
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have used 2 ipods (a mini and a nano) and now I tried Sansa e250. Apart from the "click-wheel" navigation, i-pod nano faces serious competition from the Sansa e250. The reasons: 1. A bunch of features at comparable price points (a 2GB Sansa vs. a 2 GB nano) 2. Excellent look and feel (i accept the fact that ipods have the best form factor) 3. Value added features: non-scratchable display, excellent video quality, more rugged than ipods, FM Radio, Voice recorder, Battery that can be changed 4. The best: does not tie you down to i-tunes, can use industry standard mp3 version of songs, can create collection faster and cheaper (at abt 17p vs. 99p per song in itunes) The only weakness: Navigation for people with large hands! Buttons around "wheel" are a bit small for comfort  Suggestion for Sansa: 1. With excellent video and image qualities, a new version could be introduced with a camera. If form factor is a constraint some features like the radio and sound recorder could be done away with in the new version.

<Title>Features Great - Performance Poor
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this player for 4 hours, in that time I've had to remove the back of the device in as many times to remove the battery in order to reset the player.  The device locks up with no display, no sound no nothing but a constantly lit navigation ring.  Device BIOS is same as on SanDisk's website.  Direction in user manual state to "press and hold the menu button for 15 seconds to reset the system" BZZZZZTTT Thanks for playing!  That doens't work either.  Too bad, I really like the overall look, feel and features for the price.

<Content>The only problem with this player is that its just 2 gb. but it plays video on a fairly large screen for its size and its cheaper than the Ipud.  It doesn't work with Apple's "Itoos" service but just fine with Napster to go which lets you download what ever you like for a monthly fee and move it to your player.  Good stuff this Sansa, great price

<Title>great little machine
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have only owned one other mp3 player in my life, and that was 128k flash player by iaudio.  it was one of the first to come out, so it obviously pales in comparison to the players today.  I have messed around with ipods and others before, but never owned one, so my background on these players is limited.  however, i do know that the ipods are overhyped and over priced.  in my opinion, there is no comparison between this player and the nano.  this blows it away with all the added features, and it's cheaper.  i have had it now for about 2 weeks and so far it's awesome.  the only negative, and it is very small, is that the front is a fingerprint magnet, but let's get real here folks, if that really bothers you a lot you have got some serious issues.  other than that, it has great sound, and it's simple and intuitive.  it's also the perfect size.  there defintely is such a thing as too small, especially if you are a big guy with big hands, but this machince fits nicely in the hand and is easy to operate one handed.  the buttons really arent that hard to push, depsite what some other reviewers say.  i got used to them in about 5 minutes.  the program that comes with it to upload videos and photos is also very simple.  it's just a drag and drop system, just like you would do if you were using windows explorer.    bottom line is that it looks great, sounds great, it's easy to use, it has a replacable battery, and it has a lot of features that no other player in this price and memory size range do.  you won't be disappointed.

<Title>Quality MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I spent about 7 months researching MP3 players, looking for one with the most features at the most reasonable price.  Hands down, this player fits that description.  Here are some of the qualities that I love about this player:  1) Video capability:  although the screen is small, the short videos that you can load onto this player are fun to watch.  It actually comes with a short clip from, I believe, Star Wars.  The sound/picture quality to this short clip is amazing.  2)  Ability to increase music storage:  I purchased the 2 GB, but I have the capability to increase the storage by purchasing a memory card.  3)  FM radio:  If I get bored with the music I have, I can switch over to FM radio and listen to my favorite radio stations.  4)  Size:  I plan on using this when I run long distance, so I wanted a very lightweight player.  This thing is very small, and extremely lightweight.  5)  Music/Video/Picture Transfer from PC to player:  Before this player, I had a small Samsung player that I purchased back in 2002.  Although it has held up great, I dislike using the software to transfer songs from my computer to the player.  This SanDisk Sansa is compatible with Windows Media Player, making the transfer process quick and smooth.    There is one drawback to this player.  There are hardly any accessories to choose from such as armbands, fm transmitters, etc.  I have yet to workout with this player because I can't seem to find an armband that is compatible.  But other than that, this player has lived up to my expectations.  Definitely consider this player when doing your research on purchasing a quality MP3 player.

When i saw the sandisk e250, that was it. i didn't need to look any longer. its got a cooler looking display, organized your data better and doesn't cost a million bucks that you'll have to pay a year later to replace.  all in all... i'd say its pretty G.

<Title>Not a disposable electronic device
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This puppy is one of the few portable electronic devices I've ever bout which I'm happy with even after a month from purchase. It does have idiosyncrasies though.  But I'm happy I made the right decision in not buying an ipod. Apple has a history of sticking to their own software packages (remember MAC-OS) in order to gain maximum profit from their customers by making sure they're stuck with them.  Microsoft's "PlaysforSure" format is going to prevail, because it has been standardized and there are a large number of online stores (even Walmart) selling music in that format already. These companies are going to be in competition with each other, which will keep their prices down. Not only that, there are many brands to choose compatible players from. People buying ipods and downloading music from itunes are officially enslaving themselves to Apple. Say their ipod gets lost or something. They'll have to get another ipod in order to listen to the backup of the music they've bought. But if I loose my Sansa I can chose from a wide range of brands for my new player, while still being able to listen to my music backups. Once Apple notices that they have a sufficiently large set of "loyal" customers, they'll start to crank up the prices on their players and music (already Itunes=.99c, while Walmart=.88c).   In the end Apple will include "PlaysforSure" on their Ipods, and will come up with a catchy commercial saying "up until now Playsforsure could only be played on dull little mp3 players, now they can be played on Ipods, IMAGIN THE POSSIBILITIES".  In addition ipods have the famous battery problem too. I don't like the idea of buying a disposable electronic device. Sansa-e200 has four screws I can open easily.

<Title>Buggy, but has potential
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off as one of the other reviewers noted this unit does tend to lock up.  I've noticed it doing this mainly when its power is getting low or when I gave the menu button a less than firm press when turning the unit on.  When this happens the scroll wheel will stay lit with blue LEDs and you either wait for it to compleatly drain the battery or remove the battery to reset it.  To get into the unit you will need a "00" size phillips screwdriver which is a size smaller than many commonly available percision sets sell, so be sure to check for that size.  You WILL need it if you keep this unit.  I decided to leave the screws out and let a snug action jacket hold the battery compartment in place, thereby allowing me to pop it open whenever with fussing with screws. The audio and video quality of this unit are good. The battery will last for the lion's share of a day if fully charged. The fast forward is slow which is bad for people who listen to podcasts or audio books.  If you turn the unit off without pausing a presentation it will not return to that point when it is turned back on. It will not play the video format, or allow the conversion of, a couple of popular vidcasts I enjoy. There is no function to delete audio I'm through with without syncing it to my computer. Audio tracks sometimes disappear or have a "ghost" presence on the menu even though no data is present. File management in general is messy. The difficulties with this player will hopefully improve with time, but like so many Mp3 players it leaves a lot to be desired. Update: the left audio channel on this thing went out after about 9 months of use, fortunally I got the extended warrenty at Best Buy so they replaced it.  I use the hell out of these things, sad to say it's not the first to meet an early doom.

<Title>A Solid Feel, A Good MP3 Player With Minor Problems
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a nice little MP3 player which has a solid feel to it. It has a lot of neat features but it also has a few "issues". The main problem is that it does not always "sync-up" with a computer quickly when you are tryng to load files. Several times, I've had to play with the USB cable connection to get the E250 to be recognized by the computer. But once you have made connection, you are golden! From there it is easy to drag and drop MP3 music into the Music folder on the Sansa player.  Loading photos and video clips is a little more complicated. You have to use the special Sansa converter software which Sansa provides, to change the various video files into a .mov format. It is an extra step but it has worked well for me. Photos are the same way.  The tiny 1.8 inch screen is viewable but it is indeed small. It takes a bit of playing with to get the picture to display properly.  One of the other "issues" I ran into is that some of the folders seem to   disappear when loading files onto the player. But with a couple of clicks of the browser, by going to TOOLS, to OPTIONS, to VIEW, you'll find a place to click on Hidden Files. The folders will return.   The final thing I ran into was using an external micro SD card to expand the memory. I found out that the Sansa e250 sees the music and photos that you have placed on the SD memory but not video clips. So the final solution was to put all the video stuff on the internal 2gb RAM and put the music on the external SD chip.  With all these quirks, the Sansa e250 is still a nice little MP3 player. I like the FM Radio and recorder and it works well. So with the falling prices, this is still a nice choice.

<Title>My First MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this MP3 player thinking I was going to get just an MP3 player but I got so much more. It has a built in voice recorder which comes in handy in college during important lectures and moments I feel smart and need to say some thing and don't have enough time to write it down. This MP3 player also carries your photos and movies. It came with this compact disk you put in your computer, which makes it easy to up load movies into your player and T.V shows too; which is cool because I got to watch Gridiron Gang and smallville on it lol. It really comes in handy in situations were you're board too ha, ha. The great thing is I got it for $59.99; I dropped it tons of times and it still works. I also bought the clear case for it, it makes it a whole lot better and safer too. the MP3 player it self plus with the clear case is way lighter than an ipod. It also comes with a usb drive to connect and charge to your Personal computer :) pluse theres a wall charger sold for it too; just search it and your bound to find it :) I hope this helps some body :)

<Title>This is garbage--DON'T BUY IT
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this mp3 player for our 10 year old daughter for Christmas. Let me preface this by saying that I manage high level computer programming projects for a living--I'm VERY comfortable with technology. The Sansa requires that you either update the library using Windows Media Player or as a USB external hard drive. It took me three days to make the WMP interface work, and when it did, it was complicated and annoying. So then I just used the USB drive option, and while that worked, it's not something that an "ordinary" computer user would be comfortable with. I loaded it up with music for her, and for the first couple of weeks, it worked just fine. But then one day, she came and told me that she couldn't play one of the songs that she'd been able to play before, and then the next day, that none of the songs would play. I plugged it into the computer, and all of the files on the player were corrupted. Furthermore, there was no standard way to clean or reformat the disk. To make matters worse, SanDisk doesn't provide a copy of the OS that you can download, or on the CD that's included in the package. It's 30 days past purchase, and now all I have is a useless, dead mp3 player. I should've gotten the I pod. Incidentally, if you're buying this for a child or teenager, I recommend the Apple product not only because it's more reliable, but because you don't have to be a computer geek to use it. I have an I pod for myself and my wife, and all you have to do is plug it in and it works--my daughter can manage her own music without my help. That's a plus, and in my opinion, worth the extra money. But please, don't waste your money on this product. It's worthless. And the support from the manufacturer is even worse.

<Title>Designed to Anger Audiobook/Podcast Listeners
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you use your MP3 player for music only, my one star review is very harsh. For the money, it is a decent player if you never listen to anything over five minutes long. However, if you listen to audiobooks or podcasts, do not buy this player. I have used about a dozen different players over the past few years and I have never ever seen one so ill suited for playing lengthy files. There is no bookmarking feature and the fast forward is so slow that it is completely useless. You cannot start and the end of a track and rewind back to your spot either. Worse yet, it seems like the designers almost were determined to make it impossible for someone to maintain their spot on a long track. The record button has a hair trigger and is very difficult not to accidentally touch, and you had better manage to listen to that audiobook on one batter charge, because recharging will also cause you to loose your spot.
