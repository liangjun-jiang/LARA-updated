<Title>Useless and Creative's Customer Service Department stinks
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If this is your first venture into MP3 players like it was mine DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this device. First of all, there is no legally downloadable music to play on this thing. Nothing is compatible. But, go to their website and click on the "Fill Your Zen" link from the Zen Stone Plus 2GB webpage and it gives you all kinds of links to compatible services. Go to the service, sign up for it, and Guess What? It's not compatible. But wait!!?? They advertised that it was? Now try to get help from customer service. They talk in circles, oh yea, by e-mail only... and then to top it off you have to wait at least 24 hours between e-mails to get answers that get you nowhere. In the last e-mail I got customer service finally told me..   "[We] Apologize for any inconvenience caused from this experience. Please allow me to assist you further in resolving the issue.   Prior sending us an email, our website suggested some solutions for the issues that you are having. Some information that I provide might be repetitive, but I want to get you the solutions that have highest probability of resolving your issue.   I regret to tell you that Zen Stone Plus doesn't support Online Music Subscription Services. Therefore you won't be able to transfer any of the online music that you have subscribe whether it is itunes or Yahoo!Unlimited."   Well now, there's some help. All that stuff that they linked me to on their website, its not compatible. And I'm not comfortable downloading pirated music. So now what? I've got a device that does not do what the website said it would do. I call that false advertising and, Oh Yes...hmmm, its a piece of junk.

<Content>I was looking for a good device to download audio books from the library, This works very well and resumes play where you leave off. It was fairly easy to use and also holds a lot of music.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use my Zen Stone Plus while I work out and even when I don't.  I bought hot pink in order to deter my kids from "borrowing" it.  That didn't work.  But so far it is standing up to them and me.  I like the price, too.  I really like it and would buy another one.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>Pink???
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought for the girlfriend... paid almost twice the cost just to get a Pink one.  She loves it.  Works great!  I have a black version myself... which after about 3 days... started to hear a rattling from inside the case....  Which does not effect the quality of the product....  I just find it odd.  Overall, great buy IMO.

<Title>Tiny, sounds great; you'll need to buy some acce$$ories
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this shockingly-colored MP3 player as a gift for my wife, along with the armband holder.  She uses it while working and at the gym.  As far as accessories are concerned, it came with a USB cord and earbuds, period.  The player is extraordinarily small and light.  The body is made of shiny plastic that scratches easily, so you'll want to get some protection for it.  The 2GB capacity is enough to hold roughly 40 full albums encoded at 128kbps.  Not having listened to many other brands of MP3 players, I have no basis for comparison as to the sound quality of this unit.  I personally find the sound quality to be very good, limited perhaps by the type of headphones that you choose.  As with most other Creative MP3 players, it requires no special software to hook up to your computer.  Just plug it in using the included USB cable, and you can start copying files and folders almost instantly.  File transfer times are neither remarkably fast nor overly slow.  The most efficient way of filling the player is to collect all the files and folders you want to copy, drag the whole mess to the player via Windows Explorer, and go get yourself something to eat while it labors away.  Creative claims that you can charge the player via your USB port, but this doesn't seem to work properly.  After we opened the box, I charged the player up for close to 8 hours, and it only had enough juice to last for approximately 1 hour, even though it claimed it was done charging.  In the end, we had to purchase an AC charger (got an opened-box iPod charger, which works fine) to fully charge the battery.  Even with a full charge, you won't get anywhere close to Creative's claims of 8 hours' listening time - more like 5 hours, tops.  It's obvious that Creative's business model requires customers to purchase pretty much everything separately - from the case you'll need to keep your delicate player from getting scratched up, to the AC charger needed to actually charge the battery.  Be sure to factor that into the price, if you want to get the most out of your player.

<Title>Not the best
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I oredered this mp3 player to replace my old Sandisk player. I use it daily while I'm cleaning the house or walking around at the grocery store. And with 2 small kids in the house, I needed something durable.  I was immediately shocked when I opened the box to see just how small it is. The player is about the size of a Zippo lighter, measuring approx. 2" x 1". Very very lightweight and the small screen is exceptionally bright, which makes it easy to read. The player has a shuffle option which was a major bonus with me, but it could only hold 78 songs maximum at a time.  I took it out of the box, hooked it up and followed the directions that were very easy to follow for setting it up. Then I left it to charge for 3 hours before downloading my songs onto it. The download went very slow compared to my other mp3 players, taking about 40 minutes to get the 78 songs on it.  After haveing charged it for 3 hours or so, the battery only lasted me about 7 hours, which it said it would go for approx. 10 hours making it  a dissapointment for me. So I went and ordered the adapter to charge it via the outlet versus the computer, at the tune of $35.00.  The sound quality is excellant and so far the little thing has been very durable, as I have accidentally dropped it twice, and even lent it to my 4 year old for a car ride.  The buttons aren't as sensative as I would've liked. I really need to push 'em to get the song to change, and with every song change you need to push the button twice.  I wouldn't recommend this player to anyone.

<Title>If you just want a super tiny music player and hate Itunes, this is for you
<Date>Sat Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using a 256MB Creative Muvo player for a couple years, and just recently replaced it with this one. I really love this player. It holds enough music so that I will never get sick of any of it. I still have 500MB free space after putting everything I want on it. This is a great looking player, and very small. The light up screen is handy in the dark, and the menu is much simpler and easier to navigate than the one on my Creative Muvo player. The free software that you can download from Creative's website for this player is excellent. The microphone in the player also works surprisingly well for such a small input.  One warning though about charging the player: The player charges well through a USB port, but if it's not charging well for you go to: Settings - My Shortcut - then select Date & Time.  I highly recommend this player for anyone who hates itunes and believes in file sharing.

I bought it to download audio books from my library (iPods, of which I have two, don't work with the library's ebook system). I bought the key chain to go with it, so whenever I'm bored (waiting in line, etc.) I just pull it out and listen to my book. Battery seems to go dead in about 4 hours.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB - Decent Value and Performance
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB doubles the size of the iPod Shuffle and adds a monochrome screen for viewing track names and settings.  Add in the functionality of a built-in FM tuner and voice recorder at $65 and you have a great value.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner with 32 presets ( though it's just average )  + voice recording   + simple design (no more click wheel!) with more color options + great navigation and sorting features  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WAV, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - average battery life of 10 hours (OLED screen sucks the battery) - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled )  - some DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable - few size options 1GB and 2GB - Creative software is buggy - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  Unfortunately, the 1GB Zen Stone had some quality issues.  With the new 2GB Zen Stone Plus, Creative has tried to improve on previous models and compete with the Sandisk Sansas.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express and doesn't have all the cool cache' of an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively and has some NICE features.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone Plus is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations. Unlike the shuffle, you can actually see your track names! The OLED screen is perfect for a player this size but does suck more power and shorten the battery life.   The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, up, down, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack, microphone hole, and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This is less versatile than the old battery operated unit, but more convenient.  What about sound? The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds. Most people replace their standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.   The Zen Stone doesn't have larger storage options. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6012127-4290026">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording. The built-in microphone is nice for short reminders.   The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Couldn't Get the Battery Charged
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this with great excitement, foolishly thinking that a Creative product would be good. If only I had done some more research. I could never get it to work, because I could never get the battery to take a charge. The Creative web site recommended I send it back for repair. I sent it back for a refund. If you can't even get it to work new, out of the box, why should I bother to get a replacement??!!And to find that solution so easily on the web site means it happens a lot. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>She likes it.  Me, not so much.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Santa brought this little MP3 player to my 10 year old daughter.  I thought she was going to be disappointed because she specifically requested an IPOD.  However, she is VERY pleased beacause it also has a FM radio and a voice recorder.  I am surprised how much she listens to the radio.  The downside is that Itunes is NOT compatible with the Zen.  Yes, of course there is a website where we can download songs for the Zen, but since we already have an existing Itunes account I was hoping that it would work.  Had I known prior to purchasing a Zen that I would have to "buy" all new songs, I probably would not have purchased it.

<Title>Stay away
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ordered three of these (in green) and NONE of them worked. They performed when plugged into the computer, but failed to hold a charge once disconnected from the PC. This was after the tech-support recommended "all night" charging.  By way of background, I'm fairly computer savvy, have a new PC based system, and spent hours on the phone with Creative tech support trying to fix the problems. Ultimately, I had to return the units.  Stay away.
