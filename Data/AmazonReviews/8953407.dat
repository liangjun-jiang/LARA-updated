<Content>I purchased this devcie and have had nothing but problems with it.  The moment I got it out of the box it started resetting.  I thought ok maybe it needs an upgrade.  Looked on RCA.com to see if there is a firmware upgrade.  Did it....loaded music and same thing.  Well trying to get a hold of the RCA to do a warrenty exchange is impossible, well I am getting a refirb one now, lets see how this works.  Good luck all....needless to say I a shopping for another devcie, that just left a bad taste in my mouth.

<Content>I am a college student and this gadget is perfect for tranfering files as well as storing all of my homework.  Better yet is the capability of storing my music and use it as an MP3 player.  It hangs weightlessly from my neck and the sound is GREAT.  Not bad for the price.

<Content>I had just bought a JVC KD-G720 for my Jeep Liberty and was looking for a small flash memory device when I came across the M100. I wasn't sure what to expect at first, and I couldn't find any reviews for this item anywhere. It was a good price for what it had to offer, so I gave it a shot. So far I have had zero complaints with the device. It's tiny and lightweight, yet it isn't awkward to hold or work. It has a retractible USB connection that I plug directly into my stereo head unit when I am driving and works flawlessly. Then, once I'm out of the car, I can plug earbuds directly into the device and use it as am MP3 player. It has good EQ presets, better than I expected, and organizes everything in folders the way they are arranged at transfer. The only thing I would want to see in this specific model would be a backlit LCD screen, since it is a bit difficult to see in low lighting. I am not sure of the audio quality of the earbuds either, since I use my iPod earbuds for everything. This device is worth the $45 I payed at the time, however I am not sure about paying $100 for it. You can get it through RCA for $58. Overall a great buy!

<Title>A great, basic player

<Content>I got this player at an incredible price, so I'm not sure I'd pay the listed price here.  I would say it is worth spending around $30-$40 max for it.  It is not as slick as the new screens and displays, but if you just need a little something to grab and go, you got it.  The sound quality is great, just as good as my sister's $150 mp3 player.  Transferring is easy and fast, charging is comparable to all others.  Display gives you more than you think.  Benefits:  can also use as a jump drive. very small (pack of gum); Drawbacks: supports only mp3, wma and wav files. no fancy readout.  Overall, a nice basic unit.
