<Title>fantastic iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just purchased my new nano from the apple store today and this new model is absolutely amazing! The size is soooooooo small and light, absolutely amazing! The screen is crystal clear with such high resolution.  The only complaint I have is there is just a tiny bit of "lag" as you scroll around and access the menu's and your music. Especially when browsing your music with "cover flow". Its a very minor issue and it's present in all the models I played with at the store.  This is definitely the best nano revision to date!

<Title>First iPod and I'm in love
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm new to the world of Apple and am so happy this is my first experience with the company.  I was amazed at the high quality of video of the new iPod Nano.  It's so clear and sharp.  The only problem I had with it so far was that it froze once in the two days I had it.  I held down the Menu and Center button down together for about 8 seconds or so and the iPod reset itself.  After that, it continued to play well.  Will see how it operates in a few weeks from now.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i just got my new nano a few days ago and i don't have any complaints except for the cover flow. i'm gonna need to spend a bit of time to get that organized so every single song is under an album cover, but it's not that important, it's more for show. also, the back is the polished stainless steel, so i put clear packaging tape on it (as a cheap cover) to prevent scratches since i just throw it in my backpack. i can't find any cases that i like, but it's only been out since September 5 this will have to do until i can get a hold of a clear plastic case. i love the large screen so i won't have to squint at the screen now (unlike what i had to do with the 1st and 2nd gen of nano)  i had a sansa before for a couple of months, but i got sick of that! i guess being stuck with my ipod mini for a couple of years got me so used to it. i gave the sansa to my boyfriend and just bought the new nano! i fell in love with it right when i saw it at the apple store and just bought it right there on the spot! it really is a great upgrade if you haven't gotten the 1st or 2nd generation nano.  if you're looking for an upgrade from previous (small) ipods, then this is  it! or you can save 100 bucks more for the iTouch or 50 bucks for the regular ipod.  wow people! stop complaining about the ipod nano not having a lot of storage space! it's a NANO! not a REGULAR ipod! it's a modified version of the big ipod! get it? and plus you should know the features on the product before you buy it. i don't have a 10,000 song library and movies and videos to store on a device, but if you do then get the regular ipod. so the nano is perfect for someone who just wants some on the run music.  i was a little surprised that they changed some of the colors from the neon colors to the more "calm" colors. but if all else fails, just get the black one. i got the red one to donate 10 bucks to fight aids in africa.

<Title>Awesome Nano with added Video!
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the blue Nano 8 GB 3rd generation Ipod this past Saturday at the Apple Store.  It did freeze up on me once but if you read the owners manual on [...], it tells you how to reset it.  I did as they instructed and it was working normally again.  It kept everything in memory and did not erase anything.  The video function is awesome!  You quickly forget you're watching on a 2 inch screen as the screen is so sharp, bright and clear.  Cover flow is so cool, although a bit slow but nevertheless it is a nice added feature.  Some album covers do not load in Itunes so will not download to your player properly.  This might be a glitch that Apple may address in a future software download patch (I hope).  If you are looking to purchase a Nano, I highly recommend the new third generation over the second, simply because of the added video feature and twice the memory for your money.  It is definitely worth it for the added memory alone.  Overall, more bang for your buck and a nice new cool look and interface, with an all metal construction.

<Title>I did shy away from Apple, now I came back...
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I previously owned a gen 5 iPod with 60 gig...I love it until the headphone jack went out, so I tried to fix it myself since I had it for good two years and didn't want to send it to Apple for half of what I had to pay for in the first place.  So I gave up iPod cold turkey, even when they came out with the 80 gig and 160 gig iPod, I never looked back...I also looked at other music players, they didn't feel the same...until I saw the new iPod Nano...so I ordered one as soon as possible, and yes I do have one already (ordered it straight from Apple).  It's more compact, I love the click wheel, great for people on the move, 8 gig is enough for people like me, new user interface, and the best thing about the new Nano is the video capabilities...for me it's no big deal, it's not my primary source for video playback, but it's just cool to have that feature...

<Title>Nano's keep getting better
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Nano is a nice improvement from the previous generation. The screen is big and bright, the battery life is excellent, and the music sounds good.  The video feature is nice to have, though 8 gigs and the small screen are not conducive to watching feature length movies or even TV shows. I use this feature to keep a few 1-2 minute videos of family and friends to watch now and then on the train to/from work. Plus, the new size makes it fit easily in the credit card slot of my wallet.  Also, this nano syncs nicely with Microsoft Outlook so I can quickly look up a phone number.  I give it four stars instead of five because of what I consider a design flaw--the headphone jack is on the bottom. This means that using the Nano at the gym on any of the aerobic machines requires either placing it on its side or upside down.

<Title>Too Cool Fool
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just picked mine up from CC bought it online and picked it up in the store. They didnt even have these out on the floor yet. This thing is great. Its syncs nicely and the screen is crisp and clear. I have a few tv epiosdes on here and about 300-400 songs and 100 or so pictures and about 7 movie previews from apple which is too cool. I still have 6.8 gigs of free space. The size is incredible its so small. The coverflow thing is cool even though it couldnt find some of the album covers from albums I ripped but thats a small price to pay as far as I am concerned. For the money its great and I dont need 80 gigs so this will work just fine for me.

<Title>3rd Generation Nano Freezes often (similar to the 2nd generation)
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own a video iPod, and have owned previous generation iPods, all of which I have found to be excellent products. I just recently purchased my first Nano (the new 3rd generation) and love the looks, size, functions etc.- a potential excellent product. However, I noticed that my new Nano often completely freezes up; always after syncing; sometimes while charging; and sometimes while just changing songs, going to the menu, etc. The only way I found to unfreeze the player is to do a hard reset. This is quite an inconvenience and totally unacceptable. I thought maybe I had bought a lemon and would simply return the product for a working replacement. However, after some research, I have learned that this was and is a common problem with the 2nd generation Nano. I haven't found much information regarding this issue from others who purchased the 3rd generation - most likely because it was just released a week ago. I plan to return the product and wait until the problem has been corrected. Once this is done, I will only have wonderful things to say about the 3rd generation Nano.

<Title>I liked it. 
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It is exactly what I wanted. Priced little bit more, but it is worth the money.   I am already feeling that I bought this at the end of 3Gen era, cuz new iPhones and iPod touch has come up now with huge memory.  Getting a feeling that I should have gone for them with little additional money rather than this nano.   Anyhow, I liked nano 3G. It is compact, light weight, clear sound, bright picture and Videos.  And, I can synchronize my Calendar and Contacts from my Outlook too.  I have subscibed to Podcast, and audio books, I liked to listen to it while I am driving.

<Title>Impressive
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was purchased to play AICC quality music in my home stereo via a DAC and the same quality music in my car. My JVC car deck controls the i-Pod via a convertor. 12 hours, 160+ songs at CD quality sound and it's flash drive, easily reloaded from i-Tunes. My shuffle does fine MP3 with headphones while hiking- I can't complain. Nicely done on both products.

<Title>Alright
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product is good. It acted weird after the first week I had it. The images were all scratchy and then it wouldn't play my music for some reason. Anyway, I turned it back on after a couple of days and it just went back to normal. I don't know what happened, but it hasn't given me problems since then (about 3 weeks later). Then again, I had bought a used one...maybe spending an extra $20 or so to get a new one would be worth it!?

<Content>Not much to say really about this item except that it was confusing adding songs and stuff to it.  I still dont understand  how to add some songs onto it and I have no clue how to add videos.  If this item would come with a manual, I think it would be much better.

<Title>My daughter loves it
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was an upgrade for my daughter from her Zen Nano Plus.  The Zen Nano worked very well and has been very durable so I'm not knocking it (actually, I'm inheriting it).  However, this IPOD appears to have many features that allow greater flexibility and control.  It has been much easier to download music to as well.  I hope it will prove to be durable as well.
