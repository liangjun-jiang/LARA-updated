<Content>Product was what I expected after researching online- small screen, small buttons, small (but very cute!). Bought for a 10 yr old girl for Christmas. She likes it and can manipulate the buttons (which are indeed small enough that people with large fingers could have trouble). Headset is good and clips to mobi. The best thing about it is how cute it is, she has photos, video and music on it (sound quality was better than I expected). She'll likely grow out of it and into pod-land over the next few years - but for now its great!
