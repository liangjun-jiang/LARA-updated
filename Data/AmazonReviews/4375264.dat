<Title>A great first MP3 player!  Cool features and a great price too!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sandisk's MP3 players have really come into their own.  Not only are they packed with features, but the price is reasonable.  Sandisk has come a long way from their original Digital Audio Player.  This model has tons of things going for it. - great sound, nothing not to like there - light-weight  - FM tuner - voice recording - ergonomic design - great navigation and sorting features  - Microsoft PlaysForSure compatible (for those who are into that) - USB 2.0 connectivity - replaceable battery!!!  The cons are minor in my opinion - limited shuffle features - built-in microphone could have been improved - mediocre backlight - slower transfer speed on older computers  For those needing more space, the Sansa M240 and M250 offer more space in the same form factor.  This unit is not ideal for those who primarily want to use it for recording.  Sony's various models are all superior in that regard.  One thing I have to wonder is why Sandisk didn't include an SD slot in this bad boy.  I've already seen a few similar players with them.  I took a test drive and I liked it so much, I bought it as a holiday gift for a friend.  I would definitely recommend it.  I wanted to keep it myself, but I'm gonna get my own instead.  :)  Enjoy!

<Title>Nice sound, Nice features, Nice price
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wouldn't say that this is a top of the line audio player, but with better headphones you can get a great sound.  For a little more, I suggest you get the M240 or M250, which have the same features, but with 1GB and 2GB of storage, respectively.  Why to buy this unit:  -Rock bottom price -Decent sound with your own headphones -Nice interface -Works with various music subscription services (somtimes requires firmware upgrade--see sandisk.com) -Has "Plays for Sure" software embedded. -Can be used to store any type of file (mass storage mode) -Can shuffle play -Comes with an arm band and player sleve for walks, workouts, etc. -Lightweight -Plays for 11 Hours on 1 AAA battery  Why not to buy this unit: -You want to use it with I-Tunes (not possible) -You want a unit with rechargable battery (buy rechargable AAAs, only option) -You want a unit with swappable media (SD or flash) -You want a unit that comes with good earbuds or headphones -You want a unit that has 1GB or more (see the M240 and M250 or a variety of other players) -USB modes can be confusing, causing unit to suddenly not register as a compatible music device with windows (easily fixed by changing modes back to music playback instead of mass storage) -controlls sometimes require futzing with to get what you want.  I recommend this player for a first-time player and for those who need a cheap player with good sound.

<Title>A nice mp3 player for the money
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is really the first mp3 player I have owned.  I initially looked at the IPOD's but was turned away from the price and also the fact that I had to purchase the songs from Itunes.  This player is simple to use, sounds really good, is very small and lightweight, and is a good deal for the money.  If you want to store 1000 songs, or watch videos, then this is not the player for you.  If you want something that's easy to afford, and can store around 200 songs, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this one.  I rated only 4 stars, as you may want to consider the 1G player as it would hold somewhere around 400 songs.

<Content>Husband received this as a christmas gift.  It didn't work with his (older) W98 PC, but works great with my XP laptop.  I got it loaded and working in about 5 minutes.  Not slow as some have reported.  Could use a little more memory, but at this price I can get another and have my genres separated.  I was holding out for an iPod, but this little baby kicks! Better fitting earbuds would be my personal choice, but that's no big deal.

<Title>Good First MP3
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very good first MP3 Player. I don't listen to a very wide range of music, so 512 MB is plenty for me. The one problem with it was, we tried to use it with iTunes, but it wouldn't download to it. So we had to burn a CD then take it from the CD to the MP3. Overall, it is a very good product and its not very complicated to use.

<Title>SanDisk Error
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product that SanDisk markets is not compatible with Mac computers. The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk. When asked how to resolve the problem is to return it or sell it to someone else. SanDisk is not accountable for the error and dismisses the customer to resolve their error. I give this product a ZERO because of the lack of integrity by the company.

<Title>A good Mp3 player, but.........
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its a good Mp3 player, and once it get even slightly smacked, its a dead Mp3 player, I got one of these "the square model, I forget the name" and that broke by being in my pocket when I fell, and I used my warrenty, and they gave me this, I had it for 2 days, and I dropped it by accident, and it was busted, so dont buy this if you think you might drop it, it is a good Mp3 player, but its too fragile.

<Title>I really found what I want!!
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like this player very much.  First, it is very easy for using. I believe for any electronics, easy using is the first for user. Every step is so simple. You will never feel pain to find out how to use it.  Second, transfer songs is just copy and paste. That's it! Before I bought this player, I have a Sumsung 20G player. But transfer songs is so difficult. Many songs can't be transfered for no reason. But for this player, what you need to do is drag the songs and put it into player. Just like using a usb drive. Then, enjoy~~~~  Third, it can be used as a usb drive. I really need this function. I don't need to pay money for another 512M usb drive.  The last and very important thing is the sound is so great~~~~  The only pity for me is it can't be extended by SD card. If this works, I think that will be perfect for me.  But I like it!

<Content>WMP will sync only the songs if you sync MANUALLY, but if you use WMP's AUTOMATIC syncing, then the playlists themselves (as well as the songs) get put onto the device (note that WMP still doesn't SHOW that the playlists are on the device, but they are definitely there and can be used).

<Title>Especially for first timers, this is your player
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've never had a personal MP3 before, so I found this one at erwincomputers, via Amazon for just under $24, including shipping.  Its a good intro to the world of MP3 and WMA, loaded onto, basically a flash drive with a player.  This player in particular is easy to operate in both transferring Windows Media files and replaying them.  Also, it's durable and nearly foolproof in that it just continues to play faithfully when the controls are locked.  It comes with a clear vinyl cover w/beltloop, but I just lock the controls and drop it upside-down into my shirt or jacket pocket.  I doesn't interfere with most activities.  Even if I ever decided to upgrade, I can't see any reason not to have one or two of these on hand. Oh yes, and the sound was much more dynamic than I had guessed.  You can hear all parts of the music in proper proportion and the little (cheapo) ear buds you get with the player are actually pretty good.

<Title>I like this new toy
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ordered my Sansa m230 Sunday, was in the mailbox on Wednesday, and I was working out at the gym with my new toy by Thursday.  I didn't know an MP3 player could be this affordable, so I looked like a dork at the gym with my DiscMan up until this week.  (Okay, I'm an over-40 woman--I'm not into gadgets.)  I took this player out of the mail box, and had all my favorite songs downloaded to it (with my custom playlists) 2 hours later!  This is probably the best thing I have ever bought for less than $25.  I highly recommend it.  Go ahead and order the silicone case w/clip if you get this player.  The earbuds that came w/it are the best I've ever worn; somehow they stay in place very well for me.  Plenty enough volume to drown out the cell phone yakkers on the treadmill next to ya!  The only negative comment I have is that the tiny quickstart manual teaches you nothing about how to scroll thru the menu on the player or the menu's different features.  It took me longer to figure all that out than how to burn my music onto the thing.

<Content>I purchased this product mainly for the radio tuner to use at the gym.  They have tvs that use the radio stations, in order to listen to them.  The signal is great in the gym, don't have any problems there.  It does drain the battery a little fast but I use rechargeable batteries.  It has enough space to save several songs to listen to while working out.

<Content>Honestly, you get what you pay for. From the minute I got this thing in the mail, I loaded it up with music, put new batteries in and was ready to go. Unfortunatly, the device was not. I had to keep playing with the battery to get it to turn on. When it did finally turn on, I listened for a bit and put it on pause.....when I did that, it shut off and once again, I was playing with the battery to get it to work. I've tried Energizer Lithium batteries and Duracell thinking maybe it was the battery but sad to say, it wasn't. Like I said, you get what you pay for...what do you expect for 20 bucks? lol. When it wants to work, it is great....but those with little or no patience are urged to stay away from this device.

<Title>Great value, SanDisk stands behind warranty
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this unit on "Black Friday" (day after Thanksgiving) at Best Buy - couldn't beat the $40 "early-bird special".  After about two weeks, after trying to load it up with some more songs, the unit got stuck on the "finalizing update" screen when I disconnected it from the computer.  I e-mailed SanDisk about it and they responded quickly with a few things to try.  Those things failed, so I called them the next day, and they had me do a few more things, which also failed, so they issued me a RMA number to send it back to them.  A few weeks later, a brand new unit was shipped to me, and I have had no problems with the new unit.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who's looking for a relatively simple device that will support WMA files from services like Napster (my personal favorite), MusicMatch, or FYE; iPods will not work with WMA files.  The FM tuner is also a plus.  However, my only problem with this unit is that the USB cable that they give you with it is very short - less than a foot - which tends to make it a bit of a hassle to connect it to the computer - since it practically has to lay on the floor while you're adding or removing songs from it, if your computer doesn't have any USB connectors on the front of it, you'll need to either "rubberneck" to the back of your system or get a longer cable.

<Content>I bought this on black friday for only $40 and it's the best mp3 player for $40 dollars. It doesn;t have a huge memory but it's good for young costomers. it's vert easy to use and is a bit bulky but fits nicely in your pocket and in your pocket. I suggest have some back-up headphones because first-of-all thier the most cheeeeeeesiest headphones i've ever seen and they might get screwed,lke mine.It's has very easy to use controls and frowards pretty quickly. I had some problems with it, i didn;t even know what, either the songs wouldn't delete or it just tirned off. I suggest making an account at SanDisk.com/support to help you out. The usb cable is really short but doesn't bother me I use rechargeable batteries but i listen to music every day and used it since black fiday and have only rechaged then 3 times. If your in the market for a new mp3 player, the Sansa m230 is PERFECT!!!!!

<Title>One of the best little players for it's price
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Alright, so mp3 players, yeah there's so many to choose from, it gets really annoyin, especially when all of your trendy friends are telling you to get an ipod. Don't get me wrong, ipods are great, i have one in fact, and i love it. But i rollerblade (not recreational, like the kind where you go to skateparks and grind handrails and various other things). So the the ipod's size makes it more prone to be broken, which is why I love this thing. I'm going to skip all the candy coating and get straight to the tootsie roll filling:  pros: -Most other mp3 players are a little bit thinner, but the sansa has a flat control panel and the back is round to fit in your hand, i know, i know, you're going to put it in your pocket, well just put the interface on the inside of the pocket and none of the buttons have a chance of breaking, or the screen.  -The sansa has an extremely long battery life for one little AAA, around 20 hours, which is awesome since i hate buying batteries, but that's not a problem because i have rechargable AAA, but it's gets extremely aggrivating having to recharge batteries everytime you go out.  - The buttons are perfect, they're big, they're bold, what more do you want, and i noticed most mp3 players put these tiny little pin size buttons on their players, what's the point of that.  -The menu is really straightforward and simple. You just press the menu button on top of the player, and then use the 4 buttons (play/pause, previous track, next track, and stop) as the directional buttons on the menu.  -I used to have the older version of the sandisk mp3 players (256mb) and it was never loud enough, like i would be on the bus or in a busy area and not even be able to hear my music! Thankfully they enabled it to become louder and have a better sound quality.  -It's very inexpensive, i payed 40$ for mine  from a seller on amazon. And that's about how much it goes for retail everywhere else.  Cons:  -The only problem i have is that the earbuds that they come with aren't the best in the world, but i still use them, they're the only earbuds i have ever found that have fit my ears without a 2 billion dollar price tag. Or i would get new ones.  -The fm tuner that comes with this is junk, i get a good signal every once in a while, but it really shouldn't be used as a marketing gimmick, considering most flash mp3 players have one now.  Ok, well thanks for reading my review of the sandisk sansa 512mb. I forgot to mention that it has a decent voice recorder for notes and such, but i always have mine filled to the the rim with music, so i've never really had the oppurtunity to really try it out.

<Title>Exactly what I was looking for
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is exactly what I've been looking for.  I wanted something small and durable so that it would withstand rattling around in my backpack (as I am a college student), and it seems quite sturdy so far.  Also the buttons and interface are very user-friendly.  The volume control is also easy to access and adjust when the player is in my pocket.    The earphones are (in my opinion) very high quality, and I am pleasantly surprised as to the quality of the sound this thing produces.  And here's a plus: when you have the earphones on, other people can't hear them.  This is how it should be, but a lot of times with other MP3 players' ear phones you can still hear peoples' music.  Not so with these; they're intended for the listener only.  And their style and design is also quite sleek-looking.  I am also quite pysched about the built in radio.  I enjoy listening to the radio from time to time, because of the variety of music available.  And in comparison to Apple's I-pod, you have to buy a sort of "add on" radio tuner to be able to listen to the radio with an I-pod, and such an add-on costs around $50 by itself.  For just $13 more, you can buy this MP3 player instead, and still be able to store your own music on it just like any other MP3 player.  I should mention about the radio though, that you only have access to FM stations and not AM stations.  Overall I found that this player has everything I need.  It's really an amazing deal for the amount of features you get, and I am quite pleased with it.  I highly recommend it.

<Title>Best Flash Player for its price
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this last Thanksgiving for only 30 dollars at Best Buy, plus 10 dollars for a 2 year insurance. Awesome deal. It was way more than I could ask for, for only 40 bucks.   The pros imo: - Very light weight. I could barely even notice I had the Sansa in my pocket when I used it at work. Also, the arm band is very handy so you can keep the cord out of the way while doing things. - Buttons very easy to reach. I could push the play buttons through my sweater without even looking at them. - Equalizer options are great since you can cuztomize your own. - FM tuner, is always a plus, but it didn't really work for me because I live sort of far from Boston so I couldn't get the good stations. Well I can't get the good stations even on my house stereo. Only in my car's stereo I can tune in to them. - The case that comes with it is a perfect fit, and it protects the sansa from scratching. - Playlist support if you sync it with WM player. That's such a neat option that lets you create playlists and update them to your player very easily. - Also you can access the sansa with windows explorer, and add music by drag and drop.   The cons: - 512 MB not nearly enough for my needs. This is not really a con, because for the price it's still a bargain. But that was the main reason why I sold it to my friend for $50. I'm planning on getting a hard disk now. - When I bought this player I thought that I could upgrade the memory by adding a sandisk flash card to it. Guess I was wrong, but some other Sandisk players do have that option, even though they're twice as expensive. - Earbuds are kinda crappy. I mean they fit nicely in my ears and also had that little cover, but after about 3 months the left one started dying on me. I had to keep the cord in a certain position so I could hear the sound. I guess I broke the earbud because I kept getting the cord caught on places and I kept pulling on it by accident. The sound quality is great though. - You can't use folders as playlists. You can't use any other player to add playlists to the sansa except for WMP. I used Real Player (not a good player I know) to upload my music, only because it gave me the option to convert my mp3's to wma while adding the music to the sansa. I hate wma files, but I used it so I could fit more music into my player. You get almost twice as much space if you use wma instead of mp3. Later on I found out that the sansa won't recognize Real Player playlists. Then I tried to Create playlists on Windows Media Player then add the songs that were already in the Sansa to the playlists, but you can't add files to a playlist that way with WMP.  So no playlists for me, just regular playback through all my library. I could still play by genre, or by artist, but still wasn't the same. If it wasn't for that I think that this player would have been perfect.

<Content>i love the mp3 player. sure there isnt a folder system but organized by artist is fine (with legit songs) for me. the big thing is not being able to stop the music besides pausing and turning off the mp3 player. is there some way around it like pressing two certain buttons at the same time or smth? lol i would rate it five stars if it was present (minor nusiance for some) ---so easy to use !! :-D   i bought it from j& r music world only because there was a 10$ rebate (69.99-10.00= 59.99) and besides, i wouldn't have to wait for the mp3 player to arrive to my door; the downside of J&r  was the NY sales tax that came up a tad higher than i expected so my purchase came up to 75$ and after rebate it will be 65$ instead of less than amazon (with supersavings and tt long wait with supersavings).   if only sales tax could be abolished!

<Content>We have purchased 2 of these in our family and they work well.  No skipping and easy to download songs. One set of earphones does not work as well now, but our kids use them all the time.

<Title>12 yo son enjoys
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this for my 12 yo son. He has recorded music (sister's band concert song), downloaded songs and listened to the radio. He has had no difficulty manipulating the buttons or using the mp3. The sound quality is fine. The head phones are okay quality. If you are looking for a decent first mp3 this is it.

<Title>Great little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this mp3 player to go running and exercise with. You can fit approx. 3-4 cds on it, which is more than enough for an hour or so at the gym. This little mp3 gives off great sound, takes batteries, and is really light weight. It is easy to see and figit with. The buttons are so accessible that I can even change songs when I am running.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't come with an armband... at least the version I purchased. I had to buy a separate armband that didn't quite fit is and made it difficult to use.  Other than that it is a great product and I recommend it.

<Title>Disappointing...
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this mp3 player as a gift and was very excited. It was small, portable, and had many handy features. The big issue was that it runs on batteries. Well, it DID run on batteries until it broke and wouldn't run anymore. For some reason, the programing on it corrupted. I would not recommend getting this version of the SanDisk Sansa. After talking with a few other people who owned this same player, they also said they had problems with it and ended up buying something else. I would most recommend upgrading to the 1 GB version of the Sandisk Sansa.

<Title>Sweet Price for a Sweet Player
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For 20 bucks this things a bargain. I actually bought it for a show display, but found myself listening to the radio at work and at school. The storage is ample, the size just right, the use easy, and the practicallity unmatched. A value that simply can't be beat.

<Title>Great little peice

<Content>Excellent sound quality. First when i brought it, i did not think it will be so good in performance. Only thing is you may have to buy a battery recharger and rechargable AAA batteries to save on buying AAA batteries all the time. The Player is just doing great for me.

<Title>Great sound and price

<Content>I used to own a 30GB Ipod but it broke after being dropped only a couple of times. This led me to the conclusion that spending high $ on high tech mp3 players is pointless. Why spend hundreds to store tons of music? If you want to store tons of music, get a 500 GB hard drive for your computer. When I'm out and about I only need a few cds worth of songs. And if it breaks, who cares? I only spent $25 including shipping! Plus the Sansa's sound quality is great and the headphones it comes with are really good, almost great, and better than the Sony headphones which I bought for $20. So you get good headphones and a low cost, compact mp3 player for under $30! Take it from an audiophile and music collector, the Sansa is worth much more than the low purchase price.
