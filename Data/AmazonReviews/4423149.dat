<Title>1st MP3 Player & impressed what all the features!
<Date>Fri Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 1st MP3 player and am totally pleased. Read all the Negative reviews first than the positive. To my surprise none of the negative items reported happened to me, yet. First they say battery life stinks well I read that the iRiver comes only 50% charged and it takes 1 hour to charge at 50% & 2 1/2 for full charge. Not bad when you get at least 20 hours of use for full charge.  Only being able to use Windows media player is not bad but there are so many options like rating your songs, artist, playlists, genres & star system. FM radio is great either in the car with FM transmitter or on the fly. The finger print situation is real but I bought a Invisible Shield for $9.99 with a lifetime warranty works great.  The toggle screen is ok but when you start listening to a song and the screen goes black to save battery life you have to press the screen twice once to get it illuminated and the other to go where you want just irritating.  Did not use the earbuds because it is not applicable to my ears but bought Phillips behind the head headphones here on amazon and the sound is great from the iRiver. Did not use the video option yet because I just wanted the MP3 option so maybe later when I expand to video we will see but I see no point. Also the pictures may be a faster option that I want to use and you will need a converter from iRiver website (free) to resize the image to fit on your iRiver screen and with the excellent clarity it will be great. The cradle is nice and sounds better than I thought but when you want to connect to your Home Theater receiver you need to purchase a y adapter cable unless you have a new receiver for USB connection.  If you already have a cable to connect to your Receiver than forget it because it will not fit into the back of the cradle you need the cable that came with the cradle since the housing is smaller.  The iRiver will charge from your laptop computer with no problems my main way of charging.  Also bought the iRiver FM Transmitter and works great if you can find a dead station to broadcast your signal and it has 3 presets.  So far there is no problem at all, great product and well worth the money sometimes there are problems with products and/or ignorance from users but take a chance if you read all the bad and good reviews and if this unit fits your needs!

<Title>good purchase
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was referred this product by my good friend.  Overall, I like this product, the only downfalls are: 1) a little difficult to use and 2) the battery life...  in previously owned mp3 players, I get a beep or a warning whenever the battery is running low.  However with this iriver, it just shuts off completely when battery is down.  the radio function is excellent.

<Title>Do Not Buy iRiver
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the very short period of time it worked, it was great. It began freezing up with software problems, and support is the helplessdesk. These poor people have been contracted by iRiver and abandoned. I really believed, even after many weeks of research, that I was getting a quality product. It is junk. Don't waste your money or your time.

<Content>The click system is fun and easy to use. The player itself is nice and compact, and thin. The sound and movie quality are top notch. The packaging itself shows the effort that went into the product. It looks great and oozes a lot of wows from others. Overall great product.

<Title>Very nice, a bit small and died after a year
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Got the 2GB Clix ($135) in Dec 2006 for my 14-year-old teen.  The screen is very small and it is very easy to use. It is a nice MP3 and Video (avi) player and very cool with lots of features like Flash games, nice FM radio, Alarm clock etc. A few days after the 1-year warranty passed, it suddenly stopped showing up as a Flash drive when connected to a PC. The support person said he works for a third party service and that this problem is common... If this had happened a few days ago, I would have been able to send it for repair. Unfortunately, while trying to troubleshoot the problem, I formatted the device so all we can do with it now is listen to radio...

<Title>good one, but not excellent
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am satisfied with it. Many features are very good. The sound quality is as good as ipod and others. The FM radio can receive signal in many place, quality is also good. The picture quality is wonderful, better than I expected. Some review said about the charging problem, saying it can only be charged through the computer. I bought chargers so don't have that problem.  There are several things I am not happy with. First, it is not very easy to learn how to transmit resources from computer, especially in vista. I still can not find the way to put in video and songs which are not mp3 files. Second, after charged, it can not find back where I was listening.

<Title>Charging the Clix battery "requires" XP SP1
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Nice product, but beware. No mention is ever made that the Clix will *NOT* charge the battery without XP SP1 or SP2 running. USB power bricks and computers running any other OS will *NOT* charge the battery. I've tested the power output with an electrical meter on several computer USB ports and this issue is not related to the power output of the port. The product will "connect" but it will not charge.

<Title>Great -- for the short time it worked
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really enjoyed this player--for a week. Great battery life, very simple to use, beautiful screen, intuitive interface. Sound quality is absolutely first rate.  BUT: A few cons. After a week, it just froze up, refused to power up, and couldn't even be re-set. It just died. Also, Windows Media Player, which you must use to get the most out of this device, is in beta, and so is full of bugs. You can use the Clix with version 10, but you miss out on many features. Lastly, the included earbuds are very mediocre.  I plan to return the Clix to Best Buy and get a replacement. If the new one dies too, I'll post a follow up review.

<Title>Die ipod, die!
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been waiting a while now for a better nano alternative, (the U10 didn't have enough flash memory to convince me) and now thank god for the Clix!  This is an absolute must have for anyone in the market for a new handheld media player, because this little sucker has it all.  Prior to this all I had was my cellphone to use as a portable mp3 player.  My first impressions on the layout and overall look of the Clix (and U10) are that it is a welcome change in a world of Sansa-esque iPod copycats.  Good riddance to that stupid clickwheel!  The screen is vibrant and colorful, the video playback on it is exceptional considering the size of the screen.  So far I've only watched the included clips, but they both looked surprisingly good.  But in general the images are very clear and the text is easy to read.  Audio playback was my primary desire in purchasing the Clix and it certainly delivers in that respect!  The included earbuds are atteast as good as the ones you get with an iPod, but any audiophiles will probably throw them away and buy some that cost as much as the Clix itself.  The music interface is easy to navigate and the sound quality is superb. It has included EQ's which you can change in real-time and pick the one you want.  It also has a customizable feature and SRS WOW effects ala Windows Media Player.  The dedicated volume control is on the side of the player and this thing can get loud.  FM radio!  Wow, and it's even crystal clear.  I'm listening to it as I type actually, here in my bedroom.  I haven't tried it outside yet, but the walls must be filled with lead or concrete because I can't get any cellphone reception but the radio is coming through nicely.  You can also record from the radio, save presets or adjust the tuner region if you leave the country.  The Clix interface is so sweet!  There is a button under the faceplate on each edge of the screen and the arrows on the screen make navigation easy.  The lock mechanism to disable the buttons is very cool too, it physically disables the buttons so they won't click at all, instead of just being an electronic switch like I had been expecting.  The screen does get smudged pretty easily and getting a clear screen protector is a really good idea.  There aren't a host of options for cases and accessories like for a nano, but the U10 gadgets will fit the Clix since they are basically identical.  The protective sleeve included with the unit is a nice touch however.  Even when the Clix is in there it will still fit easily in a pocket and not get scratched.  I don't have the docking station, but it seems pretty neat.  The flash games are cool too.  It comes with sudoku, a frogger type game, a puzzle game and some others.  It's also got an alarm clock feature, which I haven't used personally.  All in all this thing is way better than an iPod.  I had been using iTunes prior to my purchase (now I use WMP 11) and thankfully I had never saved any songs in my 10gb library in Apple's AAC song format.  I kept them as 160bit mp3's which were located easily by WMP and fully accessible in their iTunes folders.  WMP 11 is still a little buggy, but as I understand its still in beta.  My only real problem was that it had some trouble with the ID3 tags on some of the songs and mislabelled them in seperate versions of the same cd.  It wasn't heard to fix, I just checked off the "retrieve additional information from the internet" checkbox under the options and fixed the ID3 tags myself rejoining the songs into albums properly.  Hopefully this will be an issue addressed in a future patch for WMP.  All that being said, I strongly encourage you to go down to your local store who carries the Clix (got mine at Best Buy) and look at it youself, compare side by side to the nano and hopefully this review will help you make an informed decision.

<Title>Truly the best of the best of flash players.
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this item for only a week now - not too long - but I have to say that this is among my top three greatest purchases of all time.  To establish some credibility here, when I shop for electronics I always want the best of the best and don't settle for less.  I research a purchase for a long period of time before I actually make it, to remove any likelihood of regret.  I don't recall a time when I've regreted such a purchase.  Now, the Clix is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I have never seen such a small, but proportionately functional, player.  The screen resolution is amazing (I would honestly compare it to my high-end LCD).  The display and video playback frame-rate are also very pleasing - they say it only gets 15 FPS, but it's so negligible that I can't complain (the skip is honestly hardly noticable).  I am also very pleased with the navigation of the menu system - it's so smooth and user-friendly.  When I first began exploring the menus it was almost like going through my computer's operating system for the first time.  I mean that in a good way - it was so feature rich and every functional feature that I wanted was present and well placed.  I also love the physical navigation.  I admit I was a little unsure about clicking the screen to navigate, but it's so seemless and natural that it almost feels like every other way is irritating.  I am usually pleased with my electronic purchases and quite well enjoy them, but in this rare case I was truly ecstatic.  I must have said "wow" at least a couple dozen times.  If I had enough money I would honestly buy one of these for everyone I know.  I still can't believe that they can sell such a feature rich and perfectly constructed item for so little.  However, to play the devil's advocate, so to speak, I will say that there is one small issue that I have with this player: the storage capacity.  It's only 2GB and, at least for me, it's not enough.  Now, I'm not saying I will listen to all of those 2GBs before I have a chance to switch some files around :) , but it would be nice to have at least 4GB.  I'm sure iRiver will release a 4GB version sometime this year, and when they do, barring any unforeseen releases of some other player that could hold up against this one, the 4GB Clix will be hands down, in my humble opinion, the best digital audio player on the market.  If you think the iPod nano is a better purchase then hunt down two people who have each of these players and take a look for yourself.  I'm confident that most, if not all, of the people who experience both players will agree that the Clix is the best option.  If you're looking for a feature-rich, ultra-portable and well-built flash audio player, do yourself a favor and get this one.

<Title>things you should know
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iriver clix is a great sounding mp3 player with a great picture. There are things you should know that the manual doesn't explain to sync cds to your player you need to make sure your windows media player is set to rip them as mp3. In the advanced setting mode theres a option to reformat your mp3 player. It recomends doing it if you encounter fatal errors. Definately do not use it unless iriver tells you to do it to fix your player not only will it erase everything in the memory but it also reformats it in a way that your player will hold alot less music. Don't get me wrong this is a great player but if your electronically challenged like my self you can really screw up your player.

<Title>Great features, battery...not so much
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great product full of features. Sound, image and video quality are great. But, that great screen quality has one drawback, it sucks the batteries dry. The advertised battery life is true, as long as you just let it play. Changing the volume level and skipping tracks however turn on the screen, which devours the battery quickly. Overall, a great product with an abundance of features.

<Title>it delivers what it promises 
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read alot about mp3 players for quite awhile. I highly suggest cnet.com for great unbiased reviews. I LOVE my iclix. The only negative about it is it is only 2GB. Other than that, it does what it promises. The sound is great (that's with the earbuds that come with it) and it CRANKS. I have used the voice recorder a couple of times, and it is decent. The FM tuner is great when you are sitting still. I actually enjoy the flash games too. It downloads songs very quickly and is very easy to navigate through the system. This is my first player, and I expect to use the full amount of applications. I can't imagine needing more than what it comes loaded with.

<Title>The best mp3 player.
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very well designed and quality built device. Sound quality is above average, you can set your own equalizer settings or use the preloaded ones.  You can download your own pictures onto it and set them as a background, or view them while listening to your music. Their are several play optionsfor your music. Videos look crisp and clear. The interface is the very easy to use, it felt natural right away. Flash games play well with the click design. Text files look good. The f.m. reciever gets excellent reception, and the record quality is better than any other player that I've heard. Everyone who I've let use my clix player has said this will be their next mp3 player that they purchase. Definately worth the price, excellent quality.

<Title>IRiver...What's The Problem?
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know if I just lucked out and got the only bad one in the lot, but this device seems to have nine kinds of problems with .mp3 files that don't end abruptly.  If the song fades out, or fades into another song on the same album, the unit either locks up completely, or shuts off to the point where it needs a complete reset.  I got tired of being interrupted up to three times during my workouts to reset the device, which can take up to one minute each time.  I have already had to delete any Black Eyed Peas file, and incidentally Joan Baez seems to have the same problem.  (I don't work out to Joan Baez, by the way.) This unit may accidentally have a 45 lb. plate dropped onto it...three or four times, just like the last mp3 player that failed to satisfy me.  A very poor performance by a device which seemed to have great reviews from everyone else.  Everything else with the device seems to be fine, the menus are easy to understand, and the transfer of music is adequate.

<Title>Iriver Clix
<Date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I puchased the Iriver Clix specifically for use in my new car....which can accept input from an MP3 player.  The Clix works flawlessly, from  downloading music and pictures from my computer and playing them back through the car radio.  The only problem I`ve had is that the volume level of the playback is low and needs to be turned up quite a lot compared to the volume of the other sources played through the radio.  However there is no distortion of the sound at the higher volumes setting.   I`m pleased with the performance of the Iriver Clix and would recommend it to other customers for use in the kind of application I have experience with.

<Title>DON'T BUY THIS PLAYER!
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unless you have money to throw away, do yourself a favor and don't buy this player. Iriver usually makes great MP3 Players, but this one is really bad. You actually have to press the screen, which is built like a button itself, this leads to fingerprint marks on the display and scratches over time. Don't worry about it though this display/button will not last very long! After just a couple of months mine stopped working! People gave this player great reviews and that's what made me buy this thing! I got another one, and guess what, the same thing happened! Never again though! It seems that"customers"(by which I mean Iriver employees!) who write these reviews do not have to use that thing. It is not built to last, and the battery will give you great performance for... 3 weeks at least and will start fading really fast. I wish there was a way we could try these products out before we purchased them. Be careful buyers,be very careful, there are a lot of bad products out there and even more people who will leave a positive review for a bad product!

I absolutely love being able to share photos of my family with coworkers as well as wearing this while walking the dogs.  It is so portable and easily fits in a pocket or using the carrying case.  I can download and use any picture I want as my screen background and change it as often as I like.  The battery life is amazing only needing to be charged every couple days or so.  You can download play lists from either Real Player or Windows Media player.  It is so user friendly I would recommend it to anyone.  Even my 6 & 9 year olds can use it!

<Title>A very helpful study aid
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>iRiver CXW-2G is actually my first MP3 player (w/ video).  So, I had to think a lot when I was choosing this product over other products.    My main reason for choosing this item was it has built-in FM radio.  When I heard FM radio after receiving this item, the sound quality was great: The sound was as good as my portable Sony radio.  Now, I can exercise in  the gym while listening to my favorite FM station.  Moreover, I have a comprehensive examination coming and must listen to many required musical works amounting to 12 CDs (I'm a music major).  Thus, I was very happy when I found out that I could record all 12 CDs into this tiny item and and can listen to them anywhere, any time.  That's the reason I gave "five stars" for the rating.  Besides, it looks  cute and is easy to use.  Well, I have to mention that when I charge it, it seems to take at least two hours through USB connection to my laptop.  It isn't a problem to me, though.  I'm very happy with this iRiver.

<Title>Better than an iPod Nano
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for my girlfriend (a pc user) and she loves it. Very intuitive interface. Syncs easily with Windows Media Player 10. Can very easily convert video using the program Badak. Thats a free piece of software available through the iRiver website and thru various online sites. Badak works well and easily. Follow the instructions on the iRiver site and you'll be fine. Video looks really good. I found that it reduces a 700 megabyte .avi file down to around 300 megs. You loose a lot of quality there but since you are watching on such a small screen you don't notice the quality loss. Therefore you can fit around 6-7 300 g movies on it, I haven't tried with tv episodes yet so I can't specify anything there. But for a player to be able to hold 3 full movies, at least 200 songs, a few games, and pictures.... thats a far more versatile device than a nano. It feels good in the hand, doesn't feel flimsy. This is truly a great player.

<Title>Awseome Audio
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can second the positive comments that everyone else made. The device is excellent. The sound quality is impressive (I was a television production technician for 10 years, so I know audio pretty well.) But, since nothing is perfect, here are few things to be aware of:  * The Clix does NOT have a timer-record function for FM radio. It is possible that it will be added in a later firmware release.  * It does NOT support Audible. Again, maybe later.  * The included ear buds sound pretty good, especially for ear buds, but didn't work real well for my ears- the buds didn't want to stay in place, and they were uncomfortable. YMMV, I'm sure.  * WMP is the only means of synching audio files. Although you can copy files over yourself using Windows Explorer, it is not reccommended.  * Mine froze up several times, but only during certain songs that had a scrolling title (I've had it just a few days). Tech support is very good. This is a known problem, and the current solution (should be fixed in next firmware release- I have 1.11) is to reformat the device and re-synch everything. Not a big deal, as synching is very fast, but you do lose the pre-loaded games and videos. Many games are available for free on iRiver's web site, as are some other videos, but not all of the original games are there, nor are the videos. So, if you need to re-format, back up everything to your PC first using Windows Explorer. So far, no freezes after the reformatting.  * Sound volume may be too low depending on your source material, phones, listening environment, and ripping method. If you use WMP to rip, you can't adjust the volume at rip time. I suggest using a free ripping program (such as FreeRip) that allows for volume adjustment and/or normalization. The volume is fine under most conditions, but just be aware of the issues, and if you have a problem, the solution is easy and free.  Anyway, overall, I am very happy with the Clix. Would I buy it again? Without hesitation. Go for it.

I don't use the voice recorder a lot but when I did use it, it worked very well.  Watching videos is an enjoyable experience.  I have no problem watching movies.  The screen for me is big enough and it doesn't hurt my eyes.  The player has great flash games that can be very addicting.  Adding album art to the player is another great addition to an already amazing player.  If you are going to buy this player I would recommend buying the cradle.  It's a great accessory to have.  Another thing that you need to get for it is a silicone case from Javoskin.  It protects your mp3 player from bumps and scratches.  Iriver also sells a silicone case but I have found that the Javoskin silicone case is a better choice.  To get the Javoskin silicon case, just go to Javoedge.com and select  Iriver Clix from the list.  It also comes with a belt clip and a laynard, and it is cheaper than iriver's silicone case.  To sum up this is the best mp3 player to have.  It will keep you occupied.  To find out more about this mp3 player go to cnet.com.  They have a full review of it and they even have a great video about the Iriver Clix.  This mp3 player I would recommend to anyone.  5 out of 5!

<Title>Great Product!!!!!
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just wish it had more space than 2GB.  That is the only short coming in my opinion.  And also the fact that you need to download a video converter from Iriver just to transfer you video files too. Besides those 2 aspects, this is one of THE BEST MP3 Players I've ever purchased. I sold my Ipod NANO as soon as I discovered the CLIX.

<Title>Nice alternative to iPod
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using this product for over a week and impressed by its aesthetics, functionality, and performance. The player is small, yet good enough to view videos, photos, and text files. The unique feature of this product is that its design is not inspired by iPod unlike most other mp3 players.   The sound quality is awesome. It has good mix of lows, mids, and highs. Interestingly, the stock earphones sound pretty good. May be, some aftermarket earphones might furthur improve the sound quality (only for audiophiles).   Display is bright and crisp. Customizing the picture/video  orientation (portrait/landscape) is a nice touch. Of course, the display is susceptible to finger impressions, as is the case with any display. So, I am not referring to this as a con. Anyway, there is a carry pouch that comes along with the player.  Control buttons are located on the edges of the player. So, there is much space left for the display. Navigation buttons are the ends of the display.  Also, enabling the hold button disables the navigation buttons by making the display ends non-clickable.  Availability of a smart button that is configurable. Battery (rechargeable)life seems good (I have used it for about 14 hours after the initial charge, and so far it is working fine). Battery life is estimated at 25 hours by iRiver.  Using the menus in the player and installation of Windows Media Player 11, required to sync the player are a breeze. Of course, you can also drag-drop music files, photos onto the device directly, like a USB drive. But, drag-drop might not work properly for videos. You can make use of the iriverter software (open-source) to convert videos to suit the player's requirements.   The player supports a few features like line in recording from any audio source through the Cradle. It is an accessory that needs to be purchased separately. The cradle has in-built speakers, line-in and line-out ports on the back. It has a nice little remote that can be used to control the iRiver Clix.   Well, the player does not have really any cons. But, I feel it can be made much better.  Display size can be increased for better viewing. If the player's size is that of a video ipod, then viewing videos will be a pleasure.  2 Gb is good for storing music and photos, but might be less for storing videos. We can expect some higher capacity versions of this in the near future.  On the whole, iRiver Clix looks stylish and does what it is supposed to do. It is certainly worth the money and I would strongly recommend this to everyone planning to buy an mp3 player.

<Title>WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!
<Date>Thu Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just as it is said on the title. But to make it more elaborate, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU MAKE ANY KIND OF MISTAKE, AT ALL! Read over the rest, if you want to know what happened exactly. But otherwise, I am complaining about the iRiver player purchasing because my iRiver clix player was broken because it was so fragile, and the damage is not covered under warranty!   And I am not certainly the only one who had this problem, please read over this following forum post if you want to know what I mean:  [...]  Maybe it is possible to say that, because I have been using the product for only a month, I cannot really justify the pros and the cons of the iRiver. But I am definitely a hardcore user when it comes to a technological gadget, so I can probably say that I have thoroughly played with all the features of the product, though that is the probably the reason why I broke the product so early.  The accident happened when I tried to put the iRiver clix player through the armband and it just slipped and fell to the floor. Because the player was turned off before it fell down, I did not know the LCD screen was broken until I tried to turn it on later. That is, I admit that the accident was clearly a mistake due to my clumsiness. But I also did not expect that the LCD screen would be broken so easily with such minor damage. So, I contacted the iRiver customer service through the e-mail I found from the iRiver America website and soon got the response that the player is not fixable. While I was disappointed to hear such response, I was not exactly dissatisfied with the customer service itself because the response was prompt enough. However, what concerned me is that the product was so fragile yet the system is not covered under the warranty service, if it is due by accident.   When I tried to make the purchase of the product, I was considering between the iPod nano, iRiver clix, and the Samsung's nano like player. After reading the various articles from the online and the magazines, I decided to go with the iRiver clix because there were reviews by Cnet and PC Magazine that have favorable views about the iRiver clix. But another main reason that made me to purchase the iRiver clix was that because I read over warranty term of iRiver clix and because I found iPod nano's easily scratching surface rather faulty. Of course, I should take notice of the fragile appearance of the iRiver clix player. But I thought it was possible that, due to the immense improvement of electrical appliances technologies, such problem was almost eliminated. Beside, because the iRiver clix is a flash memory based player than a hard disk memory player, I believed that the iRiver clix can easily take some damages and still be okay.    When I called the customer service by the phone today, I found that the prompt response by the customer service representative and the interface of the phone guide to be good enough, unlike some customer services like American On Line or Paypal. And while the customer service representative's tone sounded bit tired, his detail of instruction regarding what to do about the product was competent enough. But from what I realized about the structure of the warranty service, it looks fatally flawed. I mean, I understand that the iRiver company itself has not established itself for long enough in the United States compared to the companies like Apple, but it still should have the descent service centers set up to fix the product for a free or for a reasonable price. To be frank, I am a student almost done with engineering study, so I understand how unattractive it is to fix an electronic product without a reasonable fee. Yet the Apple is doing it, so why shouldn't iRiver? Besides, the CEO Jeff Bezos from the Amazon.com constructed its company with the central premise to make almost idealistically perfect customer service for the people, as he demonstrated by he personally delivered a product to the Japan as a way of showing the thanks for having a first international buyer. And although more of monetary oriented guy than the Jeff Bezo is, the CEO Michael Dell from Dell computer also established his company with the consider how to deal directly with people with better customer service. My point is that, to be successful in business, whether it is in the United States or in some place else, I believe it is most important to pursue for a perfect customer service, rather than caring simply about how much money it will make.   I know the iRiver is trying to expand its business to the world by starting itself from the South Korea. And while it is certainly a head start to get the outstand reviews from the popular magazines and the websites, no company can go for too long if it neglects to satisfy the customer. As an example, if I have terrible experience in using the iRiver clix, I can write badly about the product by writing on the blog sites, Amazon review site, Cnet review site, etc. But if I think that the product and the service are really great, I am willing to tell my friends how good the product is and so forth. And wouldn't that be a way really to increase the sale quota of the products made from iRiver clix, especially right now where the word is so easily spread able through out the internet and the media? And besides making the truly unique products in the reasonable price, I think providing the unique customer service by a company is the only way to distinguish the corporation from the rest of others. If anyone thinks that the iRiver is doing fairly well compared to the other competitions, I guess it really depends on the perspective because I remember a South Korean reviewer who wrote unfavorably about the business performance of iRiver even in the South Korea and losing its ground to the iPod nano from Apple while making an analogy of Hyundai cars versus Honda Civic.   But now, I do not even get any response from the iRiver, despite I sent a second message. They talked something about the reward program, but I could not find it anywhere. Although I really liked the design of iRiver clix, I will be afraid to make any new purchase from iRiver now. I was even thinking about making the purchase of iRiver clix craddle, but now I will just think about choosing Samsung or Apple mp3 player instead on my next purchase.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After enjoying A LOT my Creative Zen Jukebox 20 GByte player, I decided to buy a flash memory player, and iRiver Clix seemed like the obvious choice.  I am NOT disappointed, and I think that this is an amazing gadget!  It is incredibly small, at least compared to my older Jukebox, it has no moving parts, and the sound quality, enhanced by several user options is TOTALLY OUTSTANDING!!!  I listen to it with my Shure E4 earphones and I just completely lose myself into the music. The included earphones are great, but I find them uncomfortable to wear.  I like the FM Tuner feature, and, although it was a bit of a try-fail-and-try-again effort to learn how to program it (the manual lacks specificity, on MANY subjects), I was able to finally program my favorite stations.  The reception quality is terrific.  My ONLY disappointment is with the memory capacity of Clix. It offers a 2 Gbyte memory, which is fine, for most of my needs, but I do wish I had a lot more "reserve" memory for future growth.  Any future growth can only be accommodated by deleting lower priority "albums", which is never the best option.  I also found that the Windows Media Player interface was cumbersome, and it took me a lot of working with it to understand how to manage my music collection.  Apparently, the Media Player Library is nowhere linked to the data folders one sets up using Windows Explorer, which I think is unfortunate. It takes a while to understand how the process works to update the iRiver Clix, but it has now become quite manageable.  Bottom line, it's an amazing gadget, and I will enjoy it a heck of a lot during my 16-day transatlantic cruise in November, and hopefully, well beyond that....

<Title>Feature Overload
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I bought my Clix a couple weeks ago and I was a little skeptical from my friends who owned iriver mp3's and said they had hell of a time with downloads and crashes but, the reviews on the Clix made me think otherwise... And low and behold this is by far the best MP3 I have ever owned!! The features are plenty and the ease of use is amazing from navigation to downloading. Works excellent with WMP11 and cant be easier with MTV's URGE to get all the songs I need. The video is very good to. With 15fps it still performs well. The FM Tuner is sharp and strong is a great bonus to have for morning shows or news on the go. Alot of people complain about storage, this unit is what it is 2GB and thats not enough DONT buy it. IF the only other thing people complain about it "finger prints" then this is the best value MP3 on the market right now.

<Title>Excellent Small Player
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The UI is incredible... I love it.  It's very easy to operate, and a delight to use.    The video quality is good.  You don't notice the 15fps unless you look for it, and it doesn't show up at all in cartoons and other low-quality sources.  If you think of it as a nano-type player that can play video too, you'll be very satisfied.    I managed to convert several avi files to its native format using the iriverter tool, and they look great.  I even figured out how to copy from a dvd, and to convert streamed flash videos (like google and youtube).  Very fun!  The file sizes end up being pretty small: about 75 MB for 1 hour of video... So you could fit  about 13 hours of video on it.    The sync rate with windows media player is FAST.  I used to have an H10 with yahoo music service, and this is WAY faster.  I was very pleased, because I thought the switch to MTP was a mistake, but after using WMP11 I am very satisfied with the interface.  it  is very integrated and easy to use.    Go get it!  It's awesome.

<Title>A man and his toys are a given
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm 53 years old. and have been playing games since Commodor 64 days. Have three uber gamming computers. I have bought about every electronic toy known to mankind. This is the VERY best "toy" I have ever bought. Small, SUPER easy interface, crystal clear screen,(especially for it's size) sounds as good as you can want. Bought one for my son. He loves it. He also owns a ipod. (Which are very nice also but just wanted to be Windows Father-Son more intergrated...) Sure would have been nice to have 30 gigs instead of the two gigs it does have. But like I told my son, Why do you need to "store" stuff? Right now I have 20 pictures, 85 soungs, 5 games, three full length movies and still have 300 megs left over. Like I told him, when you are done watching a movie, delete it. No need to keep it in storage. Also the FM radio is much sweetness!!! Do yourself a favor. buy it.

<Title>So many features!
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Clix last week, and the novelty has yet to wear off. It does so many different things very well. I had read lots of reviews before I made the purchase, including complaints about the converter that you have to download to put videos onto your Clix. I downloaded the converter and its beyond easy to use, so no complaints about that. Right now I have about 420 songs on it, as well as 4 videos and 20 pictures. I only have a couple of minor complaints. The first being that the Clix comes with a Windows Media Player cd thats supposed to install wmp on your computer. Well, its wmp 11, which is in beta, and it kind of screwed with the rest of my computer. I just deleted it, and am using the standard wmp.  The only other issue I have is that I have found the headphones to be almost unbearably uncomfortable. I have average ears, but one of the headphones is always falling out, I must say I had an ipod before, and I found their headphones to be alot better. Overall though, the Clix is an amazing little mp3 player that does it all! I highly recommend it!
