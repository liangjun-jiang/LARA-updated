<Title>BEWARE - IT WILL TRASH YOUR SMARTMEDIA CARD
<Date>Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This MP3 players works just fine but I gave it a one star because it will format your smartmedia card so it can only be used with this MP3 player and there is no way to restore the card to its original formatting once you used it in this player.  I now have to purchase another smartmedia card for my digital camera because this ... MP3 player trashed my smartmedia card and d-link could care less.

<Title>It trashed my Smart Media Card
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I purchased this player last month (but not from ...(this website)) and it works just fine, I am giving it a one star because it formats the smartmedia cards so they are no longer usable in other smartmedia devices, such as camera, card readers, etc.  Some MP3 player mfg have developed a utility to format the cards back to the original state but D-Link has not done this for their players and have no intention of doing so.  I just want to let you know this before you trash a SmartMedia card like I did.

<Title>Works Like It Says, And Batteries Last Longer Than Expected
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This MP3 player works great. I bought a 128MB smart media card for this and it can hold so much music now. I can get about 40 to 50 songs on here. The sound is perfect for what I need (mainly in class) and the batteries last fairly long. I personally bought rechargable batteries so I wouldn't have to worry about buying more all the time. I recharge the batteries while I sleep, just to be safe for the next long day at school. I would have opted for the DMP-120 with more memory, but i couldn't afford it. And since I got a 128MB smart media card for my birthday, I didn't miss the extra 32MB. Another great thing about this is voice recording. I occasionally make notes to myself, or record parts of my professors lecture, or just the homework they assign. In any case I recommend this MP3 player for students like myself who are on a budget.

<Title>DLINK DMP-110  Beware!!!
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Looks like I should have read some reviews first!! DO NOT use a SmartMedia card that you intend on using in a different device! Formatting the card for use in the DMP 110 will render it useless  for any other device.  I've had quite a go round with this device.  Had to return it twice before I got one that worked (I should have been smart enough to stop then). Still in search of a reformatting utility!  This device is not plug &amp; play, I'd recommend looking for something else.  This is very disappointing  as I have purchased other DLINK devices had have found them to be pretty good.

<Title>Bad software
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I was wondering whether I am the only one suffering this problem: the software comes with this player won't match up with my Compaq desktop -- it crashed my computer several times and I had to give up by putting it up for sale.  Both Compaq and D-Link pointed fingers to each other and won't help me. Be aware if you also use Compaq!

<Title>WATCH OUT!!!  I am very serious!
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought the Rocket MP3 player from Musician's Friend and was very excited at first.  I also bought a 1 year warranty on the player.  I personally hate this product and the company who sold it to me  (E-Blitz).  The reason why is because after I downloaded music into the player, for some reason it wouldn't play for nothing!!! I got extremely frustrated from having to constantly restart my comp. because it froze many times for no reason! Every time I tried to play the music that was downloaded into the player, the screen would just display "00" or "01" and nothing happened! Then, after many nervewrecking times of plugging in the USB, it stated that there was an error. It said that there was not enough memory in the player to play, therefore I couldn't use it at all.  Apparently, the player couln't handle the MEASLY 3 or 4 songs that were downloaded into it!!!(that is WACK!) How should have I known when to stop downloading songs! The thing was useless! And if I buy more memory, how do I know it won't do the same thing when the memory runs out?! I tried to call the company for a trade or refund, but all they told me was to call another # back and forth! Even with the warranty, I was not helped at all. I couldn't do anything! I wasted my money (...) for something that doesn't even work! If I could, I would warn everybody not to buy this product because if it happened to me, it could happen to you! I believe nobody should be RIPPED OFF like I was! I think that this product shouldn't be advertised at all because it is screwed up!!! (...)

<Title>Good, but not great
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I am one of the apparent few who is very happy with this player.  I got it for Christmas and was a little weary after reading all the other reviews here.  However, my player works wonderfully.  I can get 10 songs on the internal memory and they all play great.  The Smart Media Card Slot is nice.  It does use its own format and WILL make the card unusable to other devices such as cameras.  However, contrary to popular belief, the cards CAN be restored to their original state and universal functionality.  All you need is a card reader with its formatting program.  I have a SanDisk ImageMate USB reader.  It comes with a formatting utility called &quot;SMPREP.EXE&quot; I successfully used this program to restore my 8MB Smart Media Card to work properly with my camera and reader.  Bottom line is that this is a solid player, and I would recommend it especially if you are on a budget.  If you have a CD Burner, think about and MP3/CD Discman since you get 650-700MB of MP3's (150+ songs) per disc.  <p>(The drivers for this player reportedly don't work with COMPAQ machines so be aware of that if you own a COMPAQ)  Hope this review is helpful!

<Title>Nice player for the Money
<Date>Sat May 11 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I guess I'm one of the few to say it's nice inexpensive player. The sounds quality is great for the price...I got this mainly because of the small size for working out.<br>To compair the 2 I would say the D-link sound quality is close to that of the more expensive Kazoo...<br>And in my opinion the D-link sofware for downloading is actually more flexable to use than the MusicMatch that came with the Kazoo.<p>Don't get me wrong...I'm very happy with my Kazoo...but for the price difference the D-link is a great bargin...I've had it for over 5 month...no problems. Agian...especially for the price.

<Title>Better than you've heard.
<Date>Sat Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>In my experience, some of the criticism of this product is fair, but it shouldn't be enough to warn off all potential buyers. First of all, if you want to use your smart media card for other things, you WILL have to reformat it first. Second, the internal memory is small, and it WILL be only three or four songs if you prefer mp3's of 192 kbs or above.<p>However, I've had absolutely no problems with the sound quality of this player. It's cheap enough that you can throw in a 32 or 64 megabyte smart media card for more memory and still have a cheaper package than comparable players. I actually have more storage than my Rio owning bud, for less than 2/3's the price. It IS a functional recorder, basic but solid. The software is decent enough with most computers, and incredibly easy to use. The headphones are maybe the worst part of the player, and I use my own whenever possible.<p>In short, if you're looking for a low priced player and recorder, a combination that's VERY hard to find, this is a good way to go.     I'd only recommend against it if you have a Compaq computer. For the rest of you, don't let the general outrage over it's card reformatting get you down. It's a good machine.
