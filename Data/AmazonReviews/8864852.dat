<Title>First Impressions

<Content>This player is just slightly bigger and heavier than the Shuffle, and the battery life does seem to be as good, but overall is a very good MP3 Player for running.  When I first got this player, it would only hold about 500 MB. I reformatted it by right clicking on the folder in Windows Explorer, and selecting Format... This solved the problem, so don't return it if you have the same problem.     
<Overall>3

<Title>Great for Exercise Music

<Content>For what I need, this is great.  It plays all my music, it charges quickly without needed any charger other than my computer, it's easy to use, and it's small.  I looked at a lot of options and while this does not last as long as others, the price is right and it's perfect for going to the gym.

<Title>Complete Disappointment
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the item in white. The description stated that it would be silver. The item shorted out within a week of receiving the item. The manufacturer was unwilling to refund my money, as was the company that I had purchased it from. It took over a week and a half to come to a resolution to the problem. Amazon had to refund my money because the company wouldn't. The item was defective and poorly made. I have never received an item so horribly made. I also have never received such poor customer service.
