<Content>equals no sale. Closed system that excludes me is more "proprietary" than iTunes/iPod combo. You are not forced to use iTunes to use your iPod, any CD can be ripped to it. You are not forced to use a particular OS for your computer either, with an iPod. Not so with this wanna-be. Zen-casting? give me a break!  no zero star option available

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for my son this christmas. He likes it but finds it too bulky and no way near as easy to operate as his cousins iPod video. He's swithcing to the iPod as soon as he sells the Creative. I must say that the video on the creative is very good looking. Sharper than on Apples iPod. But keep in mind that the Zen is a portable videodevice and the iPod is a MP3 player with videocapabilities. It's NOT a Video iPod. Maybe something will incarnate at Macworld !

<Title>Blows Apple Away
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product has it all of over Apple's Ipod.  More importantly it is getting more and more obvious that Apple Fanatics (probably shareholders) go around and give every non-Apple product only one star and then make up some ridiculous negative review.   But the worm is about to turn for Apple as the competition is now coming up with superior products at better price points.  Which brings me to the new Creative M.     Superior battery life, FM Radio free (not a $50 add on like the Apple)and wider compatibility.  Enough said.

<Title>Solid features give plenty of bang for the buck, excellent PMP
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off let me say I have experimented with the iPod Video (friend got it for Xmas) and generally liked it. Just for my needs, it wasn't the right choice. I use XP mainly and wanted more video and song compatibilty options. After much research (iAudio X5, iPod Video, and others) the Vision:M came out on top. Now that I've received mine and had a chance to play with it some, I think it's obvious by some of the alleged "reviews" posted by obvious iPod fans, they really haven't even tested this excellent unit.   Some highlights: 1- works with the subscription based music services, which was high on my list. iTunes may someday offer this option, but at least for now does not. I like to try out all kinds of music before purchasing and can do it with this portable media player (PMP). Sound quality for music is very good, with an EQ to tweak to individual tastes.  2- video quality is top notch, with several different formats supported. It was quite easy to transfer recordings from my Snapstream PVR setup on the PC to the Vision:M, so now I have several episodes of The Simpsons, Scrubs, and 60 Minutes to watch during trips. Nice.  3- The menu navigation is just like the Creative Zen Micro, and I think most people will get the hang of that relatively quickly. It's not perfect but I had it pretty much down in the initial hour of playing around with the unit.  OTHER INFO: I haven't had a chance to play video for a long stretch to determine true battery life, but specs and reviews on sites like CNET indicate it is about 4 hours for video and 14 or so for music. That is plenty for me. iPod is more in the 2-3 hour range for video.  As for size, I've seen some who make a big deal that it is thicker than the iPod Video. However, the Zen feels solid and comfortably fits in my hand. I have no problem at all with the size. It's plenty small.  I've noticed some people claim Creative has ripped off iPod for the look, but really, the Creative Zen Micro MP3 player (about 2 years old) is what struck me as a near replica as far as size/design goes. Similar to iPod Video, sure. But far closer to Creative's already long established MP3 player.  Features like microphone recording, FM play and record, Outlook calendar / contacts compatibility, etc. are nice little bonuses but weren't a real factor in my selection criteria.  With the upcoming vast increase in choices for video, podcast and music download availability (as evidenced by recent announcements at CES and elsewhere), the Zen Video:M should be a great choice for anyone who rates features/quality over the "hipness" factor iPod currently has over the masses. I give Apple credit for how they achieved their iPod success with great marketing and a solid product, I just think if you do your research you may end up choosing the Video:M as well. I wouldn't hesitate at all to steer a Windows XP user to it.  P.S. Tested out the ZenCast feature (in beta as of my writing) and it shows promise as a way to collect video and audio podcasts from a centralized location.   Creative Zen Video:M gets a big thumbs up from me...

<Title>Just trying to even things out.
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hey I think the ipod line of products are fantastic! I think apple is doing some really great stuff. The fact of the matter is that Creative and other companies are doing great stuff too. The zen vision:m is an example of this. Why cant both products be good at the same time?!  Of coarse the reason I chose the zen vision:m is because of its ability to play multiple formats of video. I also have a subscription with napster to download all the music i want for 14 bucks a month. I do not like the iTunes interface and setup...but thats just me. I think that some people are better off with iPods (mainly the people who dont have a clue about technology). I also think that the 2hours of video on the iPod video is not enough for me...again this is not true for everybody. The zen vision:M gives a solid 4 hours of video playback time. Hopefully more people can come to love both products instead of sending hate one way!

<Title>Quality lacking
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this one for Christmas. After using it for a few weeks, it's going back and getting replaced with an iPod. My wife has the iPod, and it is much easier to use than the Creative. The Creative certainly is not as easy to use as the iPod, and it also feels as though it is not made as well. You can pretty much tell after using them side-by-side that this is Creative's attempt at copying the iPod. They do a good job of making it look similar, but it just doesn't stack up to the quality of the iPod.

<Title>A lil dissapointing, but I don't think anyone else could have done much better
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now, I don't see the hype between the iPod video and Creative Zen vision.  I can see why some people love iPod and can think that the creative is just a rip-off.  Well it is not a rip-off, because that's what companies do.  Competition is a vital factor in advancing our race.  Here, I'll do some pros and cons  Pros for creative: -Vivid screen, very nice colors, the iPod video screen is not so good -Compatible with most video codecs when the iPod is not (see specs above) -2 hours more battery lfie for video than iPod -a few more hours of music playback than iPod -When connected to the computer via USB, the battery charges using the USB power -Well made in my opinion, pretty sturdy, however I don't wanna try dropping it. -Connects to the TV and works perfectly (I tried it with a previous AV cable made by panasonic for my video camera) -Great sound quality -DOES NOT CONVERT MUSIC FILES TO AAC.  MUSIC FILES CAN BE DUPLICATED -You can change the background to any image you have on the creative -You can zoom in onto pictures quite nicely -Dubbed the iPod killer   Cons: -A bit bulkier (I don't mind, since it is pretty small to me anyways -Battery cannot be removed and voids the warranty when it is opened -Navigation is different, not hard.  People that are use to the iPod will always think highly of iPod's navigation system -Converting video is slow but I don't think iPod's is any better -The power plug is kinda big and im a bit confused why it comes in 2 pieces -The back is not black as well, I would have liked the back of the creative to be black as well as everything else including the cables etc -The video seek is slow, but I'm thinking that because it is a hard drive and not a flash drive.  I highly doubt any other hard drive based media player can be any faster -$30 over the price of the iPod video 30 gb, but it costs money is your a pc user in order to connect  I can add some more later after I use the Creative Zen Vision: M a lil more.   Overall I give it a 9 out of 10.

<Title>A real Vision M Review...
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>****Updated Review**** 1/17/2006 (original below)  I've installed Windows XP as a dual boot on one of my machines. I was able to install the Zen Vision M and Creative Media Source software without any issues. I also successfully installed WMP10 without issues.  While I was getting my pc ready to install XP I played with the player to see what I could do with it alone. I figured out how to quickly adjust the settings using the slide and tap paradigm. The Zen Touch has a similar paradigm but the Vision M extends it, the touch pad actually has left and right clicks as well. After a bit of frustration I realized that sliding through menu's should always be done with the finger on the surface of the pad, if you lift and reseat your finger the player would interpret that as a "tap" and thus commence whichever setting you happened to be on when you were sliding..I did this a few times before I got the hang of the slide and tap. Also, it took a few minutes to figure out how to enable submenu options using the lower right icon. Once I was up to speed (took about 10 minutes WITHOUT consulting the sparce instruction book) I quickly went through the task of selecting my name for the player, adding a background (I used one of the samples provided in the picture section), setting the date and time. I then moved on to checking out the radio feature, you can set the device to "auto" scan and it works perfectly. It picked up and preset every station inside of 10 seconds, awesome! I live in a basement apartment and I was suprised at how clean the signal was coming from the radio from such a small (read: tiny FM antenna) device. The next thing I wanted to try was recording, from the radio I was able to enable recording, the sub features are really very intuitive. Again, I did this all without consulting the book within a space of 20 minutes. The hardest part was the first 10 minutes of getting used to the slide and tap paradigm. Now on to the XP experience...  I finally got XP up and running, I installed the software and fter the obligatory reboot, I plugged the port doc into the player and connected the mini usb plub into the doc and the doc into the pc's USB port. Within seconds, the sync screen flashed on the player and the pc reported the synch process had been started. The Vision M software loaded up and showed my connected player fine.  The layout is very intuitive and nice, the inards of the device were layed out by category (music,video,recordings..etc.) and subcategories and folders where necessary. I could freely create or delete subcategories under the main categories. I am still miffed as to why this functionality couldn't have been provided in basic form for every known OS but only Creative and Microsoft have the answer to that riddle.  I proceeded to upload a ripped album ( I have several hundred cuts waiting to go on the player) unfortunately, I have USB 1.1 on the box I installed the XP on so the transfer is not as fast as it could be but it is acceptable. The entire folder of 14 mp3's took about 4 minutes to copy to the player. I tested a cut, the sound quality is really excellent. ( I rip at 192kbps)  Now that I have gone through the inconvenience of installing windows XP just to use it, I am very happy with the player itself. It is a shame that broader OS support isn't in place but that should be easily rectified with firmware upgrades (are you listening creative????). As much as I'd love to give the player a 5, the pain I went through to get it to work really demands something lower but not quite a 4. Hmm....I guess I'll have to give Creative the nod, after using the player now for a week I am  really impressed with it's performance in all areas. So 5 stars it is (this should tell you just how good the player is despite the hell I went through to start managing media on it).  Player highly recommended but make sure you have XP!     **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006** **ORIGINAL REVIEW 1/13/2006**  How some are claiming to have this at Christmas time in the US when it wasn't even available until this week is telling of the mental disturbances behind some peoples needs to assert the superiority of products they prefer because of one one manufacturer or another. Sad.  That said, here is my real world review of the Creative Vision M. I just took possession of it today, UPS came through 2 days as promised by Amazon.  Previous player experience:  I have used a few other mp3 players but have never owned one until now. I've used the Apple Nano, Ipod Video and the Creative Zen Touch.  Packaging and box:  The box is well designed and sturdy, a sleave and box design gives it a artsy touch, however it makes it more difficult to get at the player..no matter it's just a box.  Player and contents:  Upon taking out the parts I enjoyed the well built and finished look of everything. The cables , port adapter and the player itself are very well made. Contrary to what some have said, the size of the player is quite small in my medium sized hands. I wouldn't want it any smaller, it fit in my hand comfortably and was a lot lighter than the Zen Touch which I bought for my ex girlfriend last Christmas. In comparison to the Ipod Video it's about twice as thick but weighs and "feels" about the same. In the hand they feel similarly, so all talk of the weight/size being a drawback is bunk or those complaining need to do hand strengthening exercises ;) The surface of the player is very cool, much like the Ipod video the black (the one i got) surface is glossy. After charging the battery (takes 2 hours) I turned it on, the screen is quite beautiful to behold with rich vibrant colors. In comparison to the Ipod Video, though technically the M has more colors both have enough that video on them looks amazing, I guess I'd have toplay something on both that stretches the gamut of the players to see which is better.  Software Installation?:  The first major issue I ran into with the player was installation of the software. First, Creative includes a warning card indicating that Quicktime versions 7.0 and 7.0.2 will crash the installation so you should upgrade first to 7.0.3 (which fixes the bug) or uninstall Quicktime, install the Creative software then install Quicktime again.  This isn't the deal breaker however, the insurmountable problem for me is that I use windows 2000 and windows 2003. I don't have XP on any of the 8 running pc's in my home/business network. I own an IT business and have no use for the annoying "features" of Windows XP, why Creative didn't think to maximize software support to as many OS's as possible is beyond me (actually it is not I have some ideas..). Beyond that, why the player just doesn't attach to any pc using the USB port as a drive is also inexcusable.  ****Creative! wake up, many , many users still are on windows OS's that are not XP and if a thumb drive can auto doc without software surely your $330 player should be able to as well!!!****  Now that said, I had to figure out how to add content to my player. I figured Creative has to have software available for windows 2000 so I decided to contact customer support to find out. Page 2 of the "product information guide" indicated that customer support services are located on the installation cd in the "support" folder, I explored the CD and found the english phone number on the "customer support service center" page.  For service in the U.S. in english (french,brazilian,spanish numbers also available):  405 742 6622  I called the number expecting a long wait time, 2 minutes turned to 5, 5 to 10...and then I realized the number was long distance, "complementary" service should always be on a 1 800 number other wise it is not really complementary is it???. The nerve of Creative to call this so called "complementary" service. I hung up quite pissed off. I figured maybe I'll have more luck at the website. I went to www.creative.com/support/downloads , and tried to select my product from the list, of course there is no listing for the brand new "vision m" player.  Now I was really seeing red, how can a company release a product for sale and then not provide the necessary support services??!!. Not one to give up (ever) I decided to see if anyone with my issue had posted to the public forums (always the best place..should have done this straight away)..I went to the mp3 player forums page and queried "vision m and windows 2000" and the results were not encouraging at all, of the 8 total posts that referenced the words together, only 1 had ANY replies. (I guess the Creative support team is keeping away from answering legitimate customer complaints about this issue???)  I dug into the only thread that had responses hoping a solution to my problem would be found there in.  http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board/message?board.id=pmc&message.id=4967  Bad news was waiting, only one post was by a Creative moderator and they offered no help at all. I do have a copy of windows XP on site that came with my Dell Laptop, back then I immediately ripped out the XP and put the more functional windows 2000 on. The idea of installing XP is anethema to me just to use the player really sucks. If I didn't have XP I would have no choice but to return the player! There is no way I would give M$ $100 bucks just because Creative has a secret deal to lock us into M$ proprietary protocols.  The most egregious aspect of this situation is that the older players (Zen Touch I bought for ex) did support 2000 in file mode, why Creative went the restrictive route of only supporting the Micro$oft proprietary protocol exclusively has something probably to do with some "relationship" they struck with MS no doubt. It really stinks, here I am unable to use the device on my desired OS. I am seriously debating weather I should just send it back or if I should install XP on a box JUST to use my $330 mp3 player. (which is a pretty deck of card size brick otherwise)  Conclusion:  ***WARNING TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS, IF YOU HAVE ANY OPERATING SYSTEM OTHER THAN WINDOWS XP , YOU CURRENTLY CAN NOT USE THE VISION M TO DOWNLOAD OR MANAGE MEDIA. IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 98,ME, NT, 2000, MAC OS, YOUR ARE DEAD IN THE WATER.***  Hopefully with enough of a stink being made of this ridiculous situation Creative will move to provide a firmware update that provides the WIDE OS support that existed PRIOR to this NEW product. The player itself works fine, the sample videos that were on it played with excellent clarity and color, the sound was excellent. The touchpad was a bit sensitive on first touch but that was rectified by turning down the sensitivity in the settings. However, the OS support severely hampers my ability to give this player a top rating. In fact I would have given it a 5 if it just worked with my OS but it doesn't (not even as a removable drive..come on Creative even a $30 USB thumb drive can do that!!!) so I will have to take the rating down 4 points to a 1 out of 5.    ...now I'll have to find that old copy of windows XP lying around to grudgingly install it on one of my boxes.

<Title>Best MP3 player out in the market
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i just got mine last week so i'll just try to list some pros and cons  Pros  - the screen is more crisp and clear, just wonderful compared to the iPod video (this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for Creative ARE NOT saturated to make them look better) - sound quality is also better, this coming from Creative so for sure - the earbuds were the most surprising thing, they sound fantastic.  I never realised how bad the ipod earbuds were until today(i am a former 3rd G ipod owner) when i walked into an Apple store and did a comparison in the store, then switched it with the Creative ones. The ipod ones don't isolate the sound as well and it lacks bass, as if it isn't there unless you use the EQ, whereas the Creative ones have a nice bass and a fresh clear sound. Even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder - 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music - 15 hours of audio life, Creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by Cnet on test, it was actually 15 hours. - though bulkier than the ipod video, the size makes it easier to hold, IMO the size is perfect, it's exactly the same as my 3rd Generation iPod with a silicon case - FM radio, great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes, i do  Cons - Internal battery so you can't personally remove it - the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive, being a former ipod user, it takes a bit of getting use to - buttons are a bit stiff at first, but i notice as time goes by it's easier to press - no "on the go playlist" like the ipod, if there is i haven't found out how to do it yet  i give this product a 9/10, however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1, i am bumping this up for a 5/5

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player as a gift for Christmas a few years ago. It was the first mp3 player I've ever gotten, and as long as it keeps working, probably the last.   First of all, it is extremely durable. I'm really hard on electronics, but this thing can take a beating. I've dropped it a few times (once into a bathtub full of water... while it was playing) and the only show of abuse is the corner is cracked and it sometimes has a tendency to freeze if it gets too warm. As long as I'm careful, it's not a problem.  The best thing about it is all the space. I have over 1000 songs, 51 videos (mostly short ones I've taken myself, some music videos and some classic Ren and Stimpy cartoons), and almost 800 songs, plus two gb set aside as removable storage... and I have 20 gb left.   Aside from music, video and picture viewing, it can take short voice recordings, has an FM radio (with pretty good reception, too. I can get channels that my stereo can't pick up), removable storage up to 8 gb like I said earlier, and an date planner. I've never used that feature, since it has to be done on the computer, and I don't need it anyway.   The only really negative things I can think to say about it is that the battery doesn't last as long as it says it should, and the touch pad, even on the lowest setting, is a little too sensitive sometimes. Also I think the screen is a little too bright, even on it's lowest setting. The size is a little bulky as well, but for the for the amount of storage space it gives you, it's worth it. And it also tends to freeze, but I just put that down to me dropping it a bunch of times.   I don't know how it compares to an iPod, since I've never used one, but I think this player is worth every penny.

<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product is amazing.  If you are a PC user, and not in need of the "baby-me" features of the iPod this is for you.  Personally I like the product most because it requires no proprietary software to transfer data to the device.  Just plug it in, and drop in the music.  I have had it for about a year now, dropped it a few times on subway platforms... I dont baby it- and it has proved extremely rugged.  Tales of the screen easily scratching (to a point of unusability) are just that - tales.  The controls are a little sensitive, but it is a small price to pay when you consider the limitiations of the zune and especially the iPod.  If you want something pretty buy the iPod.  If you want something rugged and functional, with very good sound quality GET THE ZEN!

<Title>Not for iSheep - Zen Vision: M == Death Knell for iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Multiple Formats. Multiple Functions.  Better Screen.  Better Battery Life.   Bye bye Mr. Jobs.  Creative's Zen Vision: M has been released stateside and with it ends Apple's reign of sleek yet mediocre HDD mp3 players.  Ignore all the bad reviews posted about getting Vision: M's in the states before early January.  Unless these people imported theirs from Singapore they're simply iPod-fanboys lying through their inordinately white teeth.  Finally the audio world can awaken from the delirium placed upon it by Apple's continued ludicrous drive toward form over function.  Got mine yesterday and I can already claim it's better than any iPod I've ever used.   Hey look, an MP3 player that looks great and actually doesn't treat me like a retarded child with 400USD in one hand and a pacifier in the other.  Boo hoo!  No Mac support!  Now that Apple has finally kowtowed and is using Intel chips in their machine, the noose just got a little tighter around its brand loyal drones.  Wake up!  PC has been the more versatile and functional platform for years.  It's no coincidence that the Vision: M is as well over Apple's mp3 player, the iPod.

<Title>Stop comparing this to an ipod!
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been reading reviews over and over, and almost all of them compare this to an ipod, why?  is it because they look alike? well look at creatives past models, they all look similer to this, including the touch pad.  Creative did NOT steal this look from apple!  It is the generic look for hardrive players.  I also recall that creative and rio were the creators of mp3 players almost, not apple...  This costs more than an ipod because of the technical specs, and the screen resolution.  The screen resolution is twice of what the ipod can display, and 4 times the color.  Also this can plays wma (which is more common than aac), mp3 and wav.  Ipods use aac, mp3 and wav.  With the video, this can hold wmv, avi, divx, xvid, mpeg2, mpeg4, and m4v.  The ipod can only play mpeg4 and m4v.  Also, the creative vision m comes with the wall charger, and apple charges $30 for thiers.  One more thing... This is the vision m, which means it is a decendant of the vision, which is in a totally different class than the ipod!  The ipod is mostly for music where as the vision is a portable media player.  Yes I realize this is a comparison of the ipod, but the point was to prove that creative didn't just pop this out because apple put out the ipod video, these things take work to put out.  And they already had portable players that could utilize all these, and that this is just a smaller version of them.  Creative even had their PMC out for over a year before apple brought out the ipod video.  I apologize for the ramblings, and no I have no hands on experience of this player, except that of creatives older generation players, which are superb.  I don't mean to talk down to the ipod because it is infact a nice player, but this thing over shadows it by a loooooong shot.  Also, you people who love ipods so much can thank toshiba for supplying their hard drives.

<Title>I LOVE THE ZEN M!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My 14 year old techy son received the 30g IPOD for Christmas.  I purchase my ZEN yesterday.  He was begging me to pay the restocking fee and return his IPOD, unfortunately the Apple store only allows 14 days for returns.  I do find it odd that the Zen wasn't available till now in the US, after our Christmas season, middle of January at which time all who may have rec'd IPODS for Christmas couldn't return their IPODs if they chose. Even the salesperson who helped me at Frys returned his IPOD and purchased this, lol  Notable differences:  better screen quality, better programming, being able to download from several sites, doesn't SCRATCH as easily as the IPOD!!! The radio is awesome! Recording from the radio is very, very, very good, not excellent though...but hey, I will still definately use this feature.    The ZEN box states *15,000* songs, the IPOD 30g states *7500* songs (the 60g IPOD states *15,000* songs) I am a little confused about this, you would think that both  the 30g IPOD and 30g ZEN would state the SAME.  The recorder is pretty darn good, I just purchased a digital recorder two days ago for $100. and now will return.  This is a valuable feature for all those college kids!  I am very excited to be able to record my classes, come home and burn onto CD's!!!!forget tapes, a thing of the past!!!!    Needless to say, I am tickled pink about this Zen M, and yeah, I probably woulda purchased the Pink one if it were available yesterday, but all they received were the black ones.  lol  I purchased the IPOD 30g for each of my 3 children for Christmas, my kids in turn surprised ME with one....having done my homework, cuz lets face it, kinda pricey toys....I read up on the Zen, customer service @ Creative informed me that it wouldn't be available in the US till 1-15, so I let all the kids make up their own mind, they of course couldn't wait...."I" however, being older and thus wiser, returned mine, and waited.....well worth the wait!!1!!

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Had this player for a few days.  Previously had the Zen Sleek.  This is a great model.  The screen is unbelievable and the navigation is very easy/clear.  They really did a nice job with the touch pad this time.  It has a great feel.  It also works flawlessly with Yahoo Music Unlimited.  My only complaint is that the buttons around the scroll pad are very, very stiff.  Perhaps this is unique to my player.  But it is a little annoying having to press down so hard.

<Title>I now own 2 Vision:M players
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had ordered one of the players as a gift for a family member, then realized how difficult it appeared to get them, so I ordered another from a second source.  I received the first unit as promised.  I immediately started loading this on it.  It's a little thicker than the iPod, but I actually like how it feels in my hand better (IMHO).  The screen is beautiful, the file formats that are supported are great, the integration with WMP10 and the on-line stores is certainly better than the iPod.  I just love it.  I loved it so much, that when the second unit arrived, I decided to keep it for myself :)  I have used iPod many times before and I do like them.  But they can coexist and the competition will make all the players better.  If you love the iPod's great.  Again, I like them too, but right now I would pick this player.  I have synched up CD music, on-line songs, even a bunch of my TiVo shows (via Tivo To Go TTG).  I have taken those shows and played them directly on my TV too (with an A/V cable).  The currently availability of accessories is a bit frustrating, but livable - I am sure it will not match or surpass the iPod in that respect.    Like the iPod and other devices like this the screen scratches pretty easily.  I immediately bought some Palm protectors and cut them to fit.  I have customer shields ordered (from theinvisibleshield.com) but this will do for now.  This FM radio works fine.  I personally like one integrated.  It doesn't take any more space and it's nice on rare occasion.  I have read other reviews that say having the FM radio is a "negative" of this player.  Huh?  Why?  If you don't want it, just don't use it.  There is a reason why this little player just won the overall best of the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).  Even my friends that have iPods snap their heads when they see this.  But again, this shouldn't be a religious discussion of iPods vs. non-iPods.  Buy what you like best and suits your use.    This one suits mine.  I am even thinking about buying a third one.  Why?  I don't want to share mine (or my wife's) with the kids LOL

<Title>Simply Amazing
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Zen Vision: M a few weeks ago.  I had first contemplated ordering an iPod, but simply hated itunes, and was skeptical about this.  My last mp3 player was a Zen Jukebox, but I found it to be a bit too bulky.  Right out of the box I had an easy time transferring all my files onto the player.  Putting videos was simple, and video conversion was not a hassle.  The screen is absolutely beautiful and it has impressive battery.  I actually prefer its controls to the ipods simple click wheel.  Instead of constant scrolling I can just use the letter listing menu on the side, search for a specific song, or hold down to scroll.  It feels good, small and sturdy, in your hand.  I especially like the recording and FM radio features, particularly useful for recording class lectures.  Overall this is a great product and simply amazing.

<Title>A great product for technophiles everywhere.
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Tired of all this Apple lifestyle propaganda?, sick of all these Apple's true believers with their childish zealotry?, then this gizmo is for you.   Creative hits the spot with multiple video format support but still no Ogg Vorbis format support for audio which according to recent conducted tests reigns in quality above all other formats and no support for free lossless audio formats like FLAC & Wavpack which absolutely rule in the audiophile world. Seems the industry doesn't want to support these superior audio formats because of their open/free and no drm'd nature.  Nevertheless,this product is the current King in its category,it simply ravishes Apple's Ipod line with more features/more value,i wont supply more info on this,just read the reviews in various dap sites.  The only flaw i find for this product is its clonish look with Ipod,but taking into account the momentum the Ipod has in consumers psychology it seems Creatives decision to drop an original interface and copy the Ipods is somewhat justified.  I believe Creative used Sigmatel's latest chip for this player,the STMP3600, but since this a new chip with lots of features/power it would be wise if you're not in the immediate need for owning a unit now to simply take patience because sooner or later more products with similar features and better price will appear in this highly competitive market

<Title>8 months, two dead Vision M's-don't buy this player!
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've now gone through my second Vision M. I loved it, still love it. I bought the first one in March, the player froze with a "hardware problem" that required replacement after 3 months. Happily, Amazon replaced it. I now have had the second one since the summer and yesterday that one died on me. It now won't sync despite changing cables, etc. And between fatal hardware problems, there were multiple episodes of freezing screens, need to reboot (and lose then subsequently re-download all my stuff) and general MP3 mischief. I don't use my player very often, I always took care of it, never dropped it, etc.  Now hoping to decide between the Vision W and the Zune, so if anyone has an opinion, would be helpful.

<Content>This is my second one. I also have a new 16mb flash player. I bought this one because of the capacity. But my first ones HDD died after 1 year , after the warranty was up. So if you buy one get the three year protection plan from Amazon. I believe Creative know about the HDD problem as it is very hard to buy a new one of these anymore even from Creative. Creative are cheaper and better than Apple, especially if you already have your music in MP3 format and do not need to but it.

<Content>This product is defective! It doesn't work and there's absolutely no guaranty process to take care of this. We bought this product in Dec 07 and after 1 month of using it very sporadically it froze! There was nothing we could do to get it back on. Took it to the store and got it replaced just fine. New unit froze in less than a month later! Store refuses to replace it and sent us to the manufacturer. Manufacturer doesn't provide a process to replace this piece of garbage! If you are in the market for something like this, pass on this garbage! You will be sorry if you don't. By the way, there's no way to take the battery out and reset it. You are out of options on this garbage! Please, please pass on this. Thanks for your patience. Good luck on your search!

<Content>Just figured I'd add my review here since most reviews happen shortly after someone buys the device. Unlike Ipods, which tend to have an average lifespam of 7 months, this player lasts and lasts and it still has better features and compatability than the brand new Ipod videos. Highly recommend it !!! Better sound than the Ipod, better features, compatible with any format and a pleasure to use.

<Content>I have had my Zen Vision M for over a year and a half now and have had no problems at all. The first couple of months I had it i had some problems with it freezing and I had to reset it a few times, but after I went to the website and downloaded the new firmware. I have not had any problems at all since. It has been dropped many times and there it still nothing wrong with it.(I use the leather case that buttons over) The screen display is stunningly clear. The controls are great after you figure out how exactly to use them. And its easy to install on your computer and add and remove files. I am glad I bought this over the Ipod.

<Title>The creative zen player is terrible and customer support is rude and unhelpful
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got a Creative Zen Vision: M about 6 months ago.  It worked ok, until I got a new computer.  I installed the software and immediately the player froze up and refused to work again.  After spending days trying to figure it out, I finally called the company, but it also took me forever to navigate the website.  I didn't buy the protection plan, but I thought they might still be able to help me.  I got an Indian guy on the phone who was really hard to understand and refused to help me unless I bought the plan for 12.99.  I know it isn't a lot but, I felt like it was a trick just to make more money.  Apple will help you no matter what.  I told the man that I was pretty disappointed in the product and he laughed at me! So, I emailed them and got NO help from that.  I tried to reinstall the software one more time and my windows XP crashed!  I am done with this player and company, its not worth it if it's going to mess up my new computer.  I'm just going to stick with Apple because at least they don't outsource their customer support employees to India.

<Title>Better to spend more for an ipod...
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I admit, I loved this player when I first received it. It had a beautiful display, was easy to use/configure, and was cheaper than Apple for the same amount of storage capacity. Unfortunately, that didn't last long, as a little over 3 months later my player completely died, lasting only a few weeks after my warranty expired. Doing a little research online, I found that this is a common complaint with most buyers of this model, and most of the other models Creative makes. I had a similar problem when I owned a Creative MUVo micro prior to this, but was easily able to fix it by going online and updating the firmware. No such luck with this one, after numerous e-mail exchanges I was told that I would have to send it back to be fixed at my own cost, minus the cost of parts(though it was THEIR fault the product was defective).   Researching further, I found that this was also a common response to the problem, replacing the unit for $25 only to have the same problem reoccur months later. So i decided not to deal with it, and opt to spend the extra money to buy an ipod instead which is much more reliable by far.

<Title>Mysterious Screen Problems
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The zen was great for the first six months or so, but then one night I set it down by my bed to charge. The next day the screen looked like someone had stepped on it. There were blank strips and inky looking splotches, and the once beautiful clear screen was crossed with horizontal white lines.   Now, it's *possible* that somehow someone stepped on it during the night, but I can't imagine how that would happen, as it was not in a place where your feet could go when getting in or out of bed. So, to all appearances, the screen suddenly just went crazy.   I can still use it, and the features still work the same, but the whole point was for it to play high quality video, and now it just looks like pixellated crap. Has anyone else experienced this?  Besides the mystery of the screen, there were some other annoyances. As some other users have mentioned, it is VITAL that you buy a wall charger. If you completely drain the battery on the Zen, your computer will not recognize it or charge it, so you can only charge it from a wall charger.  Often I would turn off the Zen in the middle of a track, and turn it on later to find myself in the middle of a completely different track. This also happens when you're listening to an audiobook, which means you have to make sure to bookmark every time you turn off the zen, or you will lose your place. This happens very frequently, and is more annoying than anything else. In random mode, if you want to go back to the track it just played, you can't. When you hit the "skip backward" side of the touchpad, it just goes to a completely different track, forcing you to hunt down the one you wanted manually.  The touchpad is either too sensitive, or skips over a track altogether, which just takes more time.  The zen itself is pretty bulky, and not very easy to stick in your pocket.  Also, there is a problem with freezing/crashing, which increases if you try to go jogging with it (the zen isn't meant for much jostling).  That said, I loved the clear colors on the screen (while it still worked!) and the shortcut buttons. It has a very easy and intuitive interface, and it allows you to drag and drop files as well as syncing them, which I like. You can also delete songs straight off the zen, which the iPod won't allow. I just wish they'd worked out the bugs before they marketed it! I'm torn. I've seen a lot of very bad reviews on the Zen's overall durability, but I don't like any other media players because they're not as easy as the Zen. Plus, the price has actually gone UP since I bought mine! A dilemma. Any suggestions?

<Title>Thoroughly Impressed
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In my opinion; Creative audio/video players are the best on the market in terms of value, performance, and features. These traits outweigh the aesthetic qualities of the ipod. What first impressed me with the Vision M was the quality of the screen; it is very bright, the abundance of colors is amazing and the backround customization is great. The navigation system is a little tedious at first, but it becomes a breeze after a little practice. The best thing I like about this player is the fact that it supports a large array of video/audio formats. I was able to transfer my video and music files easily.In regards to performance, the playback was perfect. I was able to watch a full length video and still have plenty of juice left to listen to music. The sound quality of the music was very impressive, (97 db SNR), add to the fact that you can use Custom EQ to tweak it to your liking. The only drawback with this device is the screeen scratches easily, but as one reviewer pointed out, you can use PDA screen protectors to preserve the screens finish.Other than this; the player is perfect. If you're looking for a product that will play your music and video files flawlessy and more, then this is the player for you. It is a better choice than the ipod and your dollars will go a lot furthur with this investment.

<Title>vision M is a winner
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got the Zen Vision M from Amazon last week.  This thing really blew me away.  The screen is beautiful, video quality is amazing.  Sound quality is second to none (with quality headphones - not the junk they throw in).  It is considerably thicker than the 30G ipod video, but it feels much more solid and is more comfortable to hold in your hand.  Battery life is great (charger included!)  You can drag and drop mp3, wma, avi, divx, almost any audio or video file you may have and this will play it (or use the included software if you prefer).  On a few occasions, it said the video file was not supported, but with the included video converter, you're in business.  The user interface is great, much better than ipod's in my opinion.  The vertical scroll button now has side to side scrolling (an improvment on the zen micro).  Other benefits are the FM radio and voice recorder.  I tried the voice recorder and the quality was excellent, no spinning hard drive noise.  My only concern is how easily the unit scratches.  If you get this PLEASE get a case.. mine already has some minor scratches even though I have been careful.  Enjoy!

<Content>I have always been with the war against Apple's plan to take over the mp3 industry.  This little gadget should get the rest of the publics attention.  Although the Ipod video is thinner the vision is quite worth the extra 30 bucks, besides who really cares about the extra width.    Pros: High Definition Screen, custom wallpaper, verticle touch pad and pressure buttons instead of all touch, sound quality is rediculous, removable disk option, radio, video output to tv, compatable with most video formats, Battery life is excellant, compatabilty most applications, durabilty.  Cons: lack of silly Ipod like accessories  so sell your Ipod and get this

Wow, very cool.......except.....being portable......am I going to plug it into.....the wall at Starbucks? 6. Doesn't use one software? Yeah, you got me there. It uses REAL, or Windows Media player, or Music Match. Yeah, some winners there. Maybe I can use Sony's software and totally mess up my computer as well? Not. 7. Microphone. I believe you can get a mic for the iPod if you really want it. But are you expecting the Creative to be good at recording sound? A little mono mic like that?  Do yourself a favor and get an iPod. Don't waste your money on this. The hype is true. Treat yourself to the best portable video/music player.

<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ipod has an over glorified market.  My sister went through 2 Ipods and dealt with Apple's tech support. She said they are garbage, and said their tech support is terrible.  She also said their battery life is terrible.  After a short period of use, she said she needed to replace the battery.  I have consulted with her and since then she bought a creative MP3 player and swears by it.  She has had no problems after 2 years of use.  Another person I know bought an Ipod and said the same thing about their tech support.  He said when he called them up, they placed him on hold and must have just walked away.  He sat there for 45 minutes waiting and nothing.  He finally got ahold of them and they told him he needed to fax his receipt in.  He tried it 5 times from numerous fax machines and got the same response that it was unreadable.  If he was on hold so long for tech support, it could only mean 2 things:  1. They are ignoring his call because they don't want to deal with him.  2.  They are loaded with other callers because their products are garbage.  You can do the math, but from both cases, I think I have made my decision.  CREATIVE ZEN IT IS!!!!

<Title>A Truly Unbiased review!  Very good portable media player
<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For those of you looking to read something with substance, here's a review from someone who actually owns both an Ipod and Zen Vision M and has used the Ipod Video.  I've been looking for a feature rich portable media player (PMP or PVP) and was about to jump on an Ipod Video when I saw the press release for the Vision M in December.  I already own a regular 4G ipod and loved it.  The clickwheel made using it so easy.  I borrowed a Video Ipod from a co-worker and was impressed with the video capabilities; however I really wanted something with FM radio and better video codec compability.  The early reviews of the Vision were fairly positive, but had a few bugs like video buffer issues and no on the go playlists, but both are now fixed via new firmware.  The clincher was CNET's awarding it the Best In Show at the 2006 CES.  For a reputable site to recommends this as best in show over the hundreds of other new devices says a lot.  Ok, on to the real review.....  I purchased the Black Vision M and the two things that stand out is the clean front layout and thickness.  It is about .7 inches thick so it's signficantly thicker than the Ipod.  Although I would prefer the slim shape of the Ipod, the thicker Vision M was fine as it still fits in my pocket comfortably and is quite snug in my hand.  The instructions require you to do two things first:   1) Update Quicktime if it's version 7.0 through 7.0.2 before installing Creative's software   2) Charge it up first using the AC adapter which only takes about 2 hours (great advantage over Ipod)  User Interface and Slide Touchpad: The software is pretty straight forward and so is using the menu system on the Vision M.  The slide touchpad takes a little getting used and I have to admit the Ipod clickwheel is much easier to use.  However, it does have its advantages.  You are able to very quickly scan though large song lists by holding down at the top or bottom of the touchpad.  Alternatively the user interface allows you to search alphabetically via song, albums, artists, and genre.  This is something I wish the Ipod had as going round and round on the clickwheel sometimes gets old if you're looking for something in particular.  The touchpad also doubles as a previous/next or rewind/fast forward button by pressing it the left or right respectively.  Additionally, there are four buttons located around the touchpad:  Play/Pause, Context Menu (Options), Back, and Custom Shortcut where you can set it to whatever you want (almost, you have a list of options).  These buttons light up in aqua blue which is nice for night time use.  Sound So how's the sound quality?  Very good!  The headset that comes with the Vision is slightly better than the average as they fit snug in your ear and have good response.  In my opinion, both the sound quality of the Ipod and Vision M are good, but the Vision M is slightly better.  Additionally you can enhance your listening experience with the built in preset or custom equalizer and bass boost options.  I only wish it saved more than one custom equalizer setting.  Be careful when using bass boost as doing this combined with boosting the low end using the equalizer may distort the sound.  Oh, did I mention you can bookmark your music so you can pick up where you last left off which is something the Ipod doesn't do.  Other info Radio:  Very very good.  your headphones is used as the antenna and the reception is very good.  You are able to preset up to 32 stations (including renaming them) manually or thought the auto seek option.  You also have a signal strength bar (similar to ones found on cellphones)  Video:  The player's codec supports DivX4/5, XviD5, MPEG-1/2/4SP, and WMV9 as well as Motion-JPEG.  The included software will convert your videos to the proper codec and resolution including cropping if you so desire.  My only complaint is the 4-6 seconds of wait time when you start playing, but since this is a hard drive based device, it's understandable.  Oh yeah, you can even password protect files from viewing.  Screen:  Excellent, the 2.5" screen is bright and the colors are vivid; it's capable of displaying up to 262,000 colors.  Easily better than the Ipod Video which I thought was good to begin with.    Pictures:  The viewer allows you to choose from specified folder and displays contents in a 5 x 4 format.  You then pick the one you want to see via touchpad and then you have the option of zooming in.   Again, colors are vivid and you can even get picture details (via context button).  Miscellaneous features:  Voice Recording, Custom Wallpaper, Sync your Outlook Calendar option, Button lock (disables the touchpad and buttons), song and picture rating, Play music while viewing pictures, Compatible with Windows Media Player 10, 6 hours of video battery life, Smart Playlists (higher rated songs play back more frequently I think), Smart Volume (Normalizes volume of all songs), Video Out, power saving options, and PlaysforSure compatibility.  Weakness: So what keeps me from giving this unit a 5 star rating?  An overly sensitive touchpad (should get better as I get more used to it), lack of accessories at this time, lack of a removable battery, lack of lyrics display support, can't do anything with it when docked to the PC, separate 3 in 1 dongle for USB, AC connectivity and Video Out.  Overall these are  fairly minor complaints.  In summary, if you just need a decent mp3 player with video and photo capabilities, then the Ipod is a fine choice.  For those searching for a more feature rich player, this is an excellent option.   This item is selling well and I hope that translates to more accessories for this wonderful player.  I have thoroughly enjoyed using this player and hope you find this review informative.

<Title>This is to balance out all the geniuses who don't even own this
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't own this unit either but some people are just ridiculous.  first things first, this unit has been out for only a month or so and doesn't have the benefit of rabid apple fanboyism so of COURSE there wouldn't be many reviews but even 37 various reviews of a unit is good enough info to know whether or not you'd like the Zen.  Saying "I'll trust 300 people rather than 37 people" and giving the Zen itself (what did the zen ever do to you to deserve that?) a low score is absolutely ridiculous and asinine.  second off, iTunes should NOT be seen as a plus for the iPod, rather it depends on the user. I like having complete control over my library and itunes is great for ripping and renaming/ID3 tag changing en masse but I HATE HATE HATE using it for my nano (it was a gift!). Some people love iTunes and that's their perogative.  Third, as for it's looks. GET OFF IT~!  Okay it's shaped like a box that's longer vertically, guess that bites off the iPod?  It has a 320 by 240 color screen, I guess that bites off the iPod? The interface has words listed vertically! JUST LIKE THE IPOD?! Whoa what a COMPLETE ripoff (sarcasm, oh btw didn't you know that creative has a patent on hierarchical menu systems before apple could?  Did the Firefox browser bite off of IE when they put the "back" and "forward" buttons on the upper left of their interfaces?  The only similarities fanboys are just driveling up is that it's a mono colored MP3 player, like an iPod but that's just silly; so if another MP3 player was one color, then it's biting off the iPod?  As for it's features..  1) Radio - I'll listen to it to find new musical content/bands to enjoy plus at times I just actually might get bored of my 20GB collection. Also you have to pay 30 dollars extra and bulk up your iPod to add radio to it.  2) Interface - I'll give yah this one. Creatives interface is pretty intuitive but the click wheel is a darn nice idea apple has. Still, it's not impossible for a normal person to use this unit.  3) Battery life - A person below me scoffed at the Zen having better battery life. Wow that's ridiculous. who WOULDN'T want longer battery life? In a practicality sense, more bettery life == using the unit more OR charging the unit less == longer battery life in the long run. Remember that Lithium Ion batteries have limited charges so charging it less extends the life.  The battery life is the same as the iPod however, except with Video (4 hours-ish for Zen).  4) Color Variation - I'm pining for the green one. If the iPod's have color variation, people would be flocking for them too.. oh WAIT! Why do I see so many females with pink and green iPod mini's still? ridiculous argument yet again. Choice (In this case, color of the Zen) is a good thing.  5) AC - My buddy lugs his power adapter (30 bucks extra from good ol' apple) around for his iPod. He doesn't mind and he charges it quite often actually.  6) Software - You don't have to use any but yet again this is up to the consumer. Some people like iTunes so that would suck if they used the Zen but I personally hate iTunes so it'd be good for me :).  7) Microphone - Usable in class lectures. Also people have actually SAID the sound quality from recording was good, instead of this person CLAIMING it would be bad.  Stupid arguments by Fanboys, it's quite pitiful. I say get whatever you want, iPod's ARE fine players but the people backing them can be pretty dumb.  It's all up to you! BTW Once I save up, I AM getting this but that's just me!

<Title>Review of Reviews. (silly but maybe a hint)
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think it would be a bit redundant at this point to review my vision m extensively, given the hundreds of others. I have had my Zen for about a year with zero problems. No freeze ups, no blackouts, none of that.   Going over the negative reviews I would like to say this much:    I saw a ton of customers (and a lot IPOD biases) who rated the product One Star simply because one malfunction which was more from their own part. For example, the oversensitive touch pad touch pad can be set a LOWER sensitivity level. I did find the pad a little difficult on the default level, so I set it lower. (I fixed this within the first week).  On the reviews were there was no fault to buyer, like receiving a bugged Creative, I can only say that "it happens". My brother received a dead IPOD-everything was replaced except for the case- and had to wait a few months to get a "fixed" one (same brand). This new fixed one had to be sent back again, because of bugs. This is just a universal mp3 problem.   HOWEVER; I do agree that Creative support is worth no time, and luckily I haven't had to test this theory. This is my first mp3 and I will probably get another creative. If my creative dies within the next year, months even, I'm fine to just buy a new product. (Considering my creative has outlasted numerous of my friends' IPODs I'm very happy with it.)

<Content>The battery could not be recharged after sitting off for 30 days. The online support pages were not helpful, and it was impossible to contact a person for technical help. Thanks for some kind people at a Creative forum I tried all the tricks and finally gave up. I won't buy another Creative product. I am now in the market for a new mp3 player.

<Title>Great MP3 but not without flaws
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had my 30 gb zen for just over a year. I received it as a gift and have been very satisfied with it. The sound quality is great if you replace the worthless headphones the player comes with. The picture quality is good too. I love that I could set the background as a picture when the iPods weren't capable of that. The program it comes with is really user-friendly. Drag and drop, could it be easier? There is a large selection of free "zen-casts" as well, several to which i am subscribed. My main problems with this player are the heftiness of it: its thick, large compared to the new ipods and other mp3 players; and the fact that sometimes it freezes, and the only way to fix it is to stick a paperclip into the in-set reset button. This doesn't damage the player or the content in anyway, it's just irritating.   I'd really rather give it 3.5 stars. Overall, a really great player with flaws. For the price, I'd opt an iPod.

<Title>Creative Zen and NetLibrary
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Creative Zen Vision:M is quite acceptable for my purposes. I download Netlibrary books. You have to download the ZNVM_PCPatch_LA.exe to work with Window Media Player 11. You cannot download "Radio Quality" wma audio books to the Zen.  You must select "CD Quality" 32 kbps stereo books from Netlibrary. If your Zen unit does not charge, make sure you are plugged into a direct USB port (my expanded USB 2.0 card would not allow it to charge). My unit shuts down when charging (can't listen while charging). There are several updates.

<Title>Decent Player, rip-off service
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Zen Vision M for 18 months now, and I am really pleased with the video quality and the ease of use. Sound quality is good too, and I like being able to hook that badboy up to tv when I travel so I can watch movies I've put on it.  Now the bad news - at least once every six weeks or so it freezes up and I have to reboot it. This sucks, since to reboot you have to wait awhile if you have lots of stuff on your player, and you need to find a needle (nothing else will fit) to reach into the tiny hole to trigger the reboot. This can be a real headache when you are riding on the subway or just sitting in a coffee shop somewhere, unless of course you carry around safety pins. Sometimes the reboots happen more frequently, but never more than twice a month. Still, that's kinda lame that its happening at all.  The worst thing about the Zen is the customer service - I dropped mine and the casing that covers the recharge jack came aloose, so I wrote to Creative to ask how much new casing would cost. $200 is what they quoted me (1/15/08)to install a new case!!!! Mind you, you can find a new player for cheaper than that on amazon. Now, there is nothing wrong with the player itself and I didn't want anything else done, just the casing replaced. The guy who wrote me back was even apologetic about the price, which tells me that the management is just out to squeeze every $ they can out of loyal customers, common sense be damned.  I sold my Ipod to buy a zen because I don't care for Apple's customer service, now Creative turns out to be much the same. I'd suggest that you either pony up for the extended 2 year warranty OR buy from a company that doesn't try to bleed you dry for what should be a minor repair. Between the freezing up and the exorbitant costs, I'd say look elsewhere.  Edit: Sorry, just looked online, since the Zen Vision M is no longer being sold at Fry's, Best Buy OR Circuit City, the price is an incredible $370 new!!!! I paid $323 new (at Fry's) for mine 18 months ago. I guess amazon makes a killing selling 2 a week (or month) but Creative seems to be really doing poorly if this is the best they can do in terms of marketing strategy.   Funnily enough, less than 2 months ago you could still find the M-30 online new for about $200 or so, but I guess this was before Fry's, BestBuy, etc stopped carrying it.

<Title>Almost perfect
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ownership time: 1 month, refurbished player  Sharp screen, good clarity, brightness (even at 50%) and color quality.  I owned an older Zen Touch MP3 player and upgraded to this Zen and am not disappointed at all.  The best thing is that they cleaned up the touchy sensitivity of the touch bar from older versions.  Older Zen users might recall frustration trying to make the scroll bar settle on exactly the file you wanted to play.  The Zen Vision lets you either scroll with the touch bar or tap the ends of the bar to advance one line on each screen.    The interface has been made to operate more like an iPod, which I like.  The Random button has been replaced by a Today's Favorite button that does the same thing.  One thing I did like about older versions of the Zen that isn't in the newer one is that when you chose to play any song, whether randomly or by browsing to it, you could immediately call up the other songs on the album by moving the touch bar.  On the Vision this now increases and decreses volume, and if you hit the Back button you are taken to the main front screen instead of the album song list.    One other thing - the player supports limited video formats, mostly vanilla AVI, WMV and MPEG.  I have often found that Creative's built-in video converter will offer to convert an incompatible video type when you try to move the video file on to the player, but often times it goes through the whole process only to give you an error message that the file it just converted to wmv is not compatible with the player (???).  It doesn't happen all the time, only with certain video files.  Those nitpicks aside, if you have alternate means of converting video it's not really a problem.  Overall this is a pretty feature-packed player for the price and I don't regret my purchase one bit.

<Title>ipod beater
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Some people are giving reviews going on about how the ipod is so much better than this music/video player. Personnaly i think they are wrong. The colour variation is a very good idea and you do not have to spend more money on buying differnt colour skins for an ipod. I also think that it is good that you can use different kind of players to put your music on this player other than just itunes. Another thing is that i have known so many people whos ipods have broken and as another reviewer said the tech support is awful. I have this player and i have had no problems with it and i think it is great. Do not get drawn in by the hype of an ipod.

<Title>Wow!  iPod on steroids!!
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I returned a Nano to buy the Zen (Amazon slowest refunds ever@#!)  But, the Zen is miraculous!  iPod should be very scared.  You can put music to slide shows (very simple process), change show transition types and speed (display on a TV is razor sharp-videos too).  FM reception is VERY good (blows my Sony hifi component tuner away, way away), battery life excellent.  NOT EASY controls and video settings, etc. at first--they took a bit to figure out since the manual was so sparse, but once you know how to use, controls are superb (the volume etc are very intuitive).  The hole Zen operation is near identical to a laptop touch pad with tapping, then you get audible confirmation with each selection.  For example, volume up, simply slide finger up.  The music sounds great, the unit looks sharp, and the functions are seemingly endless. Zen is not just a fancy CD player as iPod really is, and it comes with everything you need.  With iPod most will want a charger, maybe an FM adapter, blah, blah, blah.  All pricey, all bulky and all included with Zen.  Absolutely the right choice for me, I won't own another iPod.  BTW, bought theinvisibleshield.com's translucent protective covering ($15) for my Zen, a pain to apply correctly, but it is indestructible and clear as a bell when you get it right--forget the need of any type of case, etc. once applied.

<Title>I love it!!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a 30GB iPod for my daughter and the Zen Vison:M for me. She has about 60 new songs and 10 videos for a total cost of $80.  I have over 2000 new songs(and more each day) for $15/month. They are both great products. But is comes down to what you can afford in the long run. As far as my Zen. I love it and know that I made a great choice. I have waited 2 years for a product like this. I love the FM radio and use it everyday to catch the news weather,traffic,interviews,sermons,ect. I can also record them a play them for others or future reference.  By the way, my daughter with the iPod, she wants to sell hers and buy a Zen Vision:M just so she can have more music. It also has voice recording that sounds great. I use it for song writing,lectures and meetings. I also love the calander and event planner. Another great feature is the ability to change the screen backgroud to personalize it. I find it very easy to navigate with one hand just using my thumb. I can even navigate it while running 7.5 mph on a threadmill, but do not try that at home kids. This is a great product and would recomend the ZEN to anyone. just remember: Even if you can afford to spend $1/song and be traped to iTunes only, I would still recommend the Zen just for the extra features,longer bat.life,and more color for video.  I have Napster to Go. It works great. I also have bought music from Yahoo and Walmart. Try that with an iPod.  Make sure you have a modern day computer: XP,USB 2.0  I see neg.rev. from people who should have bought a new computer and not an MP3 player who are complaining they can not use windows 98.   By the way, my daughter with the iPod wants to sell it and buy the Zen Vision:M so she can have more music to listen to.

<Content>I've spent alot of time on Amazon reading reviews on this product. I couldn't help but to notice that everyone who is loyal to Ipod gave this product one star. Most of these reviews are being written by people who have never even touched the vision m. People who don't want to believe that there is a product out there better then the ipod, like this one, are just bringing the rating down. Anyone who is interested in this product can visit Cnet.com they review hundreads of mp3 players a year and they're not bias to one company. This product is rated better than the ipod in more than one category on that site.

<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I have ever had. I did extensive reviews before buying the new Vision:M and it is without a doubt one awsome all-in-one device. I now have several thousand photos and several thousand songs, as well as 5gb partitioned for data storage (you can choose between 512kb and 16gb for storage...awsome)...and still have tons of storage left. I also synched my Outlook contacts and calendar for added convenience. I have used the new Zencast to download video and podcasts, all with no trouble. I love how I can make any one of my photos the theme, and change how the image looks (color, black and white, sepia, etc.)...really cool feature. You can also listen to music while looking at photos. Neat.  Using it as a hard drive is super easy, and you don't need Creative's software to move data like some suggest, although you can use it if you choose.  Adding music is very easy with both the Creative software and Media Player 10, with no problems at all.  I have had no problems, no freezing and no skipping. The screen's clearity is amazingly bright and clear. I had a Zen Sleek before I bought this player, so I'm used to the touch pad which I really like. It is a little thick, which I wasn't sure I'd like. But, it actually feels solid and well built.  I have not owned an iPod and wouldn't want one after owning the Vsion:M.  The new Zen Vision:M is everything I was hoping it would be, and more.  Thanks Creative!!  And....how about laying off the adds in the review area? All it does is skew the ratings, giving false impressions of products.

<Title>Finally Settled!
<Date>Fri Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been buying mp3 players for over a year. With each one I buy, I planned on keeping it if I was happy. After 6 mp3 players, I've finally settled. I've been through an Creative Zen Micro, iRiver H10, Philips PSA612, Toshiba Gigabeat F40, and have returned all of them for various reasons. This Creative Zen Vision:M is a keeper!  The screen is absolutely gorgeous. My friends at work who have an iPod video say theirs are better... until they see the screen, and then their mouths just drop.   Another advantage is the compatability. You're not going to be stuck to some format like Apple who will trap you further and further into their money making traps, but with this, you're set free! Mp3, WMA, Divx, xVid, WMV, mp4... your options are wide open!   The touchpad takes a little time to get used to, but it's well worth the effort. Face it, when a person first uses a mouse, it's awkward, but it's extremely easy to everyone now. It just takes some time.   The dongle is a little annoying as you have to use it to transfer music or to charge up. I wish it would just charge and trasfer over a regular USB cord, but Apple doesn't have that either.

<Title>Creative > Apple
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Introduction I don't see what the big deal about iPods are. Especially when you have a product this much better. Yeah, there's people who say they just copied the iPod, but it's really not possible. Creative only had five months to see the iPod design, create their own item using that design, write software, throw parts into it, and market it. Not possible.  vs. iPod I don't have anything against the iPod. It has a really great design, and it's easy to navigate with no experience. The Zen Vision is a bit clunky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it works great. No actual buttons to press, just tap the touchpad to make your selection. It's probably just as easy to use as the iPod, plus as others have stated, that's less buttons to wear out.  Another thing I think this player has over the iPod is that there is no real need for extra software. Right out of the box, I plugged into my Windows XP computer and I could start putting music on it immediately. I don't need the eyesore that is iTunes to put music on my device. One problem I did have though was dragging and dropping XviD and DivX movies into my player. I got a warning that said the file type is not supported, but when I used the software that came with my player (very clean and easy interface, by the way), it worked fine.  Features After having this device for about a week, I really can't think of anything else I could want. Of course, maybe wireless and a camera, but they're not very realistic wants. It plays pretty much every video I throw at it (MPEG, XviD, DivX 4 & 5, Motion JPEG, Windows Media Video 9), besides QuickTime and Real Media. It also does not have OGG or ACC support, but I think MP3 and WMA is plenty good enough. The screen is 2.5" and supports 262,144 colors. That's way better than any iPod video. It also has a Video output, so I can hook it up to my plasma screen at home and watch the episodes of The Office that I downloaded.  Customization Oh Lord, is it customizable. It has six different themes to choose from, all look very nice depending on your taste in color. Maybe you will be able to import more in the future? You can set a custom display background as well.  Also, the menu system is customizable. For example, if you want to remove the Radio, Microphone, and Picture items, it takes about four seconds. The only option you are required to have is System. I thought this was a very nice feature.  As you browse your media, you can also change the way it's viewed. For example, when viewing a particular artist, you may choose to view by album art, album title, or by tracks. This is consistent throughout the player for different types of media.  Pros - Supports many video and audio codecs. - FM tuner - Voice recorder (You can also record FM streams) - EXTREMELY customizable - Plug-and-Play setup - Video Output  Cons - No support for QuickTime and RealMedia - No Ogg or ACC support - Included headset is terrible - Desktop Dock sold separately  Conclusion All in all, this player really beats the iPod on all levels. That's just my opinion. I would rate it 6/5 if i could. Buy this player.

<Title>I am listening to it right now
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Some would hallow the capabilities and the algorithms written for the iPod, yet they fail to notice the fact that Creative has been making sound cards for a LONG time.  They started making mp3 players even before apple and are now in the process of litigation/a lawsuit against apple for intellectual property infringement of Creative's interface.  Before you attempt to act affronted if you are an apple ogre, do some research.  Creative obtained the patent roughly two months before Apple did on the same design firmware OS.    In addition to that...phew-- Creative has two times the battery life (2hrs v. 4 hrs.), supports a plethora more file types ( and there is no *sound* reason to favor apple's format over others, it actually is less desireable because of sheer device compliance restrictions).  In addition to that, for people who have Tivo on their computer or in the standard format, the Creative accepts Tivo on the Go ( whatever that is), but for me, the video capabilities of this player allow me to circumvent approximately 2 hrs. of conversion for every hour of video that I wish to put on my player.  Apple also has no advantage with firewire (1394b) b/c both Creative and the new Apple video use USB 2.0.  Also, the AC charger is included with the player (a $30 charge from apple, that's the price diff right there).  The screen displays roughly 200,000 more colors than the apple and the interface is something you will get past in about 1 week.  I like it better than the wheel almost now.  With all of the advantages that I just listed, if you still want to buy an Apple iPod, I wish you good luck with your future endeavors in cosmetology.

<Title>I gave it a chance, and I switched back to the iPod!
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After owning an iPod for three years, I decided to "think outside the box" and get this video player from Creative Zen.  To say I was disappointed would be a severe understatement.  I was angry, confused, and frustrated.  Playing music shouldn't be this cumbersome.  The menus were hard to read, the controls are hard to follow, and the sound quality left much to be desired.  Plus, many of my favorite songs I got from iTunes can't be played on Zen.  Thankfully, I returned it and got a more updated iPod.  The Apple iPod is the standard-bearer of digital music, and I'll never switch to another player ever again.

<Title>Amazing Player....So happy I got rid of the Ipods
<Date>Wed Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't feel like writing a long review b/c most of the great points of this player have already been pointed out. Got mine the other day. Just want to say my part that this unit lives up to all the hype it's getting. I've owned a few Ipods and I must say in terms of build quality, features, sound quality & battery life this Creative model blows them away. I can't believe how nice the movies look on this thing. I also find the slider on this system to work better than the circular wheel on the ipods. If your thinking of getting one just go for it, you won't be sorry.

<Title>Started out great...
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>... but after a few months the player developed charging and connection problems. No matter how I tried plugging the device in (AC or USB), the battery would not take any charge. As for the connection issues, I tried reinstalling the software but the player just would never register on either of my computers. I visited Creative's web site for help (these are common issues for them), but their solutions could not fix the problem. Out of warranty repairs would have cost almost as much as a new mp3 player. So thats what I ended up doing. My Ipod is working great so far.

<Title>An all-around Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After getting my kids ipods and an iRiver device, it was time dad took the plunge himself. Since I naturally have a much larger cd collection than the kids, I wanted something with a lot of storage space. I had read many favorable reviews on the Creative Zen: Vision M and so I bought the 30GB model.   After 9 mos with this device, I can say I am 100% satisfied. It is stable, the screen is really nice, and the sound quality superb. I have found the battery life to be VERY good, too.   Once you master the touch controls, you can navigate with significant speed. I would recommend that you adjust the touch sensitivity to your unique touch - but wait 'till you've used it awhile. It takes some time to have it feel second nature.    I have loaded over 200 CD's on my Zen (over 2,100 songs) and I still have 75% of the ZEN's 30GB capacity left!! Amazing.   I also love the large screen and how it displays the album art so clearly.     My only complaint: I found the Creative software that came with the Zen to be clunky and didn't work well. After wrestling with it for months, I bagged it and now I only use Windows Media Player - which works perfectly.   My kids complain about their iPod not loading 100% of the album art (it still amazes me that Apple can't get that right). Not so with the Zen. 100% of the album art loads (in fairness, and as a side note, the iRiver also does an excellent job with album art).    I highly recommend the Zen. If you want to carry around the soundtrack to your life - literally hundreds upon hundreds of records/cd's, this is the tool.

<Title>Don't buy the Zen Vision M
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you do a little homework by searching the various forums where this device is discussed, you'll learn that if the unit works at all, it won't work for long. It will cease to charge it's battery, and it's unlikely that you will ever get the problem resolved.  Creative tech support is less than worthless! When mine stopped charging, I e-mailed Creative tech support. After a couple of days, I actually received a response... telling me to make sure it was fully charged.  GRRR!!! I will NEVER EVER buy another Creative product.

<Title>A good iPod alternative
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got this player a couple of months ago as a birthday present. I had an iPod previously, but I despised the bloated nature of iTunes and the annoying limitations of the types of files that it could use.  First, the good points:  - The player has a great display, one of the best I've ever seen on a handheld player. Much better quality than anything turned out by Apple so far, my copy of 300 looks brilliant on it.  - Supports quite a few more formats. Avi. files were my main target.  - Great sound quality.  - Tons of space. I was really surprised how much I fit on here. I managed my entire music collection and several seasons of MST3K as well.  - The FM receiver is pretty handy when you'd like to get news or a weather forecast.  Now, the negatives:  - This player has a tendency to lock up if you are impatient in letting it load a song/video. If this happens, the player won't even let you turn  it off. You're stuck either having to hit the reset button (more on that later) or waiting for the battery to die. Either way, it's irritating when it happens.  - The reset button is unnecessarily difficult to push. Even a pen or pencil won't do it, you practically have to get a paperclip or needle.  - The touch pad, even on it's least sensitive setting, is still too inaccurate to compete with the clickwheel.  Despite these problems, it makes a solid alternative choice to the iPod if you're looking for a player with better video quality.

<Title>Somewhat good
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player in May of this year, and it has now just out of the blue started locking up on me. It includes an internal reformatting, and resetting function, which is good, but I guess I just got a bad player, because it locks up on this function as well. It's been good for the time I've used it. I've watched movies on it during flights, and I've continuously used it to listen to my favorite music while I travel, but now it's caput.  I just can't believe that after only 7 months I now have to look for a new player, and now the price is higher than when I bought it. I have to get rid of this thing, and it's beyond the returns policy.  I'm now leaning towards a zune. I just can't spend more money on a player that I already had that broke down on me after less than a year.  I'm very upset.

<Title>Horrid Repair Policy - Read  before considering a purchase
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the features of the Zen:M.  I have owned 3, but this will be my last.  The first one I bought had to be returned twice for problems with the headphone connector.  Recently the 30 GB version I own lost it's FM ability. So when I call they inform me the only service they offer for those of us who are out of warranty is to replace the unit ($249!).  So my issue is that I have owned 4 Creative devices, all but one eventually failed (within 2 years).  I can only guess that Creative has also seen the failure rate and has decided to bailed on supporting a faulty product.

<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just got one of these and was very impressed.  Not as small as some of the new players, but small enough to do the job and go anywhere.  Size is about the same as a deck of cards.  Software which comes with it is a bit tough to get used to.  I like iTunes better.  But so far, so good.  Pretty easy to add stuff to the player.  Video looks great.  If I had to do it again, I'd get an iPod, but this is a solid machine with great sound and video.

<Title>Great Alternative to those others....
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Music is such a huge part of our lives.  No wonder Ipod has such a large sales base and following.  But I am not a follower...I was looking for an alternative to the Ipods and the Zunes.  My son had a Creative player for several years before it died tragically in a glass of water on his desk (don't ask).  When it came time to replace it, he only wanted another one.  Then my husband wanted one.  Then I bought one. And this Christmas, my oldest is getting one for a present.  We all have the same one- and all like it tremendously.  It takes a bit of time to get used to all the features and to even find them.  But once you are up and running you will enjoy hours and hours of music, videos, pictures....  You won't go wrong buying this one.  Even if it isn't one of the more well known.

<Content>I have owned two, first shut down after 2 or so months, had it replaced because of serious problems in the hard drive, and misplaced my second around here somewhere.  Considered getting a third, but I'm quickly reminded of my frustrations with the first Vision:M.  I know it's too much of  an investment again on my end for a device that may or may not be working in the next 3 months.  Easy to navigate (dummy-proof Windows format), with tons of space, great clarity, colors and all the works...if it decides to work when you're ready to use it.  Look elsewhere for all these features BUT with a more stable hard drive.

<Title>Geek Approved, you should consider getting it!
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best portable media player out as of yet.  Here's why you should get this instead of an ipod...  Ipod is all about restricting you.  You must download all songs/vids from ONE computer, and cannot transfer them to another, and it is format specific... It must be in apple format... BOO.  I have 3 pc's, and I sometimes move songs from my laptop to a desktop... NO RESTRICTIONS WITH CREATIVE.  It caters to more files, and doesn't try to play 'big brother' and be your conscience by limiting what you can and cannot download and transfer between the unit and your other pcs.  So, it has the speed, look and feel of an ipod, is compatable with more file types for both audio and video, and it won't try to be your moral guide by limiting what you can transfer and what type of file.  Enjoy!

<Title>Way Beyond Pleased
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned my Zen Vision:M for just over a month now and I figured that I am finally accustomed enough with my wonderful device to write a review.  I'll try to focus on personal experience as many others have commented on details and specs.    First of all, while it is a bit thicker than an ipod, it fits very nicely in your hand (its pretty close to the size of a deck of cards).  The screen is brilliant; much brighter and more vibrant than my girlfriends ipod and the sound quality is well above average. Pictures looked excellent, especially with the zoom function and movies were of very good quality as well considering the 2 1/2 inch screen.  It was very easy to adjust to the controls and buttons of the player. Everything is very intuitive and the vertical touchpad is very easy to use.  After a day of use I had next to no instances where I would accidentally hit a button.  If you ask me, the vertical bar makes much more since than the ipod (after all, you are going up and down in menus, why run around in circles?).  Getting music on to the player was a breeze.  I had about 2000 songs (mp3 and wma format) on my computer when I got my Zen and it took about 15 minutes to copy all of the songs to it.  As for my new cds and such, I like the ability to use any ripping device on the computer.  I've become a fan of Windows Media Player but I suppose that's a personal choice.   As a student, the removable disk aspect of the Zen is major plus.  I have all of my school papers, projects, web sites and such stored on it to access any time I need them.  My ipod owning classmates gave me the "I wish mine would do that" approach. Also I was pleased with the ability to be able to create playlists directly on the player without having to use a computer.  The radio feature is very good, providing reception equivalent to my car in most cases (I guess this could be seen as a novelty to some, but I have a morning show that I am strongly attached to and now I can listen to it from anywhere.)  My only complaint about the Zen is the lack of 3rd party products available.  However, I purchased a set of pc speakers for it and the included ac adapter makes the stereotypical ipod sound dock obsolete.  I also protected the screen with pda screen protecters from Best Buy (while not nearly as bad as the ipod, it still succumbs to minor scratches). The included case is decent for protecting it yet it is admittedly ugly and there is sadly an absence of alternatives.  Overall, I would -strongly- recommend the Creative Zen Vision:M to anyone who asked.  The ease of use is incredible and the features blow the ipod out of the water.  If you have all of your songs on itunes I would recommend sticking with ipod, but if your new to the market or have songs on your pc this is the way to go.  Fantastic product.

The Creative Toolbox software is okay but I converted my shows to DivX using Gordian Knot and then copy them over. Those have a fantastic picture and sound.   People in the IT dept at work were drooling. :-)  Some have complained that the touch controls are too sensitive. You can change that setting by navigating to System/Player Settings/Touch pad and setting the sensitivity to low.  I would STRONGLY advise buying a cover or case for this. Like the Ipod, it scratches easily and no matter how clean your hands are, you'll see fingerprints.

From just pure reading, everything sounded better than the ipod, especially its video capabilities.  From using this thing, I can honestly say it is the IPOD KILLER!  My friends even say so, and they own ipods.  If you're looking for the best mp3 player, go with the ZEN VISION M!  You won't be disappointed.

<Title>Nice, but a bit disappointed
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I checked every single day on Amazon.com and on Creative's web site to see when this product was available, and when I saw it was out, I bought it right away without any hesitation.  I really didn't care about the price.  I had done a lot of reading regarding this product and it seemed like a good buy to me.    I received it and was so excited.  I still am happy about it.  You read about all the features, so I won't even get into it.  I really like this device, but I was a bit disappointed because of the following:  1.  It scratches very, very easily.  I take such good care of it, and still it got a ton of tiny scratches in just about a month's time. This is exactly the reason I didn't get the ipod Video because I read that it scratches easily.   2. The battery life is not as good as advertised.  You'll have to put the brightness to the lowest, which is 10%, and just let the music play without changing the songs or using any other features of the player, before you can probably attain the 14 hours or so that they claim you can get out of the player.  Every time you operate the player, like touching the scroll or other buttons, the screen becomes a bit brighter and uses some extra energy.  In other words, when they say 14 hours, they really mean that you'll have to put the player on 10% brightness (which is not good for viewing pictures), and just leave the songs to play and not touch anything else, otherwise it will be more like 8-10 hours or so of battery life.  I took a flight from Paris to New York recently and the flight time was roughly 8 hours long.  I had the player on all throughout the flight except for takeoff and landing.  I had it at 10% brightness and I did changed songs and operate the player a bit, and right as we were about to land the battery went dead.  So you decide.     3.  I don't know if it's me, but the earphones just keeps falling out of my ears.  Well this is not a major issue, but I just think for a product that's $330, it should come with better earphones.    4.  The software that came with it is not the most user-friendly.  I just think that they could have made it easier.  It came with two different methods, one supposedly for the beginners and one for a more seasoned user, but even the beginners version is kind of complicated to me.  The process is just too slow, you have to click on each item you want to put into the player and then click "add"..., so if you have 400 songs and 400 pictures that you want to add to your player, you'll have to do this process 800 times.  I really didn't see anything like "select all" or "add the following" or something like that, you just have to do them individually.  That sucks.  If anyone knows of an easier way let me know!  5.  I was not able to get about 30% of my music and video clips into my player because of licencing errors or the file type was not compatible with this player.  I thought that quite a number of file types could be used without a problem... I really don't understand this part, all I know is that I just have a lot of songs that I can't even get into my player.    6.  They advertised that I can use Yahoo Music Unlimited or Napster with this player... I subscribed to both and found it very difficult to use when I used the "to go" versions from both of these companies.  The "to go" is that the music comes directly from these companies sites into the player and you don't have to pay for each songs.  I thought it was a cleaver idea.  It just didn't work at all using Yahoo To Go, and Napster To Go worked, it's just that each song took well over 10 minutes to be transferred into my player.  I called up Napster only to be told that this Creative Zen Vision:M device that I have is not compatible with Napster To Go.  Duh, so why did Creative and Amazon say it is?    So I gave the negatives about this player... but to be fair, there are probably twice as many good things about this player which I'm not going to name them all.  Some of the good things are: it has a huge capacity for quite a number of songs and pictures, it has voice recorder, it's gorgeous looking, very bright screen when you put it to 100% brightness, FM radio which you can record from and save it on your player, decent size... it's not too big and not too small... it's definitely bigger then the ipod video, but I like the feel of it, once you get used to it, the buttons and scroll is pretty simply to operate, the sound quality is great and there are 25 levels to choose from... and the list goes on.   Overall I gave it a 4.  I guess I am disappointed a bit because I had my hopes up way to high and anticipated this player for way too long.  Please e-mail me and let me know if you know of any fixes for the negatives I listed.  I will really appreciate it.  SilentSound2006@aol.com

<Title>Nice player, but won't play M4V files
<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player mostly for the video feature.  The screen is very clear and the radio and audio quality are very good.  I was, however, very disappointed to find it won't play or even convert M4V (Quicktime) formatted files.  This file format is commonly found on ITunes (large selection) and is available from Creative's own Zencast service.  The Creative software that came with the player will convert different file formats, but not M4V.  Creative's recommended solution is for the user to buy 3rd party software (additional cost) and convert it (time consuming) before loading it to the Zen Vision:M.

<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the player for a  few weeks now and have used all the features available.  I would like to address some of the reviews I have read.  The battery is outstanding, if you condition the battery you will have no problems, please, please use the player until it dies and then recharge it try to do this at least 4 times when you first start using the player and it will work fine.  I use the player on my way to work ( I watch an episode of Family Guy) and listen to my mp3's and the radio all day and then on the way home.  I get at least 10-11 hours a day of battery life.  The screen is great the color is outstanding , the sound is as any Creative player,simply amazing and the custom EQ feature is a big plus. Radio frequency comes in very clear with little interference and I work in NYC midtown with lots of tall buildings. It's not as big as some users make it seem , it's actually the same thickness of my 4th Gen. 40 gig  Ipod but a tad wider due to the screen size but it's not cumbersome , agian it's the same size as the 40 gig 4th Gen. Ipod. and I see tons of people with those and no one complaining of arm fituge from holding the player.  All in all it's a great little package, since I got my Zen a few co-workers have put there Pod's on Ebay and are getting the Zen , more bang for your buck with 1 simple piece of equipment.  I have a case and screen protector that I purchased from www.i-nique.com that works like a gem.  I am very happy with this player

<Title>Best Alternative to iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Vision:M last close to a year ago and I have been nothing but pleased with it.  It can be diffucult to use if you are accustomed to the iPod user face, but after a while it becomes easeir to use than the iPod.  It has many functions aside from playing music, including video, photo, a built in microphone recorder, and FM radio (which you can record music off of to add to your personal MP3 library) and a shortcut button that you can program to take you to numerous places in the menu automatically.  All of these are very easy to use and gives me very little grief.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought it, coming from a brand not as well known as iPod, but I knew I made the right choice buying it right off.  In about 10 months it has frozen once, and with the reset button and the back of an earring, it's like it never even happened.  It has never been the source of any problems for me and has done its job, playing music, very dependably.  Even if the fact it is a sturdy well made MP3 player isn't enough for you, it is also very easy to customize.  It has 6 different color schemes(the color the font and selection bar are) and you can easily format any photo in your library to be the wallpaper on your MP3.  I have pretty much nothing bad to say about it.  It always functions and has a long battery life, unless you watch several hours of video.  My mother and my sister both have other Creative Lab MP3 players that are also really awesome, so even if this isn't what you want, but you don't want an iPod, chances are you can find something good from Creative.

I've used a couple of other brand players (including IPOD) and I like the Creative ones best.

<Content>This has to be one of the greatist products ever 30 Gb. in the palm of your hand. I was dibating between M the the Ipod but after i talk to my friend about his I pod which had mysterusly exploted (no kiding). When i head that i had no more respect for apple and all of there items. NEVER BUY A VIDEO I-POD EVER. I'm never buying any apple thing forever. I hope people will take my advise.

<Title>Great concept, great player... when it works
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the Creative Zen for the basic concept.  You know, the idea that if you buy music you should be able to use it as you see fit.  A concept that has for some reason eluded both Apple and Microsoft.  I loved both of the Vision:M's that I have owned... as long as they worked.  Which was not very long.  In both cases, the unit worked fine for a few weeks but then mysteriously could not be recognized by my computer.  Or, for that matter, ANY computer.  There is no cure for this ailment, which happens frequently.  A quick google search will show you how prevalent this problem is with the Vision:M.  There is some discussion in other internet fora that seems to implicate the Gomadic charger for the fried Zen hardware.  Whether it's the Gomadic or the Zen, it appears plain to me there is a design flaw here that renders the Zen untrustworthy and as a result I cannot recommend it.  Give Creative an A for the concept, but until they fix this hardware problem they're not going to make any inroads into the market share of iPod and Zune.

<Title>Have had for over a year now
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>And it works great!    Charges last for hours and hours then only takes a fraction of the time to recharge.  Holds loads of music, pictures, and videos to keep you preoccupied over and over again.  The bright, crisp, clear display will make things look nice even if it is only 2 inches.    No installation CD necessary!  Take out of the box and plug into your XP SP2 or newer PC and it's instantly recognized!  Drag and drop icons from folder to folder for very easy file uploading and organizing.  Many reviews comment on easily scratching, but there's no scratches on mine.  Yes, it's in my pocket most of the day, however it's been slid around on tables and counter tops, even fell onto cement floors before - just a little wear on the backside, but the face is still almost pristine.  There's a manufactuar's overlaying display protector on the Zen and if you take care of your items like a reasonably responsible person, it should last you a long time for endless hours of portable entertainment.

<Title>Do not buy this...it only worked for a few months.
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product thinking it would be a great replacement to the Ipod I used to have. At the beginning it was excellent, the FM tuner is great. I used it at the gym everyday for at least 1 hour, for 3 months or so... Then one day the player would not turn on... I read that if I would connect it for a couple of hours and it would work again, I followed that advice and it did work for 2 days... the 2 days past and the MY ZEN M DIED.... it has turned on once since then, but just for a couple of minutes, funny thing... is that during the those few minutes that it was on the battery was totally full as well.  Anyway.... please do not waste your time or money with this product.

<Title>There are so many little things wrong with this.
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zen plays music; it doesn't play it badly, really. I suppose it does what I wanted it to do. There are just so many little things wrong with this player than make it inferior to the iPod that I cannot justify my purchase of it. Before purchasing this for myself, I owned a 4th gen iPod, and I loved it, but I abused it and after it broke I decided to try something different. After a year and a half I am STILL frustrated with this thing.  The good:  - I like the feel of the player in my hand. I know it's thicker than an iPod but that actually works for me. - FM radio is nice to have on occasion - Modifiable backgrounds, colors, etc. - The personalized button is great! I use it for "Random Play All", which is really fun. - Headphones aren't bad - Mine is bright green, I never lose it - I have to say, it has worked without major functioning flaws under pretty heavy use for a year and a half  The bad: - Very slow startup, especially if you haven't started it in a while. - Battery life isn't so hot after a year - I still like Apple's click wheel better than the touch pad - The four buttons on the sides are annoying to use; they require a very strong push. - There is no "All" tab when selecting albums and artists --- on an iPod, this exists. So it is impossible for me to view all the songs by an artist. I HAVE to view them by album.  - The software is horrible. I am pretty good with most technology but I can still not figure out how to make playlists on this! The software freezes all the time since I have over like, 10 songs, and I can never get anything accomplished. iTunes can be slow but it blows this out of the water. - If I open up a folder that has nothing in it, it freezes.  - When it loads songs sometimes, it makes an annoying clicking "processing" sound for a second.  - Sometimes upon starting a song you'll get strange feedback in the song. This happens at random and not very often, and if you restart it goes away, but it's still annyoing. I've seen this in other reviews. - The font looks cheesy, I'll just say it. - The charging device is ridiculous, with its various attachments.  - Menus are slow in general - When on hold, the screen goes black, and I can't see what I'm listening to. - The date and time are always wrong, no matter how many times I set them correctly.  - Also, the time is not displayed at the top of the screen like in an iPod, so I can't use this device like a watch. - No smart playlists; I miss this from the iPod  Overall, former iPod users will be very dissappointed with this. For a first mp3 player it might not be horrible, but at this point there are so many better, cheaper options out there. I've never tried a Zune so I can't comment on it compared to that. I just don't understand all the reviews praising the Zen. It has major flaws that make it annoying to use, and make it feel very second rate. Its one saving grace is that I have not had to call customer service ever; it has functioned "well" for a year and a half. However, I still can't use half the features on it, so I won't be buying another one when this one dies.

<Content>I will have had my Zen for a year in January and I haven't any trouble so far. Granted I have never owned a MP3 player before but I have not had all of the problems everyone else is compaining about. I listen to mine every day for a couple of hours with no problems. I would like to note that I usually drain the battery before I charge it. I have always heard that it is better for battery life. Oh and one time my computer didn't want to recognize it but that was a computer problem, I set it back a few weeks and voila no problem. I don't know what that was about but hey it fixed it. Kudos to an independent company putting out a good product.

<Title>Pretty good
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well to start, I really enjoy owning this player.  It beats any Ipod I've used.  I especially like the video capabilities and the design.  Originally I purchased the 30g version.  It was dropped about 4 feet onto a hardwood floor and that ruined the hard-drive.  The person who dropped it generously replaced it with the 60g version.  That one was working fine for a couple weeks until I got it out one day and, low and behold, the screen had cracked.  I still have no idea what prompted this.  (I do not recommend doing this) Since I still had the old one I took both apart and switched the screens and to this day I have not had any more problems.  I use Sennheiser HD 280 headphones with this player (sure its a little bulky but I don't mind) and the sound quality is superb.  Overall these should be 5 stars but the durability factor takes them down to a 4.

<Title>Best MP3 player!!
<Date>Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a gadget junky and have many MP3 players and PVP players and for the money and features it gets no better than the Creative Zen Vision:M. In reference to the iPod which in my opinion is also a good device, this has it beat in several areas that no other MP3 players have been able to do until now. With the Vision M you get a longer battery life than the iPod both in music and video, you have a wider variety of music and video formats that can be used with this player and you also get superior audio from this player. The Vision M also has an FM tuner which also allows you to record straight from radio to MP3 format so if you hear a song you love on the radio you can simply record it and have it stored for later listening. This player also has a voice recorder, calendar which can be synced with your PC and something that is a big plus is the Vision M allows you to customize your own wallpaper for your player and you can even use your own pictures as the screen savers something no other player allows you to do. The one thing that truly stands out aside from all those features is also the fact that this player has such an outstanding screen and it must been seen in person to believe as opposed to the iPod this player displays 262,00 colors to the iPods 65,000. Video playback is very smooth with no frame rate lose whatsoever and even if you get this purely for music, once you see the screen and the video playback this player will make you want to watch videos on it no doubt about it. The Vision M is very simple to use and the software makes transferring music, movies and pictures so simple its as easy as dragging and dropping which unlike the iPod requires you to use iTunes and as a consumer who purchases products at my own cost I want to be able to use my player as I like without having restrictions that I am bound to. The music play back on this player is superb and displays album art, artist info, artist track and you also have the ability to customize your own playlists, album of the day, rarely played and most played, ect. The Vision M comes in 5 colors and all look great, but just like the black iPod the black Vision M can scratch easier than the other colors so a case would be highly recommended, but then again with all things if you take care of your "toys" scratches can be avoided. I would also recommend a different pair of headphones as the ones included with the player sound great, but for true audio heads they won't be enough for your listening pleasure, but that is with any MP3 player new headphones are always a must. The Vision M is still brand new to the market so accessories are limited right now, but rest assured that as the market starts catching wind of this quickly sought after player, Creative will start pushing accessories just like Apple does and we will all be overwhelmed with the wealth of accessories. I truly don't have any cons against this player as it has far exceeded my expectations and if you are in the market for a new MP3 player and are debating between the iPod and this player, make no mistake you will be happy with either one, but why settle for what is the rule of thumb and go with what everyone else on the block owns and buy the Vision M and be the exception to

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Greets all I am the former owner of a Dell DJ and an Ipod Nano, and I now own a Vision M. After using it for a few days I must declare this gadget a masterpiece, I sold my DJ on Ebay and gave my Nano to my sister (darned thing was covered in scratches even though I took great pains to protect it) the screen of the Vision is worlds better than any MP3 player out there right now (brighter, much better colors&contrast) a longer battery life (4+ hours), and the wide variety of supported music and video formats will satisfy even the most jaded critic. When I first heard the Vision was gonna give the Ipod a run for its money I was doubtful, I am now a believer out to preach the greatness of this little wonder. Just a word of advise, to keep the face plate and screen looking like new I reccomend you purchase a custom shield from the invisibleshield.com, its worth every penny.

<Title>Software is an issue
<Date>Sat Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Others have posted more complete info, so I will not rehash that.  Briefly, I was very pleased with the audio quality. The video quality is very good also, considering the tiny screen. These should be deciding factors for many people.  The mechanical ergonomics and user interface takes a little getting used to, but overall, Creative did a fine job. You will probably want to set the pad sensitivity to low.   The player works with the supplied Creative software, and Windows Media Player 10. The problems I encountered importing my mp3's were duplicate tracks and album art. Depending on how many mp3's you have and if you care about album art, this may not be a problem for you. In my opinion, neither WMP or the Creative software makes it very easy for you.   The Creative Labs user forums are very active, and should be a good source for help on the issues you may encounter. Also, Creative company people also monitor and respond.

<Title>Better than the ipod video
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I found this player just before i was going to buy a new video ipod. I just got the player and its incredible. The sound and video quality is the best ive seen, and very customizable. The navigation isnt as easy as the ipod's scroll wheel,but it gets the job done. the FM tuner and voice recorder are great, since i do not have to buy accerories for it,its embedded in the zen vision M. Like i said, the sound quality is much better than the ipod. The earphones themselves held up to a bass test that the ipod earphones could not handle without alot of distortion. The only trouble i had with the player is my m4a files, which i quickly converted to mp3 and loaded onto the player. Apart from that,it is a perfect machine and is, in my opinion, after using the ipod video several times,a better quality device than the ipod

<Title>truly a feature loaded player that's well worth the investment!
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I consider myself well versed with MP3 players (i've owned an ipod and creative products), software, and features and after much research and questions, i decided to go with Creative for a second time and am very glad i did!  This is truly a feature packed MP3 player that's simple to use for anyone, and offers plenty of goodies for your money.  I've read some folks who are high on the ipod horse, however, i prefer not to be told where i have to buy my music and once i realized that the only way to purchase music for my ipod was to buy it at itunes, i felt like i was forced back into the apple store long after i had purchased my ipod.  Unless you pirate your music, the only place you can buy music is at itunes... the apple money machine continues to roll on.  When you buy an ipod, apple has you where they want you.  The Creative Zen Vision M takes the personal music player to another level by expanding on the basics of an ipod photo and gives you so much more freedom then you thought was possible.  The physical size of this unit is about 4" tall x 2 1/2" wide x 3/4" thick, making it slighty thicker then the ipod photo and weighing in slightly more.  When you hold this in your hands, you can feel the quality.  The buttons are located in easy to use areas and the backlights are vibrant and have a soft "click" when pressed.  The screen is incredible!  Believe the hype!  The color is bright and crisp and truly makes other named mp3 players look black and white!  The numbers don't lie... check out the specs and see for yourself!  The unit includes a USB 2.0 cable, A/C adapter (yes, ipod users, you heard that right... it doesn't cost more), software, headphones (that acutally sound halfway decent), and a carry pouch.  I admit, the pouch is a bit goofy and useless... creative really needs to stop doing the pouch thing.  You can purchase some great accesories including A/V Cables, leather case, dock, wired remote, and other goodies.    Setup is a breeze with this player, installing the drivers and software was real simple.  Once the drivers are installed, you can decide weather you'd like to use windows media player 10  or the creative managing software.  The included software is feature loaded with video compression software, mp3 encoding, photo management, and other goodies.  Transfering music is as easy as dragging and dropping as is importing photos and downloading movies to the player.  Learning how to use this player is half the fun!  Another great feature with this unit is the "plays for sure" technology.  This player is compatable with many of your music membership services like napster, rhapsody, or (my personal choice) virgin digital (best price per month).  Or, get this, you're actually FREE to decide where you'd like to buy music from, and no matter where you get it, it will actually play on the player!  How about that!  you can shop around for the best price on your favorite music!!!  You can even listen to your favorite radio station (news, talk shows, music) and college students will love the built in voice recorder for classes and organizing those recordings is a snap on your computer!  Creative is also working on the video content portion of their content and currently allows anyone to create and upload their own "Zencasts" to their website and share with others.  I understand that Encore is about to release video content for creative users with more on the way!  Audiophiles will love the sound quality and the features to tweek the sound to your liking.  The battery seems to last about 12 hours for me before completely dying and charging time takes just a shade under two hours.  I haven't noticed the unit getting warm with normal use at the office or during trips to and from. You should however be prepared for the co-workers and their questions and envy... two guys at the office decided to order one shortly after seeing mine.  This player is truly the best kept secret in a world that's seemingly dominated by a carefully marketed toy that scratches if you breath on it.  IF you're looking for the real deal, with flexability, and is truly feature loaded then look no further!  Creative has a real winner on their hands!

<Title>Why I chose this over an iPod
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll try and avoid philosphical discussions of the iPod and competition.  I don't know why iPod users seem to need to bash products that they've never seen or touched, but they seem to.  I was looking to replace my Zen Touch 20 GB.  I was almost going to buy the black iPod video 60 GB.  I went with this instead.  I only wish that it had a 60 GB model.  They've made improvements over the Zen Touch.  The buttons on the front are better, the navigation is better, and the USB cable charges the thing as well, the external power supply isn't required (although it is supplied!).  The iPod charges $30 for their AC charger, but this one is included, kinda.  The only bad thing about that is they both plug in to an external dongle.  The dongle plugs into the Zen Vision, and both the AC adapter and the USB plug into the dongle.  I'd like to leave my USB plug at home, and the AC adapter at work so that I always have power somewhere, but I have to remember to bring the dongle with me everywhere I go, or buy another one or buy a docking station.  Kinda irritating.  In addition to that, there is a noticeable lack of accessories for the Creative player.  If that bothers you.  So as for the un-avoidable comparison to the iPod... It's slightly less than once heavier than the 30GB iPod.  Not a big deal to me.  It's dimentions are identical to the iPod from the front, but it's a little bit thicker.  Extra space to house the FM receiver, recorder, and more battery life I suppose, not a big deal for me.  It's very stylish, solid, good looking machine.  So is the iPod.  However, the video iPod that I was playing with actually had a bit of a sharp edge where the plastic front met the metal back, which completely ruined the asthetics for me.  The Vision also has a screen with more colors and brighter images.  It just looks better.  But most of all, the great thing about the Vision is the fact that I don't have to use iTunes.  The iPod and iTunes are a great combination for those who aren't the most computer saavy.  But the Vision works with creative's iTunes equivilent just fine, in addition to windows Media Player 10, in addition to the windows file system directly, akin to a mass storage device.  So with a little knowledge, you have many more options.  I like that.  OK, so even more most of all was my real test.  One morning, I wanted to watch a 15 minute segment of a local new show on the train.  I was hoping to be able to plug it in to the TV and record it directly, like some other products on the market do.  I wasn't.  However, I was able to record it on tivo, transfer that video to my computer, and using Windows Media Player convert, resize and transfer to the Vision in one step.  All in all, it took about 30 minutes, but only because tivo is really slow.  If I had tried to do that with the iPod, I would have had to transfer the video from tivo, find some sort of software to convert it to a format that QuickTime Pro can play, then convert and save it in the right size/format for the iPod, and then transfer it to the player.  I never did it with the new show recording because I didn't know how to get it into Quicktime, but I did take a 5 minute MOV file that I already had and converted it to iPod format and that alone took forever.  It's this lack of flexibility that killed the iPod for me.  The Vision will take many different formats without converting, the iPod will only take a very specific format.  That's bad in my book.  Now if you only EVER plan on buying video from iTunes, then that won't be a problem for you.  The rest is just a pain in the butt.  I can't make that committment.  So that did it.  I love the thing, although I'm still kinda getting used to it.  I'm not anti iPod, but the iPod just isn't for me.  I'm above it.  Creative has been making these things for a long long time, and although apple has come along with a very good product for the masses, it isn't the end-all be-all.  Apple has, however, motivated some of the Asian players again, and there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.

<Title>Not a bad try - but still no iPod.
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While this is certainly the best player to come out to compete against iPod, it just doesn't quite execute as well as Apple.  A quick summary:  The Vision: M costs more per GB of storage space, is harder to use, and just isn't as cool and sophisticated as the Apple iPod.  While the Creative has a great screen and a built-in radio, these just don't make up for the cost and cheep-feel of the device.  While the screen quality is great, it is not that big of a deal.  The screen resolution is the same as the iPod video (storage capacity and battery life are also virtually the same between the two products).  The only difference is the number of colors the screen can display, which is hardly noticeable at that screen size.  I imagine Apple will have a similar screen soon if you really need the color.  As far as storage space is concerned, the iPod is a better bang for your buck.  While Creative claims to have a 15,000-song capacity, it is making this claim based on a 64kbps audio file.  I don't know of anyone who has a file lower in quality than at 128kbps file.  Apple is up front about their capacity.  For their 30-gigabyte iPod, they claim 7500 songs at 128kbps (to get 15000 you need the 60gb, something Creative doesn't offer).  Your Creative player would have the same capacity since it also has a 30-gigabyte drive.  Cost: $299 for a 30gb Video iPod or $329.99 for a 30gb Creative Zen Vision: M.  Take your pick.  Besides storage space, another item to consider is to is ease-of-use.  While they may look similar when it comes to input layout, they are not.  The Creative is much more difficult to navigate than the iPod.  Apple's menu navigation with the touch wheel is very intuitive, and simple to pick up on.  Creative's approach is, well, creative.  The menus are slow, and while you can learn how to use the touch pad, it is not very natural.  Stick with Apple if you appreciate ease of use and not having to look at your screen every time you want to do something.  Apple's wonderful iTunes software is another reason to stick with the incumbent here.  It is sleek and easy to use.  It organizes music better than any other jukebox out there, and interfaces perfectly well with your iPod.  Even though iPod doesn't play as many video formats, iTunes converts and optimizes video to play on your iPod for you.  Simple as can be.  Finally, just take into account quality and style.  Apple has been making quality iPods for years now, and they just keep getting better.   The iPod is proven, while the new Vision: M is not.  If there were significant benefits, it might be worth the switch, but the features are pretty much the same (except the radio, I must concede).  Apple simply makes a classier product.  The lines are simple and elegant on an iPod, and they feel great in your hand.  The Creative is very plastic and feels more like a toy than a sophisticated music device.  Even when Apple offered color on the iPod Mini, they still did so with a touch of class - the Vision: M just looks and feels cheep, although it is well build.  Besides, with the iPod, you not only get quality, but you get to say you own an iPod.  No one will know what you're talking about if you say you have a Vision: M.

<Content>I loved and took VERY good care of this thing for a year and 10 days, when it suddenly became a paperweight.  Creative support cuts off after one year and they will not cut you any slack.  You can't even get email support at that point.  They offerred to diagnose it for $120.    IF this happens to you, don't make the mistake I did.  Be sure to file a claim with your credit card company before thier deadline for "buyer's assurance" runs out.  Hopefully I'll have better luck with the Zune.

<Content>Great mp3 player, without the hassle of itunes. use WMP or other windows based software to sync.   Pros:  30 gb is a lot of room, consider 60gb or larger if you have a huge collection. Mine is currently full,(around 4k songs at 256) but I have every song I own on it and at a fairly high bitrate. Plays movies, slideshows, music. Much better than carrying pics in your wallet!  Oter consideration is the vision, bit larger in size, my wife likes it better. She has one. Cons:  Some may find the "touch" control very difficult and very frustrating to use. FM radio, poor reception, no memory card slots, no removeable battery. (have not had any problems with battery or battery life..approx 4 hours of music)

<Title>Great System and software
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision M has been a great mp3 player to me. I trully love this thing and I have had it for a little over a year now and it works fantastic. It is built pretty well I have dropped it multiple times and it still works fine. However, when you purchase it don't take it out unless you already have a case to protect the screen with becasue it is prone to scratches on the screen. I would suggest the use of both the screen covers and a case used in conjunction. Also I wouldn't use a case that holds the mp3 player in with velcro because the velcro fibers will scratch up the unit if you take it out multiple times. The screen is great and if you have windows media center you can take the DVD's you already have and put them on your mp3 player. in conjunction with the software that it comes with. Overall it is a great system and from now on I will be keeping an eye out for future creative products.

<Title>Too many flaws to love
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're a fellow Apple-loather and looking for a viable alternative...this, sadly, is not it.  The software is the first problem. It crashes frequently and sometimes fails to rip the last song on the CD for no discernable reason.  It often fails to convert video files to a format it can understand. Every time you attempt to synch it will try to install Microsoft Outlook on your PC.  Simply plugging your Zen into the PC will result in the Zen searching folders for any multimedia it finds and adding it to your player.  The player itself has a battery life that decreases noticeably with time. Recharging the player is also a pain since Creative requires you to plug a special widget into the device before it will accept a USB cable. Unless you carry the widget around with you, you're out of luck when you're out of power.  The unit also crashes too frequently for comfort, either by freezing up (which necessitates finding a paper clip and using the reset hole at the bottom of the unit) or by simply going black. In either case, the player then "rebuilds" itself which takes perhaps 20-30 minutes.  The interface responds erratically to finger input, and I often find myself being asked to rate songs when all I wanted to do was go back to the previous screen. The "random selection" function is also far less random than one would expect.  I'm already out of space on my Zen and will not be buying another one.

<Title>Zen Nano Plus
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was my first experience with an MP3. I purchased it mainly to listen to recorded books. After years of carrying around shoe boxes full of books on tape to listen to, while I drive truck cross country, it was hard for me to believe that this small 1 gig device was capable of holding 10 or more books. It is how ever rather difficult to locate your book of choice if you have several books downloaded. Also difficult to bookmark or find your spot if you loose it.  This is a great device to listen to one book at a time while lying in bed or ridding on a plane or just sitting around. Creative's instructions are terrible and unless you have had previous experience operating other MP3's this isn't a good starter unit.  I have since purchased two larger units, a Sand disk E250 and a Creative Zen version M.  Both of these units are much easier to operate and you can see all your titles and easily select your choice from a list.   Creative's Zen Mp3 players will down load all formats, from the library as well as Audible books formats from private companies. The Sand disk E series will only download the Library wwwv format.  The E series Sandisk units are the easiest to operate and would be a better first choice pick.

<Title>Too good to last
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first Zen Vision M was immediately shipped back because it wouldn't turn on (so that didn't signal good things to come).  The new one I got worked beautifully for 4 months, but it just died.  First, the sound went out.  It continued to play, but the sound didn't work on my headphones or speakers.  Half an hour later, the screen went black.  An hour later, it shut down completely and my computer won't even recognize it. Attempts to contact customer service and get web support has been painful and arduous.  Their website is ironically faulty and they deliberately hide customer service contact information such as numbers and addresses so you just want to give up.  It's great while it lasts, but the company does not know how to run a business and is cheap when it comes to customer satisfaction.  Such behavior is reflected in their product.

<Title>Just Bought My 2nd One
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sort of good news/bad news kind of thing.  My old Zen had started to be hard to get to connect to recharge--it was taking multiple attempts before it was recognized by computer. Turns out it was the cable that went bad, not the player itself, but I didn't learn that until the new one came and I tried out the new cable.  So if any of you are having that problem, try the (much cheaper) cable first. But, I researched all the players all over again, as I was annoyed that the  Zen had apparently broken after a year and a half.  I'd not been at all careful with it--wearing it bouncing around on the lawn mower for hours every weekend etc.--but I still thought it should have lasted longer.  But, when I looked at the others, none of them had all the features I valued--great screen, bookmarks, FM radio and option of using the player as a USB drive of up to 16GB capacity.  So I ended up buying another one because they really are great players. Now my wife has inherited the old one that really was never broken, and everyone won!  I still recommend the Zen very highly.

<Content>I have had it for a month now, and I must say that I like this little guy! You can up load pics and set them as your backround, that is a fun function to have. The touch pad is a little too sensitive, just set it at "Low" and I think it will be way better to navigate arround! It will take a little time to get use to the Zen but once you do  it will be easy. Easy to set up and download the media.It is a little bigger than the I*** but it fits in your hand and you can get a good grip on it. It froze on me once but I just hit the reset button at the bottom and it was up and running again. I use it in the car every day and when I go for a run. Other than that no problems so far...

<Title>This is the one!!
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After researching several Mp3 players I settled on this one. I think for the money it is a great value. (I got mine at a good discount). The nice thing about the Zen is you don't need it's own software. Let me explain. When you plug in your Zen in with the cable Windows Media Player automatically  recognizes it. You press "Sync" on the media player and presto!! You can start adding your music. Plug and Play!! Zen recognizes Wave,Mp3 and WMA . Unlike The iPod You don't have to plug your player in to delete a song delete it right from the player! If your going to put video on the player Creative's software is easy to use. The video quality is great and with a program like DVDFAB you can adjust the video quality to fit your needs. Great Product!!

<Title>The Gizmo
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the larger version at 60 GB.  See my review of that if you like.  I am extremely pleased with the 60 GB.  Figure this is half the size of the 60.  Right now I have tons of music on it and still have 41 gigs left. When I bought the 60, Amazon had both sizes.  Right now, they are only carrying the 30 gig, but believe me, 30 gig is plenty of space--probably far more than you realize, unless you're tekkie enough to know what 30 GB means in English:-)  Creative Zen M is a great product.  The ONLY down side I found was that all the gadgets out there are available for iPod, not for Creative Zen.  If you don't need all the plug-into gadgets, the Creative Zen is a great product.  Jan 2008:  I just bought this for my son.  He finally killed his 60 GB Gizmo, but, in reality, it took a tremendous amount of abuse (like a Tonka toy truck).  Because of his electrician job, crawling around in claustrophobic spaces and up and down ladders, it got banged and dropped an awful lot.  It still kept going, held together by tape, fo a long time.  For an electronic, it took an awful lot of abuse.  He's paying for the replacement, or it will be his birthday gift.  Have not decided which yet, but this is a great product.

<Title>Fantastic Player
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a TON of research before I bought a player and this is the one I chose.  It was the right decision.  Great software, merges easily with my computer.  I run Windows and use Windows Media Player 11 to organize my music and this integrates seamlessly with that (you don't have to use the software it comes with at all).  It even grabbed all my pictures and video too!    The interface is feature-rich and has everything I'd ever want to use in it.  The controls do take a delicate touch to get used to, but I got good at it in about 5 minutes.  The screen is amazingly bright and easy to view, even for video (supposedly twice as bright as an iPod) and the battery life is remarkable.    All in all, much better than a comparable iPod AND it has radio.  Also a host of great accessories for it like remote controls and silicone protective covers.  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.

<Title>Just awesome
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After a long time and owning a few different MP3 players, I have found my favorite. It's just an overall great player.   Pros:  SOUND QUALITY. It's just as good if not better than an iPod. Note: No EQ settings required, this sounds great without any tweaking. Plays almost any audio format and most video formats without an issue 30GB at a very good price FM Tuner...that actually works in my office, so far, this is the only tuner to pick up my favorite station while I'm IN my office. Favorite button - Never knew how much I could appreciate this feature, but it'e great. I have mine set to play and shuffle all tracks. The display is incredible. The color and image quality and absolutely smooth movement, very well done. Videos - look great, you don't even mind the fact that it is a relatively small screen. Photo Slide shows, and the software automatically resizes pictures for best display and file size. Controls - Any laptop user will appreciate the touch pad controls.  Cons:  The battery life is great for a HDD player (especially with video), but nowhere near a flash player Updates - As soon as you get this, download the newest softwares. Loading videos was an issue until I did this. (On the upside, my downloaded podcasts translated very well) Size - not as small or thin as many players. Not a problem for me, because I like having a good size to hold, but I can probably say that this is my biggest acceptable size for a player. But the build is solid. The Sync Adaptor - while not too cumbersome, it is an extra part that should have been built onto the cables.  Overall - the best player I've owned and until something incredibly groundbreaking comes out, I will not be getting rid of this any time soon. Until it breaks, as I have no reason to even look at anything else.

<Title>I WILL NEVER REGRET BUYING IT
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like a lot of ppl I did my research b4 buying a new mp3 player. I had 3 choices: The IPOD, The ZUNe or The ZEN, i honestly did not know anything about it but I started looking around. I didn't want an IPOD because everybody has one and well the Zune was too expensive for me at the time. But looking and looking i came to the Zen more for the features, I love all the features many of them the IPOD doesn't have, I like the recorder because as a college student sometimes I like to record classes. 30GB it's enough space for me, I even have a couple of movies on there for when i need to travel, the size it's fine with me for all the features that this little guy has OMG it's amazing...

<Title>iPod or Vision:M?  Not black and white.
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Is the Vision:M a 5th generation (video)iPod clone?  You bet... right down to the little green battery charge indicator in the upper right corner.  Is it better than the 5th generation iPod?  In my mind there's no contest, but there are trade-offs.  Judge for yourself.  Creative Vision:M, why is it better? -Plays DivX and XviD video, as well as WMV-9 and MPEG1/2/4. -Higher color screen (262,144 colors vs 65,000 colors) -Natively plays MP3, WMA and WAV, without conversion. -Better signal-to-noise ratio under same frequency response. -Longer battery life (approx 4 hours video playback vs iPod's 2 hours) -Includes AC charger. -FM Radio/ Recorder. -Voice Recorder. -Compatible with popular music services, like Napster. -Customizable menu, with background image. -Organizer features Outlook sync support; Contacts, Calendar & Tasks. -Colors blue, green, and pink are also available. -The back side isn't made out of scratch magnets like the iPod. -Natively acts as external hard drive in Windows.  Apple iPod 5th Generation, why is it better? -Slimmer. iPod - 0.43in / Vision:M - 0.7in. -Lighter. iPod - 4.8oz / Vision:M - 5.7oz. -Clickwheel is still the preferred navigation input for many. -Lots of first and third party accessories available. -60GB version also available. -iTunes support. -30 USD cheaper.  If you're in the market for a 30GB player and you're considering the 5th generation iPod, give the Creative Vision:M a serious look.  If your friends ask you why you bought a "generic iPod," you can tell them with pride all the reasons why the iPod simply wasn't good enough for you.

The creative zen vision m does everything that the ipod does and WAY more. compare: vision displays nearly 4 times the number of colors of the ipod. the vision has a built in fm tuner and voice recorder, the ipod does not have eather of these features. the vision supports a WIDE variety of video formats that the ipod does not. the vision comes with neccesary cables and adapters. the only things that ipod has over the creative model is it looks shiny. They are both great players, but the creative model is simply better. just read the specs. if you want a quality product at a good price, definitely choose the zen vision: m.

<Title>IPOD KILLER!!! Awesome player
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had first written a review, and my original enthusiasm still remains for this player. I bought it on the US date of release, and have used it for a fair amount of time. I still love the player, and here's what's happened so far.  The Player (after a Firmware upgrade) still performs like a beauty. Most Divx/Xvid files downloaded from Torrent sites can be thrown right on. The Majority of the content on my Vision M are videos, which is my main purpose. The player performs well, and I can squeeze off a movie, and 2 TV shows, roughly 2.5 Hours of video, and still go on with about 6-7 hours of music (or possibly a few more shows).  The player is indeed a scratch magnet on the front. I had originally invested in screen protectors from Kroo. Unfortunately, they are of low quality, and a Screen protector is a must. I also snagged an Action Jacket for my Vision M, which increases the bulk slightly, but not enough for me to notice. The player has survived Coke and Sprite spills, and there is no evidence of discoloration.  The Player is obviously a little large, in a "brick" sort of design. Don't let this turn you away though. It is very easy to hold, and is very sturdy. The Buttons require a significant push, and the player feels like it is well built.  Sound quality is great. The Navigation does have a learning curve, and your Menu Colors are limited. Your options as far as customization go are wallpapers and menu order. The Main menu contains menu items, which can be deleted/rearranged with ease. There are 6 preset themes, appealing to different tastes. There is little lag in between menu options. The player is VERY sensitive, almost to the point to cause frustration in some people. Scrolling does have a clicker noise, which can be disabled, along with a clock, calendar, and dates. Customization is a key feature. Imagine an Ipod Scroll wheel, with all the options broken apart into 4 buttons, and the actual wheel became vertical. Enter, Vision M!  For the Ipod fans, I have used an iPod video enough to review, and it can be safely said that you will probably navigate easier on an Ipod than a Vision M. The Ipod's Navigation wheel is much easier to use. However, usually this has nothing to do with the actual features.  The FM Radio is of good quality, and features a little Cell phone style bar that indicates signal strength. I usually have full bars, and the reception quality is crystal clear. No hissing, buzzing, or such (for you Rio Fans).   The Screen is gorgeous, and re-encoded TV shows and DVD movies still retain their quality. I tested many movies, and all have been clearer than your standard Tube TV. Although the Vision M can support many formats, movies play best at medium-High Divx Bitrates. Oddly enough, XviD seems to cause problems such as synch (see below). Most of your p2p, Torrent, and Ripped movies will be ripped in Divx. It is best to Re-encode DVDs into around 700+ kbps Divx movies, to avoid problems. The codec is simple and most full-length movies will set you back 14-20 minutes. A good program is PocketDivx.  Now come for the Two Massive Cons. Movie Synching, and Freezes.  My player has frozen on me 5 times. 1 time included me asking a hotel for a sewing kit so I could use the needle to reset. All this time an image of Brad pitt was frozen on my screen. When the player freezes, the lights will usually remain on, and the on/off switch will not work. Usually I encountered this problem on XviD Movies. Divx however, was very stable.  Another Huge Con is the synching of movies. Again, usually with XviD movies, video files desynched after 20 minutes of play. This meant that the audio was about 2-5 seconds behind the video. The point of desynched was set in stone, and there was no fix. Desynching usually occurs when the Video Bitrate exceeds the Vision M's CPU capabilities. Recommended bitrates are 600-800 kbps, and a 14-minute re-encode to Divx can skip over such hassles.  The Vision M comes with a proprietary connector to Charge and to use Video Out. Video Out is good at the proper resolution, and looks like Basic Cable. Still fun to use, but don't expect HDTV. The Dongle can be annoying, and it is like an ipod dongle, but reversed.  PROS::: Amazing Feature set Crystal Clear FM radio Good Software for Transfer Gorgeous screen Sturdy Good sound/video quality  CONS::: Freeze/Desynch Bug WINDOWS XP ONLY! No Drag and Drop (not a biggie) Scratch-fiesta in your pants pocket Proprietary connections   Overall, I am very happy with the Vision M. It Performs well, and under good care, looks well too. Once you learn the navigation, and find your sweet spot to avoid the bugs, you'll be in heaven!   IMPORTANT!!! There are 2 different Versions selling currently. Once reported as a Vision M: lite (not a common term), there is a smaller box that includes a Vision M WITHOUT A CHARGER. The Prices don't seem to be different. THE PROPER BOX IS THE ONE THAT IS ENCASED IN A THICK COVER, AND SLIDES OUT LIKE A MULTI DVD BOX. The smaller version usually is the same price. THE SKU NUMBER IS THE SAME. You are safer buying the vision M in store, as Both Boxes will be acceptable with the same SKU.

<Title>Not perfect yet!
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before you buy, make sure it supports the codecs you use.  It has very good codec support but it's not perfect yet.  It may not support all forms of divx and xvid (it has not been certified by the divx company).  This player DOES NOT SUPPORT AC3 (the 5.1 surround track of a dvd). Many of the movies downloaded off the net use soundtracks encoded in 5.1 or 2 channel AC3.  Hopefully a new firmware will fix these glaring omissions in an otherwise very competitive product.  If you are looking for a small video player though, this is much better than the Ipod w/ video.  The screen is considered better by reviewers and the improved codec support means less time transcoding your videos.

<Title>Setting the record str8 
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would like to respond to the reviewer below who gave it a one star and is clearly some ipod fanatic club member.  The creatives vision m battery life is better than the ipod video - TRUE take a look at reviews online.  The one on CNET.com confirms 15 hours for audio (higher than suggested) and about 4 hours and 11 minutes for video under their test conditions.  This is clearly better than ipod's 2 hours battery for video.  Add to the fact that creative's screen is more vivid and bright - 262,144 color screen compared to ipod video's 65,000 color screen.  The creative vision m is an ipod killer - TRUE in terms of features and value.  The creative zen vision m is only 30$ more.  With that 30$ you get: A much more advanced display.  You get longer battery life for video. A more wide array of supported video formats (mpeg-1, mpeg-2, mp4, divx, xvid, avi).  Also 640x480 resolution is supported by the vision m unlike ipod video which is limited to 320 x 240 resolution.  The higher resolution allows the TV output to be much more clearer.  You get more audio format support, FM radio, voice recording etc.  Basically it does what an ipod video can do plus a few additions and features.  The biggest problem I have with the ipod video (I bought one when it was released) is that it scratches easily.  So much so that it will build up on scratches overtime and make the display look deformed.  I have not dropped my ipod once and everyday new scratches appear.  How could apple sell a product like this?  How could any company sell a product like this?  So I can go out and shell out more cash for a case?  I'll get a case to protect it from scratching from drops not from scratching that happens when I pull it in and out of my pockets.

<Title>Great player...lacking accesorries availability though
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this player for the past two weeks and have played around with it extensively.  As a Video/Mp3 player, it's great. Long battery life and also easy to navigate through the menus. Easy application to use, just drag and drop Mp3s like an external hard disk, no iTunes necessary. Supports album art which is great cause it looks cool when you browse for the album you want to play. Package comes with all the necessary items such as a power charger and usb cord and CD full of applications such as video converter, media manager and CD ripper.  I know people tend to compare this unit with the iPod. But the unit does what it does well and that should be all a user should worry about. There isn't many things wrong with the player so you can't really go wrong. But if you compare it with the iPod 30 Gig, Creative Vision : M has better video quality over the iPod, it has a FM tuner for radio and also is a voice recorder, it also plays multiple formats such as divx and xvid which is great for lunch time watching (I don't think either iPod or Creative Vision : M was meant for movie watching). Battery life is the same as it uses the same battery, although creative seems to have better power saving functions.  It's con is that it doesn't have USB on the go, it requires an adapter. And also because the product is new, you really can't find accessories anywhere. Hopefully if it is as big a hit as the iPod, alot of accessories will come out. As it has only just come out, the software is a little buggy such as album art does not always get uploaded properly and sometimes does not undock properly but nothing that can't be fixed by a software or firmware upgrade.  Overall a highly recommended system and a must have for people who want music on the go. Definitely worth the money.

<Title>Excellent Portable Media Player!
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Zen Vision: M for a total of about nine months now, and I use it practically everyday and I love the thing.   On the audio side,  The Vision M supports an adequate amount of audio formats, including mp3, wma, and wav for you audiophiles.  The player has a handy equalizer that really makes a difference with a ton of presets.     The area where the Vision M really shines is screen/video performance.  It supports a ton of formats, including xvid, divx, avi, mpeg, etc; this means that there is virtually no conversion required for most videos when transferred to the player.  However, some video files contain AC3 audio which the ZVM does not support and audio conversion to mp3 is required.  The screen on this thing is beautiful, being able to display more than four times as many colors as the iPod's screen.  You really have to see it believe it.    One amazing feature of the ZVM is to set a user wallpaper.  I love that you can crop, adjust brightness, and change color tone of your desired picture to get it to look the way you want.  Several themes are also available to choose from which changes text/dialog box colors and wallpapers.  The touchpad is effective, in fact a bit too effective for navigation and I set to low sensitivity.  The lighted tactile buttons are a nice touch, and an even nicer touch is the shortcut button.  You can use it access whatever menu you want with one press.  The FM radio picks up very well with autoscan, although I really don't use it so I can't comment on it.  But if radio is your thing, then you'll love that you can record directly off the ZVM's radio.  The built-in Microphone picks up voices in a crowded room very well and comes in handy quite often.    I can see how the player's removable disk (up to 16GB) feature would come in handy as a replacement for a flash drive or a full-blown hard drive for transferring large files; it does however seem kind of impractical that you have to carry the player along with the dongle and a usb cable around on you.  Needless to say I don't really use this feature.  The Zen, however is not without faults.  Its easy to forget that there's an actual hard drive in this thing, and  people (including myself) don't treat it as carefully as it should be treated.  I used to keep it in pockets and bags, throwing the bags carelessly.  The player has locked up on me a handful of times, requiring a poke of the reset button; considering the player has met tile floor a couple times, it has held up fairly well.  The M is also extremely prone to surface scratches; all past and future scratches can be concealed and prevented with an invisible skin from bestskinsever dot com for about eight bucks shipped.  The included software is pretty weak, I did not install mediasource so I cannot say much about it. The included video converter only works about half the time and will not work with long movies I have tried, but there is plenty of freeware for video conversion out there so it's no big deal.  I use MediaMonkey for ripping and tagging music, and the creative zen explorer to sync albums with album art to ensure it shows up.  besides that, for music, videos, and photos, it's as simple as drag and drop in windows explorer, which is very, very convenient.  All in all, the ZVM is a high-end player way ahead of the pack, with a great feature set that would be able to satisfy the most demanding portable media enthusiast. Minus a few faults, the ZVM shines. Even two years after release, is definitely one of the best players on the market and most deserving of your cash.

<Title>Zen broke within 3 months of having it
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the features of the zen alot... That is why I gave it a 3.  My Zen had a hard disk failure.  It is currently being worked on by Creative Labs and their service has been great (antoher reason it earned a 3).  The reason I am writing this review is to let people know that this "hard disk failure" is a "somewhat common" problem.  I found out about that when I did some forum searches regarding my players symptoms.  Great product when I was able to use it though...  UPDATE: (4 stars)  I sent my zen in for repair.  They sent back a new one.  It was a hardisk failure.  They replaced it for a $25 handling fee.  Great customer service at Creative Labs.

<Title>So satisfied with my Zen Vision M!
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned this product for about four months now, so I have had a really good chance to break it in.  I love it.  Honestly, the only real drawback is that it's kind of bulky.  Bulkier than an Ipod and heavier as well.  It's cool though, because I have a clip I can use to put on my belt or pocket, or I can actaully just take the clip off and put in my shorts pocket.  I also bought the neoprene skin along with car charger and wall charger.  The adapter you use to plug into the computer is a little different since it comes with it's own special adapter to do this with.  I was having issues with the player for a while when trying to use my Yahoo Music Unlimited to Go subscription.  When I would try to download, the computer kept screwing up and freezing.  Songs would only download 70 percent of the time which was incredibly annoying.  BUT once I did the update for Yahoo Music Engine and updated to the latest firmware on the player by going to the manufacturer website, everything is absolutely pristeen!!  I have 3099 songs on it as of today and I cannot get enough of it!  I listen in the car mostly and at home as well.  I look the look of the player because it does not look like everything else on the market it would seem.   I do not have any videos on it as of yet, but the player comes with some demos installed.  I gotta say the display is wonderful.  Great color!  I never thought I could watch someting on a screen so small and enjoy it, but it's actually kind of cool.  Perfect for riding on the bus and listening or watching a video.  The sound quality is very good as well.  It comes with an equilizer option where you can customize it to your particular liking or set it to the common options of rock, jazz, classical, pop, etc., just like the Ipod.  Just remember, if you do the custom EQ option, bass can distort the sound if you do not set it correctly.  Sound is different in the car as opposed to a home receiver.  I have seen many complaints about it's navigation wheel but I disagree.  At first, when you are just a novice on the player, navigating can get frustrating because the button is sensitive and you tend to scroll down and press on the wrong link constantly.  Oh, you can change the settings for the button sensitivity by the way.  I set mine to low on day 2.  Yes, once I was but a student, NOW I AM THE MASTER!  Now scrolling is something I can almost do in my sleep.  I have playlists, tons of albums, and never a bad moment listening anymore.  By the way, creating playlists is another downside on the player.  The instructions on how to do this don't make any sense and when I tried to use them, it did not work as I wanted it to.  So now, I just create the playlist on the computer in using Yahoo Music Jukebox and it's a lot easier that way.  I really like the DJ option as well, since it will just play every song on my player randomly.  This is great when you stock you player with nothing but the tracks you love.  One remaining annoyance though is that when you download tracks from Yahoo Music Jukebox to the player, they don't stay in the order they were on the album for some reason.  You have to go and change them around in the player (which I do using Windows).  Would call the manufacturer about that, but once the first sixty days are up, no more free customer service calls.  It then becomes, I think, $12.99 per incident.  The forum on the website is extensive, but for someone like me, it's a bit opaque and hard to navigate if you don't know exactly how to word what you are looking for.   I have not had any problems with the harddrive freezing or crashing.  No hardware problems at all, especially since I did the firmware update.  The cool thing is that you go to the site and it can tell you all the available updates for your player and lists them with recommendation factors.  Sweet.  Battery power seems fine since full charge probably lasts 10 hours or so.  Features are many, almost too many to go into every single detail but some are calendar, organizer, most popular song play, rarely heard song play, yet to be rated song play, artist lookup, etc.  Probably the coolest feature of the Zen Vision M is the shortcut button.  You can set it to go to a popular selection like rating screen, equilizer, whatever.  That is pretty damn sweet if you ask me.   So all in all, I definitely think this is a great option vs. the Ipod.  Not to mention, the fact that I got the player, the neoprene skin (which absolutely rocks by the way), and the chargers all for less than the cost of a comparable Ipod.  AND I still get 50 bucks back in the rebate deal that came with it.  Absolutely awesome!  After rebate, my entire purchase ended up costing me less than $200 dollars!  That's right, I got a 30 GB mp3 player and accessories, both necessary and optional, for less than $200 bucks.  I am in the catbird seat with this one.  I definitely recommend the Zen Vision M.

<Title>ZEN better than ipod
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had an ipod for 3 years and I recently switched to the ZEN and I absolutely love it. I had a few issues with getting movies onto the zen but i downloaded some free software to convert the movie.  The zen comes with the ability to record radio and voice without an attachment, unlike the ipod. Also, there is not any copyright issues with the zen. Overall it's a great product and I would recommend it over the ipod.

<Title>Potential But Beware Hard Drive Issues
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Creative Zen Vision M suffered a "harddisk failure" that rendered it completely useless less than 4 months after I bought it. That being said, here are my pros and cons of the product when it worked:  PROS:  + Decent battery life + Capable FM tuner - I personally got good reception with it. You can also record FM + Videos display well on the screen. Colors have good saturation and images are crisp + Sound quality is good + 30 GB is more than enough space for music lovers + Has a voice recorder function (although it takes a few steps to get to it)  CONS:  - Charging. The Zen doesn't come with an AC Adapter. You must plug it into a USB port on your computer to charge it. Not only that, but there's also a separate adapter that you have to plug into the Zen first before you can even connect it to the USB cable. Heaven forbid you lose the small adapter.  - Hard Drive Failures. I know I mentioned it above, but it sounds like I'm not the only one that this has happened to. Hard Drives should not fail only 4 months after normal use. And no, I didn't use my Zen as a frisbee or anything that would have warranted an early death.  - Included Software. Ugh. Creative's included software with the Zen is uninspiring to say the least. Yes it's functional, but barely. The Video Converter software couldn't convert half the videos I tried using. And this is a player that touts that it can play almost any video file.  - Bulk. The Zen Vision M is fairly bulky compared to other mp3 players, especially compared to flash players.  - The Touchpad/Front Buttons. I guess either you'll love it or hate the interface. I personally thought the vertical touchpad was kinda neat at first, but after awhile it actually became annoying. The biggest problem for me was the touchpad's accuracy while scrolling up/down lists. It liked to skip items. I tried adjusting the sensitivity but it didn't seem to help. The other buttons work okay, but overall I was disappointed.  - It was unable to resume where it left off of on a song whenever I turned the player off for a couple hours. I would turn it back on and it would be in the middle of playing a completely different song every time. This made it impossible to listen to long podcasts or audiobooks.  - Lock-ups. A lot of MP3 players seem to have this problem and my Vision M was no exception.  Overall, I think with some changes the Vision M could've been a good mp3 player. And if the bundled Video Converter software worked more than 50% of the time, I think it would be a good video player as well. However, the hard drive issues and the touchy interface (no pun intended) make this a difficult product for me to recommend.

<Content>This is an amazing product. I have had it for at least 6 months now, and so far, there are absolutly no problems with it whatsoever. I love my Zen, and it is a much better product than an iPod video. The only problem with it, is if you are switching from an iPod to the Zen... becuase of DRM'd music, and Apple trying to lock you in with the iPod, any bought songs off of iTunes won't work with your Zen. This obviously is not a flaw with the Zen, its Apple being Apple.

<Title>Great mp3 player. Much more versitile than ipod
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great player. I don't think I can say more about it. I believe all the other colors at the time of MY purchase still included the wall adaptor. Mine, unfortunately didn't. Just b/c it's the black model.  It does have scratching problems, but is more resilient than the iPod. I went from the iPod to this. You cannot use iTunes w/ this product yet. No 3rd party applications nor iTunes native support exist. My only "it could be better" for the Vision:M is to get a bigger HD. They only have 30 and 60 right now. I went with the 30 because I didn't want to spend more $$ and hate it. It's got tons better color than the iPod, has Radio which is good for walking (only works for fairly strong signals, though), can support wma (WMP 11+), mp3, and pretty much any avi file you can toss its way. XVid, DivX, etc etc etc. Great for home movies. The interface is semi-customizable, which is nice. You can use your own pics or theirs. It has different themes, it shows album art, syncs with a few good software pieces. I use MediaMonkey. You can use their native player, but it kind of blows.  The screen is a bit bigger or about the same size as the iPod. The only thing I would suggest before buying is to take a good hard look at the 60GB model, and perhaps consider the bigger screen. Hopefully they come out with a touch screen model, though, because it's kind of cumbersome-looking in regards to buttons.  The other great thing: The sound is far superior to the iPod if you get a nice piece of earbuds.

<Title>High Quality Media Player
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this about a month ago and after loading almost 500 songs & numerous photos & videos, the unit stopped responding. I was on the phone with Creative for 30 minutes trying to reset the unit & it still wasn't responding. They suggested I send it back to J&R Music for a refund or exchange. I did as they suggested and it took about 2-1/2 weeks for me to get a replacement. It seems to be working fine now. The sound quality is at least as good as an Ipod, if not better. The screen resolution is almost as clear as my High Definition TV -- the colors really jump out at you. The unit is easy to navigate and the controls are not too touch sensitive. The software it came with was easy to download. Unlike the ipods, you can sync music to the Zen from many media players such as Yahoo Music, Windows Media Player, etc. The difference between a unit like this and an ipod nano is that all your media is stored on a hard drive (ZEN) vs. storing on a flash drive (ipod). I would recommend this Zen to anyone who appreciates good quality sound with a high resolution color screen and the high capacity storage that the 30 GB allows.

<Title>wonderful
<Date>Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned my black Creative Zen player for about a month now. It took a while to get use to - but so did my other mp3 players. The battery life is decent, I could work a full shift (10.5 hrs) without fear of the battery dying.. and part of the next day if I forgot to charge it. I have about 2,000 songs on it right now and havent had any problems with it. Windows Media Player is so much easier to use then my last nightmare of Sonic Stage. The sound is amazing on it, and the volume goes fairly loud. The display is the most amazing thing about it, the colors are so bright.. but it also kills your battery. I almost always have my player set at the lowest dimness possible except when I want to show it off. I enjoy having a radio and being able to record directly from it and the reception works just fine for me.  Onto the dislikes.. the black scratches like no other. I was extremely careful with it and it scratched so easily. I did find a silicone type of case for it on amazon, but the damage had already been done. I did however drop the player from about 4 to 5 feet onto the cement recently and this thing is durable (pushed off a counter - wouldnt recommend it!). Ive never owned a harddrive based player before, but you can tell the difference. Theres a slight delay while switching between songs and a longer delay when choosing to randomnly play all songs. These things really didn't bother me when weighed against the pros of this player. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!

<Title>I love this MP3 player!
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not a particularly high-tech user of this device and have to admit that it's probably over-engineered for my needs.  But the Creative Zen Vision:M 30 GB MP3 and video player caught my eye when I was shopping for an iPod, and since it rated so highly in the tech reviews I decided to buy it.   My main interests are listening to albums and books, and being able to put photos of my family and friends under the nose of anyone who looks as if they might stand still for it.  The Creative does all that perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  Downloading and organizing my files is a cinch.  I haven't got much video loaded but I can see that for my needs I'll never run out of space.  I'm amazed at the crisp screen definition!  You can see every twinkle in my granddaughters' eyes.  Another big plus for me is the length of time this little object of desire plays on a single charge, especially playing audio.  I've never had to charge it in the car, it just plays and plays.  The controls are easy to use and the bookmarking is very easy -- helpful to me when listening to books.  My Creative Zen:Vision just looks and feels good and I take it everywhere with me.  A year ago I'd have said this technology wasn't for me.  I'm SO glad I changed my mind!

<Title>Player Works great - supporting Software is lousy!!
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen 30 gig player and it works really nice.  But, the software that they send you to download for it is not compatible with any files that you may already have in your iTunes library.  You can load the files on the player and they work fine.  But when you dock your player and look at it through the Creative Media software, you cannot see any of the songs from your iTunes, even though they are generic MP3 files.  So you can't use their software to build any playlists - it really sucks.  The only MP3 files that will show up on the software are those that you rip from cd's directly through the Creative Media software. I ended up using Window Media Player 11 that sees everything and I can build my playlists through it.  But it is slower and more bulky, but I don't have a choice. BE AWARE!!  They will try to solve your problem, but it can't be done.  Nor do they answer their phone for their Customer Support - it just rings and rings and rings.  You have to do it all by email.  Buyer beware.

<Title>Bringing Zen to my life
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my creative zen vision last month and I am really enjoying it!  It was easy to learn to use and navigate, the thing I am still working on is transferring/syncing correctly, but once I master that it will be a perfect product.....    The sound and picture quality is amazing.  I just recently spent too much time in airports and my Zen made it bearable.  It got me through a whole season of a show that I was watching.  I would chose my Zen again any day.  I also would recommend getting a car radio transmitter, and a good case to protect the screen.  Again, go for it, the sound is great, the picture quality amazing and it is easy to use.

<Title>Good player for a certain clientele
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen Vision: M is a great player for those of you wishing to listen to music in your car or at your house.  The sound quality, in my experience, is superior to ipod, and the battery life and controls are satisfactory.  The problems begin, however, if you wish to use this player as part of your workout.  Because Creative is forced to use a hardisk with the Zen, the player is not suited to exercising (even though there is an armband for sell).  I, personally, have very sparingly used this player for running, but have heard from others that after exercising with it for a while there player has begun to freeze consistently.  Compounding this problem is the lack of customer assistance that Creative offers.  Unless you invest in a full warranty, which costs over half the price of the player, there is little chance of getting assistance with problems, let alone being sent a replacement player.  Despite these problems, I have imensely enjoyed my Zen as I commute everyday.  If you are looking for a good player with a lot of memory and pretty good battery life this is the one.  If you're looking for something more versatile I suggest you opt for the smaller memory flash player that is more durable with no moveable parts.

<Title>a beast
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This thing is STURDY. I have dropped it several times from like, 6 feet and it hasn't broken. Unlike the ipod, you can choose a background for your interface as well. This lends a sense of real personal ownership to this player. The only real downfalls it has are a sensitive touch interface and the fact it freezes up sometimes.When it freezes, it's easy to reset with a paperclip. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ITUNES! Plus, you can copy media files from this onto Windows Media player with no additional software. While this thing isn't perfect, I have given it 5 stars to compete with the 'trendyness factor' the ipod has in its advantage.

<Title>The Big Question
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well the Zen was purchased as a gift for my father for father's day.  My brother liked the features so much that he purchased one shortly thereafter.  However we have been unable to get one that even turns on.  I've downloaded all the product support from Creative Labs, as well as the new firmware.  The frustrating part about it is this is the second unit that is DOA.  My brother purchased his at a local store and works flawlessly, were my father's came from an online source.  The stupid thing will not even turn on.  And it takes "4" weeks to get a new one????!!!!  I'm not really happy at the moment.  My brother's functions awesome, no trouble at all, and he loves it.  My father's however is well ...... well you get the point.  Sorry B&H.  I spoke with the tech folks in "India" and they suggested a trick to get the batteries to fire up. The problem they said was the unit had sat too long and run out of juice.  So they recommended that I plug and unplug the unit 15 times waiting about 3 seconds before replugging the unit. Amazing it worked and things are running just fine. So the problem is B&H Photo Video...must be why their price is so low...over inventory on the shelf too long.

<Title>Zen v. Ipod: Two Big Lessons in Careful Shopping
<Date>Sun Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife bought me a Creative Labs Zen Mp3 player for my birthday. It's the most wonderful present I ever got, next to her and my children. She knew there were two criteria for me: a really good sounding mp3 player with enough memory to hold a substantial portion of my huge music collection. The rest was up to her.   Naturally, one of the candidates was the Apple IPod, and the other, Apple's biggest rival to date, the Creative Labs Zen Vision M. Both are pretty comparable in features, but that's where the comparison ends.   Before I go into how my wife bought mine, let me explain how I might have bought one. My first impulse was to buy a used IPod, which would have been a horrible move. Another reason is that it didn't have nearly the amount of memory I wanted on my Mp3 player. But that leads to my second potential downfall: instant gratification.   When I want something, I want it RIGHT AWAY. Instant gratification has always been one my biggest weaknesses. I would have rushed to Circuit City or one of the other "big box" electronics stores, compared the ten or so options available there, and would have walked out with an overpriced IPod because I would get instant gratification. I would have owned the most popular brand of Mp3 player. This would have been a very bad decision for many reasons.   As with just about every financial decision she makes, my wife's first move was to go online and do some research into Mp3 players in general. There she found what's important to look for in an Mp3 player, and what's not so important that marketing experts make seem important. Once she's narrowed the field down that far, she started comparing products.   Amazon.com is the best way to go for comparison shopping for two reasons. First, they give a good baseline price by giving their own price as well as prices for their stable of marketplace sellers who sell the same products new and used. This gives the buyer a very good place to start. In my experience shopping, these prices are always substantially lower than retail.   The second great feature about buying electronics from Amazon is their customer reviews. Amazon has spent years cultivating good, bad and ugly reviews of the majority of the products they sell.   doing so, my wife found that a LOT of people have had a LOT of trouble with their IPods. After a year or less, many I-Pods begin locking up and constantly needed to be reset for little or no reason, or they were failing to work at all. When reporting these problems to Apple, their pleas and complaints fell on deaf ears. The process of getting the IPods fixed proved expensive and time-consuming to the point where the owners gave up completely and moved on to another brand.   The Zen Vision M, meanwhile had a lot of great reviews from buyers, many of whom had owned IPods in the past. My wife also found that their warranties were more substantial, and that they had a better record for honoring the warranties, although given the quality of the product, they probably don't need to do so as often.   Thus, on my birthday I opened up the box to find a beautiful lime green Creative Zen Vision M instead of an IPod and I couldn't be happier. Besides having a way cooler name, the Zen goes with me everywhere, and will eventually have to be surgically removed. In buying my present, my wife got a better price, a better brand, a better product and a much happier husband.

<Title>Almost perfect ... almost...
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great player. When my beloved creative micro 5gb died, their was only choice for a replacement- another creative. I have also had the 256mb muvo (that one died after one year of constant use and reformatting). Then I went with the micro, which was a gem, it really was, but it too died after many falls to the floor at the gym. When this died, I again turned to creative, only I wanted bigger, better, and video would be nice too. I have all these things which the Zen Vision. (I love the pink color). This player is close to perfect but not quite. The size is an issue. Unlike ipods which are slimmer, this is a bulky player. if you like to work out with music, this one is a bit too big for running, lifting wts, etc. But other than working out, the size is okay, it's not that heavy, and the screen size is great for watching video. It is very difficult to find a case, unless you get one that is custom designed for this player (not likely to find in retail stores, only online). I never wanted the ipod because i don't like people telling me what to do, and w/ipods you have to choose their precious i-tunes, or you are out of luck. With the zen vision, i use the programs i choose and it has worked perfectly. It recognizes almost any music formats, and can convert music and videos if it doesn't support the format. I have televisions shows, movies, music, etc that I transfered from my own library without a hitch. I have had this player since December and haven't expenienced any problems. Creative makes great players, but as with ANY electronic, an extended warrenty is a must if you pay over 100.00. Otherwise- you're gambling. And that is the truth with any MP3 player.

<Title>hands down better than iPod video...accessories an issue
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought myself this mp3 player on Xmas of 2006.  Simply put: it beats iPod video hands down.  Love the fact that you can throw any video format and it plays it.  If not, included software does the conversion job for you.  The only "issue" (that's why I'm not giving it the 5 stars) is finding accessories (that's the only regard were I envy iPod owners).  To top it all, the connector is proprietary; I wanted to purchase a docking boombox and ended up buying an overpriced one at Creative's store.

<Title>Loved it at first...
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had one of these and it was stolen.  I really liked it and so bought another one but when I upgraded the software for the Zencast organizer, it quit converting the videos I previously downloaded.  Now I can't download videos until I get this figured out.  I tried to get the Creative Labs support to help me but they were worthless.  I downloaded another video converter and it works but it is a lot of work.  This is the only problem I have with this product.

<Title>This trusty little powerhouse will serve you WELL........
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only reason I'm on here to write THIS article is because my 30gb Zen Vision M was stolen out of my backpack YESTERDAY, so I'm back here on Amazon to buy a Zen Vision W. But don't get it twisted. I'm only buying the W because I decided that I may as well go "out with the old, in with the new". Before my Zen Vision M was stolen, it was my best friend. When I first bought it a few years ago, I bought a leather case for it to protect it from scratches. I'm a jogger, so I of course took it jogging with me. I can honestly say that I dropped it at LEAST 20 times during various jogging sessions, and other than a hairline crack in the upper right corner from a particularly violent drop while jogging, it never stopped working. Also, it is the only player that I know of that can play all the video formats that it does WITHOUT having to convert them. Video is just as important to carry around as audio, so I needed a device that would play as many video formats as possible, and I didn't want to have to convert half the videos before being able to play them on the player. This player is PERFECT for that. It plays mpg, DiVX, XViD and avi formats without having to convert them. Avi is at this point the most widely used video compression format for quality videos.      The only drawback to this device is that infrequently, it would freeze while playing. I'll say that it happened on average maybe twice a month to me, and that's considering the fact that I used it EVERY DAY. I wasn't really bothered by the fact that it froze up a couple times a month. Now, if it were to do it every DAY or something, then I'd feel differently. When it froze, you'd have to reset it by gently inserting a pin into the reset pinhole, then it would reboot.      I would definitely recommend this product for audio AND video playing. The only advantage that the Ipod has over it is the thickness. It's about twice as thick as an IPod, but other than that, the Ipod can't even compare to it in terms of compatibility with various audio and video formats.

<Title>So Awesome
<Date>Sun Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Vision M two days ago, and I already have all my songs on it, and some of my favorite movies. It took me a while getting the hang of the file conversions, but it's not too hard to learn. I love the organization, the easy scroller, and the amazing sound quality. Before I bought this I had a Zen Touch which was made in like early 2000, but the scroller finally wore out and didn't work. Besides the limited accessories for this item, I believe this product is ten times better than the video iPods. You don't have to go through iTunes, you can drag and drop folders and files instead of having to update your iPod(which gets old fast, and you have to keep all the songs on your computer). Kind of experimentally, I put movies of different file types into my Vision, and they all worked. They take 10-15 minutes to convert if it's not the right format, but it's a worthwhile process. I love this product.
