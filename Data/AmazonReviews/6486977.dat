<Content>This is a nice size mp3 player. It's not too big and it's not so small that you can't read the LCD screen. It's easy to use (which is why I got it). You can download just about anything on to it. I love mine and I've had it for at least a year without any problems. Most of the people I know have had problems with the screens shattering on theirs, so far mine is like new.  
<Overall>5
