<Title>Good Idea - Needs Improvement
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A cool accessory with major shortcomings.  The LCD screen isn't aligned with the case's window on mine, which makes it look kind of cheap if you look closely.  The docking adapter fits the 40GB iPod very poorly; it's flimsy, moves around a lot and is way too slender for the docking space, so it barely holds the iPod in place in the dock.  If it moves even slightly you lose the charging connection and end up draining the iPod's battery without realizing it.  I agree with the previous reviewer regarding the unit's "bugginess" -- you often hear an annoying buzzing radio signal through the speakers when the iJet is communicating with the iPod, often in the middle of a song.  If you have a long list of artists on your iPod, the iJet takes an excruciatingly long time to load the Artist List.  If you switich back and forth between Playlist mode and Artist mode, you have to wait for it to reload the iPod's entire list of each one, every time.  If you want to find an artist that begins with a letter well down the alphabet you have to scroll from A-to whatever letter it is, which can take forever and make your thumb sore in the process.  If you scroll too quickly, it freezes up and just displays horizontal lines on the screen and you have to begin again.  If you scroll too fast during playback, it tends to get behind (or ahead) by a song or two and display incorrect track information.  It also displays gibberish characters wherever an accent appears in a title or name.  I use mine fairly often, but don't consider it much of an improvement over previous "one-way" iPod remotes.  It could have been be so much better.

<Content>I ordered this item for the purpose of concealing my Ipod in the car. For the most part, it works as indicated but it has a few limitations in the form of lag time from receiver to transponder and powering unit off and on when not in use or when turning off your car. Conclusion: You can ignore its minor flaws for the price and it's RF range.
