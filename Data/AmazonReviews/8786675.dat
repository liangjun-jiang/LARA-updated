<Title>My favorite MP3 player so far
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've used just about every MP3 player there is and this one is right there with the best of them. It's small light and extremely easy to use. You don't need ANY software to upload songs to it. The device shows up like a drive on your PC. You have the option of using Windows Media Player 11 to upload songs, but I'd rather just drag and drop songs or use my Napster subscription to upload songs from Napster's huge library. I thought 2GB wouldn't be enough but it is so easy to upload songs when my mood changes that it's never been an issue for me. If you like to watch movies then you may want to go with the larger 4GB (NWZS616) or 8GB (NWZS618) versions of this model since a typical movie takes up ~700K memory after you compress it to QVGA. If you want a larger screen size then you can get the NWZA815. That model is basically the same player with a larger screen. It also has a heavier metal shell, but it does not have an FM tuner like the NWZS615, and I wanted the FM tuner. I typically use my player in shuffle mode in my car and if I don't want to hear a song, it is a breeze to reach down and click just to the right of the center button to skip to the next song. I honestly can't see how anyone would be disappointed with this player especially when you consider the great price.

<Title>Couldn't be happier
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got this little fella as a gift yesterday, and I could not be happier.  Loading music is very easy and navigating is a breeze.  The only problem I have is the earbuds.  Maybe it is just my stupid ears, but they are a bit uncomfortable.  I wanted an ipod, but am glad I didn't get one after using this for only a few hours.

<Title>Awesome!

<Content>My son loves this mp3 player, I puchased it for him for Christmas after a thorough investigation into different mp3 players. The walkman sound clarity is "Sony" (meaning outstanding!). It includes FM radio, which IPODS don't have, not to mention how user friendly it is. Let me just say this, I played with his for awhile & ultimately purchased a cute little pink one for myself ( I just exchanged the goofy little shuffle my husband purchased and got a few bucks back to boot!) I would highly recommend this!

<Title>isn't it about the music for most of us? save$ go Sony
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Son owns an Ipod..big deal, with $300.00 in pocket I went to Walmart for the heralded Ipod,I got playin around with the $90.00 Sony, in an instant some little voice (maybe a person under the counter) instructed me to pay the 90 plus tax and use the rest to buy a printer I desperately needed with the money i saved.ame home and used Media 10 to down load and am truely surprised at the very musical sound, and imaging.It's a small rascule, best not drop it when Fido's around, he'll lick it up like book of stamps. Learning curve ain't bad and as a musician, I am using it toreplay my praticing and even that sounds good.. well maybe OK. Ipod, shmypod, save some money.. after all to most of us isn't about the music? This may be a caveate' however, as far as I can tell, its set up for WINDOWS MEDIA 11 player... so user friendly I feel I'm being treated like a school kid. It will work with the MEDIA 10 but is not so friendly. After about 40 hours of use I still am amazed at the reproduction and amazed is not a word I use much, maybe its a pefect combo of earbuds to amp but I am hearing what I never knew was there and I am not new to these gizmo's or high end home components.  My little bugger is filled to capacity with the likes of mississippi fred mcdowell, Jessie mae hemphill, R.L. Burnside, Isman Bracey and very obscure cuts, the shuffle is quick and get some nice surprises, the ergo might have been a bit more thought out but I am from the 60's. Almost lost it twice, going to get the walkman carrying case, attach a chain to it and nail it to my head. I started losing my faith in Sony with the new era of high tech but they got something here.. Want vid get much more memory, this is a musicians high.

<Title>Who needs an ipod?
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Several years I purchased a 2nd generation ipod which I adored. I downloaded music from Comcast Rhapsody and synced it with my ipod with no problem whatsoever. One sad day, as a result of leaving it in the car overnight and repeatedly freezing the battery, the ipod died. I then sprung for an 80 GB 5th generation ipod. It was sleek and shiny and smaller than the first one. I was in heaven! That is, until I actually tried to use the thing. Apparently between the last purchase and this one, Apple determined that I was going to use itunes for my music downloads and that was final. I hate itunes. They do not carry a large selection of the type of music I like to listen to and they only give you approximately a 10-second preview of each song. Once you purchase the song, you can put it on your device but God forbid something happen like purchasing a new pc - you are unable to get it again OR sync what you already paid for and put on your device to your new pc. This infuriated me. As well, it does not work AT ALL with my new Linux laptop and the entire experience left a bad taste for me. They are entirely too restrictive with what I choose to do with MY device and MY music once I purchase it.   Out of frustration, I purchased this inexpensive little Walkman. When taking everything from the box the Walkman was so small I nearly discarded it. It appears much larger in the photos. It is certainly attractive and super-portable. Within 10 minutes, I had it connected to my pc and in the process of transferring 300 songs to it. Sure it is lacking in the storage space on the ipods but do you REALLY need 80 GB or even 20? I did not. I never used more than 3 after YEARS of transferring files.   This is definitely a device worth considering if want something simplistic to store your music and are not heavy into collecting photos and videos, etc... I purchased Nanos for my children during the holidays and I am so sorry I had not thought to take a look at these.
