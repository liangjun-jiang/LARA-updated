<Title>Little Girl LOVE
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My five year old daughter LOVES this! She wanted an iPod but I chose this instead. She wears it on a lanyard around her neck & rocks out. I like that I am in control of her music. We also have downloaded some podcast stories for her & it has been a great bedtime companion too. LOVE this item!

<Title>Ok for kids
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave this to my neice for christmas and she loved it.  It only downloads mp3 type files, but it is easy to work with.  The sound is ok, not even as good as an iPod, but good enough for a young child to fool around with.

<Title>disappointing product
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was really excited to purchase this product for my son, but was really disappointed in the product. The seal for one end never closed correctly, the size of the product is tiny, and I could not easily use the product. The forward and backward buttons are useless and you are suppose to be able to shake it forward the song, and this never worked. I have purchased several apple ipods and will purchase one for my son, for the extra few $ it is worth it!

<Title>My 6 year old loves it -- even though the bottom cover doesn't stay on
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son got this for Christmas and so far loves it.  The only flaw is the bottom cover constantly falls off.  So much so that he leaves it hanging.  It bothers the heck out of me but he doesn't notice. In general it seems like a design flaw, having the bottom cover twist off in the same motion that skips to the next song, but I can't believe that it is this bad on all of them.  I'm taking it back to exchange it for another.

<Title>Wow - What a great MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Frankly, we thought we were buying a toy. It was pink, small and inexpensive. Who would have thought that it would turn out to be a great MP3 player for kids? Says it's for older kids buy my 4-year-old loves it. Easy to use for her as long as I load the music - which I prefer anyway! Amazing amount of technology in a small hand-held device. Only downside is that you can't see which songs are next. But at this price, who really cares.

<Title>She loves it!!
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product!!  I was unsure about the built in speaker, but it is a great thing.  My six year old is small and the earbuds were too big for her (have not found any small enough yet) so the speaker allows her to listen even without the earbuds.  It is easy to use, easy to load songs onto, and it is just cute!!  I was also concerned about the shake to change songs thing.  I was afraid that it would skip songs as she jumped around dancing, but you actually have to press the power button as you shake to get it to switch songs.  And why shake it when all you have to do is twist the bottom ring a bit to go to the next song?  I love this and so does my daughter.  It was her favorite Christmas gift!!

<Title>Purchase for my 8-year-old
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the Sansa Shaker for my 8-year-old daughter. Pros:  Built-in speaker---she loved sharing her music        Ease of use---no menu is involved; easy twist or shake to change tunes and volume        Price---very reasonable for 1GB  Cons:  No menu means finding a particular song becomes tedious as number of tunes increases.  Overall:  Good choice for you kids but unsatisfactory for tweens and up.

<Title>Wonderful music player for young children!
<Date>Sat Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Sansa Shaker for my handicapped son. My son Shawn functions at about a 6 year old level.  This product is the best toy I've had in a long time for Shawn.  Because there are minimal buttons it was very simple for Shawn to operate.  Also the SD card is easy to load & multiple SD cards can be created to make a library of various genres of songs for him to listen to.  A special feature of this MP3 player is that it has a speaker so you can listen to songs without the headphones.  Great product for kids!!!!

<Title>Daughter loves it
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My daughter received this for Christmas and was hooked right off the bat.  Easy to use.  The little speaker is a huge plus since I don't want her with ear plugs in her ears all the time and they don't fit well anyway to small ears.  Battery usage is as described - though given it's popularity still means that we are chewing through batteries.  Get rechargable batteries...

<Title>Nice for Kids, but not perfect
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this MP3 player for my 4 year old son.  It does what I wanted: It plays lots of different songs that he likes, with the ability for me to get rid of ones that annoy the grown-ups.  It does so while minimizing the dangers of using headphones on a toddler (both hearing and stranulation).  It is a fairly primitive and limited device, so don't expect it to replace your iPOD.  Pros: --Small, comfortable to hold, good sound, lots of capacity, easy to setup (only file manager drag and drop is available) through either a card reader or the included USB cable). --Has support for two headphones (not included).  I didn't try this, but with my two boys, this may come in handy for car trips when they're older.  Cons: --It can get quite loud, and when the speaker is pressed against the ear, this cannot be good for hearing, certainly no better than headphones. --Hard for a 4 year old to operate.  The button is a little difficult to push, and must be held down for a couple seconds to do anything but pause the playing (leaving the device on and consuming batteries of course).  Try as I might, I cannot convince him to hold the button long enough while shaking to shuffle tracks, he just says it doesn't work. --Shuffle (hold button and shake) doesn't actually choose a random track, it just skips a few (1-3?) tracks in the playlist.  When my playlist has 1000 items in it, and it comes to the dreaded "Country Music for Kids" section.  It takes a dozen shuffles beofore even moving to the next album, not what anyone with a grown-up media player would put up with.  PS: the playlist appears to be determined by the order which windows copied the files, not by any sensible order. --The MP3 decoding is buggy.  Occasionally (maybe 1 in 20 tracks) it will play a track vveerryy sslloowwllyy.  At first I thought it was due to the sampling rate of the track (it only supports the standard CD rate), but upon skipping ahead and then re-winding, the track is back to playing normal so it is an intermittant bug.  This happens even on brand new batteries, so it isn't in the below list. --It eats batteries fast, and when low acts erratically.  Some of the signs of low batteries: will not turn off, shake mechanism no longer works, or shuts off unexpectedly.  Two weeks after Christmas, and I've already recharged the battery twice (Duracell NiMH 1xAAA).  It doesn't help that my kids put it in pause mode instead of turning it off, but still. --The end cap isn't perfect.  In two weeks, it only fell off once, and that was when I was using it not my son.  But it shouldn't fall off at all, or the little brother has access to both a AAA battery and a memory card for chewing on.  If it is at all targeted for kids it should have the screw on the battery cover that is on every kids toy these days. --The included music is 4 kids songs and 4 classical songs, nothing too spectactular, but ok demo music until you can get to a computer to delete them. --The CD included is a waste, PDF version of the 8 page user manual.  Conclusion: Buy it for yourself to listen to when you don't want to wear headphones (car, desk, bed, etc), put only your most favorite playlist on it, and lock your kids in another room when they play their leapfrog toys that play the same 5 songs over and over and over and over again.

<Content>I bought 1 of these for each of my boys for christmas.  They haven't put them down since. Putting the music on the players was extremely easy...nothing to download and install on my computer. My only complaint is that my youngest sons seems to overheat and shut down fairly frequently. Again they use them all the time so i'm not sure if he really is just wearing it out.

<Content>My daughter age 9 wanted an Ipod for Christmas.  Will searching the internet I came across this item.  She had heard of it and I had seen it on the Today Show.  I thought the item would be more age appropiate and I was right.  She really loves it.  It is very easy to use, directions for setup is easy and it just made an all around great gift..  I would definitely recommend this product to others with children that are in that between age...

<Content>I bought this Shaker for my 4 year old daughter! She loves it! The good thing I love about it that she can listen to it through speaker, without headphone. That's a very small and is very easy to use! The more she uses it the more batteries I need to buy though... I need to find rechargable ones and then it doesn't cost that much to keep it. Thanks Amazon!

<Title>Ideal first mp3 for kids
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my niece when she turned 5, and she absolutely loves it. Very easy to use (not for me, but im not a kid), and she has fun listening to the sound effects when skiping tracks. I bought the 512MB version cuz I dont think a kid knows that many songs, and it seems to be enough. It's a great first gadget for young kids and it gives them confidence around technology, which I like. She normally uses the speaker, and the sound it's alright for a low cost mp3, and I dont have to worry about headphones and the hearing damage, bla bla bla. I do recommend this, its a nice looking product, easy to use, worth the money.

<Title>Good product for the price
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my 9 year old son.  He enjoys listening to it while he is playing (on speaker mode) and on the bus (headphones).  Overall I am pleased with the product.  The sound quality is adequate for a kid, and the battery lasts a fairly good amount of time, even on speaker.  My only real problem is the bottom twist off where the battery and card are inserted does not stay tight.  Luckily the bottom lid is held on by a cord, but it is rather irritating to have it always fall open.  Overall, a good buy for the money.

<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great mp3 player, especially for the preteen since it has its own speaker and does not need ear buds.  Because it has its own speaker, my wife loves it (we are getting another one for her).  The only down side is the lack of a shuffle play, the random function does jump somewhere in your list of songs, but then continues sequentially from there.  Memory card size is not a problem.  We had an extra sd card from our camera (we went from a 1gig to a 2gig card) and can now switch between them quite easily.  I would recommend rechangable batteries.

<Content>We got the Sansa shaker for both our kids for Christmas.  My son's lasted 1 day before shutting down.  The replacement lasted a whole 2 days.  Now my daughter's shut down but it's after the return time frame so it looks like we're stuck.  Unfortunately my kids loved it so now we're stuck trying to find something similar.  Definitely not recommended!

<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this as a gift for my 6 year old. It's recommended for an older child but she was able to learn how to use it pretty quickly. The sound quality is great and the battery life is decent. If you buy a name brand 8-12 pack of batteries, it should last for a month at least. She likes to dance and on her birthday brought it to school and it was an instant hit. I highly recommended this product for a young to preteen child, the price is right and it's very user friendly.

<Content>My daughter is 27 months and she loves to listen to her music on this MP3 player! I bought this for her in hopes that mommy and daddy wouldn't have to hear her music as much, but as soon as she realized there was the "convenient" internal speaker, that idea went out the window.  All in all, this was a great buy!
