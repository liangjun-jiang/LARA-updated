<Content>This is the first CD turntable that I've ever owned, so my experience is limited. Although, I have been using Technics 1200s for years now and found this turntable to be just as responsive and finely tuned, with a lot more bells and whistles that kind of take away the need for mixing ability by giving the user the ability to do all kinds of magic tricks. Anyone interested in the art of djing, hear me out, this will only add to your ability to create and open more doors to what can be done as a dj, don't fear the future, embrace it or be naturally selected. Peace.
