<Title>the best mp3 player
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't feel like writing a long review, so i'll sum this device up:  -Amazing Sound Quality -Great Improvements from firmware updates -Amazing Video Quality -Good User Interface  I can honestly say that the sound quality in this player is so amazing, that I have tripled the amount of time listening to music compared to my previous devices: Creative Zen Vision:W, Creative Microphoto, and Ipod Shuffle. I highly recommend this device to everyone.

<Title>Excellent mp3 player. Great alternative to the iTOUCH
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Samsung made a player for people who don't want to feed the evil "Apple" machine, or people who'd actually like a radio on their player. That was a reason why I picked this one over the iTOUCH. There were other reasons too... My last player was a iPOD 30 gb video, which had the mini hard drive in it. the 8 gb P2 uses flash memory, so it works so much better if you are active. (no moving parts)  Also unlike the iPOD family of products, you aren't forced to use only use the apple music and audio files. I would put videos on it and not all of them would convert right... and I had to convert all my mp3s to mp4.. but not so with the P2... and pretty much every video works on it too.   The one feature that became the catcher for me was the bluetooth capability. At least at this point in time, I don't believe there are any iPODs or Zunes that support Bluetooth. I am getting a bluetooth headset over the holidays, so I haven't had a chance to try it yet.  The sound quality is good. It's actually better sound for music than video... the headphones that come with the player are okay... not great.  unlike the iTOUCH, there are only a 4 and 8 GB models where the iTouch is 8 and 16 gb.. but it's also $50 more expensive (between the 8gb P2 and the 8gb iTouch.  There are some disadvantages, but they aren't major: 1) you are limited to 8gb, but I never used more than 8 gb on my iPod, why have more than you will use? 2)fingerprints get on it really easy... so easy a CSI tech could tell who you are just from the print on the P2 :P however I'm sure the iTouch is the same way, you just need to wipe the prints off. 3) There aren't a bunch of accessories for the P2, and probably won't be alot of them, unlike the iPod or Zune. But I think the other reasons why I wanted the P2 make up for it.  I'm very satisfied. I can't give 5 star because it's not perfect, but it's the best for what I need it for.

<Title>Bluetooth Limitations
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i really wanted to give this product five stars but it has some real bluetooth limitations. i purchased this product primarily so i could be unwired in the gym. i also purchased this product because of its high quality sound ratings. it turns out in the bluetooth mode all the sound features are turned off and the equalizer and sound enhancement does not function. Also the FM radio does not work over Bluetooth, so if you want any sound enhancement or if you want to listen to the radio you still have to have those wired earphones/headphones around. i am using this unit with a Sony DRBT21G/B headset and all the remote control features work quite nicely. Sound is good but not as good as it could be if the equalizer was available. Bluetooth range is very good with line of sight operation out to the spec 10 meters with no problem. Except for these limitations the unit is a beautiful design and even with big fingers the touch display works well (although a bit slow on the equalizer screen when you do have wired headphones plugged in). The display is clear and bright and the menus are easy to navigate. A little nit is you have to carry another cable around as Samsung did not use a standard USB plug on the unit (probably because it is too thin). Also would have been nice to have include a mico SD slot so you could add memory.

<Content>I have loved this product. It is easy to use with Windows XP, and Media Player will sync up with it no problem. Great video and music quality. Small and portable, I work out with it pretty much everyday and it doesn't get in the way at all (Get the armband for it). I would reccomend this player to anyone interested in an alternative to the iPod series.

<Title>Sleek and Functional
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  Beautiful large widescreen, excellent sound quality, thin and light, better than average battery life, buttons on the outside of the unit are convenient, simple navigation, ability to sync 2 separate bluetooth headsets simultaneously, simple drag-and-drop file transfers.  Cons:  Touch screen takes some getting used to, no external memory slots, no AC adapter included (only USB charger), slight lag when flipping through photos, no protective case, player can only play video files with the .svi extension (although software is readily available to convert other formats to this one), slightly on the expensive side (but the price seems to drop every month).  All in all this is a great player.  The touchscreen is not as responsive as the ipod touch, but more than adequate for navigation.  Sound quality is superb through decent headsets.  The inclusion of Bluetooth sealed the deal for me and I must say, compared to a lot of Bluetooth products out there, the setup was quick and painless.  My Motorola S9 headset automatically connects when I turn it on.  3 different menu styles are a nice touch for people with larger fingers.  Battery life is great as well.  I recommend this player to any tech-savvy person you might know that is in the market for a solid PMP that is both nice to look at and easy to use.

<Title>Great Price, Fast Delivery!
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Samsung YP-P2JCB had an excellent price and was delivered overnight as promised.  My only complaint was that the YP-P2 could have been packed better.  There was bubble pack, but the unit was loosely packed and was moving all over the place.  If it was not for the Samsung packaging, the unit may have been severely damaged.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Received this player yesterday, has great sound quality and does everything as advertised. Although, I have not had it long enough to test the battery life so I cannot comment on that. Touch screen is nice and the option to use the different menus is great. Not to mention that the firmware that came out lets you sync the player with your phone (BT). and the rumor of an expansion dock that will include wifi, a speaker, and a micro SD expansion slot and some other things, i don't know if that's very substantiated though. There is a video on the possible expansion if you search for it.

<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>There's a new sherrif in town, and his name is P2. Be flexible with your download sources and be different from everybody else. I bought a 4G as a gift for Christmas. I couldn't wait for her to open it so that I could try it. Four days later I bought my 8G. Black shows up every fingerprint, I suggest a case. They are out there. White is nice, but I couldn't wait for it. All the features speak for themselves, and the built in eq is a blast but can't be used with bluetooth unless you get headphones with their own transmitter to plug into headphone jack. Enjoy.

<Title>Next Best To An iPod Touch
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am a windows user with a very strict no iTunes status. So getting an iPod Touch was out of the question. When I saw the P2 for the first time it looked like the perfect "Touch Killer" and while the device has its faults its very good. First of all the good, it's very sleek and has a great design to impress anyone. Its lightweight, but doesn't feel flimsy in your hand. Also the interface is spectacular, there is a slight learning curve but once you get over that its simple, and very intelligently set up. The sound, picture, and video quality are all great. And the extras are very fun and cutting edge tech wise. With the addition of bluetooth connectivity for not only cell phones but also headphones. A text reader, datacasts, and an alarm clock. The bluetooth is really the feature to look at though. With the P2 you can connect bluetooth headphones or your bluetooth cell phone to the device and interlink the two. With headphones you obviously get wireless music. With the cell phone you can actually use the P2 as a phone. Samsung is obviously competing with the iPhone and while the quality is not stellar the cool factor is sky rocketed. With more bluetooth functions on the way via firmware updates (we know that there will at least be bluetooth GPS) it looks to be a very promising addition to mp3 players. One downside is that you can only connect one bluetooth device at a time, so I can only have headphones or cell phone, not both. Also the sound quality does decrease a little with the bluetooth headphones. Not enough for an average user to be upset about but its noticable. Now to the dissapointing features. The video formatting is very picky, you can only use mpeg4 or wmv formats. Also samsung doesn't have a music store for their music program (I have switched to rhapsody) but the program is hard to use and not very efficient I suggest rhapsody or windows media player. One last thing is that Samsung has agreed to work with CinemaNow and Vongo for video downloads. Both programs have proven to be very dissapointing not only in prices (as much as 20 dollars for some movies) but selection is limited and usually not very good. So as an mp3 player for songs its very, very cool, great sound quality, and the bluetooth just adds to the cool factor. But if you are looking for a solid video player go get iTunes and an iPod they really do have a lock on that area of downloads.

<Title>Easier than IPOD and easy file transfers for video and music
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted a video player that was easy to use with UnBox and other video sites other than iTunes (I have owned a 3G 40G and own a 4G 30G video and 3G Nano 4GB). Here are my initial thoughts: Fast charging via USB Easy to use Samsung proprietary software for music, video and RSS feeds Nice User Interface with Touch Screen, bright colors File transfer from UnBox a breeze, recognized immediately, very fast file transfer vs. IPOD Easy interface to add, update and load RSS feeds Drag and drop computer files for music and video Syncing is much easier than an IPOD, does not sync all of your files to obtain new files to load Updated firmware was fast and easy (Bluetooth upgrade) Great sound quality and form factor Cost per MB more affordable than an IPOD Love it so far after 1.5 hours of use; will update once I have it for a week or two. WORTH considering, like the fact that it does not require quirky Windows Media Player Purchased for $200, which was a bargain vs. the 4G IPOD Nano Considered the Creative Vision and Archos; Archos was more than I needed as I just wanted to plug and play and take this on a plane. :)   Update 1/20/2007: The Unbox and Vongo video downloads work great. Vongo at $9.95 per month gives a variety of videos to download (14 day trial). Vongo does load any video that you choose from your subscription (total rental fee per month) vs. Unbox which only lets you download purchases --- no rentals for portable video devices.  I also purchased the JabraBT620s Bluetooth headset and it paired immediately. Wireless music and video. However, the P2 does not support bluetooth with FM radio. Price for the Jabra is around $38-40 from an Amazon seller, 1/2 the price vs. other websites. When on Bluetooth, you can not change the equalizer settings.   Wish this were 16GB which would hold enough music and video; Samsung is coming out with 16GB model. However, this is not a deal breaker. Just means that you have to take videos off and swap them, and that would be the case with Vongo as you can download new videos all of the time.  When I take a plane trip this coming week, I will come back and update my review. Will be using Bose Quiet Comfort 1 with this player.

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Truly amazing player.  I have been using for a few weeks now and it is everything I expected and more.  First thing I want to address is the touch screen and the sensitivity that I have seen people mention in reviews not only here, but elsewhere and honestly in my personal experience it is just fine.  I have zero complaints or issues with it.  Does what I want when I ask it to and has been phenominal.  The sound quality is top notch.  I bought Vmoda ear-buds and have been thoroughly impressed with both, they work together to bring top notch sound quality.  The interface and file system is the last thing I want to cover as both are amazingly easy to use, understand, and navigate.  When loading music, pictures, or videos all you have to do is access the player just like a regular hard-drive.  The folders clearly labeled and the process is as simple as drag and drop.  No complicated programs to deal with.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this player!  You will be amazed by it and find it hard to put down.  It's just so much fun and such a wonderful player to use.  You might even find yourself spending more time playing with the touch-screen then listening to music.

<Title>P2 cooks big time
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have a Samsung T10 for my teenage daughter. She loves it. I bought the P2 to have the wide aspect video in addition to the audio. The P2 is just great and IMHO, 8 Gigs is the minimum storage size for a player in this class. It is really small and easy to put in my pocket, but I'd like to have some kind of clip because it is slippery and kind of hard to hold onto. Good thing the ear phone plug is really snug in the output plug because I end up holding the player dangling by the earphone lead. The touch sensitive format is way cool and the horizontal video never ceases to impress. This player is undoubtedly the best of several dozen player devices I've had over the last half dozen year. Just one gripe on start up. The directions are not clear about the left hand top slider switch which is a lock out switch. It is very handy because the touch sensitive controls change the program in my pocket without it in the up position. However, I thought i had a defective player at first until I fooled around and figured out what that did and that it had to be down to turn on the player. A little techo device first time contact panic there!   The Samsung software media player that is on the CD with the player and loads on your computer isn't very friendly, kind of clunky,  so I gave up on it and I use the Windows Media player 11 and have figured out how to rip my favorite songs from my CDs. I have sixty + albums on the P2 now and will add at least that many more from my own library. I also have all the segments of "Tripping the rift" videos, what a gas! I set it up to automatically rip any music CD I put in my optical drive, so I'm ripping music while I work. I haven't found any incompatible files. The Amazon tracks I downloaded go straight to the Media player. It is sometimes hard to find say one new track in the Media player, but syncing them onto the P2 is a breeze. I  see membership sites with songs for 10 cents! Wow.   For the P2, I'm glad it is an open format for the media and I stayed away from the Zune and the iPods. It is a great USB storage device. But I wish there was another way to charge it in addition to my laptop. I pulled out a song and emailed it to my brother. i also set up an external stereo speakers that plug into the 3.5mm plug on the P2 and listened to "Light my Fire" and "Green onions" all I wanted last night.  The FM radio is really great. I haven't found how to record directly from the FM but I haven't looked. I'm on the second firmware upgrade and I noticed a number of improvements to the touch sensitive menus and features. My only small gripe is that the FM radio is not stereo blue tooth compatible. But perhaps they will get that hooked up in the future.  My dream is to dance with my wife out on our deck without bothering the kids or neighbors. For that i need one more blue tooth headset and it is a go with the P2. Call it "Dancing in the Dark"  red  Portola Valley Ca

<Title>THE BEST MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First I would like to thank this seller for offering this item at an amazing price.  I paid the same amount for an 8gb as stores were selling for a 4gb.  Item came new as advertised and wrapped in shrink wrap.  Shipping was fast too.    The actual player is amazingly simple to use.  The video display is crystal clear and have been using it everyday for a solid month and am yet to have a problem.  The only downside to the samsung is its affiliation to rhapsody.  I found rhapsody to be very overpriced to buy music and videos.  A plus though is clicking and dragging songs from my laptop to the mp3 player takes split seconds.  Im very pleased with this items size, durability, and battery life.  It also weighs about half of the Apple video.  Though the apple has a bigger hard drive there is very little you could do to pursuade me to have made a different choice.  I would recomend this media player to anyone who loves music and video on the go.

<Content>Amazing product. When you first get it, you will be in awe of how sexy it looks.  Something I want to address is the touch screen. People are saying it is unresponsive, but this isn't true. The touch screen is something you get used to rather than being able to use as soon as you pick it up. IMO, this is better for the long run.  Also, they are adding JAVA to the P2 on the next bluewave update (within January). Seriously. That means you can put games and applications that you want on it.

<Content>I bought this because i wanted a nice large screen, and i don't like iPods.      I fully believe i couldn't have chosen a better player.  The screen is beautiful, the sound is amazing, and the customizable menus are really nice.   The included software has a nice little feature of making play lists automatically based on the mood of songs (think passionate, cheerful, sweet, and quiet).  Another nice feature is the fact that you don't NEED the software to transfer songs or videos, or anything.  you can open the player as a portable hard drive in your computer. Best player those of us that don't like ipods.

<Title>amazing
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Amazing player, definitely worth the money.  While it may not be listed, it does understand OGG/AAC music files (tagging support is not 100% yet, probably in a new firmware update).  Great to use with winamp, autosync/autofill makes things a breeze if you organize it as such.  Understands XVID!!  Beautiful screen, very easy interface.  No, HD to break.  Cons: As said before, OGG/ACC tags are not supported yet (at least transcoded in winamp), though this will probably be fixed in the future. Also, OGG is not understood as a file it can play by windows vista, so it will ask if you really want to transfer the file (just say yes to all and it works anyway).  Winamp album art transfer is a bit buggy (probably winamp's fault, who knows).  Its a flash player, so you only get 8gb, more than enough if you properly encode your files though, 1 day 12 hours worth of music is less than 50% of the space (~128kbps VBR mp3's), though this is technically a positive if you run/work out with it.  Bottum Line: Get this player, not just because its an alternative to the ipod, but because its better than the ipod.

<Title>An excellent Anti-Apple
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I don't pretend to be an expert on portable DAPs. This is only my second one (up from a Palm Zire 72 with PocketTunes).  Screen is sharp and bright. Audio quality with the included earbuds is right on par with my Logitech X-530 surround speakers (even with 128kbps MP3s). The 7-band EQ really makes a difference when properly tuned (use a preset from WinAmp or Windows Media Player as a guide). The interface is smooth and responsive, and it works great as a bluetooth headset with my phone (Motorola V195). Can even use it with a bluetooth enabled PC and Skype. Red vs Blue videos look good too.  Words of advise: Windows Media Player is a better option for syncing music, and drag WMVs directly to the device using Windows Explorer (works better). Install the included application anyways for datacasts. Get the firmware update ASAP (samsung.com).

<Title>Excellent choice
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned this player for about a month now.  I've had absolutely no problems, from loading the Media Studio software to loading movies, music, and photos.  A carry case/belt clip should have been included with the player but it doesn't come with one so I did purchase a holster that works pretty well.  The headphones are far from comfortable but that is such a personal choice anyhow, I fully intended to replace them right away.  The touch screen is very clear.  Movies play perfectly.  I find the sound quality to be excellent but I do believe the replacement headphones I purchased contribute to the quality of the sound.  I've used all the features of the player except the Bluetooth and have it set just the way I like it now.  It takes a little practice to refine some of the settings but there is nothing too difficult.  In summary, I highly recommend this player.  Samsung makes great products and this is yet another example of that reputation.

<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this player for about 3 months now and I honestly can't find anything wrong with it.    PROS - -Touchscreen works perfectly, very responsive. -Design looks really good, slim and sexy. -Audio sounds great. -Video is much better quality than I would have expected in such a small player. -Earbuds sounded great and didn't hurt my ears when listening for extended time. ("sounded" because my dog chew them up and now I'm using my old Ipod earphones, which are fine too.) -Software seems to be much much better than Itunes/Ipod software.  Much more user friendly as well. -Flash memory means I can job with this player and no skips. -Long battery life.  Have personally went 20hrs without charging.  And that's with switching songs manually throughout.  CONS - -Only 8GBs.  Sorry the cons list is so short.  I'm really racking my brain here to find other things wrong with it.  Well, in the end it's just a great player.  Highly recommended!

<Title>I hesitated because of the touchscreen.
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my 8gb YP-P2 for about a month and so far, it's great.  It does everything I was looking for in an mp3 player.    Before I bought this on Amazon, I went to Best Buy to try it out.  Because Best Buy sucks, I wasn't really able to test out anything besides the P2's durability.  When no one was looking, I pressed a blunt piece of metal into the screen and dragged it across.  No visible scratch.  Then, I grabbed the P2 by one corner, with my thumb planted in the middle of the screen, and started to bend it a bit.  The screen's colors distorted for a few seconds, but then went back to normal...no crack, no change in touchscreen responsiveness.   I haven't done anything like that to the one I own, but so far, I am pretty impressed.  The back looks like plastic, but it's actually painted metal, which makes me feel better.  I applied the screen protector that came with it and then sewed it a little protective sleeve and now I just throw it in my purse with everything else and it is doing just fine.  (Though I do not expect it to be a tank like my Sansa e250 was.)  It sounds great...way better than the Sansa did.  I am only using the earbuds that came with it and I've used a couple of the preset equalizer settings and I really like it.  When I first got it, there was a crackling noise between songs and a few other places, but after the first firmware upgrade, those things were gone.  During play, it can show album art, track info or a graphic equalizer thingy that responds to the music.  (There are a couple of other visualizations, but they are just looped animations that have nothing to do with the music and are totally pointless.)  You can also drag the progress bar around to go forward or back in a track...very useful for audiobooks.  The touchscreen is very responsive.  I was afraid I was going to be sitting there poking at it over and over to get it to work, but it is very quick, smooth and accurate, even with my blunt fingertips.  That first firmware upgrade improved it's responsiveness even more.  There are a couple of "buttons" in the Now Playing screen that could have been a little bigger or better placed, but it's not a big deal so far.  All the controls are pretty intuitive as soon as you learn what the different menu items mean.  Pictures look wonderful on this screen.  The colors are bright and beautiful.  You can zoom in and then kind of pan around, but it is a bit slow.  I put a few manga scanlations in there and I have to zoom in and then pan around the page to read them.  It works, but it is a little too cumbersome to do that all the time.  And flipping to the next picture has a very significant lag.    Videos look very nice on this thing.  I've only played a couple of music videos on it, but they look great on the bright screen.  They converted easily on the Samsung Media Studio software that came with it.  But I'm not a big fan of staring for long periods at a 6.5cm screen, so I haven't used the video feature much.    One of the main things I wanted was a text reader so that I could read fanfiction (I'm a dork. ^_^') on my way to work.  Each text file can have a bookmark in it so when you go back to it, it opens right where you marked it.  You can chose some different text sizes and colors.  (I also use it for song lyrics and a few recipes so that I know what to buy when I'm at the store.)  You can listen to music while reading text, but you can't change tracks without first bookmarking your place, exiting the text reader, going to the Now Playing screen, changing tracks, and then going back to where you were.  You can, however, change the volume or pause the music while you read using the buttons on the sides of the player.    I haven't used the FM radio yet, since I really only listen to AM radio.  (Oh, if only they could make an mp3 player with an AM radio in it, my life would be complete.)  I have used the bluetooth with my phone only once and it worked pretty well, I think...I answered a call and the person on the other end didn't notice at all.  I haven't made any calls with it yet.  It connected to my Motorola L7 very easily.  I don't use the bluetooth much because it drains the battery faster.  I have no experience with bluetooth headphones or stereos.  Apparently you can now transfer files with the bluetooth as well, but I haven't tried that yet, either.  I am happy with the battery life.  I listen to music maybe 3 or 4 hours a day, sometimes while reading text and I charge/sync it about twice a week.  It takes forever to charge it to full, so usually don't.  I ran the battery completely out once, but I hadn't plugged it in for 6 or 7 days.  I certainly didn't get the 35 hours it claims, but I do use the touchscreen A LOT.  Setting the screen brightness to 3 and the Display Off to 15 seconds has helped with the battery life.    I have been using the Samsung Media Studio to load text, pictures, and video and it's very easy...easier than using Windows Media Player 11, which I use to sync music playlists.  It is also very easy to just drag-and-drop pictures and music into the P2.  (I haven't tried that with text, yet and I hear it's rarely possible with video.)  I don't browse my music by folder, but I'm glad that I can if I want to.  I haven't had any problems with connecting it to my computer.   I have had a couple of weird glitches with playlists, though.  It seems when I sync in WMP11, I have to remove the playlist from the P2 and then add the modified version back in or it won't show any changes.  (This doesn't seem like "syncronizing" to me, but what do I know?)  Also, sometimes after I sync, the P2 shows multiple playlists with the same name  even though they are different playlists when you play them.  Maybe it's a problem with WMP11.  I don't know.  The sleep function is very handy.   I haven't used the alarm or the address book.    I am really looking forward to the firmware updates because they seem to be adding some pretty fun and useful stuff...games, play speed control, file deletion, etc.     My complaints:  The screen is very shiny.  Fingerprints are everywhere, but I just wipe them off.  The glare, however, is pretty bad.  I have to tilt it a lot when I am reading text if I am near a bright window.  It's also very hard to see the screen on a sunny day unless the screen brightness is up pretty high.    I hate the ridiculous indicator light that's right there in the middle.  Everyone who picks it up thinks it's a button and tries to push it and then I have to tell them it's just a light.  And it's very bright and blinky and very pointless.  I'll probably end up putting a sticker over it.  And this is the reason I didn't want a touchscreen:  I have to use the Hold switch ALL THE TIME.  I wish the tactile volume and pause/play buttons on the side still worked while it was in hold, but I suppose that would defeat the purpose.  Anyway, I constantly have to pull the thing out of my pocket and undo the hold switch to do anything.  Annoying, but I expected that.    OK...this isn't really that bad, but if you don't pause the song before you turn the unit off, then when you turn it back on, it will start off right where you left it, right at the same volume that you left it.  This caught me by surprise a couple of times.  The other option is to have it start off at the Home screen, but then you lose your place in an audiobook track because there is no audio bookmarking feature(that I am aware of).   The other mp3 player I was looking at along with this one was the 8gb iriver clix2.  I chose this one because of the bluetooth, the firmware upgrades and the lower price.  I don't know if I would have liked the iriver more, but I am very happy with my P2.

<Content>I found it to be a very good player for the price. This is my 1st MP3 Player so I cannot compare it to others.It works well and is easy to burn music to it.  One thing that could be improved upon is the battery life. I was getting about 16hrs on a charge.

<Title>YP-P2: An Excellent DAP
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player a month ago and I must say I am not disappointed in the least.  First of all, the device itself is a great size.  It is not too small and definitely not too big.  The screen is clear and bright.  The user interface is pretty good.  If you haven't used many touch screens before there is a learning curve.  I like the fact that there are dedicated volume buttons on the device.  The sound is crisp and clear.  There are many sound customizations and choices.  First there is the DNSe which has preprogrammed sound enhancements (i.e. Studio, Club, Concert Hall...).  There is also a User selection which gives you access to the EQ settings.  I personally like the Street Mode which helps block out some of the background noise.  I do suggest getting a good set of stereo headphones or ear buds to get the full enjoyment of the sound.  Video on the P2 is amazing.  There is an included animated short (about 10 minutes)on the player.  This lets you experience video right away.  I don't have much use of video since i bought this primarily as a music player, but after watching the video, I think I may put a couple of my favorite shorts on it.  Pictures are also viewable on the P2 and can be set as wallpaper.  I am also looking forward to using the bluetooth feature of this player.  The only drawback to this player is that it is a fingerprint magnet.  I found myself constantly wiping it down until I got a DLO case for it.  I am looking at getting a Protech full body skin for my P2.  It adds less than a mm of size to the P2 and is suppose to be virtually indestructible.  In short, This is a great alternative to the iPod touch.  Ive seen both and like the P2 better.  I am currently running firmware 2.08 which has improved the UI.  Firmware 3.07 is due out soon which will include games.

<Content>Bottom line, I just love this player.  Glad I got the 8GB version.  I love the swipe advance, the increment is selectable, and it is a player which has gotten fast forward right for people who listen to audio books or long radio recordings. A++  And the audio screen display is changeable and very  nice.  I can read my books on it as it accepts .txt files.  Font size is scalable, the screen aspect is rotatable, so you can set it up as you like it.  I can use the Samsung software to upload videos, which are converted to .svi files.  Takes a bit of time to convert .avi files to .svi, but by no means unreasonable, considering what is being done.  I like the fact that it compresses a 700MB movie to 300MB, so even though the movie looks clear and sharp, it takes less Flash space, so this is a realy good thing to convert to .SVI  The other cool thing is it does not FORCE you to use the Samsung media manager.  you can still just send your music to the player via windows explorer if you want.  You can use it like a huge flash drive.  Audio is just great, pictures look great.  Haven't used bluetooth much, but other reviews cover that.  Updated the firmware recently, and they put some games onto the thing.  It just keeps getting better.  Congratulations to Samsung on getting something just about perfect.  I think I'll send them an email too.

<Title>Hooray for the not-iPod!

<Content>This is one of the best media players I have had the pleasure of using. The screen is sharp and can be adjusted for indoor or outdoor lighting, the touchscreen is very intuitive and the thing is rigid - Anyone who's owned the old bar-style Nokias knows how rough those things are, and I've been though 3 of them. This player comes out of mosh pits smelling like roses.   The whole thing screams open - open bluetooth stack (with the firmware update), drag-n-drop music loading and the Samsung Media Studio that comes with it, while I'm not really fond of, has one of the simplest CD rippers ever. They even give you the choice of leaving that sound level guard for your hearing off, for those of us who remember personal responsibility (and live next to amps).   I was a bit skeptical of the whole DNSe thing they keep touting at first, but I cranked all the settings to max and everything sounds deeper and wider. The equalizer only has 10 levels for each bar, but fiddle with it for a few minutes and you get used to it. It's still a damn sight better than any other media player, but I'd expect nothing less from Samsung.   The touch screen is VERY sensitive. turn it face out if you're not doing anything particularly violent, because in my experience it will brush against my leg and I'll hear songs skipping around and stopping and the volume wavering. Also, Hell will freeze over the day I understand the point of music visualizations, as there are 3 visuals, and album art display, and tag viewer to choose from while listening.   One last thing: it doesn't play .avi videos. That's what I usually encode in, and the Samsung Media Studio crashes whenever anything divx encoded is re-encoded to mpg. So, no watching shows whilst on lunch at work, oh well. Why there's a radio I'll never know, but being able to record what you hear on said radio is tres-cool. I'll never have to sing akwardly to get one of my friends to help identify a song again.   It does what I want' has a no-nonsense approach to getting music on and off the thing, and looks minimal-chic doing it.   I give it a 9/10. I just wish it would let me assign names to call numbers , since I oft link it to my phone on walks and the like.
