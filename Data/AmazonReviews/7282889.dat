<Title>REVISED: If you're not an iTunes kinda person...
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>... then this might intrigue you greatly.  The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.  Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.  The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.  At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.  Then what?  What compels you to choose one over the other?  It has to be the UI and user experience.  The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.  The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.  So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.  It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.  The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.  Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.  Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.  This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.  I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.  However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.  What device would I recommend?  Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.  Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.  If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  **** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.  I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).  Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.  Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred

<Title>upcoming market killer
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this new product from creative i feel will be sure to take over the market. First lets name thr competitors. The rio carbon 5 gb. and the ipod mini 4 gb. Lets go on to compare them. the  ipod mini is a so called legend but i dont think so cause first of all it only has 4 gig compared to the carbon and the mini which have 5 thats 25% more. then the carbon and the creative mini have a voice recorder and the creative mini has a fm radio and a recorder. The ipod mini has a touch pad which the creative mini also has. The carbon does not have this but has an auto dj that chooses your favorite songs and your least favorites. the ipod mini does not have this but the creative one does. Like the adress book and such in the ipod mini not to fear the creative one has those too.the carbon does't. Both minis also feature backlit buttons. But the creative mini also has a cool light on the edge of player. carbon doesn't. Plus the ipod mini cant play wma the others can. Plus on the creative mini the touch pad is not  circle and has no buttons on it. Now lets name what all have. Creative has fm radio and recorder,voicerecorder, adress book and such, backlit buttons, touch pad, auto dj, 10 colors. the rio carbon has 5 gb , voice recorder, auto dj, extremely small.The ipod mini has 4 gb, no fm, no voice rrecorder, adressbook and such, .

<Title>Come on Zip
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Zip it seems that you critisize the previous guy of being a creative employee because he likes it. On that basis it would seem that you are an Apple employee, next time do not open your mouth. As for me i think that this product is far better than the apple ipod mini although for it to take down the mini it must have a crack team of marketers to get the word out, other wise it will likely go unnoticed. For all those un biased about products you should find this a much better product than the ipod mini on many fronts.  NEW: It seems that amazon in an attempt to make a few more bucks has jacked the price up from the 250$ that it used to be to 280$. Dont buy here go to creatives web site and buy from them its cheaper and you wont get screwed by amazon. I still love this product and intend to buy it after a few reviews come out from respectable magazines like PCmag or someone like that but until then screw you amazon i hate you and you need to drop the price back down so this thing can compete with the ipod mini.   Even more NEW: Good job amazon you droped the price back down. Who's a good boy, thats right. goood boy.

<Title>Zip it!
<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my first Creative player, the Zen Xtra 60GB for 5 months now and I must say that I am incredibly happy with it.  I don't think that "Zip" is actually an Apple employee but worse yet a Mac geek (see book, "Cult of Mac").  The most ridiculous argument made by these types is with regard to the sound quality.  The ipod and ipod mini do most certainly have worse sound quality than just about any of their competitors.  Not only have I tested this myself, but anyone can read professional reviews and ratings for these players, where the apple inferiority in sound quality is always noted).  I just read a consumer reports roundup (either nov or oct 2004) of HD digital audio players and the ipod and ipod mini were each the WORST of their respective categories in sound quality.    I don't own it myself, but have a friend who does and can tell you that the Iriver ihp series absolutely blows away the ipod in many aspects, including sound quality.     As for this "imitator" label, lets all remember that apple was not even the second company to come out with this type of device (hard drive based digital audio player).  Creative was indeed the first with the Nomad. I owned an Archos jukebox well before the ipod was released (that model even has better sound quality than the ipod).  The ipod certainly was the smallest when it came out and continues to have a great interface but others have caught up.  Apple is actually the imitator in this regard although this is not well known becuase apple has the greater geek fanbase and marketing muscle to help obscure things.  Most people are not even aware that competing products exist.  What is apalling though, is that the advertising and the apple fanboy base have gone so far as to claim that the ipod has better sound quality.  I'm not just expressing my opinion, standards for measurement of sound quality exist and Apple's ipod's and ipod mini's do not compare favorably against the competition in this regard (do some research on Google, even on your mac).  Creative is the standard in computer audio hardware (the core elements of a digital audio player) and this helps them produce players with great sound.    No, I do not own a Zen micro and have never written a review for anything before owning the very item.  I was forced to do so here after noticing the utter insanity of Zip's comments.  If you want to just load up your player with Justin Timberlake, Creed or Brittney songs off of ITunes, perhaps the ipod is your best bet, just quit lecturing others.  Also, the backlit screen will reduce the battery life for any player, and the zen touch's battery life still kills that of the ipod (if you actually did own one).    Please, zip it good!

<Title>Good functions, but way too ugly
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.  But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  Creative should hire some real industrial designers.

Pros: +5 GB Seagate drive +Great sound quality (all of Creative's players) +Synchs with Outlook +Looks cool +Removable battery  Cons: -Requires software to transfer music -No tactile buttons, all touch sensitive.   And to the fool zip, iRiver was out before the iPod, so your point is moot.

<Title>Interesting design
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I really like this "curved" design, and the electric blue glow is cool (can't wait to play with it under the sheets with my girlfriend). Have to remark to Gadgester about "Creative should hire some real industrial designers." that  J.Ive's worked on toilets and wash basins before iPod, which probably explains the white of the original iPod and the metallic colors of the mini, they all remind me of public toilets. The beltclip on Mini is really useless (unless you have small private parts and need to show your Mini off to impress the girls - "look see girls, I spent wads of money girls, do you like me now?) The curved shape of Micro plus its smaller size will make it easy to slip anywhere, Mini was uncomfortable in my pocket, all those sharp edges sticking in me. Good to see Microsoft and Creative team up with this product so that it will work on any PC running Windows. Think I'll leave iPods for the people who spend money to look cool, and get myself a Zen Micro as I value my music quality above what my friends think of me.

<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm writing this review because I'm been loocking forward to the iPod competition... but it is constantly letting me down. Why does creative incorporated FM radio and not ogg sopport first?, being this a digital music player... I think the are just trying to battle  the iPod with the same features, not really trying to make a better player. There are far too few ogg players out there, and most of them are not good or too expensive...

<Title>Lotta Bang for the Buck
<Date>Sat Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of iPods and Zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  The new series of Zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an iPod.  Bottom line.  But hey - buy an iPod if you want - Steve Jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   For the record, it was Creative that invented the portable music player, but it was Apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  If you want to be specific, you could say that the iPod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  Was there an iPod back then?  Nope.

<Content>I am totally hot to buy this, based on the specs as outlined on Amazon's site. However, one thing I'd like to know before I buy - will Bose and other 3rd party vendors offer products to complement the new Zen system as offered for the Ipod? I'd like the flexibility afforded by the speaker docking station, and right now it seems as if Bose is offering such an option only to the Apple consumer.  Thoughts???

<Title>I'll never buy an iPod!
<Date>Wed Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First I'd like to make a clarification of Timothy Stoehr's review. He states, "One thing that's cool about the IPod mini is that it doesn't carry a disk drive but rather a CF card. No spinning mechanical hard drive. Much more reliable." Hey smart guy, they're not called "microdrives" for nothing. It's true that CF cards are used in iPod minis but they are CF Type II, which means that they are in fact hard drives and they DO have moving parts. Don't believe me? Go here: http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/micro/soltns.htm  3600 RPM, 12ms avg. seek time  All microdrive players have moving parts, and all microdrive players utilize CF Type II.  I don't own a Zen Micro yet but I am waiting for reviews to come out. I don't know about you guys, but I refuse to buy an Apple iPod. I refuse to buy into the Apple image and support a company that still won't use the right-click on a mouse! Pathetic. I walk around and see all these people with white earbuds and I just shake my head.... If the Zen Micro were just 0.2 inches thinner I think I would be sold for sure.

<Title>Buy the Zen Micro and support the Ipod killer!
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hi, I'm a music technophile hailing from the tiny island of Singapore, the country that is offering the world the Zen Micro. Like many people, I have been sold on the idea of getting a hard-disk based portable MP3 player since mid-2004 and have been hunting around for a good one for the past 5 months.  When the mini-Ipod came out in Asia to buy in July 2004, I was pretty much interested in getting one. However, the high price for 4GB (S$458.00=US$275.00) and seriously, not too exciting colours, stopped me buying it immediately.  My attention turned to the then-competing product, the Creative MuVo2 4GB. Retailing at S$398.00 (US$240.00), the gadget looked pretty attractive, but I was still hedging for something better, as it was still larger than the mini and looked a bit plasticky.  So when I saw the Zen Micro on pre-launch in October 2004, and the blurb by the CEO of Creative Technologies in the local papers on its features and functions, I was very intrigued. The next 4 weeks was spent trawling the internet reading reviews on the pros and cons of the Ipod Mini vs. the Zen Micro. Very interesting.  Now, I'm pretty convinced that I shall get the Zen Micro, if only to march to the beat of a different drummer. Hearing friends extol the virtues of the Ipod and dissing everything else without empirical evidence just helped me make my mind up even more.   I'm sure that audio quality wise the ZM will beat the IM hands down. I don't know about the rest of the functions, but I am willing to place my faith in the hands of the underdog.  As for those writing about whether accessories companies (Bose, are you listening?) will support the ZM, I think that the market must be there first before these companies will create the supporting accessories. I for one would love to be able to plug the ZM into a good home stereo, either at my home or at my friend's place. Oh, and bluetooth capabilities would just be too cool.  So, all you people out there who's had enough of the hype of the Ipod Mini marketing machine, here's your chance to tell Apple who's really boss!

<Title>Cynical Reply
<Date>Fri Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Wow this player would be so great if it were only an Apple iPod. If it looked like an iPod, had less features like an iPod, only worked with an iMac and iTunes and were actually made by Apple and not Creative then I would love it.   I do so wish it had MIDI support however, because all my favorite songs are in MIDI. It would be really awesome also if it had something usefull like a text based role playing game instead of having a calendar and contacts.  Obviously I'm being facetious, but that's kinda the vibe I got off all the negative comments. There was no good argument against a device that for the same price has higher compatibility, better sound quality, more functionality, a removable battery and a radio and voice recorder thrown in just for giggles.   My only major complaint at this time is that I preordered this device on Oct. 17th and it still has not shipped, apparently due the overwhelming amount of orders placed for it.   I do wish that there were some hands on reviews out there (CNET has it, but has not posted their review yet) and I wish it came with the wired remote. I still plan to purchase that seperately but it would have been nice to have it included. If anyone has found any real hands-on review please let me know.   If you are a Windows user and do not use iTunes AND size matters (I had a 20 GB unit but it just big enough to be a problem when snowboarding and skateboarding) then this is the best option I've seen.

<Title>Very happy with the Zen Micro player
<Date>Tue Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro is a great little player.  I have had the silver Zen Micro for almost 5 days.  Its a big step up from the flash player I was using before.  Its a nice small package and great design.  Its a little wider than the I-Pod and feels slightly heavier.  The case is very solid, and the front face is seamless.  Sound quality is excellent, although I did replace the earbuds with the Sony Ex71SL earbuds, which are really, really good and much more comfortable.  Navigation and controls work very well.  I still think the I-POD scroll wheel works a little better than the straight line slide control on the Zen, but the difference is not that great.  The volume was very easy to adjust, even during work-outs.  It took a little time to figure out how to create a playlist from the music library, but its easy once I figured out the sequence, and the menu lets you select songs by genre, artist or song name.  The Zen Micro also allows you to create and save on the fly playlists, or you can create them with the Media Source sfotware.  Its great that there are so many ways to download music vs. being tied to i-Tunes as with the i-POD.  The included software makes it very easy to transfer files to the player, and I was able to use either Windows Explorer, the Creative Media software or Musicmatch to transfer files (I was not able to synch with Napster).  I did find that about 4 to 6 out of the 200 songs I downloaded did not transfer for some reason when I used either the Creative Media Source software or MusicMatch.  So far the battery life is less than 12 hours, but the early editions of the Micro shipped with two batteries. It could be that by turning the backlight off or adjusting the controls less frequently the battery life will be much longer.   Overall this is a fantastic player so far.  I'm very impressed with the quality for something that was just launched last week.

<Title>Exceeds the Ipod
<Date>Wed Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I compared the Zen Micro to the Ipod. It's plain out better than the Ipod in these areas:  - battery life and convenience - sound quality!!! - extra features (fm, voice recorder)  It's relatively the same in "user-friendlyness". For all those people debating about the better design, they are both well made and look nice ... it's up to personal preference. Just let each customer make up their own mind about the aesthetics. Don't get me wrong, the Ipod is a good player, but there's too much hype and overall, I believe the Zen Micro is better. Better sound, battery and more features, what more can you ask for?

<Date>Fri Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After researching mp3 players ad nauseum, I decided to buy the Zen Micro, and I'm glad I did. I have a flash player for the gym but wanted something with more storage for everyday listening. My music library is a little over 35 gig but I felt I didn't need that kind of capacity in an mp3 player. What drew me to the Zen Micro was the replaceable battery, the FM Tuner, the optional clip, and the ability to create playlists on the fly, not to mention that it has more storage than the iPod mini. I looked at the Rio Carbon, but it didn't have an FM tuner or playlists on the fly. I looked at the Archos Gmini XS200, but the battery is not replaceable and the initial software is reported to be clunky. So far, I have been very pleased with the Zen Micro. The touch pad seems to be a point of debate with everyone, and I agree it takes a little practice, unless you have a laptop with a touchpad in which case it is second nature. I was concerned that the touchpad would be so frustrating that I wouldn't enjoy the player, but that's not the case. The sound is excellent, the player is tiny, the software is easy to use, and the thin neon blue strip of lighting definitely adds to the cool factor. I am using Windows Media for syncing and haven't had any problems yet. This is definitely going to be an iPod mini assassin.

<Content>Like many other ppl, I was deciding between this player and the Ipod mini.  I chose this for the following reasons:  -1 gig extra -FM Tuner -Voice Recorder -Detacheable Battery -EXTRA FREE battery($40 value) -NON proprietary music file format(plays WMA, which is smaller than mp3 and quite popular, doesn't work w/ ipod :(  Have had it for a week now.  Took less than a minute to install.  Very intuitive interface.  The control takes a little getting used to but it's definitely manageable and oh for ppl worried 'bout the "touch sensitive" controls, there's a "lock" button, works great.   I highly recommend it.

<Title>Good player but  very poor construction
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had, which ended up rendering it useless (out of warranty).    However, while it worked, I was quite pleased with the player and the included software.  Everything was intutive and ran smoothly (except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden).  I also liked the fact that this player wasn't bound by iTunes or file format restrictions.  My only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult (just give me buttons, I know they aren't sexy but they're easy and work well).    I am giving the product 2 stars because, while I liked it, Creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build (being that this is STILL a problem with these players).  For the amount of money that a player like this costs, it should work for at least year!

<Content>This MP3 player is packed with features but all that means nothing if it doesn't work.  My headphone jack began to fail after just 3 months of ownership and wouldn't work without contant jiggling.  The hard drive failed just outside the warranty period.  I deposited the device in the trash and purchased a Sandisk Sansa player.  It's much nicer, slimmer, has no hard drives to fail and contains all the features you would need.

<Content>As many other reviews have agreed, I liked mine until it broke - in two ways.  Same headphone problem as others, but that was nothing compared to the total meltdown it then experienced.  Now I can't even turn it on, and I've only owned it 11 months.  I liked the space, features, setup, etc. but that makes me all the more sad that it's hopelessly broken.  Try another brand, because if you buy this one you will just end up buying the other brand in a few months anyway.

Yeah ight, for a major defect that was THEIR problem and if you weren't under warrent then too bad?!?! Not only that but the software wouldn't let me well do anything. I had to go install a new media center just to sync music. This would have been the Ipod killer if it didn't have crap service and hardware problems. Don't waste your money on Creative.

<Title>Good until...
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Zen Micro about a year ago.  I loved it because it had great features at a great price.  The music is pretty good and it holds a lot.  The radio is good once you get it to tune.  The way it is designed is great and the voice recording is useful.  A few weeks ago though, my problems with it started.  If you charge the battery when it is half-way, it makes the battery last a LOT less.  It started dieing very soon.  I tried to charge it, but when you take out the battery and turn it on it goes to a recovery screen.  You can't get out of it easily.  It is helpful but never delete the firmware. It says you can reload it onto the player through a USB plug, but you can't easily at least.  Since it was more than 60 days old, they wouldn't let me talk to them over the phone.  Also, it was more than a year ago so they wouldn't even help me by e-mail.  They left me with a small "knoledge database" that didn't help at all.  They did say though that for $12.99 you could get a 30 minute session with a "Creative tutor."  I took a search to finally find the phone number.  Finally I got in contact with a person and told him my problem.  He told me that I could send it in and get it repaired for $60 to $100 plus $12.99 for shipping back and whatever I pay for shipping to get there.  Disgusted, I decided not to pay, and just got a new player.  So I am here to tell you that while the Zen Micro might be good, the service is absolutely terrible.  Even Apple which I heard doesn't have great service has better service than Creative.  [...]

<Title>Not that great...
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We bought one of these for my daughter and within a month the thing would freeze up. She sent it back for repairs and left the battery in. They fixed it and sent it back without the battery and told her it would cost $40 dollars for a new battery.  I was mad and wrote the head of their public relations department a letter and Creative called me the next morning and had a battery overnighted to my daughter. (hint: go to the public relations for fastest results). Then it happened again and they would send a new one (didn't have to call their PR after the first one). This happend 3 more times till my daughter quit using her sony sport headphones.  Then after about 3 months the headphone jack started having problems, so she brought it to me and I fixed it. And it has worked fine since then. The same thing happened to my video zen:m using the sony headphones. Evidently there something with sony headphones and creatives MP3 players. Now my daughter has a ipod nano and seems really happy with it.

<Title>Programs not clear
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have had the unit only a day, and figured out how to load the mp3s after an hour or so of loading program and reading the manual. Although pretty much Windows drag and drop, there is some setup to do beforehand, so don't rush things and read the pdf manual. The paper manual has instructions for installing the drivers and playing the files. You'll have to go online or read the pdf manual to really work this thing.  I think I am pretty satisfied with the quality and oompf of the player itself, but Creative's "MediaSource Organzier" interface (along with the simpler "Media Explorer" and their capabilities--or not--caused many wasted hours here on Day Two. The Explorer offers a task list to easily rip audio CD to the device, with a box to check whether you wanted to also rip the mp3s to the Music Library on the C drive. I didn't want to waste my precious space on C drive, so unchecked the option. Later when I wanted to burn an MP3 CD (rather than an audio CD), I found could do this only with access to the harddrive's version of the Music Library. When I finally figured that out (and I reripped the album I was interested in),  then the mp3 burn list would import the tracks only in alphabetical order. I tried via a custom playlist and bringing over a clearly numbered Album, and they tracks jumped to the burnlist in alphabetical order. Through the forums on Creative's website, I discovered that is the only option. No way to have the mp3s be "tracked" on an mp3 CD burn. And that's it. Phooey.  And for some reason, I could not after the fact move my many ripped albums of mp3s from the Zen player to the c drive's Music Library. If this had been explained beforehand or at all somewhere, I would have saved hours of time. But their manuals and tutorials make it all seem so easy..select tracks, place them in order with my named playlist, click a few buttons...and presto, it's stalled or a mess with no means to figure what happened.  I eventually worked around the whole thing using other programs, and now have a cd that will play my tracks in order on a CD player. Now I'm just going to make straight copies of it. Too many hours where a few sentences in the manual would have helped.

<Title>Cool!
<Date>Wed Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received today an IPOD mini and a Zen micro, so had a great opportunity to compare them side by side.  The verdict?  Both are well built and beautiful gadgets but the Zen Micro is way cooler... The way its lights glow and pulsate during charging is especially mesmerizing.  I am totally in love with it.  To top it off, the sound quality of the Zen Micro is clearly the better of the two.   Some additional features on the Zen Micro that I particularly like -has an option to automatically normalize the sound volume of all my MP3 tracks, so I don't have to constantly adjust the volume when changing tracks.  This is so convenient as I have some tracks that play too loud and others that play too soft.  -built in FM radio with automatic preset -LONG battery life!  Highly recommended.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player at an Affordable Price
<Date>Fri Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own. This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems. Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance. To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it? You ask, yup. That's it. I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features. Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro. My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.  Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  Not everything in this world is 100% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such. I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available. Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).  That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!

<Title>Serious iPod Mini competitor
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I would give this 4.75 stars if possible, but 5 was too much.  Overall, however, this is most likely going to be the next big iPod killer.   The pros for this product are many.  First, it has a removable battery.  The batteries are rechargeable, and it doesn't take a multitude of people to change the battery.  The back slides off of it, and there is a place for the battery.  Plain and simple, but much better than the iPod mini's battery, which has had records of bad battery life and expensive removals.    For another thing, another reivewer commented on the touch-screen buttons and how they are bad.  This is not necessarily true, however.  The older iPod 20/40 GB models also had touch screens, yet nobody complained.  Touch screens are not always completely sensitive to everything, as the person makes it sound.  When you touch the buttons it responds, and while sometimes it may respond to other items, its not very often.    Personally, I think that the Zen Micro looks nicer than the iPod mini.  The thickness was somewhat annoying, but its only something minor.  The Zen Micro has 10 different colors, and all look very sharp.  iPod mini's colors are limited, and the Micro's colors aren't only brighter, but the buttons light up nicely for a good touch.  I never liked the iPod's touch wheel, as it was used for too many things.  Volume, song scrolling, playlist selection, etc were all too much.  Many times I held the middle button down to get a song to a playlist, yet it instead misread the usage and played multiple songs. Little things such as this led me to the iPod's death in my heart.  The 5 GB storage is also nice.  It holds a good 1500+ more songs (as advertised), but is not too much.  I've had two iPod Mini's (one stolen, one just broken), and on each i was running out of storage space within a month or two.  Yes, you can delete songs from it, but it is not something they come out and tell you.  I could not even find it in the user's manual.  The Zen Micro is also much easier to use with Windows.  The format that everything is set up in was mostly designed for Windows users, as opposed to the masses of people with Windows and Apple-designed iPods.  Again, minor, but the small things make all the difference.   Creative Labs' Zen Micro is a great little mp3 player, and it could lead to the downfall of iPod Mini's.  Probably not, but I'll be hoping.

<Title>Zen Micro - New User:   Pluses and Minuses
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Owned 2 about 2 weeks. Bought at Fry's 1st wanted IPod mini but FM tuner, better sound specs, extra storage, free user changeable battery and better projected battery life convinced me to buy Zen. Wanted them to take to gym FM tuner was big plus bk the gym has tv's with assigned fm frequencies, nice to listen to/watch tv while on treadmill.  Turned out to be a dud.  FM reception, at least within the gym for frequencies assigned to TVs is marginal to unlistenable.  Better headphones help, but do not resolve this problem. Also, turns out deep in PDF manual (that you don't see till after you buy) says you shouldn't use these while jogging, it could damage the unit.  When we went to Fry's a Creativerep was there,we told him why we wanted these instead of the IPods, to listen to the fm for TV's while jogging and also asked if armband carriers were available for them.  He said the armbands were included in the box, and that the FM's were great and that was a good idea.  When we emailed Creative their response was:  Maybe he misunderstood you, and yeah, "other headphonse might help the fm reception, no apology, no suggestion as to where to get the armbands, no suggestions as to which "other" headphones.  Also, the touchscreens are kinda tricky and everytime you pick one up you change the station or restatrt the song. Pluses, so far no operations issues, at least for us, sound good and they do at least HAVE an FM tuner, software is good, and I"m getting better with the touchscreen. (also I found an armband carrier, got it at the Apple store, aftermarket model for IPod Mini)

<Title>Zen Micro Problems
<Date>Wed Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Everything was brilliant....playing media was fine, syncing was fine... (as there was about 2-3 hours of battery life in it when it came) However since I charged the battery up with the mains adapter provided (about an hour ago) it's been downhill from there! It worked fine to start with and then it started locking up. Now the PC won't even see it.  I've tried the Disk Cleanup and Reboot options on the special startup menu a couple of times (when you hold down power button in the on position when you reconnect the battery) but am still not having any luck. I don't want to format it or mess around with reflashing the firmware (even if there was a newer version!) if I can avoid it as at least I've got a couple of songs on it. The special start up menu says Creative Zen Micro v0.0.56 and the information says version 1.00.05.  I got the special edition version which came with the two batteries, the first battery I tried had enough juice in it for a 2-3 hours of play. Funny that I never saw Jimmy G's message until I started having problems with it.   Really sad and disappointed, it's great aside from this lockup bug, don't know whether it's the software on the PC or the Micro itself. Guess I'll have to wait and see if any updates come out.

<Title>It's turned into a love/hate thing.......review update
<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out. Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work. So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. Then last week, my player just quit working, period. After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home. Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer service, they said I should send it in for repairs.  I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them. They obviously have quality and reliability problems. They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.  My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once! Yes, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try. My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  I threw it away.  Those are minor complaints though.  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.  Amazing.

<Date>Fri Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love this player. The sound is just fantastic. It is small and light.  My other player is a Zen Xtra - the menus are similar and it took no time at all to find my way around the Micro.  No problem between the player and my computer, not a single lockup.  There are loads of options in the menus to customize.  I like the equalizer.  The touchpad was easy to get used to.  I saw some people saying that the touchpad is too sensitive, but you can ajust that. I haven't needed to. I do use the hold button because I slip the player in my pocket.  I'm very happy with the battery life - though I've not timed it, I used the player for a few days before noticing it was on the last bar.  Not a single problem with it, I love it.

<Title>Not Recommended (POS)
<Date>Sat Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First review I gave it 4 stars  Second review of this thing after using it for a while 2 stars.   I grant good sound quality, and it looks nice.  BUT  It is not a well made unit.  First failure for me came after about 9 months of light use. It just stopped playing. Turns out the hard drive froze up. I did some drilling, and it seemed to be a common problem with the Seagate harddrive Creative was using (on the early models?) A LOT of people had it.  Now the on/off switch doesnt work.  The only way to use it is to yank the battery to turn it off, and plug it into the charging adapter or dock port to turn it on. Tech support wants $25 each time it looks at it, even if its still within the one year warranty. So Im up to $300 for a shoddy player which will no doubt fail again.  Take these reviews to heart, dear reader. You will see that bad ones are quite common. Save yourself time, money, and aggrevation.  Get something else.  Noel

<Content>Creative came out with a good Item but with a bad warranty which says that it doesn't believe in their product enough to warranty it for a full year.    After 6 months of normal use my Zen didn't work.  I contacted Creative and they said that I was out of the warranty period which is 90 days for this product.  They said that they will repair it for an additional cost of $25.00 + Shipping.   so Again READ THE WARRANTY WHEN BUYING.  For the price I paid I could have gotten an IPOD.

<Title>Zen Micro is the worst piece of junk I've owned!!
<Date>Mon Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WARNING!!!!!Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!!!!It's hard to believe Creative had the nerve to release this buggy piece of garbage.  The Zen Micro was recommended for its superior audio quality over the Ipod.  However, I could not put up with it's dismal performance.  I had to retire it and get an Ipod.  The software was slow, cumbersome, and crashed CONSTANTLY when I would try to upload songs.  With Itunes you can change songs using a batch method, but with Creative's software, you have to go through EVERY mp3 one at a time!  That's a lot of songs on a 5GB player!  What takes seconds with Itunes, takes hours and hours and hours with Creative.    The Micro would keep rebooting, and was very slow between songs.  Touch sensitivity was annoying, especially compared to the Ipod.  I tried updating to the new software, but that made the Zen Micro perform even worse! After rebooting, it "rebuilds" the library, which takes a couple of minutes. When it finally reboots, it takes so long to play a song you select, oftentimes you press play twice to make sure it registered, which of course pauses the mp3.  Very frustrating. Designwise, The Micro is far from "micro", especially compared to the 5GB Ipod.  The Zen Micro shouldn't even be considered to be in the same catagory as the Ipod.  If you're considering getting one, go with an 8-Track instead.  You'll be happier.

<Title>nice mp3 player...when it works
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this thing for christmas 05 and it started crashing around june (about 5 months later).  It was a bunch of things that messed it up.  It seemed to work fine but I couldn't hear anything from my headphones.  I had to wiggle the head phone thing for it to work and it sometimes only worked when i had force on it at a certain angle.  Another problem was then when I try to charge it..it just lights up and it wouldn't charge for some reason. After noticing that I unpluged it, and the light wouldn't go out.  So I took out the battery and put it back in and it would automaticly start itself up and would freeze at the greeting "Creative" screen.  It would do that for a couple days, works for a couple days, then stop...going on and off and deciding when it would and would not work.  It's very frustrating.  Other then all the bad stuff, there are some great features that it has.  built in FM radio, microphone, calender, adjust EQ settings, phone book, and date/time (which was always wrong no matter how many times I set it) you can adjust the sensitivity of the touch pad. and there are many different play modes (repeat, normal ect..) the blue lights and screen are bright and very noticable in the dark.   Overall...this is a good product...when it works.  and when it crashes for while...it is VERY frustrating to try to get it to work.

<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product has really really really pissed me off.  I got it in about October and it worked great until about March.  All of a sudden the sound would be really horrible and I had to mess around with the headphone jack a little and hold it there so it would sound right.  (Very, very inconvenient even when it wasn't that bad.)  It just kept getting worse and worse.  I love music, so I just kind of dealt with it and had to always keep one hand fidgeting around with the headphone jack just to get some decent sound every once in a while.  Within the past month, about 5 time it has just not turned on at all.  What pissed me off the most is it decided to completely stop working about 2 hours into my 11 hour flight to Tokyo, and I still had a return flight to make about 10 days later.  Going through and tagging most of my mp3's was a real pain too and 5GB isn't nearly enough space.  I've had to delete songs many times just to get new ones on.  I really don't want to keep having to get the same product for my birthday every year because the one from the previous year has already stopped working.  Look into other mp3 players before purchasing this one.

<Title>Don't Do It!!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product is amazing - when it works. Which for me, was two months and why it gets two stars. I originally gave it one, but when it does work it really is awesome, absolutely no complaints. Mine froze and died two months after I opened the package. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it fixed because it was a gift from an ex who I was no longer in contact with by the time it broke. After it froze I frantically scoured the web trying to find a way to reset it. That didn't work. I changed the batteries, etc etc it was just dead. I thought about buying another one until I read all the reviews with similar complaints. I am not an Apple person, but since that is all there seems to be I finally gave in last night and bought one and so far I love it. I initially resisted because of the software (I thought I hated iTunes) but I am getting used to it and liking it! So this is probably not what you want to hear, but this is my advice - skip this and buy yourself an ipod just like everyone else. There is a reason it is so popular!!

<Title>disappointed

<Content>A year later and I wish I had the money for an ipod. I have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and don't even take my player with me anywhere anymore. What's the point of having an mp3 player you can't walk around with? Ridiculous.

<Title>Great Features, But Huge Flaws
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This music player was decent: Nice look, controls, and sound. There are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive. There are really good things about this unit; however, the faults are just too great; thus, superseding the great features.  However, the reaction to your key pushes, and file search are way too slow. The software is pretty nice, but the bad thing is that it likes to rename your files for you even when you didn't ask it too. That gets very annoying. For example, I just want the file to be named as is, with no tags, but the Zen software will add tags no matter what, even if it has to put in the word "unknown". It also has these strange crashes that makes it hard to have it recover. The worst part about this product is that the earphone jack gets damaged in a few weeks or months -- unprovoked!  It was so frustrating to think my headphones where damaged, but I switched it up and found out that it was the Zen. Then I read online, and what do you know -- it's consensus, the product is faulty because many other people have experienced the same problem. Some people even found some fixes, and I've tried them, but to no avail. But then again, why do I have to fix a fairly new product?   If you're going to have a fault when it comes to a music player, you DON'T want it to be a physical issue that renders the player useless!  I'd give it at least three stars as I was quite satisfied with it, but the physical fault with the headphone jack is just too much of negligence to overlook.

<Title>The MP3 Player for the Rest of Us
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative Zen Micro is no iPod killer. It is the iPod for the rest of us. Where Apple's product is stylish and fun to use, it has that unfortunate Apple characteristic of locking users into buying their music strictly from Apple. iTunes is a fine online music store, but there are many others and some (MSN and Musicmatch for example) are as deep in selection and easy to use. And the Creative Zen Micro gives us a player every bit as intuitive and stylish as the Apple product and the benefit of FM radio, Outlook synchronization and the use of every online music store other than iTunes.   Everyone knows that the Micro comes in an array of colors. Mine is silver. I like the blue glow and the shiny white case that compliment the silver face. Personally I think the black model looks best, but I didn't buy the unit for the color. I've seen a number of reviews of the Micro from people having trouble with the vertical touch pad. After two adjustments, I had no issues with that controller at all. It is more intuitive than running your finger in a circle. The touch pad and menus it opens are user adjustable. I was having trouble getting the Micro cursor to stop where I wanted when scrolling though the menu lists. I adjusted the touchpad sensitivity setting to low but that didn't help. I adjusted it to high and the problem was solved. It may seem counterintuitive to select high sensitivity to better control the touchpad. If you're having touchpad issues, try the high setting and see for yourself.  The Micro comes in with good quality ear buds, a hard shell case that accepts adapters to help it serve as a belt clip or a desk stand. There is also a carrying pouch, a USB 2.0 cord, universal AC adapter, and the removable, rechargeable battery. Other accessories are available from Creative. I am not a big fan of ear buds, but these are pretty good and the cord doubles as the FM radio antenna. I selected Auto Search and the Micro found strong signals for all of its 32 presets. I live in an area with lots of FM radio, so performance in other areas may vary.   Volume on the Micro is controlled by the touchpad, not a separate button. Some folks prefer a separate wheel for volume. It is more important to me that the volume reaches acceptable levels and is EQ adjustable. Both are true on the Micro. There are a number of EQ presets and a limited ability to customize adjustments.   You can create playlists on the fly which is a great feature of the Micro missing in many other MP3 players. It is also possible to create playlists on your computer using either the included Creative software or Windows Mediaplayer 10. I like the interface in WMP 10 better than the Creative software and the Micro syncs with WMP 10 flawlessly.  The Micro has a microphone for recording voice notes. Speak normally into this mic or you will get distorted sound. At normal speaking volumes, the quality was fine. You might be tempted to shout to such a tiny device, but don't.   Creative says the battery will play for 12 hours. Early buyers of the Micro are receiving an extra battery in the package, which is a great bonus. I charged the extra battery and keep it in the pouch to be handy when needed. I've not run a battery test where I drain the unit dry, but I probably won't get 12 hours anyway, because I set the backlight for bit longer than the default. I was pleased to learn that the Micro charges either from the AC adapter or via the USB cable when it is plugged in for syncing. That is a nice touch.  My unit is full with just over 1000 songs, far short of the 2500 claimed for the 5GB drive. This is my fault. The 2500 claim is based on using only WMA format songs recorded at 64kbps. I have a mix of WMA and MP3 files and I usually encode at a much higher rate. This is another reason the Zen Micro is the player for me. The original iPod and other devices are just too big. I don't have anywhere near 10,000 songs to carry around. I am pleased for those folks who do, but drives that big would be a waste of space for me. The 5GB units provide just enough room for me to carry around my digital collection. As the number of songs I own grows, I can always compress them to fit better on the Micro or become more selective about which tunes get synched.   Creative has a winner in the Zen Micro. I really believe this is the music player for the rest of us and, with some marketing behind it, it can do for the other online music stores what the iPod did for its brother iTunes. Thank goodness for choice.

<Title>Owned it less than an hour
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The touch pad sucks, and sinks this product COMPLETELY. I am an enthusiastic owner of a 30 gig Zen Extra, and I WANTED to like this product. Ordered one through Amazon/Office Depot, and it arrived in 48 hours. I set aside an entire afternoon to play with it. Accidentally set the language first to German, then Japanese trying to select english. Trying to do initial setup with this thing is a NIGHTMARE due to the touch pad. I stopped after getting into english. How in the hell do they expect me to operate this thing on my hip while I am mowing the lawn or working out, or in my car, where I have to do it without looking? Thanks a lot Creative, you really screwed this up.

<Title>Down With IPOD!
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I hate Apples, and i bought a crappy mp3 last year cause i didnt want an ipod.  Man was that dumb, i could have just bought one of creatives mp3s and listened to good music.    I hate ipods, they are evil ugly stupid devices that cost a fortune, and are actually not that cool.  Those things are like ten pounds.  And the minis, are only like and inch smaller.  So i said, screw apples, and ipods.  Then looking at pcmagazine the other day, i saw the most beautiful mp3 player i have ever seen.  The zen micre 5 gb mp3 player.  It is so cool.  Does everything an ipod can plus more.  :  It has radio.  It glowsin the dark with that line that goes all around it.  It has an extra battery that lasts 12 hours, unlike stupid lame ipods.  It has more than one color, and theres a black one, whichis awesome.  It carries a two and a half thousand 2500 songs!  ( and Who the hell has 10,000 songs to listen to???)  If i had ten thousand songs, at a dollar a song, id just buy a huge cd player and keep it in my personal jet all day, while on my way to my secret school in Antarctica.  But reallyl, i dont even have a thousand songs, so why pay a fortune for crap you dont need if this is better, smarter, and cheaper, and cooler!?!?!?   I dont know, but i do know is that ipods are evil and ugly and expensive.

<Title>Nearly Perfect ... 
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased a Creative Zen Micro at a local retailer recently and it easily deserves a five star rating.  The sound quality is excellent (much better than several iPods I've listened to), the battery life has been impressive and the (mostly) intuitive interface has been fairly easy to master.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, my experience with the Creative software and the connections to my computers was pretty positive.  The software loaded quickly on both my work (HP laptop, docked in port replicator) and home (Dell laptop) computers and within a few minutes I was loading songs.  Surprisingly, the Zen was also recognized by Musicmatch, my primary program for managing music files, so I was able to load songs directly onto it from Musicmatch as well. I'm now at a little over 1,000 songs, the unit is nearly full, and I've got enough music to last me for months.    The only criticism of the Zen Micro - and it is a small one that I'm sure will be improved upon soon enough by Creative once the technology permits it - is that 5G is a little on the small side. 5G isn't quite enough room for someone with a fairly extensive music collection, although it should be plenty for lots of people. I'm sure in another year or so, when Creative offers a Zen Micro with a 10G hard drive, I'll be tempted to upgrade and find a new home for my 5G version.    For now, however, it has been an extremely impressive purchase.

<Title>Not Audible Ready with update now that it is
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Update:  As of 2005 sometime this player became Audible compatible as I'm sure someone else has already stated. Be aware that the Photo version of this player is still not compatible. I ordered the player and have had it for over a year and really like it. The sound is better than that on my friends' iPods and now that Napster has ironed out the bugs in their software, it's a great player for the subscription services. I use this all of the time and would give it at least four stars at this point. I only wish it had a slightly larger hard drive and I miss the digital clock screen that some other Creative players have.  Previous review: Okay, I don't even have mine yet but will be returning it as soon as it arrives (okay, technically Santa will be making the return even if she doesn't know it yet) as it is NOT AudibleReady. I don't know why they are offering the price discount for this player. I just didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake.   Someone on Creative's website claims to have a method for converting the files several times to something that the player can play but I don't want to bother with that since there are other players that are AudibleReady. Audible isn't much help in resolving this as their customer support just refers you to their list of AudibleReady devices and the Zen Xtra is on it (you must download extra software to make it compatible).

<Title>Beware before you buy it if you are runners!!!!
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got mine in the mail today, very excited about it.  I did a lot of research before I bought this unit, but I don't know how I missed this one.  I just found out on the website that they don't recommend you to run with this unit since you can damage the HD.  That is actually my main purpose of buying something small, so I can run with it.  Now I am stuck with this unit.  IPOD, on the other hand, has skip protection for both regular IPOD and mini IPOD.  They advertised that you can jog with it with no fear.  Don't take me wrong, after doing a lot of research about it, Zen Micro has a lot more features than any others in the market.  But if I can't jog with it, why do I need a small player for?  Another thing, I accidently chose the wrong language since the touch pad is extremely sensitive.  Now I am stuck with Japanese language.  The manual says I have to hold the menu/back botton to change the language.  I got the menu to come up, but it's in japanese, so I don't know which menu would let me change the language.  So, I reloaded my firmware according to the tech support, but there is no firmware available to download on the website yet.  They will e-mail it to me, so far I haven't got it yet.  It hasn't been a great experience for me yet so far.

<Title>Less Than What I Expected
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had a Zen 20 GB player for a couple of years and have no complaints with it. I thought a smaller lighter player might be a bit nicer. The sound quality is excellent.   I use my player through a cassette adaptor in the car alot, and I noticed that the volume on the micro had to be turned up louder than the old Zen Player in order to obtain a good linear volume control on the car stereo. This sucked the battery down in about 3-4 hours.   The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. However, the touch pad was not well designed. It's much too sensitive, even on the lowest setting. The real problem is the distance your thumb has to travel on the pad to move just one line is so short, that it sometime seems impossible to hit the function or album you want to select. Very frustrating when you keep going up and down, hoping to land on the selection you want eventually. And by all means, don't tap the pad by accident, you'll be looking at a menu you don't want at the moment too!   Overall, I was disapointed with it, and sold it after 1 week. I gave it 3 stars, based solely on the sound quality. I'll stick with the thumb wheel on the old Zen.   If you want a Hard Drive Player, get a Zen Xtra 30GB player for about the same money. If you want it for workouts or jogging, then get a 1 GB Flash Drive player.

<Title>This thing rocks!
<Date>Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.  That was before the Zen Micro came along.  I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  It's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.  Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.  I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.  This appears to prevent the lockup issue.  The battery life doesn't appear to be anywhere close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.  The extra Gb is just a bonus.  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.  If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.

<Content>I received this MP3 player as a gift last July, and I didn't start using it until last winter. However, within the past few months a significant problem has occured with the headphone jack and the sound quality is terrible now. Apparently this is a widespread problem with this player, and all you have to do is Google "headphone jack Creative Zen Micro" and find the Creative discussion board to read hundreds of complaints about this one problem. To make matters worse, their customer service is practically non-responsive. Do the smart thing and purchase a different MP3 player.

<Title>worst of the worst 
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wouldn't recommend the zen micro to anyone, even my worst enemy. I had read some of the negative reviews before purchasing the unit, but discounted all of the critisms upon reading many positive statements written here on this website.  However, I have now owned the zen micro for about a year, and just about every problem highlighted by other reviewers has come true.   Here is a partial list: 1) Hardly ever boots up cleanly 2) Stops in the middle of a track for a few minutes, then miraculously starts up again. This happens about every 15 minutes 3) Battery life (even at low volume is at most 3 hours)  Here's the thing: For the first month or so, everything worked great, then it went downhill from there. I have downloaded new firmware several times, I'm constantly rebooting the unit to try and get it to work, and sometimes it won't boot up at all. Basically it's a time consuming and never ending struggle. In addition, Creative have not been helpful in trying to resolve all the issues. Sure it sounds great, when it works, but do you really want all the hassle? I don't...I'm getting an ipod.

<Title>From a kid's perspective
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased a green zen micro with my babysitting money in September 2005.I had done my research and was either going to purchase this or an Ipod mini. I made a mistake by purchasing the zen micro.  At first it was great. The sound quality was good as well as the headphones. Then after a while the sound quality got poorer and the headphones broke. After 3 or 4 months the headphone jack got messed up and you have to keep adjusting the headphones to get any sound at all. One time I dropped the player off of the counter and thought I broke it but my dad figured out how to fix it. What you do is you take out the battery and thump the back of the player a couple times and then put the battery back in and try to turn it back on. If it doesnt work the first time then keep trying and eventually it will. Here are the pros and cons  Pros-  good accessories- wall charger FM radio  Playlist function Voice recorder   5 GB storage-plenty for my collection   Cons- bad headphone jack poor sound quality after a few months battery life not as long as they say  Overall I would say go with another player because this one doesnt last very long. I will probably end up buying an Ipod nano because from the reviews I have read the problems I have had with the zen micro don't seem to happen to Ipods.

<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first got this as an xmas gift, as i was looking for a step up from what i had originally, which was a very small 30 song player. I wasnt completley sure of the Zen, but, after owning it for many months, this is definitley the right choice of a mp3 player. Its worked perfectly, the only fault that has happened for me, is that i broke the USB cable. Pros: 1. Same price as an Ipod Nano, but, more than double the space 2. Great construction 3. FM Radio and Voice Recorder 4. Plenty of Space for Music 5. Rechargeable 6. Excellent firmware with player, Itunes compatible  Cons: 1. Battery life is shortened if backlight is left on 2. Some people have had problems with the headphone jack, So far i havent. 3. Out of Package Battery can only be recharged through Computer connection. Creative does sell a hookup with the player and a wall outlet, as well as car outlets sepratley. 4. All of your friends with Ipods will be jealous that you got a better player for less.

<Title>Too fragile for a portable device
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like the features of my Zen micro. But the product is VERY fragile. I won't buy another Creative product in the future because of my bad experience with this product.  First, let me say that I bought the Zen Micro because I wanted a full-featured MP3 player, but I didn't want to pay for the "coolness" factor of the Ipod.  I liked that the Micro had a replaceable battery, and an FM radio (although the radio doesn't pull in a good signal most of the time).  But I am on my 4th replacement Zen Micro. The first time was because of the loose headphone jack problem. The second was because my 2 yr old son got hold of it and dropped it 12 inches onto a hardwood floor. The third time is because I dropped it about 2 feet onto a hard carpet floor while taking it out of my pocket. It not like I was throwing it around. It's a portable device; it's gonna get dropped! Creative should make these more sturdy!  Hopefully I can keep my 4th Micro without breaking for a while.  If you insist on buying the Zen Micro, here are my suggestions.  BE SURE YOU BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM THE STORE when you buy this product. The BestBuy 2 year warranty was worth the 50 bucks it cost me.  Keep the player in the case provided, It's bulky, and makes it hard to keep in a pocket, but will provide a level of protection.  DON'T use the belt clip. The clip essentially slides into the case but does not latch or lock or anything. The clip comes loose VERY easily from the case and will cause you to drop your player.  To prevent the headphone jack from breaking, I rolled a strip of paper into a tube, and slipped it around the space between the jack and the case. This prevented the headphone jack from moving and breaking the solder connections. Creative may have fixed the headphone jack soldering on new models, but I'm not taking the chance.  Buyer Beware!

<Content>Unlike those who've experienced technical problems with jacks and being fragile, my zen micro has flown off the tread mill more than once...in fact, I'm needing to replace the belt clip, which did break....the player did not.  It took me a bit to figure out the menus, and I don't love the way (I think) that the playlists have to be created on the computer and synced...so I suppose the software could be easier.  I personally use the record feature with the built in mic, so I can get a song idea from my head into a digital format very quickly - like we used to do with hand held tape recorders..but this is so much better.   I haven't used or had an ipod, so I can't compare, but I sure wouldn't like to have to use itunes....and this has been a great little player for me for about a year!  Just wish accessories were cheaper and replacement parts easier to find!

<Title>Zen micro - poorly designed
<Date>Wed Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has a decent audio quality, but it has a lot of fatal flaws: 1)	Its headset socket is extremely poorly designed. It does not go through the PCB, so the factory soldering cannot keep it in place. I have re-soldered it once already and within 2-3 months it is back to the same problem. 2)	The radio is useless. I live in the Chicago metropolitan area and I cannot get any of the radio stations I normally listen to. Even in the gym where their transmitters are close enough I the FM tuner does not pick up the signal. 3)	It is extremely slow when booting up and navigating is slow. 4)	The keypad is a pain too, even though the sensitivity could be adjusted. I would not recommend this player to anyone.

<Content>I love my Zen Micro.   The sound quality is great and it gets a great signal on FM radio.  My favorite thing about it is the fact that I can add and delete songs individually or as a group using Windows Explorer.  I don't even bother with the software that came with it.  I just drag and drop the songs I want to add.

<Title>Love this player
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I've had mine for about 7 months now and still love it. I really like it's small size so I normally carry it in a cheap cell-phone holder on my belt. No real problems with battery life at this stage (and I shouldn't have either). The face plate control was a little fiddly, but no interface is going to be perfect so you just get on with it.   I REALLY like the fact it has a radio, it was a big selling point to me as I listen to a lot of talk-radio during the day. I was leary of the iPod because of it's battery changing problem (you have to send it back to Apple). Don't know if it is the same deal with the Zen Micro, but I hope not. Only gripe is I have to charge it via the USB cable, there is no seperate power adapter (that I can see). I tried to charge it with a lap-top that did not have the Zen software installed, and it did not charge! Even when I left it overnight. I don't understand why it didn't charge. Having the software installed shouldn't make a difference...   For my birthday I ditched the little white ear-buds that came with it and splurged on a set of Shure E2c noise insulating ear buds. Man what a difference! They are not noise-cancelling, but work like an ear-plug, blocking out external noise.  [...] Highly recommended.  There are plenty of in-depth, technical reviews out there already, so I will not bother repeating them here. Two thumbs up!

<Title>Creative Products:  Truly poor technical quality
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After several attempts to own a functional Zen Micro, I give up.  It should not be this hard; iPod, here I come.  My first Zen Micro broke within three months of opening the box.  I returned it (a small but manageable hassle).  I received an entirely new one about two weeks later, no charge.  Two months later, had power management issues with the new one; Creative recommeded an upgrade to the firmware.  OK, fine.  Three months later, the thing completely crashes -- no music, no connectivity to my PC, nothing but a permanent splash screen.  I tried the restore mode, but none of the restore functions were working.  The thing was dead dead dead.  I called Creative to see what they could do.  For $25, they could tell me what I already knew:  it wasn't working and needed to be fixed.  Then, they made it clear that they would be charging me for whatever it took to fix it.  All this despite the fact that THEY sent me this lemon and it was less than a year (read: still within warranty) since I had received it.  Great customer service, eh?  Bad product + bad customer service = doomed company.  Don't buy a Creative Product.

<Title>Great player!
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player, this is my second Mp3 player, first one being the Creative Nomad2. Firmware upgrade is a MUST for Zen micro. It was very tough to 'create' cons for this player.   Con: I am sort of jealous that 'click wheel' belongs to Ipod, the touch pad of Zen Micro is very good, but since its a vertical bar pad, as your thumb reaches the end, you have to lift the thumb for further browing. so much work! but this is an excuse only for extremely lazy guys like me.  Pro:  1.Good Battery life 2.Good Music Quality 2.Drag-and-drop feature doesnt require any 'seamless integration with a software' 3.Compatible to Subscription music(i use Yahoo unlimited)  Other: with Flash-based players catching up to 5Gb capacity, this might soon vanish.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ok, I have had my Creative Zen Micro for about 1 year. It is definitely far and away then the Ipod. First of all, its not an Ipod like everyone has, its something different. No ITUNES to use, Mediasource and Explorer are so simple to use(drag and drop). Battery life is great, I get at least 9+ hours on a charge. Holdability and colors are nice! Next, USB 2.0 kills Firewire point blank! Transferring data is quick and easy. You can also use the player as a Removable HARD DRIVE!! That isn't true on the Ipod. Lastly the FM radio, recording off of the radio, and outlook sync is cool. Other reviewers don't seem to be careful with their player! Also sensitive can be controlled in the system settings!  Apple is far behind this player in most respects. All they really have is  a marketing campaign! What person that uses an Ipod has a Mac computer. I would say 1 in 20 or ever more! Get a windows based player for a windows system!    Keys: -Price I got mine on sale at the time for $179! -No Apple to deal with Itunes -Removable Battery -Great Layout, Menus, Buttons -Customer Service- Easy to connect to creative on the phone. Very helpful. Getting a hold of Apple is like pulling teeth. -Plays Many formats mp3, wav, etc and great software too! -Firmware updates are easy  Downfall: -Earbuds are not great. I Recommend a pair of Sennheiser headphones highly. -Need to buy a skin or case if using heavily -Creative Doesn't market their products Thanks!

<Title>It was pretty Iffy.
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am 14, and I recieved a Zen Mirco for christmas of 2005. I was thrilled to own it, and even more thrilled to have matching speakers. I quickly uplaoded dozens and dozens of songs, just jamming to my music. I enjoyed being able to shuffle my music. My mom knew how badly I wanted an mp3 player with a touchpad. The Zen is a thousand times better then an iPod, if you ask me. I was in love, but about a week later, when we went out to watch the fireworks for New years, I had a hard drive failure. I wasn't able to turn it back on. Devestated, I sent it back. It look a little longer then they said it would, but I was thrilled when i finally got it back 1 1/2 monthes later.  I still had a problem, though. My Zen would not shut down. I chould charge it completely, turn it on, immeadiatly shut it back down, and it would say "shutting down" for hours, until it finally ran out of batteries. There was no way to turn it off without removing the battery. Soon enough, my dad realized why Iw as taking the battery out, re-did the ahrddrive and firmware, and now, it takes a few seconds to turn it off, that's it.  I highly reccommend this item, but be prepared. There could be a time when it needs to be sent away and fixed. If you are willing to work with a problem, this item is for you. I still love my zen, and I bring it with my everywhere.  Being able to create playlists is totally awesome. I have a playlsit devoted to just gentle music to relax me before bed, and I have another list with vibrant, loud music to dance to. You can create doezens of playlists, for any type of music you are craving at that moment.  The fact that it's all in alphabetical order and is catogorized bo genre, album, song title, and/or artist makes it even better.

<Title>Great Player!!!
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had mine for a couple of days.  I bought it without the firmware and documentation.  I had to download the firmware and try to figure out how to get the music on the player using Creative Media and after a few hours went back to using Windows Media.  I wanted my gentle music on one playlist and the other music on another and to randomly play each.  You have to have some kind of knowledge on how to do this, although once you figure it out it's not that hard to do.  If you have your music on your computer and just want to download it and play it randomly, you can do that with little or no knowledge.  It takes some playing around with the unit to figure out how to do playlists etc.  My advice is to not buy it without the firmware and documentation no matter what kind of bargain you think your getting. The unit has great sound and plays "play for sure" songs.  If you download music from Wal Mart or any other "play for sure" site this is the player for you.

<Title>A good buy with a few glitches. 
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well I must say I love my mp3 player. It really is great. this zen is one of the best alternatives to the ipod. It has everything you'd ever need to just listen to music. Also, it is compatible with the subscription survices such as napster-to-go and rhapsody. Over-all its one of the best mp3 players on the market. But, it does have glitches which seem to fairly common. sometimes the player will just freeze up, some problems where your computer will simply stop reading it, and it also has a tendency to duplicate songs in the playlist because of licenses but it can be fixed by reformatting. (which erases everything) Overall it is a great mp3 player with a few minor glitches. I would still take it over most of the competitors.

<Date>Tue Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sound quality is superb and the interface is comparable to the simplicity of the mini ipod.  With extra 1GB, FM radio and built-in mic, extra accesories (pouch bag, battery charger, and USB cable, and belt clip) make it superior in value.  The minuses are the battery life, which does not seem to live to the claim made by Creative, by a longshot.  I got lucky because my unit was a limted edition, which came w/ two batteries.  The FM signal reach is only good for strong signals.  The headphones' sound quality is above average but the earpiece is a bit too large.  All in all, it is a gret device.

<Title>Better than an IPod!
<Date>Sat Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Zen Micro for a week now and I'm incredibly pleased.  I looked at quite a few players and it came down to this or an ipod mini.  I finally chose the Zen because it just seemed like more bang for my buck.  With the Zen you get an extra 1GB of memory for music or removable storage, FM radio, radio/voice recording, organizer features, removable battery, and some nice small touches like alarm clock with autoplay.  Aesthetics: 4.5/5  I would have preferred a single color for both the body and faceplate (silver in my case) but that's just a small quibble.  Overall it's small and just plain cool looking.  Furthermore it's already survived a fall to a hard surface.  So I'll conditionally call it sturdy as well.  Accessories: 4.5/5  Came with an extra battery and belt clip.  It also comes with a stand that I have not used. I would prefer a case that covered the faceplate but the belt-clip is fine and there are 3rd party cases that will fit.  USB connector and power cord are included as is a fairly useless drawstring cloth bag.  Functionality 5/5  MP3 player with partionable hard drive for file storage. The FM tuner is excellent.  Recording radio or via microphone is easy and useful.  I haven't fully explored the organizer features yet but I imagine the ability to sync addresses and appointments with Outlook will come in handy.  Battery life is spec'ed as 12 hrs; I'm getting around 8 hrs of MP3 play.   Sound Quality 5/5  The sound quality on both mp3 playback and radio play is fantastic and better than the ipod.  Ease of Use 4/5  The Zen Micro is ultimately very easy to use but I'm taking an extra half point off here because of poor documentation.  The printed booklet provides only minimal information and the PDF instruction book is not much better.     The touch pad takes a little bit of practice and is not for the arthritic but ultimately is easy to use. Touchpad has adjustable sensitivity and can be turned off to avoid accidental activation.  Navigation is fairly intuitive but the player would benefit from a "home" button to get you out of nested menus a little faster.       A note on installation:  When I initially connected it to my laptop, the Zen micro froze.  It turns out it is finicky about which USB port it syncs with and I've noted that others have had similar problems with USB connectivity ports/cords.  Other than this single incident, I have not had technical problems with it.  Also note that there is a firmware upgrade available on the Creative site.    Overall, I'm incredibly happy with this device and recommend it to others interested in a mini player with more than just mp3 playback.

<Title>for my first mp3 player i really like it
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have never had an mp3 and everywhere i look i see an ipod or something similar.  I have read many reviews here and in magazines and what not and talked my wife into getting me the zen micro for the holidays.  My original reasoning was for the battery life as i have heard bad things about the products without a removable battery and also i wanted to have a FM radio as i like to listen to that on my morning commute.   So now after using it for 2 weeks I have to say i love it, but i gave it a 4 and not a 5 because i think it needs improvement.  I think the improvement it needs is with the FM tuner for some reason mine doesn't seem to work everywhere.  It only works in 1 room in my house but to be honest I have no need for the fm tuner when i have this thing with me.  As i previous stated i listened to the fm radio on my morning commute but when you have over 100 of your favorite cds(with plenty of room to spare) in the palm of your hands why bother with the radio.  At first i admit i didn't know how to use the touchpad and i even switched it to some kind of asian language but I was able to figure out how to get it back to english and then it took me about 2 more uses to get it down pat and now i consider myself a pro at it so I think if someone took the time they would figure it out and be shocked as i am that there are so many compalints about it.     Also, I have to say that the battery lasts me 4 days of my commute which is about 2 1/2 hours a day which comes to about 10-11 hours, they advertise 12, to be honest i got an extra battery with my zen micro so this is not an issue for me.    I think the software is also very easy to use too. It has help right in front of you if u need it and answers pretty much any question u have. I know i needed it when i first started but again i was able to figure out everything i needed.   Now about my complaint, overall i don't think of it as such an issue to deter someone from buying it but i would have liked for the radio to work better.  My cell phone has an fm radio and it definitely works better than this one, but then again i can't listen to almost all my cds from my cell phone, until that comes out i will be proud to have this.

<Title>My first mp3...
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Zen Micro is my first mp3, and I am quite pleased.  Even the packaging gave the impression that this gizmo was top-notch.  So, without further ado:  ***Pros...The presentation is very cool.  I still smile whenever the neon outline comes on.  *The sound is excellent, now that I've rcvd my Sony EX51LP ear buds, (Amazon, $25.49 w/ free shipping).  *The re-chargeable, re-placeable battery is definately the way to go.  *The thing is so tiny and light, I don't even bother with the belt clip.  I just put in in a pocket, and always hit the lock.  *I do some pretty rough hiking with it, and it never skips.  It's only "glitched" on me while tracking once or twice, and I'm not sure that that wasn't the fault of the download.  But damn, this thing sounds good.  ***Reservations...So far, the battery life is nowhere near 12 hours. (maybe seven?)  But, I did get two batteries.  *The touch pad absolutely requires a deft touch, and I do mean deft.  Folks with ham hands should definately keep looking.  *The printed manual is not a manual at all, and the virtual manual is sketchy at best.  I'm still trying to figure out how to do some basic player functions, and can't find them listed anywhere in the "manual".  *I don't care for the music management software.  I already have my cds recorded to hard drive with Roxio, and there's a great deal of confusion in the transfer of files to the Micro.  I may have only two or three cuts per album from several albums in a single folder titled under the artists name.  But the player won't download them as folders.  It downloads them as all of the individual albums, meaning that many albums on the player only have the two or three cuts.  Also, I have quite a few jazz compilations.  The player lists each individual artist, from each cut of each compilation.  This makes the "artist" category on the player totally unwieldy.  And almost none of the albums are listed under genre, making that category useless.  Now, all of this may just be my inexperience, but it's not all as easy as the p.r. says it is.   All in all, though, I am very satisfied with the Zen Micro.

<Title>Had Potential
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The following describes my horrible experience with the Zen Micro and may not necessarily be indicative of all.  The Zen Micro's battery life is advertised to last up to 12 hours, but I was only getting 7.5 after installing the latest firmware upgrade and properly conditioning the batteries. For testing purposes I used 128kbps MP3 files, volume level 8, no EQ setting, no backlighting, and the headphones that came with the product. Given these non-demanding settings, the battery performance was truly disappointing.   I really wanted to give it another chance so I got a new replacement within a few days. My second Zen Micro completely locked up as soon as the USB cable was plugged in. Since I hadn't return my original unit yet, I was able to try the other known working cable but got the same results. I was not even able to upgrade the firmware, let alone transfer music, because of the lockup problem.    I really wanted to like this MP3 player (great style, sound, build quality, features) but two defective products in a row is totally unacceptable. I should have been more suspicious about Creative products since my Muvo TX FM player was buggy as well (i.e. player would immediately shut down when powering on).    REVIEW UPDATE I recently got the Rio Carbon and am much happier. I was able to get 19.5 hours of power immediately after the initial charge and can get 21 hours at times. Although the battery isn't replaceable, it should last two years and much better players would be out by then anyway. Thinking back, even if I hadn't experienced all the technical problems, the Zen Micro wasn't really suitable to my needs in the first place. The Zen's interface isn't tactile friendly at all and can be inconvenient to use during exercising or driving. For example, it's impossible to skip tracks or adjust the volume by simply reaching into my pocket (or the car's center console) feeling for the appropriate flat button to push. It's not even recommended to jog with it anyway. I guess I was initially attracted to the Zen due to its sleek design and coolness factor, but good usability is more important.

<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Disgusted with apple's terrible customer service, I vowed never to buy anything apple again and jumped at the micro. For a while it worked very well. Yes, it would often start "rebuilding the library" for no good reason. And it often seemed twitchy - but I was willing to overlook these flaws. In fact, I bought one for my girlfriend's birthday. BUT, that one had to be returned to creative after less than 2 weeks, when it just froze. It was still within the 90 day window when creative will fix it no questions asked - which was great. Fastforward a few months and now mine is broken too!! What gives?? Obviously mine is well past the 90 day window and even though its still within the 1 year warranty period, Creative wants money to fix it. Thats rich. Save yourself the headache. The quality control on this thing is terrible. When it works it works well. But more often than not its acting up.

<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>after a couple months of use, the head phone jack broke and I could hardly hear any sound, i sent it in for repair. i was happy again, but just for 2 months because the darn thing broke again, but my warrenty was alredy over. I need a new mp3 player. Not sure if this is a common problem or just with creative products. I didn't want apple ipod players, but I think I might switch to the other side. UPDATE: I found a website explaining how you can fix it by using a soldering iron. I have never used a soldering iron before, but i went out and bought one and fixed it. If I was able to fix mine, I'm pretty sure you can fix yours too. I'm a girl.  Update September 4, 2006: After fixing it with the soldering iron, the problem came back about a month later. i probably didn't fix it that well and the headphone jack thing became loose. Heck, I don't know. I don't care. I need a new mp3 player for my bus ride to school. For sure it's not going to be a creative product.

<Content>I am trying to be a loyal fan of the Zen Micro but it is getting increasingly difficult.  I am having the same problem with the head phone jack.  I sent my original purchase back because it was within its warranty but then the replacement product began having the same problem.  I don't know, I may have to go over to iPod just to get a working product.  I was really in love with the Zen Micro (when it worked) because the features were awesome.  I don't think I will buy another Creative product because a functioning product is not too much to ask. Just recently I purchased the Zen Micro Photo.  Itis a great looking product.  After reading more than a few reviews, I am certain the ear jack problem will not be an issue with this one.  Wish me luck.

<Content>this mp3 player is good but not great. i've been having a few problems with it. and i've only had it for less than a year.  - it scratches really really easily - the head phone jack broke so the sound quality is really bad - the earphones that come with it don't fit in my ears and they broke easily  but i do think this player is a lot better than ipods! a few of my friends have ipods and they've had lots of problems with them. i'm not really an ipod type of person. i've never really liked apple products. and the ipods are a rip-off. a 4GB ipod nano is $249 and a 8GB ZEN MicroPhoto is only $229. it's probably because the nano is so thin and stylish. but you can get so many more accesories with the ipod.   the Creative MediaSource is realy easy to use. it works great! very easy to download from the instalation cd too.   so for my new mp3 player i want the Sony Walkman Bean but the blue one of has 512MB. not enough for me. and i've heard some bad things about it too.  so i'm not sure which mp3 player to get next.  and if you do deside to buy this mp3 player than a totally recommend buying the TravelDock ZEN Micro as well. its pretty cool! and works great! but for some reason the FFW button on my remote doesnt work. oh well. i still love it.   hope this helps!

I was so happy when i got it. It takes only 3 hrs to charge, when the ipod mini takes 4(guess it doesn't really make a difference)       also, the zen micro comes w/ a USB cable, carring pouch, belt attatchment, and a 12 hr battery, and in the MP3 is a microphone, to record things.       I hv read most of the peoples reviews, and it sounds like theirs broke really quickly but i hv had it 4 almost 5 months, and mine is in perfect condition!      Finally, the ipod doesn't hv FM radio, if u like to listen to radio and even record it, u should get the creative ZEN micro.

<Title>It's no I-Pod...
<Date>Mon Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>But it is still a good device. With 5 Gig for space you can fill this thing up! It's very sensitive when you get it so you may have to adjust the Touch Pad like I did.  *Pros  -Cheaper than an I-Pod and holds more (for the price, that is) -Nice, modern look -Add songs and delete them easily -FM Radio (I don't use it so it's just extra) -12 hours of playtime -Displays song name, album title and singer name -Has an alarm that automatically turns on device (I can't turn it off! [Not the device but the alarm!])  *Cons  -Way too sensitive on default Touch Pad settings  I own one of these but there isn't much else I can say about it. Oh yeah, it glows blue!!! Sweet!

<Title>it was my lover...
<Date>Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved my little creative zen micro. i did a crapload of research about a year ago and decided on a dark blue one. then, i was comparing it to the ipod mini.   pros: >so cute =] >on-the-go playlists [i loved this feature] >gorgeous blue backlight >great sound quality >the interface >removable battery [yess...] >radio [reception wasnt that great though, could just be where i live] >microsoft outlook >loads of other stuff  cons: >program was slowww... >no gamess...=[ >[see below]  and i dont think the touchpad is THAT sensitive. i got used to it just fine =] and   unfortunately, after a year, my little zen micro died. recently it had gotta slower & startecd freezing up more often. i would always restart it or take the battery out and rebooot it. it would always say "reloading library" and have a little bar showing the progress. except NOW it says reloading library and the bar doesnt move at ALL. and then the battery dies. so i recharge it and it starts all over again.   but for the year it was with me, it was the best little mp3 player someone could have. it completely outperformed the ipod mini [EVERYONE has one, i swear. or everyone did. now everyone has the nano.]  now i just dont know what to do. the warranty was over months ago but i still might call tech support.  im considering getting a new mp3 player, since im anti-ipod [dont argue with me] and one thats small. and under two hundred bucks. and AT LEAST one gig, even  though thats so many steps down from my 5 gig =[. any suggestions? or else im going to cave and spend three hundred dollars on the creative vision:m. even though im a bit pissed at creative right now.

<Title>Broke@4 months, Creative wants money
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will never recommend the Zen Micro to anyone.  My 16 yr-old has had one since late 11/05.  By 4-months, we are now unable to turn on the unit, & the headphone plug is loose in the unit(headphones are designed for use w/mp3 players). Since purchase, we have now discovered that after 90 days, Creative Labs wants approx.$25 to test the unit. If it is within the 1-year warranty, they will replace/repair the unit, but will not do so without $25. If anyone reads this, please "DON'T BUY ONE!!!" We spend enough money on an mp3 player & should not have to spend money so soon after purchase for repair.

<Title>Worth the Money
<Date>Tue Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>[UPDATE]  Nearly two years later, I still have a working Creative Zen Micro. However, aside from the technical setbacks mentioned at the end of this review, I have encountered a few more problems. After several months of use, maybe a year, the ear buds broke, forcing me to buy a new ones (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JUZE1Q/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-2622009-2464039">Earbud Headphones - White/blue</a> from Sony). Another problem that I can't seem to figure out is that sometimes, while it is playing a song, it gets briefly interrupted by another song or sound for a brief second and does this repeatedly throughout the song until you skip to another song. Another annoying issue is that sometimes, when I hook up the player to my computer, I cannot organize my tracks with the Creative Organizer because it cannot detect the player for some strange reason. However, luckily, I can still use the Creative Explorer to import new tracks, etc. Though the Creative Zen Micro remains functional for me, I feel that you should probably spend an extra $100 for a better MP3 player, such as the Ipod or Zune.  [/UPDATE]  For a while, I have investigated MP3 players, trying to decide which one I should buy and particuarly comparing them to the Ipod Mini. Based on the information I gathered, I made a unique move by stepping outside of the box and buying a Creative Zen Micro instead. I've concluded that the Creative Zen Micro greatly surpasses the Ipod mini in several categories, making it much more worth my money.  First of all, one of the biggest things to consider is the cost of the item. I was able to purchase my Creative Zen Micro for $171, including shipping and handling, as well as tax. The Ipod mini, on the other hand, is only available for around $240, not including shipping and handling or tax.   For $70 cheaper, I get 5 GB of memory space, an FM tuner, an organizer, 2 separate batteries (each providing 12 hours of playtime), a case, belt clip, stand, pouch, headphones, AC/DC power adapter, and USB 2.0 cable. However, the Ipod mini, at $240, offers only 4 GB of space and only 18 hours of playtime. It lacks an FM tuner, case, pouch, AC/DC adapter, and organizer, which are useful accessories and features to have.   - An FM tuner always provides refreshingly new music, which comes in handy when the songs get tiresome or repetitive when listened to too often. - The case and pouch help protect the MP3 player itself and save the buyer of having the time and money of having to purchase them.  - The organizer is helpful in keeping a record of events and contacts.  - The AC/DC adapter is an alternative way to charge the MP3 player, which becomes particularly useful when a computer is not available.  Finally, one of the main things that makes the Creative Zen Micro so superior to the Ipod Mini is its sound quality. Creative is known for its enhanced sound quality, which is one of the best in the business, whereas Ipod's is simply mediocre. Another additional bonus about the Creative Zen Micro is its compatibility with WMA files, which save the user time from having to convert WMA files to MP3 files. It also keeps a list of the songs that have been played the most and those that have been played the least. This helps the user single out favorite songs and new songs. Though navigation may feel a bit clumsy for some, the Micro's search feature makes finding tracks a breeze, whereas   to the best of my knowledge, the Ipod does not have one.  There are a flaws to mention about the Micro however:  1. Though some people are completely comfortable with the Micro's navigation, I find it is a little difficult. There are only 3 sensitivity settings and all three feel strange to me. The thing that is probably the most bothersome is how the scroller is also the selector, so if you're scrolling and accidentally tap it too hard, it will select something you did not want selected. I also think that the Ipod Mini's circular scroller is faster and more intuitive, but the Micro's vertical one is tolerable.   2. Yes, some people have claimed that their Creative Zen Micro broke within a matter of months or they bumped into some technical difficulties. This is not a myth. I, too, have been a victim, as my MP3 player froze a few days after receiving it from Amazon. However, I contacted Creative and they were very helpful and prompt in responding. Though I did have to pay a few dollars for shipping the product back to them, I received a fully functional replacement that I still use on a regular basis to this day (months later). I have researched a little to see how many people have suffered from any kind of technical difficulties with the Micro and have found that there are indeed a large amount. There are some who are more unfortunate than others, but it is more likely that you will not suffer from such problems and if you do, you will receive an excellent replacement.   Despite these few annoyances, the Creative Zen Micro is worth it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase as I saved $70 while receiving more features than the Ipod Mini.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Micro for a little over a week now, and I'm very happy with it so far.  It's much smaller than I expected.  It's about the size of my Motorola flip phone.  It fits well into the hand and has a nice solid feel to it.  So far, I have a little over 1100 songs on it, and I have about a gig and a half left.  I've been ripping my music at 128 WMA, so I expected to get less than that advertised 2500 songs.  The radio is pretty good.  The reception isn't stellar, but I get a pretty good signal from most of my favorite stations. I'm also very happy with the way it syncs to Outlook.  It froze up on me when I first charged it up, but I simply took out the battery and restarted it and it hasn't happened again since.  I've loaded the software (not bad, not great, but very usable), upgraded the firmware, and loaded over 1k songs and I haven't had any problems at all.  The touch sensitive interface takes about a half hour to get used to, but it's a piece of cake after that.  A few nits:  1) The earbuds really are huge.  I read that on a few other reviews and it's true.  I have to wedge them into my ear and they fall out as soon as I move my head.  I'll definitely be changing those.  2) The battery life has been less than expected.  I'm getting about 7 hours per charge.  I've read some reviews that state that you need to cycle through a few charges first, so I'm hoping it will improve.  It's still better than the iPod.  Overall, I'm very happy with this player.  It looks very cool and performs nicely.  I thought seriously about an iPod, but was sold on the extra gig, FM radio, sync to Outlook, and longer battery life.  I would highly recommend this player.

Reasons why 4 stars and not 5: 1)  software interface (iTunes still superior to anything else out there) 2)  accessories (new product and not as widespread as iPods, hence very few accessories available)

<Title>Totally awsome music player, with a few flaws..
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i got my Zen micro for an early Christmas present.  and i must say THIS THING IS AWSOME!!! it is so easy to download music into it, it also has a FM tuner so i can listen to my favorite Radio.  when i got it i was amazed at its size! i never knew it would be so small.  however, there are also a few flaws of the Zen Micro.  1.The Touch Pad-  i totally like the touch pad, it is fast to scroll down to my favorite music.  however, i did have a hard time getting used to it.  Everytime i would try to scroll down, it would press enter instead, it is a little bit confusing to use it.  however I got used to it, and now i am a pro at using the pad.  2.Users Guide- The first time i got it, i was looking the the guide on tips.  the guide accually does not have anything very useful, it only has the basics.  And the way they show you how to download music doesnt explain it very lucidly.  Everytime i would put it in the USB, it would say that i do not have the Hi-Speed USB Bus Controller.  so i thought that i could not download music into it. however, i was determined to find a way, so i did.  it was very very easy to download music in to it.  it also doesnt show you ANYTHING about using the Zen.  but it is, afterall, very easy to use.  3.Battery Charge- The first time i charged it overnight, i woke up and it automaticly turned on.  i tried to turn it off, but no matter how hard i tried to turn it off, it didnt turn off.  worried i kept on trying to trun it off, so at last i took out the battery and put it back it. it didnt change how it worked, everything was normal.  i still, to this day, cannot find out what happened.  Besides these Cons, the Zen micro is ultimatley an awsome music player.  My friend who owns a Dell DJ and another friend who owns a mini IPOD, wants my Zen.

<Title>awesome little thing
<Date>Fri Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received mine 2 days ago and luckily mine came with an extra battery. Overall I am amazed with this thing. It is a great by has many features and looks cool.  Design-4 1/2- well this player looks sweet. The backlight is great and the edge light is awesome. One thing I don't like is the battery is hard to get to. This is why it got four and a half. Also amazing is the size. This thing is small. It is also light. Compared to my Zen 40GB xtra it is a feather.  Touch pad- 4 1/2- well this little thing is really interesting. It does take some time to get used to though. It is very nice and is fast. I recommend you keep it on medium sensitivity because I find it works best.  Sound quality- 5 - amazing   Radio- 4 - what can you expect? The radio is pretty nice quality. It has presets and auto scan which detects radio stations. Good news-no antenna cause the headphone string doubles as one, radio recording is the same quality as you hear. The bad- it is hard to find good reception sometimes.  Mic- 5- great no complaints  Ease of use- 6- yeah it is amazingly user accessible. it has customizable menus, auto dj, id3 tagging so it sorts by albums, artists and stuff, has search , sleep timer , wake timer, clock, calendar, and if you use Microsoft outlook it syncs up contacts, calendars, phone #s, email.  Stuff- 5- battery life is okay. Im averaging about ten hours per charge. Lucky for me I got a free extra battery. Also available is a remote.  Overall it is awesome players go and get one today

<Content>Creative has hit a home run with this player! I received my Micro(White) yesterday and I couldn't be happier. This tiny little wonder is great. It is my first mp3 player and I had it up and running in minutes. The vertical scroll bar hasn't been a problem for me at all. Creating playlists is a snap and adds to the versatility of the player. I used Windows Media Player 10 to transfer my music. It worked without any glitches. I highly recommend the Creative Zen Micro to anyone who wants a fantastic player that works as good as it looks.  By the way, Amazon had this to me in three days with free shipping! They totally back up what they sell, so go ahead  and get off the fence and join the mp3 revolution.

<Title>Should I kick myself ?
<Date>Sat Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A lot of 'iPod killer' nonsense has been written about the Zen Micro. As an iPod Mini owner should I be kicking myself? I don't think so and here's why:   1. I am a programmer and I bought such a product for both business and pleasure. And for business, I'm sorry to say, the Zen just won't cut it because of the stupid software required to use it as a hard disk. With the iPod it's just plug and play, no drivers or software needed. And I'm using USB 1!!!!!  2. Buying an MP3 player is as much an emotional, impulsive decision as it is a logical one. So yes the Zen Micro might be a bit cheaper, have a better battery system, more features, but it's not enough to sway me. After Creative announced it I was wondering if my purchase was foolish, I'm now relieved to say no. And to my eyes, the Mini looks nicer, it has a purity of design that the Micro lacks.  In conclusion, I'll still give the Micro 4 stars as by all accounts it's an excellent product. But, contrary to popular belief, it ain't no Mini killer either.

<Content>After the first day of using this player, I have to say that I am very happy with it. The sound quality on this thing is absolutely amazing, which when you think about it, is not too surprising Creative makes excellent sound cards. The device is a little touchy as far as the touchpad goes, but any accidental pushes can easily be avoided by putting the lock function on the device, no biggie. The organization and import software is very straight forward, it installed just great on my laptop, and with little difficulty on my relic of a desktop.

<Title>I Just Can't Get Over the TouchPad
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>What's not to love about the Zen Micro?  It's everything you could want in a player and more.  In addition to standard music features, you get FM, FM recording, Voice recorder, and synchronization with MS Outlook.  The accompanying software worked well, too.  Hardware-wise the 12-hr battery is magnificent and the player can also act as a removable disk to take computer files with you on the go.  Why am I returning mine?  I just can't get over the over-sensitive touchpad.  It is just unbearable.  I've given it a lot of chances too.  I've tried the low, medium, and high sensitivity settings.  I'm fairly skilled with handheld devices, I've used a Palm Pilot, Blackberry, and cell phones for years.  I've played video games my whole life and am handy with many controllers.  I develop computer software for a living.  I am a customer who REALLY wanted this to work out.  I've been shopping for a portable audio device for a year and this was THE one, loaded with all the features I wanted and more.  I've read other reviews where people write they eventually become comfortable with the touchpad.  For your sake, I hope you can.  I just can't stand the frustration.  Apparently Creative is aware of this, too.  They even place a special "quick tips" flyer in the box detailing how to use the touchpad if "you are new to the vertical touchpad."  It didn't solve my issues.  Sadly, now I've been spoiled and expect all these features in a player.  Now I may be sitting on the sidelines for a while until Creative or another vendor come out with another feature-filled player AND one with reasonable navigation.

<Title>My Precious!!!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yeah, it's a LoTR qoute, but what other phrase describes it? I've been experiencing my "Moment of Zen" since Mid-Oct. and haven't looked back to the days of making a whole CD to add ONE song. I can only write of what I have seen and heard...and sadly, others may have found out otherwise...but I've really enjoyed this awesome little music player. It's never skipped once, I take it everywhere 'cept work (But it would work there, jsut not allowed by management)...jogging, riding my bike, driving, to class (where the integrated and ADJUSTABLE flash drive emulator has become a staple of my existence), or jsut relaxing after a hard day of work (like I've had one of those, lol).   I found the space to be a little low (6 or 7 gigs would've been perfect 4 me, but the price was too high). It works so well with my PC and putting music on and organizing it is a snap! My favorite is the ability to build playlists on my compputer and copy them onto the device. It's not a new thing I know...to be able to do that...but having been used to waiting 5 to 7 seconds for my old CD player to load up the next song, this seems instantaneus (which makes the playlist seem more fluid-straight from one song to the next). Surely no one really deserves to go to any album from anywhere in under 2 seconds, but this will do jsut that!      I would gladly recomend this to anyone, and the touchpad (which took me-a total klutz- only a few hours to get used to) that lights up in the dark makes it look so cool!

<Title>superb player: better than iPod mini
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Creative Zen Micro almost an year ago. I did extensive research before buying this product and I'm glad I made a good decision. The other contender was iPod Mini 4 GB Some of the cool features I liked about this player are:  Vertical scroll pad: this make it very easy to navigate through a long list of albums, titles and artists. I have heard people saying that it is a difficult to use, but if you use it for 10-15 minutes, you won't have any trouble with it. it's pretty much like a touchpad on a laptop.  Power adaptor: though you can charge it through a USB cable just like iPod mini, a universal power adaptor is also included with Zen Micro. You can us it when you are on the go or do not want to leave your computer on, just to charge your player. for iPod mini, you have to buy the adaptor separately thus requiring more investment. Besides, the adaptor can be used almost anywhere in the world (110-240V, 50-60 Hz)  User interface: Zen Micro's UI is pretty much similar to iPod mini. You can browse thru artist, album, genre or song title  WMP 10 integration: This player works superbly with Windows Media Player 10. Use the Sync freature on WMP to transfer files between your PC and Zen Micro. You can also use WMA files and digitally protected tracks purchased from websites like real, walmart and napster.  More Space: Zen Micro 5 GB has more space has 1 GB more space than iPod mini giving you more MB/Dollar value  Integrated FM radio: Though I'm not a big FM fan, I use it in the gym where they have set up FM transmitters with their TVs. iPod mini doesn't have this feature. Infact, out of the numerous accessories available for iPod, none of them enables you to listen to radio.  External disk: I can use my Zen Micro as an external Hard drive to transfer files upto 4 GB. No need to buy an extra flash drive. No need to install any extra software on other computers to transfer files.  Long Battery life: my Zen Micro works for upto 14-16 hrs on a single charge. I usually charge it once a week.  Removable Battery: You can remove and replace the rechargable battery when it wears out. Mine was a limited edition Zen Micro, in which they included an extra battery at no extra cost. for iPod min, you have to send it back to apple for a replacement which costs twice as much as the replacement battery of Zen Micro.  One and perhaps the only drawback is very few accessories available for Zen Micro, but I got a silicon case and an armband for it. besides, it comes with a Universal power adaptor so you save money there.  My Experience: In last one year, I had only one trouble with my Zen Micro. The power switch stopped working properly and Creative replaced my unit for free including free to and fro shipping.   CONCLUSION: If you are a sheep and want to follow the crowd, go for an iPod, if not Zen Micro is for you. I really don't like Apple's philosphy of squeezing money out of people by restricting people to buy music only from iTunes store, by requiring people to send iPods back to apple for battery replacement and by not including essentials like power adaptor with the player, but selling it as as an accessory. Zen Micro on the other hand, gives more features for the same price and more flexibility with regards to software and music purchase.

<Content>I got this thing and I loved it.  However, its built very poor.  Yeah, its got alot more features than the iPod and it costs way less, but the thing falls apart.  I went to Creative's website and it turns out that ALOT of users are having problems.  The display ceases to function, the player freezes... and this is from 100% standard/official usage of the player.  Great features but its built at a trash can quality levels.  I was shocked actually.  Creative/E-Mu have never let me down.  I've been buying their soundcards since like 1997 and have never had a problem with them.  They need to implement the same standards of quality control across their entire product line.

<Title>Terrible product. Not tested thoroughly enough
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Within about 2 months of purchasing this product, whenever I tried to turn it on, the machine would freeze up. I contacted customer support and they suggested that I clean up the drive and then reboot. That worked for 1 day, and then it reverted back to having the same old problem. The unit was under 1 year old, however after conversing with their poor customer service department, I came to the sad conclusion that although parts are under the warranty, shipping and labor is not. It doesn't take a math genius to realize this device is better off in the circular file cabinet, which is where subsequently I tossed mine.

<Title>A good little player
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like this player.  I've had no hardware problems with (the headphones are awful though.)  Software's a bit of a pain, but no worse than the software for other players.  My one complaint would be that the menu's can be a little hard to navigate.  There are some cool options like DJ, but to find the music you want you have to go through 3 or 4 menus.  The little slider bar doesn't work as well as the wheel on the ipod either.

<Title>Do not buy this player!!!
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This has to be the most frustrating purchase I have ever made!  This player functions properly for about a month then completely locks up and is not functional.  I call Creative, pay $25 for service, and send it in.  They send it back, working ... but soon it freezes again.  I am now on my 3rd time sending the player back to Creative.  I've asked for a refund, but it is not an option.  I HATE this player and am temped to just purchase a new one.  If I have to pay $25 each time I send it in, that'll cover the cost of a new player.  Again, do not purchase this product!!!

<Title>Good when you handle it carefully
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using my Creative Zen Micro for nine months.I have no word to complain about it's sound quality.. it's perfect. You can enjoy even the minute background sounds from small music instruments. Rechargeable battery still works good (Even more than the time specified) You can use it as a 5GB Flash Drive.. The software comes with this is really usefull.. Has an Organizer.  Only thing, you should handle it carefully.. you may damage the head phone jack holder (I used to put this in my jeans pocket on my walk.. I think it might have caused the holder to damage). If it happens, then you will loose your sound quality, even no sound sometimes and time to time you should adjust the jack to get a propper connection (it'd damage your holder further).... I have two more months left in my warranty period, so I'm going to send it for repair.  If it doesn't have this fault I'd give 5/5 for Zen Micro.. I don't know about other players.. my advise.. on your walk, don't put this player ( may be, any player) inside your jeans pocket.. use proper belt clips or holders. GOOD LUCK

<Title>Great Value, Great Player
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This really is a great little player.  A lot of people have complained about the touch pad, but I think they have failed to find the sensitivity setting.  Mine is set to medium and works very well.  I have had no problems and enjoy using the touchpad.   Other people have complained about Creative's management software, but if you've used Itunes or Explorer on your computer, this program is a no brainer.  Just import your files and then upload them to your micro.  Extremely easy.  You can also set-up playlists and edit your ID3 tags.  I have had no problems with the software.  However, I have noticed problems with stability.  When I first installed the battery, the system locked up and I had to hard reboot it by removing the battery.  I then uploaded a number of songs and used the micro pretty much all day.  I plugged it in to charge overnight and when I woke up it wouldn't turn on.  I had to remove the battery again to restart it.  This is the only problem I have experienced.  I will see if these were just isolated incidences over the next few weeks.  I've tried to use the FM Tuner.  It works, but its definately like any other radio where you need to find the correct position to get good reception.  Don't expect to use this to listen to the radio while working out.  I have never used an Ipod so I won't make any comparisons.  I do think that this is a great little player and a good value.  Its also visually pleasing.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first MP3 player so I might be a little biased, but I will try to give a fair review.  The first thing I noticed about the player is its size, which is great.  The second thing I thought was really cool about the Zen Micro was its blue glow around its edges and controls, which makes it easy to use in the dark.  Next, when I first used the player, I thought that the touch pad was a little too touchy, but when I lowered its sensitivity and upgraded its firmware, it was near perfect.  The next thing I realized was how great the quality of the sound on the Zen Micro was. I could hear things in songs that I have never heard before.  Finally, one small problem that I have realized with the Zen Micro was how it sometimes freezed whenever I tried to shut it down. This usually happened whenever I stopped it abruptly, so this is more of a problem that I have caused. Also, it sometimes happens whenever I detatch it from a computer or its charger.  Whenver it freezed, all I did was took out the removable battery, a great feature.  All in all the Zen Micro is a great Windows based MP3 player that has many great features and a few minor problems that do not take away from its experience.

<Title>Love the Zen Micro -- I wish it just didn't freeze up !
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got the Creative Zen Micro for Christmas. I was looking around at the MP3 players and narrowed it down to basically the iPod Mini or the Zen Micro. I don't like the colors for the iPod. For the Zen Micro, I loved the colors, design, size, -- everything! But within a matter of an hour after downloading the software, that's when this started to go completely down hill.  My computer didn't reconize that it was plugged into the computer. I checked the USB port and everything and then all of a sudden it finally reconized it was there. I figured it was probably just a loose connection or somthing so I went on download my music on to it and setting everything up.   Everything was going smoothly and then after about 2 hours, it just frooze in the middle of a song. So, i took the battery out and expected for it to just go on. Just a little glitch or something. Of course not -- it completely froze after putting the battery back in and it just got worse and worse. I couldn't even get through turning it on without it freezing.   So, back to Amazon it goes. I'll try to get another one and give Creative another try, but my hopes are going to be up this time around.  Just a thought -- but I've been reading alot of the negative comments from people who have bought this product from Amazon and have gotten a "dud". Do you think there was just a bunch of "duds" sent to Amazon?

<Title>disappointed
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received my player from amazon on 12/24. I was looking forward to loading the music and starting to enjoy it. I spent 3 hours the first day. I started the 2nd day with problems-it kept locking up while trying to rip the cd to device. I called support 1st time-recording giving hours operation and then cut off. Called back zeroed out to operator who got me help. I then spent an hour with support and had to download a firmware upgrade. Device still locks up and I am forced to take the battery out while holding the "On" button to clear memory and reboot. Another lost hour trying to get the device to be recognized by the program. I cannot believe that they sent it out without the latest software upgrade and that its this difficult to get it to work properly. I should have gone with the IPOD. Shame because it comes with the FM built in and great sound. I want my money back and I wish I could get my time back.

<Title>Ipod Owner - Considering this player
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have a 2-year old Ipod and was pleased running it on a Windows XP  PC until about 1 month ago.  Ipod requires you to use their software (I Tunes) to transfer music to your Ipod and they have recently updated their service. My Ipod has not worked since their update.  If you look at their "discussion" pages - There are plenty of us PC users who are using are Ipods as paperweights.  I am considering just calling it a day and purchasing this player which seems like it is more compatible for PC users.  Apple support is TERRIBLE - you are allowed one free call to their support team - that's it.  Apple's response is that Windows XP (Service Pack 2) users probably will need to buy new computer cards to get their Ipods to work - yeah thanks Apple - I should spend yet another $50 for your Ipod.

<Title>I love it
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.  Why?  Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.  I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player-- Be sure to UPGRADE FIRMWARE.
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Several reviewers have written comments about the sensitivity of the touchscreen on the Zen Micro, and I had the same feelings about it when I first used the player.  Then I read on either Gizmodo or Engadget about a firmware upgrade that addresses this issue. It is available on the Creative website, under "Support". This firmware upgrade (version 1.01.03)also helps with battery life when you plug the charger into the wall before you connect it to the player. Of course it would be nice if the player came preloaded with the best firmware, but at least Creative was quick in getting this update out, and it was very easy to download and install.   If you still have trouble with the touchpad after upgrading the firmware, try changing the touchpad sensitivity setting to low instead of medium (or try high...some people have said that they've had luck changing it to high, oddly enough)  I bought the Zen Micro for my wife, but then ended up "borrowing" it so much she bought one for me! Both of our's came with two batteries, which was a nice bonus, but I'm not sure if all of the packages that Amazon sells will be the "limited edition" ones that come with an extra battery.  UPDATE: Creative just added yet another firmware upgrade. This one adds Microsoft "PlaysForSure" support, which will be useful for subscription services like Napster, where instead of buying individual songs or albums, you pay a monthly fee in exchange for access to 700,000 songs. These services have previously been limited to the computer, but now with Microsoft's DRM (digital rights management) software, you'll actually be able to sync those songs onto your player and tote them along with you, so long as you continue to subscribe to the service. (I'm still not won over by this idea, which feels like just another way to cut a hole in my pockets so I drip money month after month, but if you are REALLY into music, and if the price is right, then it could be a very cool feature.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this player.

<Title>Better than iPod Mini by a landslide
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Firstly, when creative chose the name of "micro" for this player, they really did mean it.  This zen is EXTREMELY small.  Keep in mind, it holds more music or files than the iPod Mini by one G.  If you are concerned with the touch pad, do not worry, although a little touchy out of the box, sensitivity settings are easily accessible.  I was mastering high speed scrolling in about two hours, stopping right on what i wanted.  In adition to great styling and size, the software that comes with Micro is very easy to use.  After a simple installation, i had 400+ songs on it in about two hours.  In adition to being small, easy to use, and BEAUTIFUL, Micro has a supposed battery life of 12 hours, four less than the iPod.  And one of the greatest things about it, an EASILY removable battery, unlike iPod's.  You wont have to send this back and pay 90 dollars.  This player is well worth the $$$.

<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Zen Micro for about four months and I love it! It has all of the features the ipod has plus more! You can listen to radio and do all kinds of other stuff. Also, it's so small and light!!!! I can fit it in my pocket!! It has great sound, it's simple to use, and the backlight is great! The battery life is not an issue and works for a very long time. One of the best features that the ipod does NOT have is the replaceable battery. If you have an ipod, and your battery dies, you have to send the whole thing back! If your zen micro battery dies or stops working,(mine still works perfectly) you can just simply replace the battery. It even comes with two batteries. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!

<Title>nice mp3 player for the non-sheep in the world....
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK. If you want to have what everyone else has, buy an Ipod. They work just fine. However, if you want a user replaceable battery, a voice recorder, an fm radio....get a zen micro. Also, with the Zen you can utilize multiple download services (Yahoo, Napster, Real, etc.) You are not restricted to Itunes. The player works great, I really like the slider controls. I think if you have a laptop with a touchpad like I do, it's no transition at all. Those who have not used a touchpad may have a learning curve (once you set the pressure to the level that works best for you). Transferring music is not quite as easy as with an Ipod; it helps to have some computer skills. I junked the included software and use Audiograbber (FREE) to rip my cd's and purchased Notmad to transfer to the Zen. It works great. I highly recommend extended warranties on the Zen Micro (and any other mp3 player) because you are dealing with sensitive electronics which can give out without warning. Mine is nearly a year old and I have had no problems, but I baby it, use a Vaja case, right angle headphone jack. To summarize: it beats the Ipod if you have a little computer knowledge and you can use lots of different music sources.

<Title>Zen Micro Is Good When It Works
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Zen Micro 5GB MP3 Player for my daughter as a 2004 Christmas present.  I bought it because of the features and capacity it offered, and it had a good keypad design.  Initially the player worked fine and we were happy with the purchase, but by the summer of 2005 the left channel cut out so that music only came through the right channel.  I sent it back to Creative Labs and they sent me a new one in September.  Four months later the hard drive failed in the replacement unit, and now that it has been more than a year since the first unit was purchased, Creative Labs will not replace it unless I pay them $122 (a new one costs $180).  Rather than do that, I spent $135 for a Cowon iAudio G3 since it uses a Flash Drive and has no moving parts.  Hopefully the Cowon will be more dependable.

<Content>Zen Micro is a neat player with nice features. Problem is if you do have a problem you are sunk. E-mail support has a single canned response to wipe your disk, load new firmware and try again. I got the same response for my Zen when it was freezing up (solved the problem), when the battery would not charge, for a bad USB cable, for error message on player with licensing error (for properly licensed music). Support is terrible and the player is failure prone.

<Title>Love my Zen
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my 5MB Zen Micro for over 6 months and haven't had any real problems with it. I got different earbud phones from Sony that are more comfy, as the ones that come with this unit are too big for my ears (although I do think they sound good). The accompanying software is easy to use, although I've had some kinks to work through with my music downloading service.  The greatest part of having this unit for me is that I can subscribe to Yahoo Music Unlimited, which is only $6.99 a month to download whatever I want into my Zen Micro (I gave up on the free music programs since so many albums now can't be copied). This is where I've had some problems with the Creative Mediasource Organizer. Sometimes I transfer my Yahoo music into the device and the Organizer doesn't recognize it's there, even though it actually is. I guess it's a kink between the two software programs. But it's worth working through to avoid paying iTunes a buck a pop for songs, as is needed for iPod.  Of course, another nice thing is having the FM tuner included in the device rather than needing a special attachment. I also recently began syncing my Outlook items (Calendar, Contacts, Tasks) into my Zen Micro, making it a nice alternative to a PDA for these basic functions.  Overall the Zen Micro is a great little MP3 player with an attractive price.

<Title>SO much better than an ipod!!
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After much consideration and research, I decided to buy this mp3 player instead of an ipod mini.  I've now had it since christmas, and I LOVE it!  The bonus points I've found so far (that so far I haven't found in my friends ipods and other mp3 players): you can use multiple computers and music libraries without any problems; you don't have to keep the music on your computer (I have absolutly no music on my home computer!);and you can make playlists right from the player, no computer needed.  The bad points I've found so far have really nothing to do with the player itself.  I'm not sure if it's the software that came with the player or just the computers, but sometimes when I plug in the player, the mediasource says my player isn't connected.  It will still charge, I just can't add any music.  And the only other problem is that it's hard to find any accesories.  The market is so ipod driven, that's all anyone carries.  So, if you're trying to decide what type of player to purchase, I definitly recommend the Creative Zen Micro.

<Title>Excellent performance for a Good price...
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I purchased an Mp3 player, I did my reviews on them and made sure I bought the best.  This one came out on top.  The other Zen's were better than this but they all held about 30,000 songs and I don't even know if I'd heard that many songs in my lifetime, so I stuck with my best choice.  Zen Micro holds 2500 songs (based on 4000 kb for each song) and delivers mind blowing crystal clear sound quality.  I listen to underground metal, and those bands can't usually afford top of the line producing equipment, but this device makes all their music sound crystal clear.  Along with top quality sound, the Micro has preset equalizers for different types of music and has a customizable equalizer for your preferred preferences.  The touch pad is also quite easy to use, but at the same time it is also........highly reactive to touch.  But no worries, the Micro has settings that enable you to adjust how much it reacts to the touch of your finger.  The screen isn't color, but when browsing through menus, it provides a bright light up screen and easy to read menu headings.  One problem though, this was probably my own fault, is that it breaks easily.  I dropped mine about 5 feet from the ground onto hard carpet and it broke.  Of course mine didn't have a case, but still.    Overall, the best PRO of this item is the superior sound quality, and be careful, because these headphones provided are loud as hell when turned up full blast.  The only CON is....well, nothing.  So with that said, GET THIS ITEM NOW!  John

<Title>Great little gadget
<Date>Sun Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After spending a month researching the various devices, I settled on the Zen Micro.  I've had it for about two weeks and love it.  I've got about 1100 songs on it so far (at 128/kbps MP3 or better, ranging from 1:30 Ramones songs to full-length  operas) and still have 1.2 GB left, which is exactly what I wanted.  The battery life is solid, and mine came with an extra battery as well, making it an even better deal.  As almost everyone here has noted, the sound quality it puts out is the best on the market- 98 dB signal/noise ratio as compared to Apple's 90- and investing in a pair of Koss Plugs or Sony EX-71SL's makes the experience great.  The curved back makes it fit very comfortably in a pants pocket as well.  As to the problems some others have noted, here's my experience on the matter:  - Touchpad sensitivity: Set it to high and it isn't a problem. This is certainly counterintuitive, but it's easy enough to do and solves any problems.  However, I'm also inclined to believe that maybe some of the people having problems with this have shaky hands or fat fingers; I've had no problems with this even on the factory default setting.  - Freezes: It has a hard drive, it freezes on occassion.  Popping out the battery fixes it.  New firmware probably fixes this, but I haven't gotten around to upgrading the firmware yet.  - Headphones: Lots of people have complained about their size.  They're right, they're sort of huge.  They won't provide a seal around the ear or dynamic bass.  That being said, despite having two pricey pairs I find myself using the stock ones frequently because they do allow me to hear things going on around me, which I find more useful when I'm trying to dart through traffic on my way to class than booming bass.  Those are all fairly minor issues in my opinion, and easily outweighed by the extras of the FM tuner, built-in microphone, user-replaceable batteries and extra 1 GB of storage to other microdrive models.  Overall, I've been extremely impressed with this model and would strongly recommend it to anyone considering a mid-capacity MP3 player.

<Title>Super iPod alternative
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Seeing iPod's and iPod mini's everywhere I looked, and not wanting to appear too much like everyone else, I love the fact that Creative came up with a player that matches or beats the iPod at its own game, and stands out from the crowd.  That said, this player does not need any contrast to be appreciated.  Tons of capacity, great looks, good, compact size, FM tuner, great sound reproduction  and the freedom to buy/download music from anywhere make this a really good investment.  My only negative experiences are a) battery life is not as good as advertized, b) accesories are as rare as hens teeth (good luck finding a carry case or pocuh - as far as I can tell, Creative does not even make one).  Overall, great player, 5 stars when the battery life lives up to expectations and case logic or belkin or someone comes up with some custom built accessories.

<Content>This is a great product and after doing a lot of research on the verious mp3 players i decided to buy it.  I recieved it a few days ago and i couldn't be more happy with it.  I was hesitant about buying it at first because of some of the negative reviews, but i'm glad i went ahead an purchased it.  The sound quality is superb and offers crystal clear sound and also looks very snazzy in the dark.  The Headphones it comes with are also quite decent.  The voice recorder works really well, but the quality is pretty fuzzy.  Also the replaceable battery is very nice!  After reading some of the negative statements about the touchpad i was afraid i would hate it.  However, i love the touchpad on the zen micro and it's easy to use.  The only negative aspects of the zen micro are the lack of a dedicated volume button and the reception on the FM radio.  These are just minor things though and i highly recommend the zen micro to anyone who is looking for small compact mp3 player that offers superb style and audio quality.

<Title>The best IPod alternative
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Since the Ipods came along, I always wanted one just because everyone else was getting one. I loved the look, and the hype of it, it was amazing to me at that time.  Thanks god I didn't get one. The battery of the Ipod, once it dies, you have to pay money to replace the battery and it costs just the same as if you were buying a totally new Ipod all over again so that was the main factor why I didn/t get one.  Now that the Micro came along, i wanted it to give it a try and I did. I'm telling you guys, there is no comparison to how I feel about this mini Player. Its the best MP3 Player i've seen. The user interface its good, battery life, audio quality EVERYTHING. I love the FM Tuner, just in case I get bored of my music collection. The Sensitive path its a headache the first day you get it, but by putting in in LOW and in 2 days I was the master of this baby.  I recomend you all to buy it, MUCH BETTER THAN AN IPOD!!!

<Title>Better than ANY player
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the best player I have ever had, having used the Mini too. The vertical touch pad is extremely easy to use, I cant believe some people are having trouble with it. I learned within 5 minutes of using it! It is better than a wheel. Smaller, better sound, more color variety, more space, it is just better in evert aspect. And if you order soon like I did, you get an extra free battery! The package also includes more things that you can really use, like a belt clip, stand, and pouch to protect it against scratches. And the blue light it gives out while charging just takes your breath away. This is truely value for the money.

<Title>Love the device
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users. I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago. This proprietory software to download. (That was a major turn off). I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod. Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style. and supply those stupid white Headphones. I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well. Let's face it. Apple is Apple. So Creative should be "Creative".

<Title>Wow! Much better than iPod mini!!
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the much coveted iPod mini for Christmas, but could not get it to work on my PC which run a 5 year old ME OS--yes the fine print on the box did indicate that it was incompatible. Short of an  expensive and possibly unsuccessful set of soft and hardware updates, I was out of luck! I ordered the Zen Micro and have had it now for 2 days. It is beautiful!! I am not a computer whiz, but I was up and running with only a few minor problems after about 4 hours. I have ripped my CDs onto it, bought and imported music from msn music, listened to the radio, recorded from the radio, etc. (the FM tuner and the recording mechanism, by the way is a great great feature, and missing on iPod mini). This is definitely a life-changing event--no more hunting for the cd, dusting it off, getting it in the stereo, taking it out, putting it way (or not).  Now we need more accessories for this gizmo, and we will be set. The apple is not the only choice! Give this little guy a chance!

<Title>Can't run with out it
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an awesome unit.  I had a pink one reserved, but couldn't wait till late November for release so changed and pre ordered the silver for it's first release date.  I did much research and had come close to purchasing the i-pod mini.  My Zen Micro beats it hands down.  The replaceable battery was one of the biggest draws for me.  To my surprise my silver zen mircro box said limited edition and came with an additional battery.  The head phones have great sound, but did not last long and I will replace, foam covers came off, and now one has fallen apart.  Touch pad is sensitive, but can be modified by switching sensitivity to high.  Would love a remote control for it, I'm not sure if one if available.  Software is great for transferring.  Like other MP3 players I have had, book that comes with is worthless and you have to figure out stuff for yourself - web site help was great.  If you like to run like I do, you have got to have it.

<Title>If only...
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player is definately an iPod mini killer.  25% more storage, FM tuner, microphone, radio recording, and personally i like the look of the zen better.  I would give it a five but there is one MAJOR flaw.  The program bundled with the zen is very, VERY hard to use.  I do not understand half of the functions in the program.  Ripping cds into the player is a big pain in the but because half of the cds i have (i own aout 92 cds) wont even rip all the way, the program rips all of them fine except the last song (i.e. Hoobastank The Reason, Korn Untouchables, Blink-182 Enemia of the State, amongst many other cds).  This is very vey annoying.  If anyone knows of another program that can put music on the zen micro, a referal would be nice.  Also, I've tried putting music that i've ripped with iTunes onto it but the artist and album names are reversed.  Except for the program i would give the Zen Micro a 5.

<Title>nice player
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I puschased the Zen micro about a month ago, despite many negative reviews, and am glad I did. I've only had it freeze up on me once and this was easily fixed. The battery life seems to have been a little exagerated at 12hrs. I've run it dry at about six(with the backlight off and the contrast set to 20%). I hear there is a firmware upgrade that may help this out as well as some sensitivity issues others have complained about with the touchpad. I personally don't have any problem scrolling or selecting. My micro came with a remote. This is pretty handy for adjusting volume and skipping tracks when the micro is burried in a pocket or bag. Perfect for cycling. I've dropped my micro from about a meter onto a tiled floor and it hasn't seemed to have been effected. I dropped it yet again from a shorter height and still no problems. The earbuds aren't very good, I'd recomend something a little better. Mine is an international model. This is a big plus because the ac adapter can be used in many countries. It is good from 100V-240V. All that you need is an adapter for the actual shape of the outlet, and these are pretty cheap. No need for a step down transformer. The sound is great. The smart volume feature is really important for me. It automatically adjusts the volume of individual tracks so you don't have to fiddle with the volume when the player gets to a track that's louder than the others. I've got about a 1000 songs loaded up and everything is going smoothly. I recommend this product.

<Title>iPod for Window Users
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off if you are a Windows user and want an iPod like I did but were scared that it being Apple would be cause for concern, then by all means get the Zen Micro. I was worried that if I got an iPod somehow it wouldn't work right if I didn't have an Apple or iTunes. So with that in the back of my mind I went with the Creative Zen Micro. It does all that an iPod can do but it is just better equipped to handle Windows. I got the white one and it is very clean and sleek. The outer casing is white so everything is the same color. If you get a black or another color the casing will still be white. So I bet you are reading this to know what I don't like about so here it is:  -The instructions on how to actually use the Zen are lacking. It is basically figure it out on your own. Now the software is easy enough, but I had the hardest time trying to make playlists.  -The earphones are a little big. If you have small ears they definately will not fit. I always thought I had big ears until I put the earphones in. They barely stay in.  Those are the only complaints. The sound is great. The size is great. (about the size of a flip phone) And it comes with bonus stuff like extra battery, stand, charger, carrying case, belt clip. If you want an iPod but are worried about it being an Apple, get the Zen, no questions.

Do-over permitted Creative, because of your design, feature advances, and demonstrated sonic abilities.  But try to keep version 2.0 off the market until you include tested hard drives.

<Title>Absolutely Superb - Lightyears beyond the others
<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently bought a Zen Micro mp3 player, being uneasy about not going for an iPod instead.  However, I could tell the minute I got it that it was the right choice.  There is nothing bad about it.  Many complain that the vertival touch pad is not easy to get used to.  No way.  It is completely natural.  It surpasses the iPod in every dimmension.  It's 12 hour battery life is not a lie.  The curved fit and blue glow is a nice effect.  It is also packed with a multitude of very hand features, such as its ability to sync with Outlook.  There are not many accessories because they are either all buit in or still to be put to market, such as its wireless headphones.  The Creative Zen Micro is the new iPod plus much more. It is smaller, holds more, has more features, has an acutal 12 hour battery life, and is compatable with non-apple software.

<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, i got my zen micro as a xmas present. i was waiting to have one. tons of my friends had mini ipods, but i didn't want to be like every one else, so i wanted to get a zen micro. So here's my list of pros and cons:  Pros:  - its small and can fit in my pocket, but remember to lock it :) - its easy to download music from the internet and from ur cds - great sound! its awesome - i love that u can c it in the dark, cause it lights up blue - FM radio is good..i can get all my channels to come in perfectly - u can pick out whatever color u want (ipod has fewer color choices)  Cons: - make sure u set the senstivity to low..its a bit hard to scroll and click on what u want with the higher senstivities - the included earphones aren't wonderful, mine crapped our on me 3 weeks later - battery life is okay, it CAN last a long time, but im jus always scaried its gonna go out on me (only takes 3 hours to charge) - its challenging to set up a playlist, but i finally got it  All in all, its a great product and im happy to support a Bay Area company. If you buy one u'll probably love it. The best part is while it recharges the lights go in and out so it looks like its breathing or something.

<Title>wait a few months for Creative to straighten out the bugs
<Date>Thu Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>* An update to my review: I ended up exchanging my Micro when, after one month of use, the headphone jack quit working, rendering it completely useless. And I never did get Outlook to synch with it. So we'll see if the second one holds up better than the first, but if it doesn't, I'm opting for the iPod. *sigh*   The Micro is beautiful, it's intuitive to use, and it fills me with happiness every time I use it. I love gadgets, I love things that glow blue, and I love being able to carry more music that I could possibly listen to in a week.  The battery lasts so long and recharges when I attached it to the USB port on my computer to tranfer music, I've never had to charge it yet. And I've partitioned 512MG as a removable hard drive that I can use everywhere. I am enraptured with this thing.  However, even the best relationship has its problems. These problems are pretty large, forgiven only because I'm so utterly charmed; it's exactly like having a new lover whose flaws you see as cute rather than irritating.  Out of the box, it didn't work. The touchpad didn't respond at all. Based on reviews I had read here, I went to the Creative website and downloaded firmware updates and that fixed the problem, but it was not an auspicious beginning. Then I had trouble getting the Media Explorer software to recognize the Micro. Download more firmware updates. I still haven't gotten the Calendar to synch with Outlook (which was a feature that swayed me to the Micro over the iPod mini) and I'm trading emails with the Creative tech support folks.   Basically the firmware is not what it should be, and if you're not willing to sort out the bugs yourself, I suggest you wait to buy the next generation of Micro, once Creative has a chance to sort this stuff out.  One other tiny thing: the earbuds are unacceptable to me. I immediately replaced them with Philips HS461 Lightweight Ear-Clip Headphones, which aren't perfect, but they're WAY WAY WAY better than the earbuds included with the Micro.  So charming. So much potential. It has it's problems, but I bet I can fix it. Yes, I have a codependent relationship with my Micro.

<Title>Clearly in front of the pack......
<Date>Thu Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned my black micro since Dec 23 and can honestly report a very satisfied experience using it.  OK--I'll go ahead and say it.....Apples use of DRM to lock its environment into I-tunes makes me run away as fast as I can.  But the fact that the micro is platform independent (although there is WMP-10 recognition) is only one of many reasons this is the best 5 gig hd player out there.  The integrated voice recorder, outlook interface and removable hd all work flawlessly.  Creatives software is a bit clunky but Zen explorer is really all anyone needs to import or manage files.....and it works great.  Yes, the totally touch sensitive face takes a bit of adjustment.  Yes, the pulsating blue facia line is beyond cool (and it puts out quite a bit of light in the dark). Yes, the headphones are junk.  But this product performs so well on so many levels its hard to criticize.  In my judgement the players output could be slightly more powerful and less bright in sound character....but with EQ is fine.  Great Job Creative.....now how about a 20 and 30 Gig model!

<Title>Not bad!
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to carrying around my CD collection all the time.  As a student, backpack space is necessary and shouldn't be wasted.    I bought the 5gb version in silver at the local Walmart, and I have no issues with the player, except that I had to buy a longer USB 2.0 cable so the player wouldn't have to sit on the top of the hard drive while docked.  I have an old computer though, and it's incredible that it actually worked on my system despite the requirements.  I am running under a 300mHz Pentium MMX processor which I've been working on for a few years.  The software works seamlessly with my PC, even better than WMP 10, which would corrupt my mp3s and wmas.  I do think ripping is kind of slow, but otherwise it's better than what I'm used to: burning CDs.   Quality's not compromised - I've had better luck encoding my ripped CDs at a lower bitrate.  I conducted an experiment based on quality by encoding the same song twice - one at 320kbps and the other at 64.  I had the song already encoded at default - 128.  I listened to them repeatedly and tested different EQs. I found the best sound with 112 kbps for that song, and it ended up working with other songs as well.    The earphones don't bother me; I've had issues with CD players losing their headphone connectivity after a while and I'd like to say that it has to do with putting pressure on that area.  Generally if you put the jack in gently you'd be okay.  The quality's pretty good and I'd probably invest in some high-end phones later on, but I like the versatility of earbuds.  Mine don't fall out at random.  Sometimes they feel like they do, but they don't fall out.  I guess it's a comfort issue since I prefer the ones that secure around the ear.  It is a fragile player, but the ipod also feels that way (possibly from worry).  I've had excellent experiences with leather cases for cellphones and bought a PHILIPS case for the player (Walmart standard).  It fits perfectly and adds grip to it.  It also keeps the player scratch-free.  A friend of mine likes to put plastic wrap around her mp3 player, and it's a cheap alternative, but I think a case is better.  I found the touch pad easy to navigate on medium.  There is one rule of thumb with the touchpad (and the player) in general: BE GENTLE.  VERY GENTLE.  If you do that, it works seamlessly.  I found it best NOT TO mess with the EQ if you have a huge variety of genres since the player doesn't let you assign different EQ settings to different genres.  I found that disco EQ works best, if you like deep technotronica music, industrial, or metal though since that's most of what I own.  Battery life also is extended if you turn the backlight off during the day when you can see the screen without help and generally not messing with the player too much since exploring databases and skipping tracks uses more power.  Yesterday I got 7 hours of straight music this way.  I'm used to the sound quality - before I got the Zen Micro I've been burning CDs of music I download.  Generally, if a file is of low quality, it will sound almost the same as it did through the PC speakers.   The FM radio is nice, but since I live in the middle of nowhere there isn't much to listen to.  Podcasts would be nice here, but I prefer listening to music I like instead of waiting... skipping... etc...  I also use it to record lectures and it does a good job at it.  In the long run, I don't recommend this player if you don't know that much about how the interface works.  Because the instructions don't tell that much, it leaves you to figure it out, but there's the help file and it tells you everything you need to know.    As for playlists, I'd say it's confusing at first but is easier after a while.  If you save the playlist as a playlist, name it something, you'll be able to listen to it later... not at the same time.  I'd say it's the same as the ipod mini, but if you have an old PC running on Windows and are technoligically inclined, you'll be okay.  I'd recommend the ipod for ease of use, though.  It's hard to use, but worth it.

<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player doesn't offer the usability that you'll get with an Ipod but then again it doesn't cost as much either.  I am not an Ipod owner but have used one before and the one thing I like better about an Ipod is the control.  The Zen Micro can be difficult to control for someone with large fingers, like myself.  I have to say that I am impressed with the audio quality that you get from the Zen micro.  I also like the fact that you don't have to use any software to operate or put songs on the Zen Micro, although software is included with the player.  The 12 hour battery life claim is bogus but you can expect 6 - 7 hours of playback on a single charge.  I have seen several reviews for this product that complain about the headphone jack going out so beware if you plan on purchasing this product.  I haven't had any difficulty with mine though.

<Content>I own an ipod (3G) and gave my wife an ipod mini.  I added the zen micro to my collection so that I could take advantage of Yahoo's subscription music service (which is great).  Overall, I'm satisfied with the zen micro but I have to admit that the ipod is a much better product.  Here are my thoughts about zen micro pros and cons:  Pros: Great sound, good battery life, works with Yahoo music, good integration with windows XP (some other players are more finicky), nice size, comes with good accessories, standard USB charger that allows me to carry one cable for my phone, camera, and mp3 player, comes with plenty of accessories.  Cons: interface is less intuitive than ipod, very very difficult to control while running (unlike ipod mini that you can control with your eyes closed), freezes occasionally (this happens to all mp3 players I've owned so it's not a big deal)  Overall, I am pleased with the product but wish that I could just use my ipod with my yahoo music subscription instead...

<Content>A 16 year's old review:  Over the summer, I had read tons of reviews about the zen micro. And some of them were really good and some of them wern't. I was worried that mine would be one of the ones that would get messed up. But I really thought to myself, if I just be careful maybe it won't happen to me. And plus, the price is good, it has a nice design, and cool features like the microphone. And I did't want to use itunes and pay 99 cents a song. So I settled for getting the zenmicro, and told my parents that's what I wanted for my 16th birthday which was in October. So that means I have had mine for about 2 months.  And I have had absolutely no problems with it. Even the vertical touch pad wasn't a problem for me, which was weird. And I didn't have trouble with the software because I didn't use it. Instead I used Windows Media Player 10...which I highly recommend, it works great. And a lot of people seem to have major problems with the creative media explorer or zen organizer thing.  I downloaded music from some place. And organized into my library and synced it to my player. And sooon i was listening to my music.  And i totally love it because, i finally have a mp3 player, and it looks kool, and ive had no problems with it..oh yeaa and it's very easy to hold in your hand...very comfortable fit, easy to switch songs or whatever...althought the only thing i dont like are the headphones which are really a ripoff..and i kinda wish it was a bit thinner like the ipod...but i dont really care that much  But I do have to admit, once my sister's boyfriend got the new ipod and i got to play around with it...i fell in love it....i mean it is truly gorgeous...and this one was black...and plus it was in color....and i happen to like the click wheel or whatever...and really just how it loooks is reallly nice...and the features...oh mannn....PICTURES,MUSIC, VIDEOS!!! how great is that.  but since im not a very picky person...im happy with my zen micro...it may not be as gorgeous as the new ipod...but it really is good enough...im just happy i have a way of carrying my music  i just hope NOTHING happens to it...*cross fingers*  so i hope this helps you in choosing if u would like to purchase a zen micro

<Title>Still a happy Zen Micro owner (edited 2-06)
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am happy with my Zen Micro. I have owned it for five months. I mainly use it for audio book listening when I drive and enjoy my morning walks. I download/transfer the books from the Massachusetts library on-line digital site. I only download/ transfer about 4 or 5 parts (hours) at a time (I have dial-up Internet service). Downloading takes hours/the transfer to the Zen takes mere minutes. I delete each one after I complete listening to it.  I have also transferred some of my favorite Smooth Jazz music from my Windows Media player to the Z/M.  My one major complaint has to be the battery-charge life.  It only seems to be about 4/5 hours long. The Zen Micro has a lot of great features (fast forwarding/holding/ etc.). Use of these features, however, 'eats' a great deal of battery power. I was able to stop using the 'hold' feature by switching to a hard plastic case which must be opened to use the touch pad.  I try not to use the 'fast forwarding' feature unless it is absolutely necessary.  The 'deleting' feature also uses a great deal of battery power. I have decided to turn off the backlight feature during the daytime to see if that improves the situation. (It didn't/I just keep it at 5 seconds)   Also, the plastic casing of the Z/M is extremely slippery. I used strips of clear duct tape along the sides and a square piece on the back to give it a texture that is easier to hold on to.  Early on, I did two firmware downloads without any problem. I have found that light taps and slow, deliberate moves eliminate 95% of my daily usage problems (freezing, etc.).  As far as the jack problem is concerned, I decided to try a preventive measure.  I used a toothpick to place some Hard As Nails clear nail polish in the area where the jack attaches to the casing. I hope this will help to keep it anchored. (This seems to be working!)  I finally got around to looking at the manual which was transferred to my computer from the formatting disk. It is a wealth of information (daily usage info/shut-off info/defragging info/etc.).   My love of audio books inspired me to create the following book blog http://audiobooksaredelightfulmindcandy.blogspot.com/  J.K.

<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the Micro mainly because the iPod did not have a radio which was a must have on my list and the fact that I do not have enough music to justify the 30 gig iPod also helped in my decision. The iPod nano carried 4GB max and costs $250 (I bought my Micro at $170+tax) and without a radio was ridiculous and made it an easy decision to buy the Zen Micro.  I definitely would recommend the Zen Micro over the iPod Nano if that's what you were gunning for. Plus, there seems to be a lot of cases with iPods breaking down.  I've already dropped my Micro (with the plastic case) twice and so far no damage whatsover. If it freezes on you, just take out the battery. That's what I did and it worked fine after I put it back in. Remember it's a micro hard drive not flash-base.

<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought the Micro in Dec. 2004. Headphone jack conked out after 4 months. It took Creative 6 weeks to send me a new one. Now, 7 months later, headphone jack conked out again. I don't even use the thing a lot -- maybe a few hours a week. BUYER BEWARE.

<Title>good alternative to ipod mini
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The zen micro is a good alternative to the ipod mini.  What I like about the zen micro:  1) replaceable battery 2) bigger hard drive space 3) a little cheaper (better value) 4) has fm radio (though I have no use for it) 5) technically has better sound quality than ipod (though you probably won't be able to hear the actual difference).  what I don't like about the zen micro:  1) a lot less accessories than ipod-- e.g. no iTrip for zen, etc. 2) does not have a line out.  ipod requires an extra accessory for a line out, but it's there.  this is important if you're hooking it up to a headphone amp or a high quality receiver. 3) does not support mp4 (aac).  ipod supports both drm (m4p) and non-drm aac (m4a) files.   mp4 has a much better quality at the same bitrate. 4) doesn't support audiobooks. 5) interface is ok, but ipod is better.  I would've given the zen a 5 star if it had a line out and mp4 support.  Contrary to some user comments, you are not locked into drm when using ipod.  You can load and play non-drm files into ipod just fine.

<Title>Until...
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Until this thing I waisted 250 bucks on is compatible with Audible downloads, it is useless!  If your an audible subscriber DON'T bother.  Any firmware update to fix this in the future and make this a GREAT player is unknown, contacting Creative or Audible only gets you one line responses that they have NO plans to make it Audible ready.  Sorry to be so harsh but reading the threads on Creative's site you get the same thing.  The most unbelievable thing is that at one point they actually advertised this player (not on Amazon) with a discount if you sigined up for an Audible subscription!!!

<Title>Everything the ipod mini didnt do (except for a couple)
<Date>Sat Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you are a PC user and are deciding whether to get an ipod mini or a zen micro your choice should be the zen micro.  There are some key things that Apple should have considered that was done on the zen micro.  One is battery life.  Why do you think the 3rd gen of the regular ipod quickly turned into 4th generation?  One reason was the buttons weren't very stylish and most importantly was the battery life.  They quickly jumped it from up to 8 hours to 12.  Creative made the right choice and made it have a 12 hour battery.  Another excellent addition was it having replaceable batteries.  It's so nice to have an extra battery (40$) on an airplane when your battery runs out. Also the Zen Micro is more worth your money then the Ipod mini is. What would you say is better?  250$ for 4 gigs or 5 gigs?  There are many reasons why Zen Micro is just better then the Ipod mini.  The only thing the Ipod mini has better is its click wheel.  You might need getting used to the Zen Micro's touch screen.  Also both don't have a dedicated volume control.

<Content>You *might* save a buck or two, but the user interface is a complete joke -- both on the player as well as the software. It's downright aweful. Save yourself some time and frustration and get the real deal. Take a look at the iPod Mini or the iPod. You can always go into your local Apple store and try them for yourself. Either buy it right there or come back to Amazon.

<Content>I have had the Zen Micro for about 3 weeks ago, and have been using it constantly. It is a great player with wonderful sound quality. The menus are logical and easy to navigate. I chose this player over an Ipod Mini, because:  * FM radio * 1 Gig more space * Much longer battery life * Plays MP3s and WMAs in native format * Records from FM * Can record with built-in microphone * Doesn't need to go to factory to replace battery * Seamless interface with Windows and Windows Media Player * Better sound * Better looks

<Title>Overall satisfaction, however....
<Date>Sun Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are a few complaints. The touchpad is a little tricky even after making the necessary adjustments, however, I think I'll get used to it after a while. My real complaint is the packaged software. Now, I'm a pretty experienced computer user, having been self-taught in a number of softwares from Photoshop to SPSS. At first it seemed like it would be pretty seemless because my first cd-ripping session easily put my cds directly onto the Micro with little effort. The problem is that I haven't been able to find that feature again! I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, I just expected the software for executing this basic task to be a little more intuitive.

<Title>Seriously in need of help!!
<Date>Sun Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really loved this mp3 player, it had great sound, useful features, and it held all the songs I wanted, but then, it started screwing up.  I was listening to it and it just froze.  It wouldn't turn off or respond to anything, so I took the battery out and put it back in.  When it turned on, it was on recovery mode, and I don't know how to get out of it!  I've tried letting the battery die and recharging it, rebooting, cleaning up, attaching it to the computer, reloading firmware, and pushing just about every button on there, but it still won't go away!  I can't listen to anything until I can find a way out of the recovery screen.  The exact same thing happened to my sister at about the same time.  If you know how to fix this, send me an email at qwerpi@kiwibox.com.  For anyone thinking of getting a zen micro,just pay for the ipod, it's worth it.

<Title>Some Tips Might Help~~~~~~~
<Date>Mon Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a zen Micro from Amazon about three weeks ago. I really like the amazing sound quality and everything goes fine execpt the annoying freezing problem. My computer sometimes could not recognize the unit then it froze and even could not be shut down. Fortunately after several times, I finally found out that if the unit is FULL CHARGE then the freezing problem would come up, but if not, everything will be fine. So DO NOT PLUG IN THE FULLY CHARGED UNIT TO YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!  Another thing that might help is when u try to connect the unit to the pc, please first plug the usb into the unit, then connect the other end to the pc.  Hope these can help some folks' problems.

<Title>Tiny Like a Baby!!
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i loooooveed this product. Many of my friends got it because they thought that the iPod Mini's wern't that great. And they are so happy that they waited because soon after, the Zen Micro came out! They are so tiny, that they are perfect to bring along with you when you travel. They are actually smaller than the iPod Mini.   If you are deciding between the Zen Micro and the iPod Mini, consider these facts first: 1) the Zen is about $10-$20 cheaper than the iPod Mini 2) the Zen is smaller and more convenient than the iPod Mini 3) the Zen can hold 1,500 MORE songs than the iPod Mini for less money 4) the Zen comes in many more colors than the iPod Mini 5) the Zen has an FM Radio 6) the Zen has a voice recorder 7) the Zen has twice as much battery life than the iPod Mini  considering these facts, what reason could you possibly have for buying a measily iPod Mini? that's a rip-off..  GET THE ZEN MICRO!! IT'S THE NEXT BIG THING - AND WAY BETTER FOR YOUR MONEY.

<Title>An Intelligent Consumer's Reward!!
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my Zen Micro to replace a Muvo 2 that was DOA when I bought it.  Prior to buying it, I read a product review that mentioned that the USB cable that comes with the Micro sometimes doesn't work.  So when mine didn't either, I substituted a cable from another device, and it worked perfectly.  In spite of this glitch, which one wonders how Creative could allow to happen, I have to give the Micro five stars.  Everything else about it is spectacular.  Although the earphones, juiced to 115db sensitivity, are good quality, I prefer to use my Shure E2C's with it.  The slightly lower sensitivity of the Shures means I have to crank the volume a notch higher, cutting down on battery life slightly; but the resulting sound quality is so phenomenal that I don't mind at all.   Once I installed the firmware update, the Micro's touch controls became a total pleasure to use.  The menu tree is well-conceived, versatile, and extremely logical.  A user who tags his or her song files in a uniform way will find his/her diligence rewarded by the Micro's file system.  For interfacing the Micro with my PC, I use the Zen Micro Explorer, a matter of personal preference.  Creative MediaSource and Windows Media Player can do the same things, but the Media Explorer's GUI is a bit more user-friendly.  I haven't tried ripping directly to the Micro, but I've never had a glitch transferring files from my hard drive using the Media Explorer, which has a convenient on-the-fly tag editor.  Although Creative advertises that the Micro can hold up to 2,500 songs at a low bitrate, sound-conscious users will likely find themselves ripping significantly fewer files for the Micro at 192kbps and higher.  Even in instrument-cluttered songs, individual musical voices are more clear on the Micro than on some audiophile-type home systems I've heard.  For users who like to tweak their sound, the Micro has a five-band equalizer.  Since about 1980 I've used the same audio program material--though in different formats--to sample various audio components and systems. The Micro reproduces this material as well as any audio system I've ever heard.   Almost a couple of decades ago, Creative boss Sim Wong Hoo was the definitive pioneer in bringing sound to personal computers, an innovation that enabled people to see the PC as an entertainment device, rather than just a work tool.  For years, the Creative name was synonymous with a visually unappealing PCI card that did almost magical things when it was connected to a PC's motherboard.    Over the years, Creative has continued to set the standard in PC audio, but without quite being able to find the right form factor to do justice to its superb products.  With the Creative Zen Micro, Mr. Sim and company have finally created a device with enough aesthetic appeal on the exterior to do justice to the incredible sound quality that comes from its interior.

<Title>Loves It, then again maybe not...
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Update:  My player died after 9 months and it cost $40 to get a refurbished replacement, which also died a few months later.  It was great when it worked, but the reliability has really been disappointing over time.    I just got my Zen Micro yesterday and I'm very impressed.  Inserted the battery and plugged in the charger and I was listening to the FM tuner within minutes.    When I got home from work I went through the installation process which was trouble free.  Installed the software and upgraded the firmware from the Creative site, which I have read is a must if you want to use Windows Media Player 10 to synch instead of using the Creative software.    This is my first MP3 player, so I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of uploading files.  I uploaded almost 1,500 songs in a little over an hour which I thought was pretty fast.  I have a fairly new computer (P4 2.3GHz with USB 2), so I'm guessing that's why it was faster than I expected.    The only hitch was that some of the songs didn't make it to the player and it did hang up 2x during the upload process.  When that happened I had to disconnect the player, close WMP and start again.  Still I was able to synch all but about 12 of the songs I have ripped to my computer.    I can understand how some Ipod enthusiasts wouldn't like the Zen Micro because it's UI is different.  I have friends who own Ipods and the wheel is very cool on them.  I think that unless you are really attached to that interface you will not have a problem with navigation on the Micro.    As for the vertical touch pad which I know some people have had complaints about, I have mine still set on the medium setting.  I think it's a matter of preference and just takes a little getting used to.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Strengths:    Sound quality, attractive design, FM radio, vertical touchpad, size, storage capacity, start-up time, included accessories, navigation, use of ID3 tags, removable battery, organizer + transfer speed.   Weaknesses:    Ran slow the first few minutes, but I think that was because of the cold temperature when it arrived. (below zero F)  Summary:   I've spent at least a month researching different mp3 players and, without any regrets, chose the Zen Micro. It's easy to use and the only thing it lacks from the iPod is the games and I would have liked if it supported the OGG Vorbis file format--hopefully it will soon with a firmware upgrade. I prefer the vertical touch pad that is on the micro.

<Title>Zen Micro got it right...
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my iPod mini for christmas for myself, and had it for 2 weeks. Prior buying iPod, I looked only at iPod reviews, and most of my friends had one, that I wanted to get one. THe only choice I made was to prefer mini over to the 20GB, 'coz I use it a lot at the gym and during running.   I loved my iPod, it was good looking, cool, could stock up to 1000 songs, amazingn clcick wheel...   But when I looked at Zen Micro on an ad, read the review and spec. I was totally moved wheh I read, Zen Micro had an embedded FM radio, with recording capability.... That was more than good enough to have me buy it. I listen to my MP3 collection most of the time, But there were times, I wanted to be able to carry my tiny little FM tuner I got 'coz they would be givingi away some stuffs on Radio, or I was wanting to hear my name called on KZLA's, double your salary. It made perfect sense for me to carry both my FM tuner and my MP3 player...  And often, I hear a song on Radio, and then go download it from iTune or any yother music store. And here I am , able to record it right there to my player... How cool is that!:)  I love it so far. THe touch pad isn't what u would feel in iPod, but iPod to me is like a closed system, and put ur songs period,nothing more nothing less. Where as Zen Micro, have ur music, if u want nlisten to all the radio stationis u want, and record songs if u like...(think of all the top10s that you can add to ur collection every day...)  I like the player so far.  THe player didn't look that cool on the pictures, but it felt really nice and perfect when I got it and hold it on my hand. Except for the Black ones the other Zen Micro's are not photogenic, but trust me they look cool... in real!  My over all experience with Zen Micro is that, they got it right... a music player ought to be able to play radio stations... There are people out there that likes radio once in a while, andn don't have to sit in their car to listen or carry around an another radio tuner for listening to radio!   These guys got it right... and I am sure the software would come with more powerful choices in the upgrades that would integrate radio and the player's ability to record them. Like now, By the time I hear a song, and seem like I like it, I already lost little of the song before I start recording... THere must be someway these guys can buffer like few seconds of radio at any given time to catch up on recordinig... I haven't read the manuals, so do not know if its already there... What to say, I am just being a naive user with more expectations...  Its a good one, and they got it right!

<Title>Compares well against the the IPod Mini
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought an IPod 20GB for my son this Christmas and decided to get the Zen Micro at the same time for myself. So I've become familiar with both products. Both my son and I am happy with our MP3 players.   The advantages of the IPod is the 20GB of hard drive space compared to 5GB over the Zen Micro. However, compared to the IPod Mini (a more fair comparison), the Mini only has 4GB.  The two biggest advantages of the IPod are the Click Wheel and the overall design. The design of the IPod is pure "zen." It is a perfect balance between design and technology.  The interface for the Zen Micro is very good, but the IPod is just pure perfection.  The killer problem with the IPod is that it is very proprietary. Apple slams Microsoft for its monopolistic practices, but IPod and ITunes are very proprietary. You basically better forget managing your collection of music on more than one computer. With IPod/ITunes you are pretty-much restricted to one PC to purchase and manage songs. The IPod also locks you down to ITunes, whereas the Creative Zen Micro lets you use just about anything you want to manage your songs.  I chose to use Windows Media Player 10 to manage and Sync songs to my Zen Micro instead of Creative's own software (which is actually pretty good).  Another problem with the IPod is the non-removable battery. The Zen Micro came with two removable/rechargeable batteries.   A few tips: upgrade to the latest 1.x firmware as soon as you get the Zen Micro. It is very stable compared to the 2.x firmware (that allows you to be compatible with the Plays For Sure Media Transfer Protocol). The MTP will be an important standard but the 2.x firmware from Creative is still a little too buggy.  Using the 1.01.03 firmware is ROCK solid with WMP 10 and USB 2.0 transfers.  I've had my Zen Micro for a month now and it has never locked-up on me.  All told, the Zen Micro has many more features compared to the IPod Mini: FM Radio, Recorder (off of radio or live), Calendar and Task List sync with Microsoft Outlook.  To me, the sound quality is better than the IPod. The included ear buds are very good, surprisingly so. They are a little big and those with smaller ears may have some difficulty in keeping them in. I bought a pair of Sony 51 ear buds for $40 and they are terrific.    You cannot go wrong with the Zen Micro. It is a great little device. Just make sure you have a working USB 2.0 connection in your computer and you update the firmware.

<Content>It's hard for me to give much of review. I recieved my Zen one day, and the hard drive was shot the next. It just up and froze. I tried taking out the battery to reset it, but that did not work. I then waited for the battery to run out completely and then tried again. But no luck. So, sadly I just shipped it back to Amazon today. I was really excited about the fm recorder and the small design.

It's a great little MP3 Player, great sound and it even came with an extra battery that I can put in myself!  Ear phones take a little getting use to and I even may get something else, as they are popping out of my ear once in a while.  You will not be sorry that you purchased this machine.

<Title>It's Great!...If you're lucky
<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great MP3 player. There is more space, a FM radio, FM radio recorder, and a voice recorder, along with many various features. But none of that matters if your batttery dies within 4 hours (when it takes ~3hrs to fully charge in the first place).   I contacted the Creative labs for help and they replied with a LONG list of things that I coulda, shoulda done. For one thing, you're supposed to charge it for 8-10hrs before first time usage...now...that was not written ANYWHERE in the box that was delivered to me. In fact, the user manual hardly contained any information.  So if you're willing to go through a lot of trouble in exchanging your player, getting it fixed, and messing with the many other glitches of this Creative player, you should try buying it.  Last thought...they don't sell any skins for the player, so trying to protect it from everyday usage is almost impossible (unless you want to use the cheap pouch they give you...)

<Title>All I could ask for..............
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this item for a good price after doing weeks of research on my best deal.  Alot of my friends have iPods, and I loved the apple interface.  For this reason, I was reluctant to steer away from Apple because of the fear that another company would not be able to meet my same expectations.  However, I discovered the Zen Micro and decided it was worth the risk due to the extra features it offered over the mini.    After 2 weeks of use, I am glad to report the Zen Micro is a dream.  It holds everything I need, sounds beautiful, and holds its charge for a surprisingly long period of time.  Also, its incredibly small, and it easily fits in my pocket.  People tend to complain about the touch pad, but I could work my way around easily in a day's time.  As far as the ease of the interface, it is not as good as Apple's.  However, it allows you to customize your menus and place them in whatever order you prefer.  This allows you to only see what you want to see in your menus.  The only bad thing I see about this product are the horrible headphones it comes with.  However, I simply have some Shure E2c's on the way.  Other than that, I am 100% satisfied.  If you are seriously considering an iPod mini, do the smart thing and order the Zen Micro!

<Title>Not as good as the ipod mini
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod. The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. This is by far my biggest complaint.  Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
