<Title>It is easy with XP and performs beautifully
<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't get the "Microsoft Professional"; sounds more like an insider for them. This was very easy to install to my XP Pro PC - downloaded Itunes from Apple, charged up the battery, ripped a CD to the software and transfered it to the Nana...it is that simple.  The sound is amazing.  How do they create such a huge volume of sound from this little device?  I am a PC guy, and this gets me to start transitioning to Mac. The Nano is a buy, recommending to my wife and family.

<Content>I've never owned one of these, it's so cool! I love this ipod! I'm not an expert, but I think it sounds great, it looks good (I got silver), holds a lot of music and it's small but substantial. The only problem is those earbuds, they really hurt my ears....

<Title>I'm a Pod person now
<Date>Wed Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I give this iPod 4.5 stars out of 5. I always wanted an iPod so last year I bought an iPod mini at the low, low price of $300. I was disappointed that I had paid so much for something that didn't even have a radio and I returned it to the store. Instead, I bought a Creative Muvo Micro, a tiny pink player with a replaceable triple A battery and an FM radio. I thought, why should I pay $300 for an iPod with several gigabytes of space that I don't need just because it was pink and cool looking, when I could have a $100 player that has more. Me and my Creative Muvo Micro were getting along great for an entire year before the unthinkable happened...I lost it. I searched for 2 weeks for the little thing and I still can't find it, so I needed a new mp3 player. If I'm going to get something new, I want something with more space, better sound quality, a better screen, just something of better technology than the player I bought a year ago. I didn't want an iPod, but every other player sold in stores is big, black, and ugly. Since the iPod Nano was now a more reasonable price at $150 for a silver one, I bought it. I wanted a pink one, but I didn't need 4 gigs of space and besides, you should get a case that covers your iPod to protect anyway, so I just bought a pink case instead. I've had this player for a week and so far I love it. It came in a small box with nothing but a usb cable, earbuds, and the iPod itself. You have to download a certain version of iTunes from the Apple webiste. Afterwards, I didn't know what to do. I'm pretty computer savvy but it took about a day before I figured out how exactly to get songs on and off the player. The directions on the website are in a video tutorial and I didn't find them that helpful.  The sound quality is excellent. Much better than my previous player. The earbuds fit very well, they're comfortable and sort of small so they don't hurt my ears.  The color screen is very bright. It even allows you to put album artwork with the songs you play, which is really sort of useless to me, but it's still looks cool. There is no radio which means that I can't listen to the tv at the gym. However, I just discovered free podcasts. I downloaded some free upbeat running music as well as some educational stuff to learn to speak Spanish. There are many, many podcasts to download so I might not have a problem filling up the 2 gigs of space. You can buy a radio for it though. Battery life is excellent, I've had a full battery every time I turn it on. There is one thing I don't like about the player and that is the placement of the headphone jack. It's on the bottom of the player which is very awkward. If I've got the iPod clipped on me while I'm working, the headphone cord gets in the way and sometimes gets pulled out. I've actually had one problem with the player since I've had it, so that's not really a good sign. The thing completely froze with the screen light turn on. I couldn't turn it off or do anything with it and since there's an internal battery, I couldn't just pull out the battery to shut it off. I had to go home and search the apple site to figure out how to reset it. It took a couple of seconds and now it's working fine again. I think Apple could have at least included a belt clop or a case for the player, but you can find cheap stylish cases with clips at online stores.  *UPDATE* I've had my iPod Nano for about 2 months now. I haven't had any more problems with it. I use it just about every day! I've never run out of battery life and rarely have to charge it up.

<Title>Joining the iPod Movement
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this iPod for listening to a salespitch at work and consequently did not have a choice in color, size, etc.  I have owned various mp3 players in the past and most have been decent.   iTunes is great software compared to some necessary for other mp3s.  With a little experimentation I have almost mastered it.  Any other question are answered easily by checking online.   The 2GB is larger than any player I have had in the past and so far I am good with the number of songs it holds.   Good sound quality, tiny and light although almost too light.   Although I don't have a high-speed USB port, the song transfer is pretty quick.  Never experienced the supposedly scratch-prone Gen. 1, but so far this seems durable.   Miss FM radio but the area I currently live in doesn't have great radio stations anyway.      Overall, a good product.  Still don't know if I would spend the money to buy one.  But definitely awesome, especially when it is free!

<Title>Love this 'pod
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a shuffle a year ago and loved the quality, I was iffy to purchase a Nano due to my clutzy nature with electronics. I have to say, this baby is TOUGH, I love the brushed finish of the Aluminum casing, no fingerprints!!!My dog has sat on it...twice, it has fallen on the floor and I have fallen down the stairs with this in pocket.....Not ONE SCRATCH on the Ipod....Me, I had a nasty break in my tailbone.  I love the games...but does anyone alses know any games that can be downloaded onto the Ipod Nano? I love, love, love this product, almost as much as my shuffle (My husband took my shuffle from me) but I am never giving up my Nano!  Peace! J

<Title>I'm sold on the 2nd Gen.
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to have the ipod shuffle but was frustrated that I couldn't dictate which songs to play. The nano is the perfect solution; I can play by specific song, artist, specific artist's albums, playlist (music folder I create), or genre. This ipod gives me the flexibility I want! Although I mostly just play music, the stopwatch feature has come in handy a few times. I haven't tried downloading games or anything else, though.  I recently went on a 24-hour road trip. I used my ipod the whole trip, and I still had battery life when I got home. The thing is very intuitive, which was nice trying to choose a song while driving at night on strange roads. I've heard people complain that it is too simple, but who wants to spend a lot of time surfing the thing when all you want is to play music NOW! The backlight was REALLY bright at night, but I like that I can determine how long the light stays on after I'm done (10 second, 5 or less after last touch).  Negatives: The earbuds are just OK but not bad enough to make me buy new ones. I would love to reorder the thing so I could get the 4 GB instead of just 2; I have A LOT of songs I want to put on it, and the 2 GB is just a little bit under what I need. There is no carrying case or anything, so you have to put it in your sweatshirt or whatever while transporting the thing. By doing this, you can accidentally increase the volume or change songs. However, I think you can lock the controls to avoid this. My shuffle has a lanyard, which is nice.  I researched mp3 players in depth, and the nano sounded like the player with the least problems (in this price range). I'm glad to know that I made the right buy.   I wrote extensively here because I truly benefitted from other people doing the same.

<Title>Grandma can do Nano's!!!!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Having zero experience with iPod-type devices and with purchasing music online, this grandma put music on her grandchildren's Christmas gift of the Silver 2GB Nano in only half a day with only 2 calls to customer support. If I can do it, anyone can. The Apple support are incredibly patient, helpful, have a sense of humor, and you don't have to wait long to get through to them. I just wish the iPod Nano came with a written manual. I did go online and print the 60-page feature guide and it didn't help me with my problem with getting the audiobook out of the music category. Once I did the "Manually manage music" option, the audiobook went in the correct category. A 2 1/2 hour book took minutes to download from the iTunes store (that's the Apple online site where you can purchase books, music, etc.)and minutes to transfer to the Nano. I loaded about 50 songs and 1 book and used 0.1 GB of the available 1.7 GB capacity using a DSL connection and a pc with a USB 2.0 port. The best part was listening to the music. It's stereo sounding, clear and the best I've heard coming out of a radio/cd player in ages. I just laid back in the recliner and listened for an hour. I bought the Tough Skin Nano holder which does have screen protection, because the Nano's are going to a 6-year old and an 8-year old. The Skins come in colors which will differentiate silver Nano's going to the same family.

<Title>Apple 2 gb Ipod Nano (2nd Generation)
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod Nano is a sleek, perfectly sized mp3 player.There are many great things about it, but I have found one thing that frustrates me.     The great things about it are its sweet sound quality, size, graphics (for such a small screen), strength, and smooth click-wheel. I don't know about other headphones yet, but the ones that came with it sound great! The Ipod weighs 1.3 oz. and is 8.9 cm. long, 4 cm. wide, and 0.6 cm. thick. The graphics on this are great especially on the games!(brick, music quiz, parachute, and solitaire) I have dropped my ipod so many times and it is still working great!!!!!! The click-wheel is very smooth ;although, I expected its size to hinder its capabilities.     The only problem I have found is that it cannotplay videos, but it can show photos.     I hope this review helps you find the right Ipod for you!!!

My only complaint would be with the ear buds; they sound great but do not fit in my ears properly.  Certainly not a reason to send it back!!

<Content>Although I prefer the 1st generation look, the iPod itself works perfectly. I couldn't find a thing wrong with it if I tried unless it's my fault (its pretty dirty). The delivery was great too. It arrived one day before the delivery date range was up. I had not gotten an email from amazon informing me that I could track my purchase so I emailed the seller at the given email. I had walked into my house around the time packages are delivered, and i saw no package so I went to my computer to read the email response from the seller. The email stated that it should have arrived that day so I walked back out 5 minutes after I had walked in, and there was my package.

<Title>The best of all the Pods
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned 5 or 6 iPods: several shuffles, the original iPod, the video iPod, and this - the 2nd gen nano.  This little guy is by far my favorite and I use it all the time while my clunky video-pod gathers dust.  It's easy to use, the perfect size, light, and incredibly wearable - especially with the lanyard headphones.  It's so much more convenient than the big pod but holds plenty, and it's way better than the shuffle because it has a display.  I LOVE it!  I'm sorry Apple saw fit to make a 3rd gen nano (with video - which I DON'T want).  They no longer sell this treasure.  Why?  As far as iTunes being hard?  I've never heard that.  My Mom and both my kids easily use iTunes and sync their pods with no trouble.  I find it incredibly user-friendly and idiotproof, myself.

<Title>Excellent, but would get the 8gb version
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was an upgrade over my old dell mp3 player. It is durable, easy to operate, and the sound qualtiy is good.  My biggest gripe is the memory. I was able to fill up 2gb much faster that I expected and I wish had purchased the 8gb nano. My other gripe is that you cant delete songs from memory or playlists using the ipod itself...only from the computer using the itunes program.  The best thing about this nano is the size. The 2nd generation nano is the perfect size to fit in a pants or shirt pocket or on an arm strap. It is very thin and very narrow. My wife just got a 3rd generation nano which has a larger screen, but is wider and feels thicker.  The full size ipod is just a little bigger than the new 3rd generation nano.  If I were in the market for an ipod that is easy to take everywhere (including to exercise with), I would buy an 8gb 2nd generation nano.

It's sleek and stylish. The only problem I've had is that it randomly turned on because something was pressing against the buttons; thus causing the batteries to eventually run out.

<Title>Oh GOD------
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Oh GOD is right! DON'T BUY THIS IPOD! I purchased one a couple months ago...and this is the story: The box arrived at 3:30 AM - 3 in the morning! I rolled out of bed and sleepily opened the front door. A very irate looking UPS man thrust the box into my arms and said "I hope you choke on it!" Needless to say, I was very perturbed. I put the box down and fell back asleep. I opened the box that morning, the sunshine flooding my house. I remove the iPod from the packaging and a very disturbing odor filled my olfactory organs...it stank like whitefish! I gagged and dropped the fishy piece of electronics. After vomiting 6 times, I cautiously placed the bad-smelling iPod back into it's lair. I was very very disappointed! I spent the whole day staring out the window while some scratched CD played some old Beatles tunes. My day was ruined...my life no better. I called UPS and informed them of my "situation." They promised to come back and return it. They did come back, 4 weeks later! My whole house stank of spoiled whitefish! Even the mailman dared not step in the vicinity of my abode. I never got my new iPod and am not sure if I even want a new one...all I know is that if not for a wonderful product called EnviroClear, a odor-eliminating spray, my life would have been ruined. Indeed. EnviroClear saved my life! PS---Don't buy an iPod, unless you like spoiled whitefish!

<Title>Excellent music listening package 
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've heard all the hype about iPods for years. Wanted to see what its really like.  Overall, it is an excellent music listening package. By package I mean iTunes and iPod. Much of the credit really does go to iTunes. It does a good job of making your music collection accessible in an interesting way. It tracks number of times a song has been played, you can rate songs, etc. It has several interesting play list choices. Highest rated, most listened to, most recently added etc. While using the iPod you can easily create a new playlist even while music is playing. This playlist is then synced back to the PC where you can rename and save it.  iPod itself seems strong and durable. UI is simple, efficient. Clickwheel is an excellent way to quickly zip through menus. Generally feels very high quality. Display is excellent, albeit small. It has better viewing angles than other devices.  I do have one serious concern however. The primary purpose of an mp3 player is to listen to music. The headphones that come with the Nano are quite lacking in low frequency response. Luckily the iPod includes an equalizer where you can boost the bass. However, is what I consider an inexcusable oversight, it often boosts the bass so that songs play very distorted. There's no excuse for this. Its trivial for the equalizer to reduce the volume of the entire song by the same amount it boosted the lows. Practically one line of code. Instead, I'm sure millions of people run around listening to distorted music thinking it sounds great.  There are freeware tools out there that can alter your music on your PC to lower the volume enough to prevent it from distorting on the iPod. The one I've used is mp3gain. It works, but its an amazing pain to have to go through this process when the iPod itself could have done it trivially.

<Title>Just hype, not enough substance, not really worth the $$$
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has a great appearance and a huge marketing machine behind it. The iPod software(not the iTunes)is great. I like the wheel and the generous display(although it is not used to it potential since the iPod Nano does not support video). But that is where all the good stuff ends.  ** The interface with the PC and especially with the iTunes is really really bad. The programers that made the Nano software didn't work on the iTunes software unfortunately. ** The Nano does not use a regular USB cable to connect to the PC, you have to have the Nano cable. ** The Nano does not support many audio formats besides mp3s such as OGG, ASF, FLAC. ** The Nano does not create a usable drive for easy media upload in Windows. ** Because you have to sync it with your PC, you can't sync it with any other PCs. ** The Nano does not have an FM tuner. ** The Nano does not have a voice recorder either. ** And worst of all...you can't replace the battery. How long will this Nano recharge...we'll find out.   I got my Nano as a gift, but by choice I would not buy it at any price because there are many other players, perhaps not as hip, but with many more needed functions.

<Title>The Only iPod Review You Need to Know
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have used the iPod mini (4GB silver), the fifth-generation iPod Video (30GB white), and the second-generation iPod nano (2GB silver), and also an iBook (white plastic). All through these years I have gotten to know Apple's products better and better. But here I am going to comment on the new iPod nano that I have.  First, the good things.   Beautiful design! I have looked at all kinds of mp3 players for a long time and have also tried at least a dozen of them, but the iPod series of products are easily the winner of all. No other products can compete with the iPod in terms of design. I don't understand why all of the other mp3 player companies have no sense of aesthetics whatsoever! If any one of them wants to compete with the iPod, they should at least know they need to excel in design first and foremost!   Superb software! The iPod is easy to use and fun to use as well. I am using a PC. But WMP11 is so unattractive and stupid compared to iTunes. It is such a shame for Microsoft to continue to turn out crappy products like this. We all know IE7 is so raw and buggy and ugly! I have read some other comments that iTunes did not work well on PCs. But I think those people might be just a little challenged when it comes to computers. For PC users with a little bit more knowledge of using computers, iTunes should work just as well as WMP11 or even better. Personally I found that iTunes has a better editing interface when you need to edit album/song information. It's very intuitive and it works, while on the other hand WMP11 is not intuitive and many times it just does not work, and you need to search for solutions on line. So iTunes DOES work seamlessly with Windows XP.  Better clickwheel! No one has even noticed it before, but the clickwheel has been improved. If you look at the iPod video, you will see that the clickwheel and the center button are on the same level, viz. they are flat. But the new clickwheel on the iPod nano is grooved in the middle, fitting the shape of your fingers very well. It's a small physical improvement, but it is indeed a major functional improvement. It makes the clicking even more smooth and enjoyable.  Stellar choices of accessories. There are just too many cool accessories to mention here. But if you have an iPod, the possibility of expansion and extension is just endless. No other mp3 players can compete in this respect.  Easy subscription to Podcasts! No doubt one of the biggest impact the iPod has had on people and society is Podcasts. There are just so many things offered and you are sure to find many things you like. It is just a breeze to subscribe to and manage your Podcasts on your iPod. No other mp3 players can do this, or even if they can, they cannot do this well enough.  Okay, of course there are tons of nice things to say about the iPod, but most people have already heard of such comments too many times before and now I am going to point out some really, really disappointing flaws that made me mad.  Build quality! One word: inferior! That is not a word that people associate with Apple, since Apple tries to look as hip and highbrowed as possible. With an award-winning design, the iPod should at least deliver the quality that matches the superiority of the fine aesthetics. But it does NOT. The first iPod video I bought had quite a few bad pixels on the screen. Some were more noticeable and more annoying; some were less, but as annoying. The other day I bought a 2GB silver iPod nano at Walmart. When I first turned it on, I immediately found out that the screen was not set correctly inside the iPod, and in fact it was so obviously slant! I had to take it back and exchange it for a new one. The lady at the customer service counter at Walmart  could easily see what the problem was and agreed to get a new one for me. So it is not that I was fussy or picky or whatever, but it was a defective product. So I got a replacement. You know what, when I opened the new package, voila! the screen was also slightly slant, but not very noticeable, and I almost decided to keep it when I spotted a bad pixel on the screen. It is either a bad pixel or some dirt trapped inside the screen cover. But whatever it was, it was very annoying. This made me remember my first iBook. The screen was defective and I had to call Apple and got a replacement. But upon unpacking the new computer, I noticed more flaws on the screen and on the keyboard as well. With all of these in mind, I think it is reasonable to draw the conclusion that the low-end products of Apple are of low quality as well.  High price! If you look at the build quality of the iPod, you have reason to believe that the cost of each unit cannot be more than $50! But they charge $150.00 and more for it! Why? Because it is so popular! But frankly such business morals and conducts are questionable. If you want to stay in business forever, you have to be honest with your customers.  Disappointing earphones! How ironic! Why does the iPod not come with nice earphones? If you ever tried the Creative Zen and iRiver Clix players you would hear the difference. The earphones that come with the iPod are beautifully designed, and they have nice clear sound. But the bass is so lacking and so weak that when I listened to some songs with rich bass lines they all sounded muddy and crisp. Well the word crisp might be a good word in other contexts but not when you are talking about bass performance. I have read quite a few "authoritative" reviews of the iPod mp3 players, and most of them laud the "beautiful sound quality" of the iPod. But may I disagree? With a price tag like that, and a hip profile like that, how could the earphones not live up to expections? The fact is they do not. I am by no means an audiophile, but I can tell which earphones are better. I can only say that the Apple earphones are just mediocre. Speaking of this, I think of the iPod Hi-Fi. I played with it in an Apple store, and it made me extremely disappointed. Again the performance of the iPod Hi-Fi fell short of my expectations. And again the culprit was the bass performance. It just sounded muddy and incompetent! Yesterday I played with a JBL Time Machine Alarm CLOCK/DOCK For iPod (white), and I was really impressed. I like it, and recommend it to anyone who is serious about sound when it comes to sound anyway.  I like Apple and its products, but I am also deeply disappointed.

<Title>Poor customer service
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The features of the iPod are phenomenal.  Unfortunately, the service offered by Apple is sub-par.  Beyond 90 days, your only option is to submit a request on Apple's website (Apple only permits one free support call within the 90 day window).  A service request I submitted was cancelled with no reason given and no method to respond.    Beyond the 1 year warranty, expect to buy a new mp3 player rather than have your existing iPod serviced.  To have a battery replaced, the service charge is $70, with an additional $30 in shipping.  For all other issues, your iPod will be replaced for $170, with an assitional $30 in shipping.  That's more expensive than the 2GB Nano that's on the market!    Utterly ridiculous, and not what I have come to expect from Apple's reputation.  Needless to say, my next purchase will be from one of Apple's competitors.

<Title>Perfect blend of art and science!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>iPod arrived late thanks to blunders by Amazon, shipping 2day order via UPS Ground and UPS, forgetting to load the package to delivery truck. I never liked Apple anyway. Never had any Apple device. Never like their policies of using proprietary devices and software not compatible with anything else in the market. But I love gadgets and work with computer hardware so I love modern technology. I hated Apple purely on other people's views. So finally when my daughter told me only thing she wanted this Christmas is an Apple iPod I was mad. But I love my daughter so I decided to swallow my pride and order an iPod thinking I will be able to return it quickly when she compare it with the MP3 player she already have. Last Christmas I gave her best non Apple MP3 player I could find. iPod arrived today and I wanted to just make sure it work so I opened it. It was a mistake!  It was a long time since I experienced this feeling of love at first sight and it was an incredible feeling. I just stared at the package for a long time. The colors (or the absence of it), the shape and size is breathtaking (yes I am talking about the box, and I have not yet opened it). Then I open it WOW, every thing is so logical and easy from how you open the box to presentation and color selection of every component in it including printed words and beauty of absence of lengthy instructions but preserving essence of order and logic of natural progression of events that lead from one to another building up on each to guide you seamlessly is breathtaking. It is a perfect blend of pure art and advance science to create minimalist but highly functional device design to educated and empower you instead of being your slave. It defines a new life style that changes your habits and expectations. I have no feeling to fully describe it. Yes I know it has no FM radio but Podcast, it has no multiple file format support but iTunes, it has no voice recorder but touch-wheel. It does not give you the past but take you to the future. It is long time I have felt this way and I thank Apple for creating a device that touched my soul and brought out the hidden passion in me I thought lost long time ago.

<Title>I love my new iPod nano!
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first iPod with screen, I had an iPod shuffle and I liked it but I always missed having a screen and selecting songs easily, so I sold it and bought the new nano... I love it, it's beautifully designed, it's so small that everytime I hold it in my hand I keep thinking how Apple managed to make it so small...  -I love the battery life, I dont have to recharge it constantly... -The interface for selecting songs is very intuitive and easy, in fact, everything about the ipod nano is easy to use... -I love the sound quality, it's excellent  The only thing I don't like about my new iPod nano is that it doesn't have an option to adjust the level of brightness of the screen, in normal lighting it is perfect, but I use it before I sleep at night with the lights off and when I want to change a song the brightness of the screen blinds me...

<Title>A Nearly Perfect MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After getting a year of good and hard use out of my 1st generation 4gb iPod Nano, the hold key snapped. Since it was out of warranty, Apple said that it would cost $180 to fix. Forget it. At that price, I might as well get the new one. So I did, and as of now I have a fantastic impression. I'll go through all of it step by step, so prepare yourselves.   1: The case. Though relatively minor, the case that the Nano comes in, as well as what's included with it, has been slimmed down to the bare essentials, which I actually prefer. The small plastic case uses very few materials, which is good for mother nature, and has no CD that you need to install before using it, which is good for your patience. There's also a few apple stickers, which I promptly got rid of as well as the new Apple headphones, a bare-bones manual, a warranty card and an adapter for a dock. One minor thing, the case can be a little frustrating to open, though it's worth it, believe me.   2: iTunes/connectivity with your computer. As with all iPods, this think has nigh on perfect harmony with iTunes. I've got around 2 gigabytes worth of music, and it was all transferred and ready to play within 7 minutes. Unless you balance the Nano on the cord just so or get a dock, it's going to be lying on your desk, so make sure not to have any dust on it. As with the other iPods, the Nano uses the proprietary connector, which is cool with me, with the slew of accesories that are available for it. Just don't lose the cable, since you'll lose all ways of charging and syncing it. Again, a small complaint here. The Nano isn't fully charged right out of the box; you have to charge it for around 45 minutes to get it 100% juiced.   3: The differences. If you were to go through the pros and cons of the 1st generation and 2nd generation Nano, 2g would win hands down. It is a hair thinner and a hair taller, but the curved edges make it feel simply, well, Nano. Another very good addition is the use of color. With the previous generation, the lovely dark color ended as soon as you flipped it over. Not so with this sucker. The whole thing is clad in anodized alumium, which happens to be nigh on scratchproof and extremely resistant to fingerprints. The bad part about that is that the case is seamless, so anyone trying to open it up will have to go for the much more difficult top or bottom openings, which are still plastic.   As for the differences with the guts of the Nano, they are small but noticeable. The vaunted click wheel is still here [and with good reason, it's the slickest and easiest control scheme in the portable world], along with the only other button on the thing, the hold key, which I hope proves less breakable than the one on the previous generation. The screen is noticeably brighter, easily the 40% claimed by Apple. There are also some handy new features on the inside: when you're scrolling quickly through songs, a letter will appear in semi-translucent text to make it easier to tell where you are. There's also a search function, and you can set a volume limit if you don't want to give yourself a headache. Other than that, things are pretty much the same.   Finally, the complaints. First of all, I dislike Apple to a very large extent as a company. They make decisions that would stop me from buying this iPod if I hadn't already made a substantial investment in the songs that I had purchased. For example, Apple makes it impossible to use the 1st generation Nano dock because they moved the connector port about 1mm to the left, for no apparent reason other than to get people to buy the dock, again. This'll also be a problem for any other docks/radio transmitters that have an enclosed connector, since those are bound to be designed to the first generation.   Those complaints aside, I am well and truly happy. Apple truly has made a great product, and if they stop making these stupid money-making changes they will have no significant obstacles in retaining their title of Maker of the World's Best MP3 Players.

<Title>Bad software
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Cute device and works well when it works, but I wasted hours and hours of frustrating software problems and still can't get iTunes working right with my Nano.  iTunes often does not see the iPod - it took hours to find the reason hidden on their site. iTunes mysteriously starts blocking browsing to buy music after sampling several songs. I don't know if it's a bug or some kind of browse limit. Why they would want to stop people from buying songs is beyond me. You have to reinstall iTunes every time this happens - what a pain.  The folder structure is confusing - if you delete songs and sync, no memory is freed on the iPod, because the songs are still there hidden in a "Songs" folder. There is a folder called Music and other folders that you create for your music - does that make sense? Not to me. To really delete some songs you have to go into a manual management mode which creates even more confusion. Delete a file in manual mode and you get a long delay with no indicator of what is going on.  Without exaggeration, iTunes has the reliability and illogical approach of amateur shareware. I'm on the Windows version. I guess they think they'll sell more Macs if their Windows software is horrible enough - not to me. The time I wasted just trying to get the songs I want on my Nano thru the poor iTunes software was way way too much.  And forget about support. There is a place to enter your S/N to prove you own your device but it did not recognize my S/N. I tried twice. This appears to be a bug they don't want to fix. And the iPod is hardware so why should I have to proove I own it at all?? Then you have to fill a form and fax proof of purchase to register for support - like people still use fax machines.  That's not all. In iTunes you can't hide the ads even though it's a pay service! The iPod connector pulls out the bottom plastic part of the case if you are not careful.  Here's my theory - Apple's success with iPod made them think they are doing everything right. They should offer tech support without playing games, not for the benefit of their customers, but rather so they can see what a mess they create for them, which might persuade them to write software that works as good as their products look. I'll be searching for a way to use my Nano with anything but iTunes.  iTunes and iPod are designed to work together so I reviewed them together. I gave 2 stars based on the average of 4 stars for the iPod and negative -2 stars for iTunes.

<Content>This is a great product, probably the best mP3 for $150.  The backlit screen is much brighter, the battery life is longer and it is extremely light.  The sound quality is very good and unless you have jumbo-sized hands, it is the perfect size.  It does have games that you can play while you listen, it has and adress book and a calender that can bee synced with iTunes.  The only flaw that I have found so far is you have to charge the battery on the computer by plugging it in there.  So, when you plug it in, it tries to sync with iTunes as well and is a pain in the neck.  I would suggest this product for everyone because it does a little something for people of all ages.

<Title>First MP3 player, wow!!!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A couple months ago I bought a black 2 gig ipod nano, for just $50. Why??? I simply didn't want to spend a couple hundred $ for an MP3 player. Yes it was partly used, but the person selling it bought it for his wife and she never used it(I bought the ipod off of Craigslist) so I got it. It was missing the USB cable and docking thing, so I bought the cord off Ebay for a couple bucks. I didn't see any reason to buy the docking port, and so I just stuck with the USB cable. Instead of downloading music off the internet, I just took songs off of Cds I had. And wow, does 2 gig hold quite a bit! The nano works great except for one thing, the battery. My battery work for about 6 hours, more or less. I am not sure if that is the average battery time for a second generation Ipod nano, but it does seem kind of short. Some of the features I liked about the ipod was the fact it kept world time, and has a pretty detailed calendar in which you can mark days. Right now my nano has a couple thousand pictures on it, once I put into it over 10,000 photos, and it took over an hour to get all of them downloaded! No surprise, it took a huge chunk of memory, so I erased most of them. To keep you entertained, there a four games:music quiz, parachute, solitare, and brick. One other feature I'd like to point out is the hold switch on top. It's very useful if you are the kind of person who carries their player everywhere. Once the switch is on, nothing you press will turn it on. I recommend the ipod nano to all music lovers!!!

<Title>iJobs: Why Must there always be a fatal flaw?
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One pictures the gestation of this product unfolding thusly: Steve Jobs raging at his engineers that the device has to be even more sleek and futuristic than its predecessors.  That it must possess superior sound and ease of use.  And that it must possess some element designed to leave its owner incredibly disappointed, almost to the point of anger.  Such has been the Apple tradition since at least the first gen. iMac, probably longer...  In this case, Jobs ruins an otherwise perfect product with vexingly designed earphones that will not stay in your ears.  They sound awesome.  The bass sound is particularly impressive.  And yet, they are so slippery and ill-fitting, expecting them to stay put even while sitting perfectly still- is simply unrealistic.  Again, one imagines Jobs in his sanctuary, personally directing the earbuds' nightmarish design, then testing them on Senior Managers who have fallen from his favor.  As the unfortunate test subjects are tantalized by scads of U2 songs monopolized by iTunes, they find themselves trying to somehow flex their earholes to keep the buds from popping out just as they are getting into a groove.  Musicus Interruptus..  Ah Jobs, the angry genius.  We pray for his forgiveness while he roils in his disappointment of us, the general public... "The World must PAY for choosing Windows over the Mac OS! It must PAY for the shunning of NEXTSTEP.  I will make them WANT this...but they can never listen to their precious music comfortably... without paying for aftermarket earphones! Mwuh-huh-huh!!!"  When we see the launching of an Apple product that does not include a fatal flaw, we will know at last mankind has reconciled with the psyche of Jobs.

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this iPod! I got it for Christmas and it is just the best!  It is easy to put songs and photos on it, charges WHILE you are putting songs on, super compact, and not only great for on the go, but great if you want to play some games, look at pictures without going through the trouble of finding your photo albums, you can listen to music at the same time, if you are in a place with no electricity or at a sleapover or something with no clock you can adjust the date and time along with the city, set "to do's" and "notes" along with calenders, and you basically have your own little compact organizer!    I personaly think that this iPod is overrated, I mean this is great, but I'm sure that there are a lot of nice and maybe even NICER things other than this although it is great, but the first thing that comes to people's minds are "iPod!" But it IS a really great product.    It has a long lasting battery... 24 hours!    I don't think that the earbuds aren't good because of the iPod, I think that earbuds are just uncomfortable and aren't good in general. Plus, you can just buy a pair of headphones that you can find for cheap.   The sound is great, really clear and everything is always organized.  Overall, I think it is really nice to just have.  Hope this helps!

<Content>This is my first experience with any type of ipod device. Downloading music onto it is a breeze as well as removing the ones you might change your mind about later, although getting pictures onto it has been challenging. However, the manual is in .pdf form and is quite helpful. There are games, a calendar and lots of other goodies. It's a combination of a Palm and MP3 in one in many ways.  The sound quality is phenomenal and while you listen, it is though the artist is right next to you. Not bad for 2GB and 500 songs!   Downloading free podcasts from the iTunes store is also a nice feature, whether you want to learn Spanish or famous speeches. Although the Nano does not have video capacity, you can download video podcasts that you can watch on your computer, just as though it were on Windows Media Player and then erase them as you go.  Overall, this is a great value for your money. Enjoy.

<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Silver (2nd Generation) today. I am very pleased with Amazon so far. Amazon told me that I would receive my iPod nano between late January and Early Febuary (they were out of stock), and I received it Dec. 27.   I like the 2nd gen nano much more than the 1st. the battery lasts almost twice as long, the screen is brighter, and the aluminum design is much more scratch resistant, and even a little lighter. The only minor annoyane that I found is that the LCD screen is unprotected, unlike the original nano, which had that layer of plastic over it.   I do wish that the 2 GB nano came in the same colors that the 4 GB ones come in. I have no need for more than 2, but I would have liked it to be in a color, like green. I find this to be one of Apple's schemes; trying to make us spend another fifty dollars.   I am very happy with my new nano. I have to say, I like the iPods much more than any other mp3 player. The click wheel is handy, easy to work with, and fun. I also love the sleek design. I recomend Apple iPods of any sort to anyone who wants to pay a little extra for something that can hold a minimum of 500 songs and adiobooks and 10's of thousands of digital pictures in an attractive way to show off to friends.

<Content>Just moved up from mini-ipod to the Nano. I could be unhappier. Once I stop listening and plug it in, I have to reboot it each time to get sound. I have no sound otherwise. This completely does not work for me since I use it at the gym with audiobooks. So now I am using the wheel to fast forward...at 20 second intervals which is not how it is supposed to be either...my mini jumped forward in much larger intervals so can only think this feature is not working on the Nano correctly either. Completely frustrated but I'll trade it for another. Apple gets one more chance and then I'm moving to another mp3 player.
