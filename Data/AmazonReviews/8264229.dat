<Title>Great Performance and Great Design
<Date>Mon Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Sounds great!   I couldn't believe how easy the set up was.  This was my first time using an MP3 player and I did not even need to use the manual to set up and start downloading.  Earbuds are high quality with incredible depth and range.  Very cool design with earbuds integrated into the neck cord.  Not much bigger than a tube of Lib Balm.  Also has this great arm band attachment which really holds up as you exercise.  Easy to read and use display window. Nicely backlit in blue.  Highly reccomend this for yourself or as a gift.

<Title>good for working out
<Date>Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I LOVE the compact size of this MP3 player and use this specifically to use when working out.  It is very difficult reaching customer service.  I advise you to keep very careful documentation of the player; this is the easist way.  The company started in 1998, so I think they are still developing their customer service department.   I enjoy mine, but needed different headphones from the ones that were provided; the provided headphones were very short.

<Title>Great Little Player
<Date>Fri Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this player after a lot of research.  I wanted something lightweight for running.  This player is great!  The sound quality is excellent.  I use my own headphones because I do not like earbuds, however, the quality of the earbuds is very good.  The belt clip works wonderfully, I have not had a problem.  I have not used the armband.  I like the player so much I listen to it in my car! I had no trouble with the music software.  I was up and running w/ in minutes.   I would highly recommend purchasing this product.  I have had this player for 7 months and it still works great.  The only problem is it does not play WMA files.  I did not care about this when I purchased it, everything I downloaded was MP3.  However, all I can find now is WMA files.

<Title>Compact and easy to use
<Date>Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great player.  The size is amazingly small but the sound quality is great!  <p>The software that comes with the player is a little difficult to understand, but I took their advice and downloaded the plug-in for Real One Player.  I find it easier to use and with many more features. I do save my favorite cds as mp3 and the sound quality does not diminish.<p>I agree with the previous reveiwer about the headphones...the ones provided, though great sound, are very short. Great if clipped to shirt pocket or armband, but not to your shorts or even holding it at arm length.  I bought another good quality earbud and am using that instead.<p>Overall....good quality, good features, great sound.

<Title>A Great Product in a Small Package
<Date>Wed Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received this MP3 player for my birthday.  It's a great player for those who are content to load your songs on and go.  On average, I can get about 30 songs on there of high mp3 quality.  The biggest con is that it won't play wma format.<p>I have been extremely happy with this mp3 player.  I wish that I could expand the memory to play more songs, but I usually don't even use all of the memory anyway for a typical amount of listening time.  <p>The battery lasts about 10 hours long, so on long trips I have had to change out batteries.  But the sound quality and the size are the best features of this great player.  I would recommend this to a friend.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I really love this player.<br>It does exactly what it says it does.  It is compact and very light.  After receiving it I can see why it won design awards.  It is a very cool looking unit.  All I wanted it for was to listen to my tunes at the gym.  I have already used it for other things.  I connected it to my BOSE wave radio and the sound was incredible.  The ear buds that come with it have a incredible output.  The only negative thing I have found was the same as others the length of the ear bud's cord is a little short.<br>After going to the companys web page I figured out what I was doing wrong in tryig to play WMA and now it does play both MP3 and WMA files.  I know the 128 MB does not play the WMA files.  I would by this product again.  It is great for the gym.  It does not have a voice recorder or a fm tuner.  I did not buy it wanting those features. Like I said all I wanted to do is listen to music at the gym in something compact and it has already proven that and more.  The preset equalizer setting is a nice feature.

<Title>Very impressive little package
<Date>Sat Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I finally decided to buy an MP3 player and this little unit is just great.  Software was easy to install.  Adding and deleting songs is as simple as dragging and dropping into any folder on your hard drive.  The one AAA battery needed seems to last a long time.  Love the fact that you can wear it around your neck as a necklace with the earbuds attached.  I can listen to music and read while my spouse is watching TV right next to me.  Great to have with you while waiting in the Doctor's office, etc.  I would recommend to friends and buy them as xmas gifts as well.

<Date>Fri Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a great product. The sound quality is very good. It is easy to transfer songs to it. It is compact and very comfortable to run with. The only minus that I have found is that its battery level gauge is misleading. You would expect that 2 out 3 lines on the battery scale means that you have quite a lot of battery power left, but this is not the case and 2 out of 3 should be actually interpreted as close to empty.

<Title>STUPID HEADSET
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I opened the box and repacked right away for a refund. I was so disappointed.  Don't get me wrong.  I own the MPIO FL100 and love it.  The design is so sleek and chic. I'm going to get another one.  The sound on the FL100 is amazingly clear.  I thought I would buy another product from MPIO and this DMK looked unique - small.  Ooohhh, how disappointed.  The head set is like a freaking 'necklace' You literally have to put this silly thing over your neck and the earplugs comes out of the side.  It's as though you are wearing an eyeglass holder around your neck and your glasses are daggling on your chest.  You can't tell at all by the picture.

<Title>Bad Design
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 Player uses a AAA battery. This is a terrible design decision. It severely curtails play life (by 1/3 to 1/2 compared to a AA) while the batteries themselves are not significantly cheaper than AA's.  I have also had a hard time finding rechargeable AAA's compared to AA's.  And while it sounds trivial, it is NOT minor that AAA batteries disappear much more easily that AA batteries at almost 3x the size.  I bought 4 rechargeables shortly after getting this.  A month later, 2 have disappeared.  Did I mention AAA batteries are not notably cheaper than AA's?&#60;br /&#62;Dont buy this.

<Title>I Changed My Mind!  (You'll See Why)
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I previously wrote a good review for this MP3 player, which I have since deleted.  Basically, what happened was a week after a wrote the review, the thing conked out on me for no apparent reason.  What happened was I had just finished downloading Service Pack 2 for Windows XP (don't know if this caused the problem, but I found it to be an odd coincidence).  I went to erase the songs, which went smoothly, but when I tried to download some different ones, the program froze up on me.  This had happened before, and usually I would just restart the program and it would pick up where it left off.  This time, though, the program would not start.  I tried again and again, to no avail.  Well, I figured, I'll give the program a rest.  At least I have about ten songs in the MP3 player.  I'll just listen to those.  Well, I went to turn on the player...nothing.  I changed the battery...nothing.    Over the course of three weeks, I e-mailed, called and wrote MPIO a letter detailing the problem and asking for a refund or replacement.  I heard nothing back, not even an automatic e-mail message.  The only good thing about their customer service is that that don't leave you on hold forever.  After fifteen minutes, they ask you to leave a message detailing the problem.  That's great...if they made the effort to return your call.  Well, finally, I gave up, chucked the player and bought a new one (another brand of course).  I talked to several people in the know about this stuff and they said Service Pack 2 was probably not a factor in the player's demise.  Also, my new player works fine, despite my still having Service Pack 2.  I wouldn't have been so ticked off if the thing hadn't cost 100 dollars and I had it for a whopping nine months.  I expect something at that price to last for a few years, not a few months.  Well, I won't EVER be buying anything from MPIO again, even if they come out with a player that holds a million songs and looks better than the overglorified IPOD.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed in their product and their non-existent customer service.  I once highly recommend this player, but now I say don't waste your money.  You're 100 dollars is better spent on something else.

<Title>Highly Recommend
<Date>Sun Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The DMK was my first experience with mp3 players and I'd have to say it's worked great. I've had it for about a year and a half now and it's survived countless high-velocity impacts on pavement. The thing is covered in dents and I lost the battery cover but it's still alive and kicking perfectly. Its small size is really a plus, making it ideal for running or working out at the gym. I've read various complaints about the inconvenience of the "necklace" headset configuration, but I've actually found this to be advantageous, as I can carry the thing around without any belt clips or whatnot. The earbuds and wires are also easily concealable, which is helpful when i'm listening to music during class:) I bring it with me everywhere, couldn't live w/out it. Overall a great buy.

<Title>works fine, but not w/o quirks
<Date>Sat May 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Cons: after about a year of use (during which time SP2 was installed on my pc), the player and the manaing program started locking up -- i had to manually kill the process and remove the batter from the player to stop it. After browsing the MPIO website and downloading the updated driver for SP2, i found out that the update does not work (i.e. the file mentioned in the instructions was not included in the download). I removed the manager from my pc, downloaded the newer version of it, formatted the internal memory of the player and so far have not encountered any problems. Also, the included clip does not hold that well.  pros: small size, VERY durable, perfect for workouts. In my opinion, beats the expensive HDD players.

<Title>I've registered solely to warn you AGAINST purchasing this.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The MPIO DMK MP3 player is an unmitigated piece of junk - a terrible, terrible purchase that has only caused me a ton of frustration and, well, even a tinge of embarrassment.   I say frustration because, since having initially managed to successfully upload songs onto the device ONCE (which I suppose could in a way justify the mandatory one-star rating I've had no choice but to give it,) it has for all intensive purposes ceased to function, it would seem entirely of its own volition. I have tried installing and re-installing the included MPIO software onto no less than three different fully up-to-date PCs with no success. MP3 files simply refuse to transfer to the device. I have spent tireless hours trying to troubleshoot the problems - even braving the, uh, let's just call it "loosely translated" instruction manual - to no avail. Alas, I  have since given up, having come to the realization that there is so much more to life than sitting by the computer and trying to beat this piece of crap into functioning the way it's supposed to. I have come to the end of my unfortunate epic journey of frustration with the knowledge that there is no software, firewire or missing piece that will rectify the problems with the MPIO DMK 128 MB MP3 Player. The problem is intrinsically in the poor manufacturing. To say that THIS THING SUCKS is an understatement.  It is also important to note that though the MPIO DMK is marketed as being cross-platform compatible (i.e. it claims to work on both Mac and PC,) this is outright false advertising. A blatant lie. iTunes and this thing are like water and oil. Plugging this piece of garbage into a Mac (yes, I've tried it on a Mac as well as the aforementioned three PCs) will only result in a frozen computer. Try connecting device. Restart computer. Try again. Restart. Try again. Restart. Scream. Punch hole in wall. Drink heavily to dull pain. Again.  Furthermore, the MPIO DMK wasted no time in starting to fall apart physically as well. It's not too major, but the rubber cap that seals the firewire input dock ceased to fit, leaving the dock exposed at all times. Can you spell A-W-E-S-O-M-E?  I say that the MPIO DMK 128 MB MP3 Player caused me embarrassment as well because I had the added misfortune of having bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. It would have been her first MP3 Player. She watched and waited as I tried in vain to get her music to work. When I finally gave up, pounding fists on the desk and sobbing unconsolably from the unrelenting emotional toll raised by my endless unsuccessful efforts, she dried my tears, stroked my hair and assured me that it didn't matter. But as much as I tried to grapple with her sincerity, I could see the truth plainly revealed in her eyes: she thought me to be less of a man.  Just kidding. It wasn't like that. But close.  But seriously, I have since replaced this piece of crap with an iPod Shuffle, which works without incident and sounds infinitely better.  So, in conclusion, if you are in the market for a portable MP3 Player, I implore you to save yourself the trouble and look in another direction. I can tell you with all conviction not to purchase the MPIO DMK 128 MB MP3 Player under any circumstance. You might as well set your money on fire.  In fact, I will go so far as to say that If I could manage to get in touch with the President of MPIO - or, say, a customer service representative...or, geeze, even a frickin' company secretary for that matter - I would, without hesitation, ask for his resignation.

<Content>I absolutely love this mp3. It was my first mp3 player.  I had recieved for my brithday and have used it for almost 3 years and it still works perfectly.  I've taken it running, snowboarding, and etc. I like it how you do not need to charge it because it runs on AAA batteries.  Loading songs onto the mp3 is incredibly simple.  You just drag down songs.  The controls are also very easy to use.

<Title>No reason to buy this
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player a year and a half ago, and it's really not worth getting.  I had serious compatibility issues uploading songs onto the thing, it got so bad that only one in about ten tries would successfully work, and sometimes if you were uploading one song it would freeze and corrupt the entire memory.  As long as you weren't changing songs it worked ok, but that's hardly a justification for it's flaws.  It's possible this was just a compatibility problem with my pc, but I wouldn't tell anybody to risk that anyway.  I personally won't ever risk buying a digital way product for a while.  For the same price as this you can get a Samsung YP-MT6X 512 mb mp3 player, that is better than this one in ever way:  - it plays OGG and WMV files - it has 4 times the memory - it has 4 times the battery life.

<Content>I just purchase my mp3 player and it was so easy to set up and use.  First, installing the software was simple, and downloading  songs to my mp3 player is even easier to do.  It was just click and drag, so no one should have a problem downloading music to their mp3 player, even dumbies can do this.  Also the features on my mp3 are easy to use; it's like a regular cd disc man.  The quality of the songs played is cd quality, but you will need a mp3 or wma converter program to download your music to your mp3 player.  I love how small it is and is great to exericise with.

<Title>WMA Screwup Solved!
<Date>Wed Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought my MPIO yesterday and couldn't be happier with it. However, thanks to the above reviews, I was under the impression that I wouldn't be able to listen to any WMA files with my new MPIO. THIS IS NOT TRUE. <p>First, using the CD-ROM enclosed with your MPIO, you must select the "Install Windows Media Plugin" from the main menu. If you install this plugin, you will not need to install MPIO Manager 2.0. <p>Next, once you have connected your MPIO to your PC through the included USB cable, enter Windows Media Player and select the action "Copy to CD or Device" (This feature is on Windows XP, I assume it's included with older versions of WMP). You then have the option of selecting a drive to copy the MP3 and WMA files to. Usually this will be a CD burner. Simply change it (using the dropdown menu) to "Internal Memory"... it should have the MPIO logo beside it. Then click "Copy" and you are able to download WMA files to your MPIO. <p>Just thought I'd clear up the misunderstanding regarding WMA files on the MPIO.<p>KM

<Title>This MP3 player is great!
<Date>Sat Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I'm brand new to the world of transferring music to the computer and not especially computer-savvy, but I just got this player yesterday and within 2 hours had loaded the software and filled it up with songs from 6 CDs.  As others have said, the interface for the installation software is confusing (and if you only have internal speakers, you should turn them off before loading the software as an annoying percussion sound plays constantly and it, combined with the confusing interface, can start stressing you out.) But if you just click on everything that shows up as you roll the cursor around, you can easily load the MPIO software and RealOne and be all set to go.<p>The player itself is much smaller and lighter than I expected, and the necklace-type holder with attached ear buds is perfect for use on an airplane or the subway (which is how I plan to use it.)  The sound quality is amazing.<p>I am really looking forward to using this to drown out screaming babies on my Christmas plane ride home!

<Title>Hard drives or Flash Memory?  What I have found out.....
<Date>Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Okay. Here is a write up, that I did, on the comparisons/contrasts on MP3 players. Mainly, the Harddrive versions (I.E. Rio Riot/Apple IPOD -both of which I own) and the flash memory type... (I.E. Memorex 3642 Mp3 Player, of which I own as well). <br>What prompted this little jaunt (of which you may send to as many people as you like) My (expensive) Apple IPOD died during a sync last month. Just me copying files over to it, and the battery ran out of juice. I would have not attempted to copy music had I known the battery was low, but the battery read FULL STRENGTH. Anyhoo, I called Apple, they said return it for maintenance.<br>I did. Sent it back.<br>They returned it, still broke.<p>To my suprise, there is only a TEN DAY return policy.<p>TEN DAYS.<p>I did not realize this at all... and will not ever buy another apple product.<p>So, after a month or so of messing around trying to find another MP3 player... I decided to go with a flash memory MP3 player, the ones that use memory sticks.<p>SO, here are the pro and cons of these devices.<p>Pro's for the Memory Stick Mp3 players<p>-Cheaper. WAY CHEAPER than Hard drive types.<p>-If you go into music match and file convert to MP3 Pro and shrink the size of your MP3 to like, say 3o percent... you can really make a good Kompression. Example. My Memorex MP3 player has 32mbs of memory on board. It is expandable to 256mb. 32 mb will basically let you put one cd's worth of music. It is easy to put music on and off of them, due to your computer reading the USB as just another hard drive, so you drag and drop to put on, delete them to take them off. But, after you shrink your files to MP3 Pro 30 percent, you can put twice as many. So, basically a 256mb chip will allow me to put 208 songs on my little less than palm size MP3 player. And it wieghs like 3 ounces. <p>- More on memory. These little chips are the size of the upper part of your thumb, at least my thumb anyway. They come in 128mb, 256mb, 512mb and even though there aren't any MP3 machines out there to handle them YET, you can even buy a 1.5gig thumb size chip thingy. Considering the size of the chips and the shrinking kompression I told you about earlier, I could shrink my whole KOLLEKTION down to 10 of those 1.5gig chips. At the current shrink rate I am at 5 DVD's, which are way bigger and more fragile than these little chips.<p>- Not as fragile as hard drive type. You can drop one of these chips and not scratch it. I wouldn't stomp on one with my foot, nor get one in water, but they are encased in plastic. Ruggedish.<p>- Batteries last for like two days. There isn't much going on here, no moving parts, no laser or hard drive to put power to. Most of these flash Memory types have a single AA battery. I use a rechargeable type, so we are talking very low cost here.<br>In comparison to the hard drive types, where you will get a solid 8 hours of playing, this really whupps up.<p>- Size. Small. Very small. Mine is three inches by three inches. A square. But, you can get smaller ones. And the memory chips that go in them are the same ones you use for your camera. And you can put files on them. If you want to put a word doc on your memory chip, you can. Your Mp3 won't recognize it, but it is nifty storage.<p>COMPARISON/CONTRAST<p>- Size does matter. In the case of hard drive Mp3 players... lets face it, you can, if you so chose to, put a library of congress on these monsters. They are the caddilacs of the hand held devices, and guzzle batteries like gasoline. But when it comes down to it, size is the only thing they have going for them. I don't mean to downplay the hard drive types, but don't drop them, don't shake them, and after shelling out $499 to Apple you might consider insurance. Apple doesn't care about you or your apple after 10 days of ownership. <p>- Price/Komparison. IPOD ran me $499 bucks. My memorex MP3 player ran me 45 dollars. The 128 memory chip runs you 50 bucks. Owch. There really isn't a comparison to the two. The memory stick Mp3 players just kick ? on this issue. And, you get MORE than a ten day return policy, since you buy these things at Target/Wal Mart etc... <p>So, that is my review in a nutshell

<Title>Great player, obtuse manual
<Date>Fri Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received my player just a few days ago and have enjoyed using it tremendously.  Once you load your songs, it's simple to use and the sound is quite good.  That being said, actually getting the songs from your computer (or CD, etc.) to the player requires some intuitive computer wizardy.  The included manual provides the same amount of assistance in this area as, say, reading the rules of golf will help lower your score.  It's just not a useful item.  Still, I recommend the player to anyone who is comfortable enough with the idea of an MP3 player - just be prepared to spend 30-45 minutes learning how to navigate.  The included software is quite good, and once you get the hang of it, it's very easy.  Downloading from the 'net works fine, too.  Playback has been great through running, working out, and mountain biking.  Finally, I have 42 songs on my playlist, with room for probably another 15-20.  Compare that to how many CD's you'd need to carry!

<Content>Great little player, but it DOESN'T PLAY WMAs.  I bought this for my wife for christmas because one of the reviews said that he got it to work with WMAs.  Well, you can load WMAs onto it, but the player will not recognize or play them.  There is no firmware upgrade at this time, so be prepared to use MP3s if you buy this product.

<Title>Slick MP3 Player well worth it!
<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ok, I am a computer veteran who has about 400 MP3 files and finally decided to get a player for the gym.  I compared all models, like the RIOs etc and decided on this one. Great choice!  I went for the 256mb one and it is the only way to go.  I have over 45 songs in my playlist and it works flawlessly.  I would strongly recommend this unit to anyone who wants to get a player.  Its simple to use and very intuitive.  Here's the 2 shortcomings I do have (I have to nitpick):<p>1&gt; the ear buds while OK are simply not long enough to really use if you want to clip it on your waist.  I dont like ear buds anyway so I use my Sony over the ear phones instead.  <p>2&gt; downloading songs to the unit is very easy.  Arranging and re-arranging the song order with the included software once downloaded is cumbersome and tricky though.  Not to worry though, once you figure out how to do it, its workable, but that first couple of times, it is frustrating!  Once done, its OK.<p>Thats it! Bottom line:  Great unit well worth the cost! I would recommend to anyone, novice to expert, and even plan to buy a few more for my wife and Dad shortly.  Hope this helps. Enjoy!

<Title>No, it does not support WMA, only MP3
<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Disregard all the misleading statements in the Amazon product site and customer reviews.  I spent a good day on this and confirmed with the Digitalway tech support: this player will only play MP3.  The firmware is not upgradeable.<p>Quality is excellent, even on the lower bitrate MP3s and the volume is very good.  It will block outside noise even at half the maximum.  The neck strap and earbuds cord is pretty short, but it is designed specifically to reach from the arm or the neck to your ears.  <p>One problem with the setup is that the belt clip (which is designed to stay on the included armband) will not hold the player securely.  You can easily shake the player out of the clip.  But, when you wear the clip on the armband, unless you are doing flips, it will stay.<p>One good thing is the point where earphones connect to the player is secured with a part of the neckstrap, so there is no chance of messing up that fragile connection.<p>For software, I recommend checking out FPIO at http://hem.passagen.se/frasknas/ which removes "the file upload back to PC" restrictions and adds a very nifty WinAmp plugin.  Also has volume normalization.  (Once again, don't worry about any of the WMA features; this player will not play it).<p>Real One Player support was shaky; I had to restart several times to configure the download.  But the good thing is that Real One Player will re-encode your playlist to a lower bitrate as you download it to the player.

<Title>maybe it is me... maybe it is not
<Date>Mon May 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i purchased this mp3 player from best buy recently.  i had read reviews about installation problems w/ this player and i thought it can't be that hard.  well anyhow, after trying it on three different computers w/ windows XP pro and windows 2000, i can say that i will stay away from MPIO.  i downloaded the latest drivers and program from their website and every occasion, it either restarted the computer when i turned on the layer, or the program will lock up.  when it locks up, you will need to take the battery out to restart it.  i attempted to try and reach tech. support to resolve the issue, however the website is useless.  the latest drivers/progams does not work.  remember, i have used this on three different computers and i even read the instructions before i installed it and on all three computer i experienced the same problem of freezing, crashing my os, or not being able to transfer file.  at times, my computer did not even recognize the mp3 player.<p>however, i was able to transfer one song, and from that one song, the sound was really good.  it was loud and clear.  not much noise/static.  overall, the build quality seems to be on par w/ the other leaders in the industry.  the lcd screen is another plus for the player.  very bright and asthetically pleasing.<p>even w/ the positives, i can't get this to work.  maybe it was my fault, but to be honest, i tried many different ways, and just didn't seem to want to work.  i guess i could have exchanged for another one, but that was not comforting to know that it broke already.  anyhow, i returned it for a full refund.  if you decide to buy it, i hope you will have a better experience w/ it that i did.

<Title>DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DEVICE
<Date>Wed Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It plays music just fine- it's getting music to download to this MP3 player that's the problem.<p>I am a computer programmer, builder and consultant.  I know computers.  This device fails to recognize when you plug it into the USB port.  When you do locate drivers, it then fails to recognize in windows media player.  Necesitating the download of their MPIO Manager 2 from their website, or from the CD.<p>Now - your problems are just starting.<p>When you actually do get it to connect, expect multiple hangs, failures, and other problems.<p>Downloading songs will be a trial of hit and miss.  It's almost like this thing can't take more than 2 or 3 megs of data before hanging.  I'll get 1 or 2 songs loaded, and then it will just stop.  <p>I have (after much trial and failed uploads to the MP3 player) updated to the latest firmware, and I have downloaded and installed the latest software and plug-ins. <p>None seem to get this MP3 player working.<p>RUN- don't walk away from this player.

<Title>Extremely pleased!
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As a female, I would rate myself slightly above average in understanding technology and appreciating new gadgets. I bought my first MD (not MP3) player about three years ago.  Like any techy fanatic, I considered it outdated and wanted something smaller with more memory.  I did a lot of research and,at first, was hesitant to buy this product because of some not-so-great reviews from other customers and because of the popularity of the IPOD.  In the end, for $100 less, I took a chance and bought it.  (Afterall, it is much &quot;cuter&quot; than the IPOD!)  It took a total of 15 minutes from me taking the player out of the box to putting the earphones on and listening to my music!!  The only cons I've noticed so far are the instruction manual and the belt clip/case.  The manual reads as if it was a literal translation from another language but is still understandable.  The case slides on but does not &quot;snap&quot; into place and, with a quick shake, can fall off rather easily.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product, it's memory, it's ease of use, and the speed at which the MP3's downloaded.

<Title>A pretty piece...but too many snags.
<Date>Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This little gem (just look at the design) serves its functions well, and plays mp3's flawlessly. The sound is amazing, sometimes overly so, magnifying the scratchy static background noise of poor quality music. It's pretty impressive how they've enabled so many functions to so few buttons. The casing is silver, with a purple pearly button, and the LCD display's colors match the color scheme. Along with the attractive player come some nice accessories. The necklace style headphones are unique, although just short of the armband and beltclip. The player is actually held in place on the armband by the beltclip. And best of all, it's can store just shy of 60 songs for me. Not bad for 256 mb.   HOWEVER, before you get too excited about this little digital masterpiece, there were several bugs to be aware of. The player does NOT play wma files, rendering half my library non-portable. After looking on MPIO's support site (apparently the DMK earned its very own FAQ), it said to format the internal memory with the software. After doing so, the player STILL fails to play wma files. Nice help, MPIO. And speaking of software, that's the most frustrating part of the music storing process. The CD comes with version 1.5, which helps download the music onto the player with ease. Or so it seems. If you try downloading or erasing multiple files (and sometimes just a single file), the program freezes on you. Again, according to MPIO's download site, there's an updated version (1.7.0.0) that will eliminate this problem. Except the link doesn't work. The program doesn't download. I attempted to Google it and found version 1.8 on the Korean website. The glitch is still there, and I find myself unplugging and replugging my USB cable once again. This is extremely nerve grinding and disappointing. I'm crossing my fingers that they'll fix it (once again).  Overall, DMK is a pretty piece that will appeal to those looking for an eye-catching player that will hold just enough songs for enough variety that will last you a while. As for the bugs, they don't outweigh the pros, but if MPIO doesn't fix them with an upgrade soon, I'll be looking elsewhere when shopping for my next gadget.

<Title>Be Warned: 256MB does not support .wma files as advertised!
<Date>Wed Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Be careful, I had a bad experience...the advertisment for this 256MB player states that it accomodates .wma files, unlike the 128MB.  Not true in my case.  I use windows media player and therefore purchased this player so that i could easily use .wma, and not have to convert to .mp3.  Well, i was wrong and now feel totally misled.  It took nearly three frustrating days to figure what was wrong and why it wouldn't play .wma files.  The product manual is very basic and not very helpful as there is no troubleshooting mention at all for the file format feature.  I tried contacting the manufacturer by email and no response. I did notice, however, on the message board for the manufacturer's website that many other consumers were frustrated by the same problem.  On the bright side, I still like the physical features of the player, so I decided to keep it and just use .mp3 files, despite the inconvenience.  (I live outside the U.S. and I didn't want to be burdened with the process of having to send it back).  To solved the 'no .wma' issue, I purchased software to convert my .wma files to .mp3. The bottom line here is that it seems this product has a lot of r&amp;d technology invested in it, but falls short in the area of customer support and marketing.  They promised .wma file support, but didn't deliver...and that caused a lot of disappointment, frustration, and wasted time trying to figure out the problem and fix.

<Content>I love this little thing. I've had no problem with it at all. It's small, it's relatively reliable, and it can take a beating. I even dropped it in a sink of water. With a week to dry out, it was fine.<p>However, the manual is horrible. It is a total candidate for engrish.com! It's obviously translated from another language and it isn't done very well. It took me a week to realise I could actually depress the RW&gt;FF button to get to a whole new menu.<p>The software it comes with is really easy to use, I find. However, actually installing it is a bit confusing, and I hate their flash layout. They've tried to be hip and flashy, and that's all good and such - unless you have to use it frequently, or have a PC which can't handle flash well.<p>Otherwise, I give this product a 4 - they lost a point for their crappy software and crappy manual.

<Title>WMA do not work.  Plug ins to use player only.
<Date>Mon Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have no tracks through my Windows Media Player.  It's because my songs are in WMA format and although it looked like it was loading into the DMK, it never showed up.  I finally tried using MP3 files and was able to load, see tracks , and play them.  DMK contrary to what others say, is not WMA compatible.  It allows for a Windows Media Player plug-in which means you can use Windows instead of the MPIO manager program.  But if all your music in Windows Media Player is WMA then you're out of luck.  I like the player and got a good deal at Best Buy but it would have been better if it was WMA compatible.  If anyone knows different, I am curious to find out.

<Date>Sun Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this player for my 10 year old daughter, after shopping fairly extensively.  She had burned through 3 cd players and they never seemed to last.  I picked this mp3 player, because it was about as easy to use as it gets.  Not a lot of frills, but gets the job done.  Holds more than enough songs for my daughter, and I got a really significant rebate. Comes with enough accessories that make it really portable.  My daughter prefers the wraparound style headphones to the earbuds provided.  Too early to say how long it will last, but so far rock solid.  OT: I wish there was one with an AM receiver as my daughter likes to listen to Disney.

<Title>A good product but read this before you purchase it  !!!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been using the 256 meg version of the player for over a year now. Its main use for me is when I go to the health club 3 time a week to work out. It hangs from cloth band around my neck which is really convenient. I'm basically happy with it for it performs quite well for its size. However, there are a few details you should consider before to purchase it.<br>1. <br>The advertised battery life of 11 hours is a basic lie. I never got more than 6 intermittent hours on a Duracell Ultra AAA battery and since I've installed an additional 256 meg of memory (total memory=512 meg) the battery life is down to about 4 hours. Still,,, this does not bend me out of shape<br>2.<br>The software that comes with it (MPIO Manager 2.0) really lacks the control that you need. The playlist feature is next to useless so I choose to upload files directly from their folders without using a playlist.(I, therefore, am not able to reproduce the exact download for future use). Real Player does work with the FL100 on a limited basis. It only recognizes the root directory and will not see any subdirectories. This is not good if you want to pick from the middle of the list of 512 meg of music.<br>3.<br>The FL100 a little weak on power/amplification but if you consider its size you probably need to be somewhat forgiving here. <br>Overall I like the FL100. It serves it purpose well. If anyone knows of some better software that works with the FL100 please drop me a note.<p>Thanks...

<Date>Wed Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 player worked for only a few weeks.  The second time I tried to add music to it my relatively new Windows XP computer would not recognize the device when it was attached via USB.  The MPIO website had several fixes, none of which worked.  Their final recommendation was to use another operating system such as Windows 2000 or ME.  It is nice and small and had good sound when it did work.  It seems to be a very unreliable device based on comments on the manufacturer's website and my experience.  I would not recommend it; it has been a big disappointment.  The manual was very brief and offered no solutions to my problem.  The website was full of grammatical errors and looked like it was translated from Korean by a translating program.  I am returning it and finding another well known product instead.

<Title>As a new owner of my first MP3 player...this one is ok.(Revised)
<Date>Sun Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the DMK 128 player because when I was looking through all the options, it was the player that seemed to have the best reviews.  It was also the right price and size so I didn't look much farther.  Imagine my suprise when I came back later and the number of negative reviews had doubled.  So, as I sat playing with my player, I felt I had better put in my two cents.  I love my MPIO.  It is the perfect size for what I use it for, working out.  It includes a arm band and holder which also works just fine.  The head sets are nice as well, with neck band and all.  For such a small package, the MPIO pumps out a amazing amount of sound, with a max of 30 and a usual setting of 10.  So if you really want to bleed your ears, this can do it for you.  The battery is a AAA and it doesn't last all that long but it is long enough.  Besides, if any of you are like me, you have hundreds of AAA laying around that you have never used.  Plus, its an AAA so finding a good rechargable isn't immpossible.    The MPIO is simple to use almost to the point of being idiot proof.  Its got one toggle switch, a start stop button and volume controls.  Other than that there is a "hold" toggle amd not much more.  Yet with these few controls you can easily scan through music, change play mode and Equalizer settings as well as how the display...displays.  The manual is brief and to the point but not terribly amazing.  You can figure out what needs to be done but not much more.  Basically the controls are intuitive.  Now for some negatives.  The actual putting of music into the MPIO is a little annoying.  The included software is sparse without a doubt.  Listening to the music you are going to download can be done but the feature is lacking somewhat.  For instance, you must first download a songf into a play list before you can play it, rather then being able to play anything in the folder.  Its a small thing but an annoyance all the same.  I also experienced the occasional crash of the program while downloading songs.  Its easy to fix but annoying all the same.  There is also no "find music" option to get all your music in one place.    They say there is a flash card that can be added for more room.  128mb is about 30 songs give or take so its not as if there isn't plenty to hear.  If you use songs downloaded by Windows Media Player, you can get double the number i.e. sixty songs.  As for the card, I want to buy the thing but I cannot for the life of me figure out where the thing plugs in.  Just another small thing.  Over all, I am very happy I bought this device.  I looked around a bit and it seemed to be the best for the price.  I wish I could say what other players might be better but all I can say is...this one works just fine.   As of 2006  And if anyone still reads about the DMK, I need to say... I got MPIO manager to work for me.  Not perfectly, not even well, but it worked.  Hundreds of times. It froze, it locked up and it crashed but my music made it on.  And so did the WMA's when I used the plug in ad ONLY WMA's.  This player cannot have both on it, which is totally unexplained but never thel less true.  Why I am luckier with my DMK than most I don't know.  Maybe I actually installed the requisite PLUG IN that is on the disk.  Maybe my comp is just different.  But with MPIO on the financial rocks, these players are now UBER cheap and, if you are savy enough with technology, you can make it work for you, like my girlfirend did.

<Title>Nice Little Player
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>So far, I've had this mp3 player for about a month now and have come to a few conclusions. I hope it helps you decide if this product is for you.<p>Small, light weight, cool looking and comes with a headphone necklace that you can wear around your neck or a armbelt and holder if you want to wear it some place else. If you don't plan on wearing it around your neck, then you'll have to invest in another pair of headphones with a longer cord. The sound quality is not bad, not brilliant either, it comes with 5 equalizer pre-settings, but none of which you can personally change. Does not have random/shuffle which would of made this product more appealing.  I have purchased rechargeable batteries (Energizer NiMH) and a BIG problem with it is that the battery end is flat on the negative terminal (unlike regular batteries with a notch on the center) which makes inserting and removing the battery very DIFFICULT. I almost had to break open the player, but decided that it wasn't worth damaging since it is new. Now, I have to put a ribbon underneath the battery so that I can change the battery. The battery that came with it does not get stuck. I don't know if other people have had this problem, but my recommendation is to watch out for flat ended batteries as they would get stuck. Software is relatively straight forward. Nice thing about ripping mp3's off the CD is that you can select the bit rate, so you can either get better sound quality or more music on to the player. In my engineering courses, anything more than 128 is undetectable, not unless you're a super audiophile that wants the best, although if that is what you are looking for that, then you might want to consider another player with a higher S/N ratio (this one is 85db; there are others that are higher). Lastly, with my rechargeable batteries, I think I get around 5 hrs worth of music, with regular batteries you'll definitely get more, but since it only has 256MB which is about 65 songs, that is a pretty good life.

<Title>Great product for the money

<Content>I saw this deal a week ago and I finally decided to go for it. This little mp3 player is doing a good job. Many functions. I especially like the idea of having 2 earphones in the set, although the second one is pretty weak. The earphone is not great, comparable to Sennheiser PMX 60, which is a low-end product of Sennheiser. However, for the price, this is very decent. I am going to get better earphones for this baby.

<Title>Lifespan 3 Weeks

<Content>I bought 2 DIgitalway/MPIO players and searched for a deal because the iPOD is just beyond my budget.  I bought this little 128mb player for my son and a 256 mb for myself. I really like the FM because my gym transmits the TV over FM.  They were fantastic, clever little devices until about 3-4 weeks, when both of our buttons quit responding.  It was as if the hold button was stuck on, so you got no response from ANY of the controls.  The only moving parts on the device failed.  I returned them for a full refund at BestBuy.  I would definitely NOT recommend  Digitalway/MPIO.  I've heard people have much better luck with IRiver.

<Title>For people having trouble with this player
<Date>Thu Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>OK I do not have the 256mb player I have the 128mb.  That said I have read numerous reviews of people complaining about not getting any songs downloaded to their player.  This happened to me, I was trying to download a bunch of WMA. format file onto my mp3 player.  I thought it would read them but it wouldn't play them even though it showed up on the manager that I had downloaded in the player.  I looked for a solution instead of just giving up and complaining online about it.  If you go to Realplayer Jukebox, or download it like I had to, you can go to the Burn/Transfer page.  If you go their you have to ENCODE the wma files into MP3 format.  It is kind of annoying because each time you encode files it'll delete the current playlist you have but it takes like 3 minutes to delete and recreate a newer playlist so that doesn't bother me.  Overall I think that even though I paid 50 bucks for my 128 I would've easily paid 100 for it new.  Thanks

<Content>I got this with my own money in january.. Pretty good sounds, can fit about 40 songs on there.  WMA format doesn't work, but I just transferred my songs to real player, no biggie.  I really enjoy this sturdy piece of work and I hope you do too!  BTW&lt; the light is a darker purple, almost a blue.  Everything else is as pictured :).

<Content>The player is great...Could use more volume though...The only downfall on the player is the User manual it is really vague and the web site is hard to use.  I love the size of the player and the necklace headset

<Title>PURCHASE THIS if you want an mp5 player for working out!
<Date>Sat May 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This mp3 player is PERFECT for exercising at the gym or outside.  It's one of the smallest players out there.  It's cheap.  It's durable.  It has great sound. It's easy to use.  It holds about 30 songs, which is the perfect amount for a 1-1.5 hour workout.  I cannot find any flaw with this player, except that the company needs to hire a better translator for the instruction guide. :)  Definitely a BEST BUY!
