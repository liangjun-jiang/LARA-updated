<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It was a gift for my nephew, 17yrs. old. So far he seems to love the whole thing. He says it holds more than enough music, its controls were very easy to learn and use. I would recommend this product/item to everyone who has a teenager as well as everyone who loves music at their fingertips in an MP3 player.

<Content>Pros: Easy set up..easy song and pic transfer..lcd screen has excellent quality..transfering songs can be done numerous ways..ie...software..WMP..drag and drop in explorer..sound quality is very good  Cons: doesn't have the ability to make a playlist without connecting to the PC..supplied headphones sounded very good but where a bit large and hard to get to stay in my ears(I suggest Koss "the Plug" or Koss "the Sparkplug" earbuds

<Content>I think this player works very well.  The sound is great!  It holds songs and photos! You can back up a digital camera to it if you want to get your files off the memory card, but don't have a computer!    I have few minor problems with this.  The first is that there does not seem to be a way to delete pictures from the player; you have to install the Gigabeat Room software and open the photo viewer to delete pictures.  Very cumbersome, and this is not explained in the manual.  The second problem is that when you play in random mode, you cannot "reverse the track" to get any previous track played.  These are the only problems I have, otherwise I think this is a fine player.  You can bookmark, which I assume is for audio books, although I have not done this.  The graphics are wonderful.  I do not regret the decision to buy this player, and I am glad I have it!

<Title>Great MP3 Player, but be careful where you buy online!
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this unit for my son at Christmas. It is really a nice player, not too large and of sturdy construction.  I would give it five stars, but it does have a few quirks with regard to the software.  The problems are minor though.  It also does not immediately dock and power on when you plug into the dock, another minor annoyance.  Also, the headphones can be rated no more than 3 stars by themselves. Still, for the money offered currently here on Amazon the Gigabeat 10gb represents real value.  I would just caution to make sure you are purchasing from a reputable online dealer. Tiger Direct and their rebate partner BDI Laguna Corporation (ESend) have been sitting on my $50 rebate now (it shows as legitimate on the status site) for close to 4 months. ESend does not respond at all and Tiger Direct while prompt in their responses are truely incapable of helping their customers resolve the problem quickly.  When it comes to rebates, stick with reputable outfits or play it completely safe and just go with the low prices at Amazon.  I know I will not be purchasing from Tiger Direct again.  Fool me once...

<Title>nice for a time.
<Date>Wed Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have has this player for about two months. its a great player but, the software that it comes with is horrible! and even with windows media player its very hard to load music on. when you are going through the songs  on it you could feel the hardrive move in your hand. its not really a down side but i found it to be surprize. after about a month of music playing. the music on it started to skip horribly! Just like a scratched cd. but on the other hand its very durable. i dropped it about 10 feet.it still works great. (the skipping started way before i dropped it) the only visable damage was a little chip in the corner. there is no accessories. you could try to piggyback some of the ipod accessories. and it always feels like it could just snap in half if you look at it wrong. the picture viewer is nice, but you dont really need it. could use a fm tunner bad! the earbuds that come with  are huge and stick out of of your ears. the 10 gigabites are quite nice to load your whole music collection on. i wouldn't mind the draw backs if it was a little cheaper. i sold my ipod mini for this, thinking that i was getting a great player. i was very dissapointed.   so if your in the market for a mp3 player i would go for a ipod. right now the online apple store has a refrbished mini for $150.

<Title>Alright Value
<Date>Tue Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm the kind of guy who listens to his MP3 Player constantly.  More than 6 hours a day.  This product is alright and is not really worth the money.   Pros: Pictures and music.  Plays both WMA and MP3.  Nice screen and easy to use. Sound quality is alright  Cons: The Gigaroom(software) sucks and is not as good as Musicmatch and iTunes.  The casing is easily broken.  Can't make playlists on the player.  Can't look at playlist with out going to the main menu.  It's annoying and an iPod or even a Dell Jukebox will be worth more of your money.  Just do your research and be careful what you buy.

<Title>Costly mistake
<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was unable to get the software for transferring music to this device to work properly.  After several frustrating episodes, I ordered Windows XP so that I could use Microsoft Windows Media Player 10 which, according to the documentation, could also be used.  It made no difference.  Thankfully, Amazon allowed me to return the product.  Overall, the experience was very frustrating and costly.  I paid a 20% re-stocking fee because I did not return it within 30 days and I paid $188 for XP.  As a final note, I find XP to be considerably more cumbersome than the Windows 2000 I replaced.  Not an experience I care to repeat.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great, simple mp3 player.  I don't mean simple as in it's features because it has some that an IPOD doesn't have, but simple as in easy to use.  It took me 5 minutes to download the software, get it hooked up and started ripping cds. I am a busy parent and to me, I-tunes is just way too much work.  With this, you put in a cd, push a button on the docking cradle and that's it, it does the rest.

<Title>Careful
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Not someplace I would buy from again.  The product does not work as described.  We have attempted to contact the seller.  The phone only has answering machine for a message and they NEVER return the calls.  We contacted Toshiba and they sent new discs and everything to try and fix the machine and then told us to return it to the seller.  We are STILL trying to do that with NO SUCCESS.  "Beware"
