<Title>Touchy, but ok for light use

<Content>I actually own the identical 128mb version of this mp3 player I purchased for 18 dollars on sale.  This little system has serious limitations on what it can play.  It claims windows media files, which I have mixed luck with, but strait mp3 files are ok.  Napster is about the only download system that can work with it (unless there is encrypting, which I have found problemsome with some other MP3 sites). Beyond that, it does lock up occasionally. My use is to rip cd's i have to mp3, then upload this for my wife to jog with, works great for that, and that's all I need if for. for serious users, look elsewhere.

<Content>I received this player last Christmas and it has served its purpose, EXCEPT the little batery covery is flimsy and cheap, breaking and no longer staying on without tape. It not on snugly, the player will not work. So, I usggest getting a player that is more sturdy for kids, or if you are going to be using it daily as I use mine.
