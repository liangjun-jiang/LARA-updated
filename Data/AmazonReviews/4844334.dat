<Title>Decent, not great
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for the water-resistant function (rain killed my other mp3 player) and the price. After a few weeks, here are my experiences:  - I prefer belt clip to arm band; band and the length of player can chafe some. Not alot but noticeable - probably a personal preference. - No off button is frustrating. Seems to die in my gym bag. - Sony software is a pain. No drag-and-drop directly into folder like other players. - Controlling player while running is easy ONLY if you are just skipping songs. Otherwise, you have to stop, take off the band and muddle your way through to perform other functions. - Charging via USB adds extra hassle, vs. simple battery.  Overall, once it's loaded, strapped on, and playing, it sounds good while exercising. And it's easy to skip song. BUT getting there is a bit of pain.

<Title>Great so far!
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this player because I wanted a lightweight, water resistant player with an armband for use primarily during exercise.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the additional features-- lots of play options (shuffle within playlist, play all, etc.), FM tuner, "hold" position (inactivates buttons).  In addition, the sound quality is good and the armband is comfortable and secure.  The earbuds (which I think many people would choose to replace with their own), hook over the back of the ears-- I have used this player for multi-hour workouts without having the buds fall out or be damaged (so far) by sweat.  Great exercise player for the price!

<Title>Good value - one flaw
<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the sound quality and the cool features of the device.  It is a great value for your money.  My only complaint is with the headphones.  They sound great, BUT, they just won't stay in place.  They don't fall off my ears, but they do get out of place which makes it hard to hear the music and makes me adjust them every few hundred yards.  If the headphones were to stay put in my ears through the run, this player would have gotten 5 stars from me.

<Title>Excellent accept few things
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i purchased this item nearly 1 month ago. Really amazing player but there are some points that makes make me give 4 star.  First - You have to use a cable for access via USB. Second - You have to use SonicStage(Very annoying program) for adding music to the player and can't even delete the music file without SonicSage.  you may consider this before buying it. But these are the only bad things i can say about this product. Very successful product indeed.

<Title>works great
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am not techno savvy, but this worked out okay.  I didn't see the problem with the software, it works fine.  I use it to mow, to run, to lift weights, to do anything, really, and no problems.  I sweat very heavily - embarrasingly so - but it has not caused any problems for this unit which was my concern.  The FM receiver works better than bigger radios I have wasted money on.  Overall, a good product.  It did not come with the belt clip, but the armband works fine and is big enough.  Pleased with my purchase.

<Title>Awesome!!! blows the stupid Ipod away
<Date>Wed Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only thing that is bad about this thing is the software you use to download music. But once you figure out to work that, it is really not a problem. Software doesn't seem to work with Windows XP media center version. I love the FM, mp3, stopwatch all-in-one feature. It is a very cool design. The headphones look ugly but I think they are the best when it comes to comfort. Other headphones hurt my ears after a while. This just hangs on my ear and is very comfortable. I love this MP3 player

<Content>Amazing player. The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of its accompanying software. It's a bit cumbersome to use. But the player itself is a piece of beauty. Looks great, plays great.

<Title>Sony Should Keep Atrac/Connect. Why only use MS/Apple
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 2GB Hipstreet MP3/WMA player for 29.95 (locally).  After two months, screen stopped working.  I was told I if you have weight on any of them, they will stop working.  I did have a bag with two beach towels and nothing else on it. That day, this Sony player was 69.95.  I went back two days laters (I was told I could just bring back the other one and they would replace it free of charge--no go they changed and said I have to send HipStreet to manufacturer.  Now price of Hipstreet is 59.95). Now this Sony was 39.95.  This model was 1GB which worried me, since what I do with it is to convert Pimsleur language tapes on CD to WMAS and listen to them when I walk my poodle twice a day.  This needs a lot of memory. I have found, however, that the Sony-specific format called ATRAC actually takes less space than WMA and has a better-sound quality (not really that important for language sound files  anyway).  I downloaded the latest version of Sonic Stage Software, 2nd week of September,2007.  Now it is version 4.3. I like it WAY better than Windows Media Player. Why should I be forced to use Microsoft or Apple products (iPOD and iTunes).  Sony has something called Connect to compete with iTunes. They will be shutting it down in March 2008.  I think this is a serious mistake. The new players do NOT use ATRac as far as I can tell and will only use WMA/MP3 just like all the cheap brands.  The cheap brands mostly use replaceable AA batteries, not the internal one irreplaceable one that this Sony player has.  So the advantage of using both ATRAC format and being water-resistant over not having an easily replaceable battery will be lost.  Someone has a complaint that this player's battery does not last on a recharge as long as another Sony player from two years previous. But that guy did not read all the reviews. If that player had gotten it wet from sweat, it would have stopped working.  I am not a technofreak---I do not use Linux as, according to the tech columnist for the Wall Street Journal, it still is not as easy to use as Windows XP or Mac OS X (or whatever Apple has now). But why should I be forced to stick to WMA formats (Windows Media Audio) to get compression size down to 1/2 of MP3.  Or why should I be forced to buy an iPOD using proprietary software.  My son has one of these, and we do have the software to convert it, but my point is that Sony has a good product and a good software product that, in my opinion, is the superior to Windows Media player for CD/WMA/MP3 conversion, at least in it latest incarnation, Sonic Stage 4.3. This is again a serious mistake by Sony.  I actually did a report in a business class, listing the mistakes that Sony has made over and over and will probably repeat again (PS3--using BluRay, losing out completely with BetaMax, going to lose high-end laptop market to indestructible Lenovos and Panasonics, just as they did with desktop computers when they became commoditized).  Sony has here a unique and unusual product. They always do, but now they are changing the MP3 product line to one just like all the other ones. Serious mistake. Have you seen their new egg-shaped MP3 player, no headphones, shaped like an egg, only 1GB, going on sale for 350 dollars in Japan?  Another mistake.  At least they seem to be getting it right with their LCD monitors, partnering with Samsung. Also will lose the market of LCD-HDTVs eventually to Toshiba which has a much superior product to anything else in the market that is tied up in a legal dispute.  Sony..please keep both Connect and Sonic Stage/Atrac--to NOT do so will just be another mistake.

<Title>There are much better products on the market
<Date>Sat Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Rechargeable battery is good as is the 'shuffle control'. Unfortunately this  product comes with the aweful SonicStage software which HAS to be used. I bought the Walkman for running with but the supplied headfones have a very poor fit. Rather get a competitors product where you aren't bound to SonicStage software (I had a Creative before this and regret not getting another Creative)!

<Title>Confused
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Since I bought this off amazon, I've only been using the radio.  I know that you need to use Sonicstage to upload songs, but what format do the songs have to be in to keep from skipping/clicking?  I've tried; mp3, atrac 3, and I've tried every bit rate in these formats.  Does anyone know what I have to do to get the music to play smoothly?  Other than that, the radio's sweet and it's shaped like a little cigar.

<Content>this product is released by Sony last year(i'm not quite clear about this, overall it's just released not long ago). Generally speaking, nice design, nice audio quality and good performance for sporting men.   One point I'd like to point out is that it can adjust to your walk/run pace, playing different EQ music, i think that's great!

<Title>Nice looks. Okay operation.
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Hello All ... First of all, if you already have this product, be happy. Its nice, with some nice features. Let me list the good points. 1. Its has cool looks. Flaunt it !! 2. The G-Sensor is cool. Counts steps n calories burnt. Shake n shuffle is a nice option. No need to push buttons !! 3. Has a custom equilizer.(no surprise though). 4. The wrist band comes with it. Real usefull for joggers / gymers. 5. The sports mode plays fast songs automatically.  Thats all I guess ...  now the real stuff, that the buyer want ...   1. Battery life is average. may need charging frequently than u thought. Only USB charge is possible. so need to have a PC or then buy a Plugable USB charger. 2. Needs Sonic Stage to put files in and out. The software has some restrictions on the number of PCs used. (I AM not sure). 3. The headphones that come with them are PATHETIC ... God knows why would they provide such low quality head phones. 4. The rotating switch need both the hands to operate, one to hold the base and the other to rotate the switch. One hand operation is possible, but then its difficult to see the display.

<Content>Great player for people who exercise.  The use and sound are great and the SonicStage software is easy to use.  The people that are complaining about the software either shouldn't own new-age electronics or should become more software savvy before using it because I had it up and running in seconds.  You have to be smarter than the equipment you're operating!
