<Title>Superior to the ipod in many ways
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First off, this mp3 player has excellent sound quality, far superior to any ipod i have listened to.  Also, this product's display screen is very large with excellent resolution.  This mp3 player is very thin with a glossy front, and the touch pad controls look very nice.  The looks practicly sell this product by themselves.  It also comes with bluetooth, which i have not used yet My only complaints about this samsung t10 is it's menu style and user interface.  This is were apple has the advantages.  For the menu style, you have three choices on how it is displayed, none of which work very well for me.  I prefer to have my menu in a list format(like on ipods) as opposed to this samsung where you have to flip to a new screen for each selection(music, movies, photos, etc). The control pad arrows on the t10 are nowhere near as good as an ipod's scroll wheel.  Ipod's scroll wheel allows you to move quickly and precisely whereas the t10's arrow keys are slow and sometimes inaccurate.   Those are my only complaints Overall, the samsung t10 beats the apple ipod in audio quality, design, and bluetooth capability.  It looses in UI and menu style.  I reccomend the t10 over the ipod.

<Title>SAMSUNG PLAYERS ARE THE BEST
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the Samsung T10, P2, and I just ordered the S5. Samsung's players are by far the best players out there - I can't stop buying them all!  Way better than the IPOD. Apple is just a monopoly. With the Samsung players you can use anything to download music, you are not limited to "just ITunes" like Apple. You can download unlimited songs for $14 a month instead of $1 a song like ITunes. IPODs do not compare.

<Title>T-10 Shuffle Problem
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought our daughter a T10 for Christmas.  Our son got a T9 last year and liked it so we figured the T10 would be even better.  It seems neat, has lots of nice options and sounds good BUT the big problem our daughter is experiencing is with the shuffle function.  It plays the same songs over and over in the same order and does not play all songs.  We have contacted Samsung in search of a solution for the malfunction.  If there is not one we will have to return this product.  Does anyone have an idea how to correct the problem?

<Title>Nice player, great battery life, software lacking
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had this player for about 1 month now.  Have only used it for music so far.  Had issue getting one computer to recognize the player while a different computer had no issues.  Level I tech support was not very helpful (wanted the player sent back for repair even though it was a Windows problem), and level II support quite knowledgeable (make sure you have the .net updates installed - they ask you to install all optional Windows updates).  It was nice to actually have a real person answer the tech support phone # with very short wait.  I had wanted to get a Sansa, but could not understand why players purchased in the USA have no Asian language support, but if you buy a Sansa in say Hong Kong then you can buy it with Asian language support.  They also refuse to provide that option through firmware upgrade.  The T10 automatically displayed correctly the song names in my music library that were in Chinese.  Pros:  Great music quality great, and even better battery life (3 day car trip without recharging).  The player is stylish, small, and very lightweight.  Many ways to sync - using included software, Windows Media Player, or drag and drop from Explorer.  Cons:  No easy way to manage playlists.  If you create playlists in the included software, all songs in the playlist are transferred to the same folder.  Say you created 3 folders in the T10 to manage music, and a song happens to be in 2 playlists -> this song would be copied twice to the 2 folders.  Of course, this eats up memory fast.  Why use folders?  Because I like to organize my music, and also to avoid filename conflicts from older CD's which have ripped songs with filenames like 'track 1', etc.  Another feature that would be nice is to be able to play all songs in a genre or master folder, instead of having to drill down to the album and only playing that album.  For a long car trip, I would prefer that the T10 plays multiple albums without need of user intervention.  Miss the feature in iTunes where I could set up sync profiles to sync different set of songs to the iPOD depending on what portion of my library I wanted to take.  Recommendation:  Definitely a good player worth buying.

<Title>Very nice product.
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just recieved my T10 yesterday (2-6-08) from Amazon and I am really impressed.  I was immediately able to download music from Ruckus (yes, if you have ruckus this player WILL work!!!!) very easily.  Video was a little bit tricky at first, but overall it is just as easy.  I didn't love Samsung's download software, so I elected to use the direct link through Ruckus, which was no big deal to me at all.  All in all, it was very simple, if I can do it, anyone can!  The player itself is very nice and appears to be of high quality.  The screen is incredible, it has the quality of an HDTV only much, much smaller.  I find the touch controls to be very easy to use, inspite of my sausage-like fingers, and the software is intuative and easy to use (I have not had to read any directions yet, woo hoo!).  The USB charging system doesn't bother me at all since I am a student and spend the majority of my time on the computer anyway.    This is my third mp3 player, although the first with video capability, and it leaves my Rio and shuffle in the dust (for about the same price).  I really did not want to lay out $200 plus for a new Nano and I think the T10 is a wonderful alternative.  For me it's an easy 9.5/10.

<Content>I'll be the first to admit that I'm not an expert on MP3 players, but I have been very pleased with the Samsung T10 that I purchased, and I have no complaints.  My only suggestion would be to purchase the T10 with more memory....I believe there is at least an 8 GB version.

<Title>Compact, very easy to use and good sound
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this player for a couple of months now.  I have an iPod, but was looking for a player which used flash memory which could withstand a workout at the gym and general bashing around.    I don't like to be wedded to things like MP3 players and was keen to avoid either an iPod or a Zune.  Having to install proprietary software to transfer files is a completely unnecessary intrusion in my view.  With the little Samsung I use drag and drop in Windows Explorer and it does the rest.  I haven't tried the Samsung software so can't comment on it, but for me that's an ideal place to be  (in case you're wondering, for the iPod I use JRiver MediaCenter - iTunes, good though it may be, is a relationship I don't wish to be compelled to have).  Using the T10 is exactly how using an MP3 player should be.  There is one mechanical switch (combined power/lock), the rest of the controls being on a touch sensitive pad.   I was a little bit concerned about the sensitivity of the touch pad, it seeming to be very sensitive causing menu options to be skated through too quickly, however, I have become better used to it and can work it fine - definitely not for the heavy handed though.  The menu options are laid out very well, and getting to where you want to be is a breeze.  The screen is very clear and simply adds to the joy of using the player.  Sound quality?  Understand that this is a $100 player!  That said the sound quality is very good, better than a player at this price should be.  The earphones, however, are a different matter. These things should be consigned to that drawer where you keep paper clips and pens that don't work.  Sure, they'll do in an emergency, but they do not do this player any justice at all.  If you understand this and budget for a decent pair of headphones (I like the little Audio Technica ones) then you will not be disappointed.    One thing to note is that the Samsung uses a proprietary USB connection.  It'd be much better if it used a standard type (oh the irony of every manufacturer using their own 'standard')  I have the teensiest, weensiest complaint about this player.  Mine is piano black and it very easily shows up finger marks, hey but that's what shirts are for - a quick rub and it's back to shiny piano black again.  That aside this player is perfect.  In summary, it's not perfect: the headphones are hardly worth the cost of shipping them; a non-standard USB cable, and a piano black finish which needs to be buffed regularly! These minor grumbles aside this is as close to perfect as you will find today.  A brilliant little player, and well worth 5 stars.

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VQ3R44/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9201917-0062007">Samsung T10 4 GB Slim Portable Media Player (Black)</a>  I've just had "Sammy" a couple of days but I'm hooked. I purchased it solely for music but may play with some of the other features eventually.   It's not quite perfect:   * I haven't yet found a case for it (but a small $10 Case Logic case for a digital camera works fine for now);  * FM radio is a bit scratchy but I can live with it;  * There's a lanyard strap hole but no lanyard (what would it cost them?  4 cents?);  * It will only charge via the proprietary USB cable (but I'm not likely to spend 30 hours in the woods with it so it's no problem to recharge it).  But darn close: * Great design, seemingly sturdy, fun to just poke and discover all the features; * Intuitive - I'm no gear head and this is my first mp3 player but I managed to organize and load songs without consulting the online manual; * Easy navigation - folks complained that the screen on the T9 was too sensitive but I haven't had any problems with the T10 and find it easy to move around the menus; * Great sound, includes both preset and custom EQ settings.  I don't care for ear buds but several different headphones sound sweet; * The sample videos that it came with look great; * Nice price.  It's exactly what I wanted and more.  Very much recommended.

<Title>Excellent player for audio: free library eaudiobooks, radio and podcasts
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Other reviews (including a great review by Mariofrancis1 on youtube.com) have provided very useful information on this player.  The elements on which I found it more difficult to find information were the voice - audio elements of players. So, after testing the T10, here's how it performs on that score:  (i) fm radio - T10 finds stations automatically or manually with ease, but the autosearch is not as quick as that of the Zune. Many stations are crystal clear, but others are a little scratchy. Another player with fm radio is Sony, whose player also works well.  (ii) podcasts - No problems here. These can be set up via subscription so that the latest podcasts are downloaded automatically as soon as the player is connected to the laptop - at lightning speed - deleting the earlier casts, but not other files. The number of downloads per podcast can be individualized for each podcast for the last 2, 5, 10 (etc) feeds.    (iii) Playback of secure/protected WMA - I considered this element essential so that I could borrow free eAudiobooks from my local library (via Netlibrary) rather than pay to download them from commercial websites. Here the T10 performed well, although you do have to route your downloaded eAudiobook through Windows Media Player before transferring it to the T10. If you don't, the files remain locked and cannot be transferred to the player. The T10 also has a bookmarking function (not available on all WMA-compatible players), which means you can bookmark your Audiobook, go off to play some music and come back to the exact place on your Audiobook where you left off.  (iv) Long battery life - at 30-35 hours playback time, it should survive most intercontinental plane trips.   PS Note regarding netlibrary compatibility: iPod and Zune do not support the protected WMA. Sony sales reps (online and phone) provide conflicting advice re their A818 on this score. See this link for more on WMA- and bookmarking-compatible devices and how to use netlibrary. http://www.oclc.org/audiobooks/techspecs/devices.htm.

<Title>Why I love my new Samsung T10 MP3 player more than my iPods and iPhone
<Date>Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned almost 10 iPods, and afterall, they are iPods; you really can't beat them in terms of their user-interface, design and ease of use. On top of that, I barely have any complaint over the iPhone, it's the Jesus phone, for Christ's sake! (pun intended)  But then on my recent trip to HK, I picked up a Samsung T10 to hold some new music that I have ripped from my old CD collection. Because if you sync your iPhone with another computer, all the songs residing on the iPhone will be erased, so basically I just couldn't add new music to my iPhone and I wanted to get a budget MP3 player.  Anyway, I was overwhelmed by the features and qualities of the T10, besides the so so UI (Apple is better on this). First of all, the sound quality blows, really blows. The clarity is so much better than all the iPods I have ever owned. That said, I am using the same crappy Apple headphones. The bass is deep and vibrant. The T10 has an FM radio with auto presets, voice recording, Bluetooth connection to my BT stereo headphones which enables me to listen to music wirelessly. The best of all, is that you can record FM radio broadcast and the T10 instantly turns it into an MP3.  I am so giving up listening to my music on the iPods/iPhone for this little wonder.

<Title>Say no to nano, yes to T10!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The T10 supports audio in MP3, WMV, and also OGG formats. Audio quality is excellent. Video support is limited to WMV, I think. I haven't tried to convert a video yet, so I don't have anything to say about that. The T10's interface is simple and intuitive, much better than the Ipod's (however, I've never been a fan of the Ipod's interface: too easy to scroll past what you're looking for, takes forever to find a particular song, ugly). The T10's controls respond well, and are pretty cool-looking. The Samsung software is much easier than iTunes to use to organize your music collection, and does not hog your computer's resources. The downsides: In the U.S., you have to use Rhapsody buy music online, (no access to the iTunes store, obviously). I don't know what kind of Apple/MacOS support exists, if any, although I doubt an Apple user would consider anything other than an iPod anyway. If you use a PC, and are considering a super-slim, high-quality MP3 player, consider the Samsung T10 as an alternative to the overhyped iPods.

<Title>IPOD ??!! who
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Forget about IPOD! This mp3 player leaves the "leader" in the dirt by a mile. First, I'm a big fan of the bluetooth technology and this is the first mp3 player to have it integrated, so you don't have to look for and buy expensive attachments for it like I have on my last IPOD. The interface is much better and more entertaining, the software is much easier to work with you can do it all, upload, rip, burn, delete arrange in lists for different use, like walking, riding and so on. The buttons are amazing. They disappear when you done using them and when you touch anywhere and under the display they appear again and are like a touch buttons. You can save from files to pictures and movies and the quality of the LCD display is amazing. For me this is the number 1 personal player, I'll never buy an IPOD again. Thanks Samsung!!!

<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Unlike the Sansa piece of junk we bought in October, this Samsung mp3 player is a solid item, with many more capabilities, and built in durability.   The unit also has the added advantage of being Linux compatible, as it recognizes all unix-based sound codecs.  For a 4 gigabyte unit, with a one-year manufacturer warranty (not only 90 days), turn to this fine Samsung unit.   We did, and I only wish we'd saved ourselves the aggravation, and bought the Samsung model the first time.

<Title>Sleek Design, Fun GUI Make This Samsung a Winner!
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Samsung T10 is a unique and fun to use MP3 player that manages to stand out from the MP3 crowd. I had plans to purchase a red Samsung K3, but with the release of the Samsung T10 with video/bluetooth support and a unique GUI I purchased the red T10 instead and I have been more than pleased with it. The T10 features support for video, bluetooth, text, a voice recorder, FM radio, and datacasts. Here are some pros and cons of this flashy little device:  Pros: + Design - If anyone could outshine Apple in the design department it is Samsung. The T10 is thin and has a sleek futuristic/minimalist design that will garner plenty of stares. It's also available in many colors to suit everyones taste.  + Unique GUI - The GUI is one of the most unique on the market. The "Sammy" GUI (the one with the dog) is fun to use and will appeal to the child inside everyone. The animated dog guides you around and even holds your album art and dances around to your music. You also have the option to choose two other GUI choices - Pendant and My Skin (which gives you the option of choosing your own wallpaper), which are more traditional but still cool to use. The GUI is also very fast and responsive.   + Customization Options - There are plenty of customization options. You can choose from three different font choices, various color choices, and cool screensaver options that play during your music. I can guarantee with the option of three GUI's and the various customization options you will never get bored using the T10.  + Easy to Use - The Samsung T10 is very easy to use. Though it may take some getting used to the touch based interface, it is easy to find your files and the software that comes with the T10 is suprisingly easy to use. I had no trouble transferring files to the device.  + Bluetooth Support - Support for bluetooth is another unique feature on this device. With it you can use bluetooth headphones and future firmware upgrades may even expand on bluetooth support and allow you to use your T10 as a phone (which is what was done on the Samsung P2). Update - I just  updated to the latest firmware which allows you to transfer files between other bluetooth enabled devices. I just enabled bluetooth mode on my phone and now I am able to transfer files (such as pictures) between my phone and T10. And if you have the Samsung P2, you can transfer files between the two devices, or if you have a friend with a T10 you can share pictures and music files, a very cool and easy to set up feature.   + Other - Though the T10 only has a 2' screen, the screen has superb clarity. Its good for showing off pictures and perfect for displaying music videos, short clips, and any Simpsons/Family Guy episodes you may have. The sound quality is also good, while I am not an audiophile I had no complaints about the sound quality. The text reader is also good and perfect for lyrics or any notes you may wish to have. And Samsung has always been good with adding features/themes via firmware updates. So it is quite possible that in the future Samsung may add even more features (such as more GUI options, flash games, expanded bluetooth support) through firmware updates.  Cons: - FM Radio - The FM radio is a little scratchy, but of course the clarity depends on the headphones you use and your location.  - Video Transfer - Transferring videos to the device can take a while. A 30 minute episode of Futurama took almost 15-20 minutes to transfer over.   - File Deletion - You cannot directly delete files from the device, you can only do it through the included software. With my Creative ZVM I am able to do this and I find it handy.         All in all, I highly recommend the T10. It's fun to use and has a sleek design that make portable music listening fun. It's easy to use and the price is competitive, in fact it is cheaper than the new ipod nanos (even though it has a more unique GUI, FM radio, voice recorder, and bluetooth support), and it stands out from the bland MP3 crowd.

<Title>Stylish
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Looking like it belongs in The Museum of Modern Art, this is a very stylish MP3 player that is small and light.  It is also feature packed, easy to use, sounds outstanding, and boots fast--eight seconds.  There are many small things that Samsung has got right to make this little unit a joy to use.  Things like a clock, a calendar, the ability to load any picture and use it as wallpaper, and a plastic sheet to protect the screen and control panel from scratches.  If you dislike the sheet, you can remove and discard it.  WMAs at 160 kbps sound like CDs, at least to my ears; I connected the T10 to my hi-fi and did this test by listening from loudspeakers.  At 128 kbps, I was able to notice a difference.  The actual capacity is about 3.67 GB.  The earphones are good compared to the earphones usually bundled with portable-audio devices, but if you care about sound quality, you should buy a pair of high-quality headphones or earphones if you have not already done so.    But I do have some quibbles.  No volume indicator is shown on the screen when one is listening to music: one has to touch the control panel to see the volume setting, but then this forces the volume up or down a notch.  Playlists are limited to four-hundred songs.  Four-and-a-half stars.
