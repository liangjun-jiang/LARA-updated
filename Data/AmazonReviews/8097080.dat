<Title>died after 30 minutes

<Content>My boss got me this item to record meetings, and while I was learning how to use it I discovered the following:  Backlit display is almost impossible to see, it takes 15 seconds for it to tell you how much memory is left, there is no carry pouch as advertised on the box, the battery that came with it was dead, the loose USB plug cover will surely fall off soon, the neck strap is stiff and inflexible, the directions suffer greatly from translation, while I was recording the unit powered itself off never to come on again.  Lived 30 minutes.

<Title>does not work

<Content>Instructions are incoherent. Device does not power on, accept or play music, despite multiple attempts with new batteries. Deserves zero stars, but amazon will not let me put zero stars.
