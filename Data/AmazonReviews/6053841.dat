<Title>Small mp3 big sound and clarity
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have avoided buying ipod's because of the price associated.  But now that I have broken down and purchased one I am pleased to say I was impressed.  This shuffle has powerful sound, without becoming distorted.  The battery lasts for mine about 4 1/2 hours and charges like a snap.  The mp3 player keeps where you left off if you suddenly have to turn it off, the player goes into pause if the headphones are unplugged, and the clip is extremely strong.  I ran on a track with this clipped to the end of my sleeve and it did not even move.  The only down side is that the headphone are not ear buds or wrap arounds, but that is just personal preference.  Even at this price I would recommend buying it, there is just not another mp3 that is better than a shuffle in this small of a package that does not have any design or software problems.

<Title>It's stupid but I LOVE it
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok, when Apple offered an ipod with no screen, where the songs are offered to you randomly, I thought - this is so DUMB.  Then I tried it.  Now my Nano and Classic 80 just sit gathering dust.  This device is so small and light and sounds great, and hey I just use iTunes to keep my current play-list on it.  If I don't feel like listening to a particular song, I just hit "skip".  IMPORTANT:  The sound can be a little lightweight unless you use earphones that have substantial bass.  I upgraded to earphones by Westone.  Awesome match with the Shuffle.

<Title>functional once u get past the setup
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So I buy the shuffle because it is wicked small, figure it will have the same simple drag and drop setup that the ipod has. Well, i come to find that loading music is pretty annoying, and slow. Music has to link up to the music loaded on you iTunes library which is annoying if i move some of the music around. when I want to delete music from the device agian, its easier to write down what songs you want to delete because doing it one by one will take far too long.  The device works fine, as would be expected from an apple product, but in comparison to what I'm already used to (iPod) the loading and unloading process is slower and as a result annoying. Other than that, once its good to go, its great for working out, small, practically weight less, unobtrusive. If there was another procut out there that was just as small , i would probably not get the ipod, but given that there isnt one as small, ill have to stick to this one for now.

<Content>I love this little guy - I listen to music only sparingly, mostly I listen to audio books - I had no problem downloading from Audible - one thing to be aware of, though - it is cheaper to purchase books through Audible than ITunes. Audible has directions on their site that tell you how to purchase from them and still download through ITunes.

<Title>Satisfied though wish for better earbuds
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for use at the gym. I clip it on my collar, and it's fine, stays there, does what it should. This is my big leap into the 21st century, so I'm still adjusting. I haven't timed it, but I don't know if the battery stays charged for as long as it claims. It's still good. My only beef is with the earbuds. They're of good sound quality, maybe too much bass, but that's a small quibble. I just wish they stayed in place while I'm running. I find myself adjusting them a lot, and when I sweat, they just pop right out. I wound up  buying some other clip-ons this week. Still, worth it to me.

<Title>More bang for your buck
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I was hesitant to buy the shuffle, am I selling myself short, Will I miss the video feature of a full-size iPod? The only thing I have been disappointed about this product is the fact that I bought the silver one just two months before the purple one came out. This ipod is great for working-out and traveling, the other ipods are too bulky for these activities. I take it everywhere with me.  I LOVE IT! Now if they can just stick more memory into that tiny little body.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The third generation of the iPod Shuffle is similar to the second.  It's a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seemed a little bit more durable.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points. Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player Zen Stone Plus 2GB Black <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP50AY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD40N8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">Sandisk Sansa Express 1 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Durability  Apple definitely deserves point for the more durable player in this group.  Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Want to Make a Good Ipod Purchase? Stop here!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 3rd generation of the Ipod Shuffle has to be one of the best purchases that I have ever made, period.  Although I will admit that there is just one down side that I see in comparison to say the 80 gig classic Ipod, which I also own.  But lets focus on the positive first.    Running at least 8.5 miles a day, 5 times a week the Shuffle is great to have!  The controls are easy to use, it gets loud enough to drown out all of the people at the gym and the battery life is out of this world.  I love that it can handle hours of music, also that is so small that I forget that I am wearing it on my arm.  I also wrote a review one of the Shuffle arm bands that I highly suggest.  I know that a lot of people love their new Ipod Touches, but I think that the Shuffle could be the most valuable Ipod because of all of the people I see at the gym using one.  It makes time fly and I go a couple of weeks without having to charge it.    The one down side is the sound quality when you compare it to full size Ipod.  You can really tell the difference between them.  But that is just one of those trade offs for size and convinence that you are going to have to live with with the Shuffle.  The rest of the unit is great to use.  I know that other reviewers state that it is a little pricey compared to other small MP-3 players, and that is true, it is.  But when a product works like the Ipod Shuffle 3rd generation it is worth the little extra money for the long term benefits that the product is going to deliver.

<Title>Perfect size, functional on the go
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had one of the older 1st generation iPod shuffles and upgraded to this latest model 2 mos ago.  I primarily use it for running and working out.  The small size is perfect -- I love how it just clips to your clothes rather than requiring an armband or lanyard.  Also, I have not had the same issue with this iPod shuffle as I did with my old one in that it frequently had issues with its shuffle algorithm (to the point where I could tell it was merely going in the order of the artist's first name alphabetically or it would play the same block of songs over and over).  I have really been pleased with mine so far after 2 months and the price is reasonable given all the use I get out of my iPod shuffle.

<Title>Easy to operate, small in size
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first Ipod. I wanted to listen to music while I work out, by walking and cross country sking.  This is it.  It's so small I can bring it anywhere.  Good sound too.   I didn't like the fact that the software was not compatible to my windows 2000.  I had to use my wife's computer.  Apple's site of course wants you to buy their music, but they are pretty good about making it easy to download your own CD's.  The rechargable battery is nice.  I can easily go 10 hours on a charge.  I like things simple and the controls are very simple.  Thanks apple.

This version is great for running and workouts as it is sooo small and non-intrusive, and with its own clip.  I know Apple has just announced the 2GB version but for my running - 1GB and the battery life are more than enough features for me.  What a great price.

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - New Lower Price, Same Popular Player, Check it Out!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Apple's iPod Shuffle is a compact MP3 player that's great for working out, running or just plain music listening on the go.  The new lower price as of January 2008 makes the relatively high cost of the device a little more bearable. Great as a gift, extra player, or exercise companion.   Pros  - Newly lowered price!!!! - Compact and functional design - Nicely integrated clip - No case needed! - Great family of Apple accessories - Great for those already used to iTunes - Included in-ear headphones are great for a starter pair - Lots of great color options (silver, green, purple, blue)  - Highly durable player  - Apple brand and reputation   Cons  - Still a premium price compared to competing players (total $ and $ per gigabyte) - Competing products offer more features, including fm radio and voice recording - No screen to view track names - Difficult to control / select tracks via playlists - Proprietary dock / jack for syncing  - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability  - Limited native file format support in iTunes (MP3, AAC), though you can easily convert  - No drag and drop music control - Non iTunes fans are still forced to deal with software limitations  The Form Factor   Size has always been the iPod shuffle's greatest asset.  The integrated clip is no doubt its second greatest asset.   This unit works fine with no extra case, though there are still options. The composite case comes in one of several popular color options, including the silver, blue, green and purple. And of course, the unit's durability is great, probably because of the simple design.   Apple chose to use a proprietary headphone jack for syncing, which most competing players accomplish with a standard USB B port.  Overall, still a great design.  Durability   Apple deserves points for the more durable player in this group. Even with the composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse. Creative's failure rates are too high, but Sandisk's Clip is gaining ground in this area.  Capacity  The 1GB size for the shuffle was the only option from Apple for a long time.  The market has been flooded with 2GB players from the competition.  In addition to lowering the price in February 2008, Apple finally added a 2GB option available now at Apple stores. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012LWG9O/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">Apple iPod shuffle 2 GB Silver (2nd Generation)</a>  Still, as Apple finally ups their size, Sansa now has their Clip in a 4GB size.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00126V8WU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Clip 4 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a>  Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W09ZTK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Features and Software  Competing players over simple screens for track viewing as well as FM radio and voice recording.  The Zen Stone Plus by Creative and the Sandisk Clip each offer all three features at better price points. Apple's reliability and brand loyalty has allowed the shuffle to survive with limited features.  Competing players also offer drag and drop syncing using standard USB cables or, in the case of the Sansa Express, via direct USB.  Apple still requires the proprietary dock.  For a 1GB MP3 player it seems excessive to have to use iTunes software to sync your software.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  iTunes is both a curse and a blessing, depending on your point of view.  For those who are used to iTunes or totally new to MP3s, the interface can be a great plus.  For anybody who want more direct control over their music collection, some of the features within iTunes can become burdensome.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, or if you are totally new to MP3s the software will still be a net plus for you.   For those that care about file options, Apple's software allows only MP3 and AAC. You can easily convert other formats to these, but be aware of the limits.  This is only a negative for those really loyal to a certain file format, such as the growing group of WMA users.  Having to have 2 format copies of all your music can really hurt as your collection grows.  Sound   The sound this unit produces is pretty good though not great. While I still feel the first generation shuffle sounded much better, the tradeoff was worth the smaller size.   Cost   The shuffle's price has finally come down to about $50 for 1GB or $65 for 2GB. While not a bargain, this price makes the sting much less painful for Apple loyalists.  On a dollar per gigabyte and absolute dollar cost, Apple continues to charge a premium for their brand.    1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail, one fifth the lowered cost of the shuffle.  In addition, competing players like the Sansa Clip continue to offer more features at a better prices. If you want a small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, your options continue to expand.  In addition to the Creative Stone and the Sansa Clip, new models from Samsung and Sony have added even more options.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved. This model requires you to pay a premium for it, though a slightly shrinking premium.  :-D  Conclusion  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, choose this or one of the new 2GB shuffles. If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 but gives you 4 times the capacity and video.  Still, if you're not an Apple die-hard, the Sansa Clip and other options deserve consideration.  Research your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Overall this is a good player at an improved price.    Enjoy!!!

<Content>This is a perfect gift for my kids - I have control with what goes onto it AND the sound level.  The colors make it fun for them too.  I'm getting one with more memory for myself, but with an average of 250 songs per shuffle, it is just right for them.

<Title>The iPod shuffle is an excellent value
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is so small, yet holds 240 tracks. (Actully I have 242 tracks on mine right now.) I bought it mainly for my wife and she hates complicated electronics, but this one is so easy to operate, she loves it. It is quick and easy to load with new music too-takes no time at all. I highly recommend it to one and all.

<Title>Nice but not compatible with Windows Media Player
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod shuffle is small, plays fairly well and is at a relatively fair price, but if you are comfortable using Windows Media player then this item is a nightmare.  Mac users seem obsessed with attacking anyone if they prefer Windows software but, hey, I like Windows Media player. For me it's just easier to use, faster with way more options than iTunes.  There are many other very good mp3 players out there that work great with Media Player and in the future I will avoid all iPod products. Not to mention once your battery dies then the item is as good as junk.    Just to be clear, I do like the shuffle but I hate iTunes.

<Title>All this sound from this tiny little device?
<Date>Tue Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was given a shuffle from work as an award, I had never wanted one before, but I set it up today and started listening, the sound is absolutely amazing. It may even be better than my 5G 30Gig video. The big con is that you are at the mercy of the ipod as to what songs you listen to, I like having a screen.

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QIRC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-3645282-9867634">Apple 1 GB iPod shuffle Green (3rd Generation)</a> I bought the 1 GB iPod Shuffle to listen to podcasts or music while I'm working around house and garden.  I like to listen to music or talk radio while I'm working, but because I'm always on the go, I don't like to carry a radio with me.  I often lose reception; the radio is heavy or in the way;  the batteries die too soon; and the sound quality of small portable radios is lousy.  With the Shuffle being about the size of a postage stamp, having a clip, and weighing next to nothing, I can attach it to my shirt or belt and keep working while I listen to my favorite show or music and the sound quality is awesome.  I can listen to hours worth of podcasts and/or music because not only will that tiny little thing hold so much entertainment, but the rechargeable battery will last up to 12 hours!  A lot longer than I'll be working in the garden.

<Content>I purchased this for my 9 year old daughter.  This Ipod is better than my nano.  For it's size,the quality is outstanding.  the buttons on the unit are strong and sturdy.    This is a perfect product for a teen, young adult, or an individual who works out.  Due to it's size, this is perfect for a runner or a gym junkee.   My next Ipod for myself is going to be the shuffle, due to quality and size.  At first I was hesitant about this product as the music is random, but this is a really fun product!

<Title>3rd Gen Apple iPod Shuffle Fits The Bill For Beginners!
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this iPod shuffle for a young lady of 10.  This player really works well for her.  She doesn't care about selecting specific songs and has no need to sort by artist or genre.  She likes how easy it is to dump songs onto this player, even without the use of iTunes.  The Shuffle is really small and has an integrated clip, so it is easy to transport.  The sound quality is awesome, for such a small device, and it plays for hours and hours on a battery charge.  I think the iPod Shuffle is an item that will only please a certain range of people.  After all, there is no display so you cannot select the songs or artists that you wish to listen to in any given order.  The player does just what the name implies.  It "Shuffles" your music in random order.  You still have the basic controls at your fingertips, including track skip forward and backward, play, pause, and volume up and down.  It also has a handy hold switch so that you don't accidentally turn the player on or change tracks when you don't want to.  I purchased this 3rd gen iPod Shuffle from Amazon for the amazing price of $69.99!  It is now back up around $75, so I feel lucky to have purchased it when I did.  If you are looking for a very small and easy to use MP3 player, which simply shuffles your music and has a high quality look and feel, then look no further than the Apple iPod Shuffle.  It really is an amazing player.  =o)  UPDATE - 1/23/2008: This iPod Shuffle ended up taking a trip through the washing machine and was then subjected to the brutal pouding and scorching heat of a clothes dryer!  Obviously we were just sick about what we had done, and we were sure that this Christmas gift had met an early death.  We allowed the Shuffle to sit out for 4 days, without trying to power it on, in order to make sure that it was completely dry on the inside.  Much to our amazement this 3rd Gen iPod Shuffle powered up and works flawlessly!  It charges, plays all of the onboard music files, and connects to the computer without any problems.  All of the buttons and switches work just fine as well.  We are SO relieved, and can't say enough about the build quality and durability of this product.  We will now be more careful about checking every pocket before laundering our clothes in the future.  Whew...thanks Apple!
