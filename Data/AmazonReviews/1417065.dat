We purchased this for our daughter. Used to love the Toshiba line. I own their laptop, two high definition tv's, their high definition dvd player, and a regular dvd player.  So, when purchasing the Gigabeat, I didn't hesitate.  Well, the thing turned out to be a lemon. System failure, hard drive failure.  Sent it out twice for repair, both times losing over 1200 songs my daughter paid for.  They told us if it happened a third time, even after the warranty expired, they would replace or refund our money.  Guess what?  It just failed, and they said, tough luck, you're out of warranty.  By days mind you - not months, not years, just days it is out of the warranty period.  Nice company, considering what faithful customers we are..  I will never purchase from, or recommend Toshiba again, and I will take every opportunity I can to let every consumer know what their customer service is.  A Joke.  I will be writing their corporate office also.  They are so non-consumer oriented, you cannot even send customer service an email at Toshiba, nor can you speak to a supervisor.  You have to mail them!!!!!  Yes mail, regular mail, like the post office, with a stamp.  Hello!!!!!!! Aren't they a technology company? No emails??????  What a huge disappointment Toshiba.  Shame on you.

<Title>NO MAJOR ISSUES SO FAR!
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to wait a good year before I wrote my review.  I have reached that point with positive opinion on this product.  It is very easy to work with and has lots and lots of storage space!..I like being able to see the album covers when I play songs either on the display or on the TV screen...If I could change anything about this product, those things would be: 1. The battery life: don't get me wrong, It will last all day with moderate use if you are listening to music...apprxmtly 7-8 hours..depending on how you have the device set. (some settings pull more on the battery than others)..If you are watching video, maybe 2.5 hours on a full charge...that might be a little weak as far as battery strength goes in my opinion...But, a simple solution for this is to keep a car charger with you when your using it in a vehicle, and you will never have problems with battery life.  2. I wish it was more compatible with video files and did not have to convert all to WMA format..I found that I couldn't convert some video files...I would get an error message. Also, some files, when you convert them, lose clarity and that defeats the purpose of converting the file in the first place..  3.  I would love if I knew how to make each clip in the video file play continuously without having to manually play each individual video.. If there is a way...I haven't figured it out yet.  These aren't major issues though.. I mainly purchased this to listen to music and audiobooks....you can also run slideshows of your pictures will music is playing as well...I would say that I am overall very pleased with my purchase..

<Title>Mayor Flaw in Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have bought the S60 and I am totally disappointed. The device is nice and works fine but the way you have to sync the music using MediaPlayer 10 is not working for ripped CD's that do not have Tags. I have audio books that I did place in the Music folder using the FileManager. The S60 attempts to sort them by Artist, Song, Genres, etc. but does not give you a folder view as the F60 did or as any other MP3 player I owned did. This makes this player useless for anyone that likes to listen to audio books and music that was riped from a CD. I liked this device because of size bothy physically and storage but this flaw made me decide to put it on Ebay and get rid of it. It is unfortunate that such a flaw is produced by Toshiba. I even called the customer service and they told me to simply add tags to all my 7000 songs and audio books, Yeah right!!!  My recommendation is do not buy this device until the patched this mistake in the interface design.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am completely satisfied with this player.  I installed the beta version of Windows Media Player 11 and it works great. Takes some time getting used to coming from 10, but it's worth the effort.  One thing I really enjoy about using this product is that it requires no extra software. It comes with a CD, but I just tossed it to the side and let windows xp pro handle the rest.  I did see that some people were disappointed about not being able to put data files onto the unit. Cmon people. Open up my computer while the device is connected. Create a folder and drop your files in. It's not rocket science. This product will work like a thumb-drive.  One minor drawback, but it has not flawed my opinion at all, is that simply dropping media into the device outside the "Sync" routine won't allow the file to show up in standalone mode. I'm sure theres a way this rule can be bent, but why bend something when another method already allows for it?  Buy this thing now.

<Title>A nightmare for me....
<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was thrilled to get the Gigabeat (60 gig) and spent hours loading it up. Then the problems began. This is an actual partial copy of my email to Toshiba customer service at the address provided with the product: ........................................................ Just received Gigabeat 60 from Amazon Friday. S/N: (provided)   This has been a nightmare for me. I waited for this product and did not want to go IPOD.   After following ALL instructions and spending hours downloading selected music, pictures and videos - including several VONGO downloaded films which I subscribed to just for your device, I connected the Gigabeat later yesterday to add some more downloads and instead I saw a message on the device stating something like "deleting files" and within seconds EVERYTHING I had downloaded was gone....GONE!   After this I rebooted the PC, reconnected the USB to the Gigabeat and it was no longer recognized by the PC, even though I did get the message asking me if I wanted to use Windows Media or VONGO. When I clicked on Windows Media is when I got the "not recognized" message. Interestingly the VONGO site did recognize and I was able to download films again...BUT I could never get the PC to recognize GIGABEAT when in Windows Media. I even downloaded WM again through the gigabeat software CD.   So, I waited until this morning to try again - since it was after midnight when I finally gave up trying.    This morning (Sunday) I turned on the Gigabeat, the PC and reconnected them using the USB. This time I immediately got a message on the PC stating that the connected device has malfunctioned. Then I disconected the Gigabeat, which said it was connected, and the Gigabeat's screen shut down. It will not turn on at all. It will not even show the battery icon when using the AC adaptor.   I am ready to return this to Amazon tomorrow and ready to write a user review outlining this horrible experience. Your device came with a slip of paper saying please do not return the product and to call customer service. This either means that you are serious about making this product successful, or there have been many problems, or both. Of course, unlike many other tech product suppliers, you have no weekend phone support and do not even begin until 10 am EST on weekdays.    I will wait to call Amazon to arrange the return until 1:00pm EST in case you would like to call or email to discuss. If you email or call and get my voice mail please be sure to leave a direct return phone number....or failing that please state a time that you will be calling and I will make sure I am in my office to answer your call - any time between 11:30 and 1:30 EST.   Again, this has been a nightmarish disappointment for me. I would appreciate a thorough and helpful response.    UPDATE: After I returned the product I received an email response - days later - from Toshiba customer service (Rick) telling me to "swith off the battery for at least 3 minutes" and if this doesn't work to call an 800 number for support. I'm not sure what this meant as the battery has no switch and is not removable. But, of course, I had already returned the product and have received a refund from Amazon.   Some people seem to love the new Gigabeat, but I am not willing to live with the chance that all files will delete on their own at any time. I liked it for the hour that it worked for me. In my opinion, Toshiba has work to do in quality control as well as customer support. I guess I'll wait for the upcoming competing Microsoft product.

<Title>Jury is still out, but you might want to WAIT!
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok... I did my homework and decided the Toshiba Gigabeat was what I wanted.  I ordered it last Thursday and even joined Amazon Prime so I could get it overnighted for $3.99... just had to have it for the weekend.  First, I loaded over 600 songs on it Friday night.  It was great.  While I was listening to those I joined VONGO and downloaded 8 movies!! The next day I tried to transfer the movies to the Gigabeat... TRANSFER ERROR! Oh, but it gets better... ALL my 600 songs were GONE!!!!  Hmmmmm, seems I remember reading about a similar problem someone else had in the reviews.  So I reload the songs and finally get the movies to transfer.  Later that day I record something off TV and try to transfer that.... ERROR!  This is getting old.  Wait, not done.... Sunday I fire it up again and guess what.... yep, all 600 songs are gone again!!  So Monday morning I contacted Amazon and sent it back!  Figured I give it one more chance so I told them to ship me a replacement.  If I have ANY problems at all with this one, it's going back for a refund!  Obviously Toshiba has some quality issues!!! Oh, and when I emailed them (Toshiba) about the problem, I got the exact SAME email back that the other guy did... something about turning off the battery for 3 minutes!!  What a joke!  All I can say is beware on this one... seems to be alot of lemons in the mix!!!  NOTE:  Amazon has been wonderful to deal with on this, so my rating is based on the performance of the Gigabeat, not Amazon.  They paid for the defective unit to be returned and sent me a new replacment the next day, before they even received mine back!!  5 stars for them!!  UPDATE:  I received the replacement unit from Amazon.  I tried transferring movies that I downloaded from VONGO... one of the main reasons I bought this unit.  All I got was error messages!!  After numerous attempts I called Vongo's techincal help line.  "Not our problem, must be Toshiba"  So I called Toshiba's Technical help line.... you know what's coming... "not our problem, must be Vongo!"  So the next day it went back for a refund!!  I'd think twice about wasting your money on this device, it obviously has A LOT OF BUGS to be worked out and I got a real "couldn't care less" attitude about it from Toshiba!!

<Title>Another buggy device
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow after i read the comments on this website I am 110% glad that i returned my Toshiba Gigabeat today. Its uncanny how I've had the EXACT problems with the gigabeat. Transferring audio is easy but keeping them on the device is very tough. When I tried to transfer a video windows media player, it would always get stuck in the converting process at 0%. After 2 hours and still at 0%, i disconnected the gigabeat. When i turned it on, it said "Dumping Information" on the screen. What did customer service say? Turn of the battery for 3 min? BS! This occurs 2 more times after I did this. In addition to this, my battery would abnormally die even after a night's charge. A message would come up on the screen saying that "Portable Media Center is very low on battery and will turn off soon". Then there was an option to click OK, but the screen froze and the only remedy to this was to reset the battery and say goodbye to all ur content.   And what about video quality you ask? lol. It was so bad i thought my vhs had better qualities. Due to the 65k color screen there were numerous color abnormalities on the screen. Horrible night scenes due to lack to color transition made watching nighttime movies impossible to bear. Plus the gigabeat virtually supports no video format. But what about WMV? No. It has no native support for any video file. Even if you try to transfer a WMV file to the gigabeat you will need to convert it. Worse, if you have an divx or xvid encrypted divx and try to convert it on the gigabeat frame-skipping occurs. Atleast the viewing angles are great? WRONG. If you watch a night scene on the gigabeat you will fund yourself turning the screen around.  Why am I saying all of this? You've probably read about these problems many times before this. I am just reitterating my problems just to show you how deceptive this product really is.  O sure you see a 8.3 in cnet, 9.2 on pcworld so it must be a great product. Then you think it looks sexy and its not an ipod. The best deal! WRONG. I was optimistic like this before i bought the gigabeat. Companies and people wonder why many consumers are pessemisstic about products and seek to find anything wrong with it. I have learned that if you want to buy a product you must expect the worst from products.      Bottom line: It depends on what you want. You want portability get an ipod. It has the same capacity, a thinner look, a sexier look and a whole lot more battery life. No FM tuner, but the tunner in gigabeat is garbage anyway. I have manual tuning radios that work better. You want quality and performance? Get the Creative Zen Vision: M. It has greater video support, DivX 4,5, Xvid, Mpeg 2,4 and WMV. It has a bigger and better screen at 2.5 with 262,000 colors compared to the gigabeat's 62k. Better FM tuner, and more features including calendar, contact list, screen keyboard for artist search, organizer, microphone and radio recording.   If there was a zero rating for this product I would rate it just that. I fully recommend that you do not buy it, and if you do then returning it will be the best day of your life.

<Title>An Excellent PMP
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's interesting to see a product get either five or one star.  My experiences have been nearly all positive.  The software seemed clumsy at first, until I upgraded to Windows Media Player 11, which is intuitive and dependable.  It is possible to delete songs, and I have never had any problems transferring music, pictures, of videos to the Gigabeat.  Since I prefer classical music, sound is important.  I previously owned a Creative Zen Touch that distorted with percusive sounds (such as loud passages on the piano).  Those same MP3 files are distortion free on the Gigabeat.  The sound is fantastic! My guess is that the one-star incidents are anomolies.  This is a solid value, especially compared to the Zen and (possibly) the iPod.

<Title>apple can pack its things
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I cannot help but spread my enthusiasm for the player - the 1-stars seem to rely heavily on download-services which do not play a role for me. If you search a player that   - runs smoothly with your music collection (mp3, wma, etc) - has a brilliant screen - plays movies without complaining (even divx after conversion) - shows fotos that can be put on the player directly from the camera  the Gigabeat is your device at a good price.  At this point, accessories are a big minus for sure - there is one single manufacturer that has carrying cases (Noreve St. Tropez), but they cost 40EUR ($51) a piece excl shipping (they are handmade, though ;-)  I am afraid for stands you will have to wait quite a bit (if not forever), car adapters should be easy to find, though, since you can be safe to assume that the player will run with the standard stuff you find at radio shack  however - I have to say how great the player is and how it is worth the hassle to get it (at least it was until july). it is intuitive, the sound is excellent, even divx-movies are converted, the screen is brilliant and the hook-up with the tv runs smoothly (movies are like watching a dvd, seriously).  all in all a great buy - the ipod would force you into itunes and cost way more considering all the "accessories" (i.e. radio, tv-out, foto-transfer, etc.) ipod-people have to pay big money for.

<Content>If you use a subscription service, stay away. Yahoo wma files kill the batteries. Plays for shorter is more like it. I have done tests, mp3s I have made, the battery lasts 15 hours. Yahoo files, good luck on over 2 hours.   I like the interface, the sound is clear and distortion free and it has a huge storage capacity.   As a player, this is a good device. Just stick to files you have ripped your self.

<Title>Battery drains when fully charged
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am returning my unit. Just like another reviewer (read below) documented the battery drains abnormally when switched off. It happens when you actuate the battery 'switch' (it's a miniscule slide button in a recessed opening that you cannot see, you have to use a pin or a needle and knowing that it is in the off or on position move it the opposite direction - one poor design feature in this product). I'm playing it safe rather than having it repaired which Tosh. readily agreed to do. I also have noticed that the battery runs down faster if you play WMA DRM files a lot or move around in the menu a lot. I knew this was not the player with the best battery life before buying it, I would be happy with 8-10 hours with audio. There is a lot to like too. THe sound is great, the interface is great and scrolling to an item in the menu is very fast. It works well with WMP 11 Beta 2. The FM radio reception is mediocre. It would not pull in one of the strongest stations around here for some reason. FM was not one of my requirements anyway.

<Content>I bought mine for $200 but even that was overpriced when you consider that it only worked for around 6 months.  One day it just froze for no reason and all my songs disappered only to reappear a few days later.  Now the unit only works is if it's plugged in which renders it pretty much usless.  Don't buy this piece of trash.  Now I'll just have to break down and buy an iPod.

<Date>Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Toshiba gigabeat when my last mp3 player finally died. I had a dell model before and absoutly love the simplicity of the machine. I like having my entire music collection with me, but i dont use the whole lets put pictures, and watch tv or anything like on an mp3 player/ media player. I really just wanted a simple mp3 player. Well this one is simple, kinda. I like the fact if I wanted to I can listen to local radio stations on it, which is great for those in the gym experinces when they have a tv but you have to set your radio to a certain station to hear the sound.  The battery life isnt bad, I can get about 8-10 hours of music on shuffle. I have however still not figured out how to get a playlist to load on to the player. The quicklist isnt bad, but i miss having 15 different playlists to cover my particular moods. I dislike the fact all the play, next track, or last track buttons are on the side instead of on the front. That being said I am very pleased with the device, and I would buy it again.

<Title>Whatpod?
<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my 60-gig Gigabeat for 6 months now and I'm still thrilled with it.  It is the first MP3 player I've had and I don't see how an iPod could be better -- not to mention that there isn't any proprietary format nonsense to put up with.  The battery has been solid -- I have played 2 full length movies on a single charge -- and it has room for everything.  I was hoping that it would function as a portable hard drive but it isn't.    I have not had any problems with file transfers.  I have about 30 gigs of media on it and it takes about 15 minutes to sync.    A few of the controls could be better placed, i.e. the "lock" switch should be farther from the power button so that you don't accidentally turn off the power when you are trying to unlock it.  But overall, this is a great product and I hope that Toshiba follows it up with a stellar second generation.

<Title>Still my first choice in MP3 players
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Gigabeat 60GB for about six months and I have been very pleased with it. The feel and quality are substantive - unlike some others that look and feel like plastic toys.  The fact that the media sync is universal with Windows Media player is a plus.  The sound and picture quality are fantastic.  Controls are simple and intuitive.  I wish you could delete files directly on the Gigabeat but you must be plugged into the PC to do that.  Easily powers my Sennheiser headphones. The battery life is not as long as advertised.  I should have sent it back for that but I like it so much, I don't want to give it up! The trickle charge over USB is handy and quicker than I expected - you do not need to take the AC charger everywhere.  Another reviewer noted the loss of all of stored media.  I only had that happen once and since then have been very careful about making sure that the Gigabeat is done communicating with the PC and ready to be disconnected - no problems since.  I carefully reviewed all of the MP3/media players within this size/price range and I would still buy the Toshiba if I had it do all over again - no hesitation.  Accessories are non-existent but hey I didn't buy it for the accessories.

<Title>Temperamental sometimes, but worth it.
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Quite simply, this is the best Portable Media Device on the market, aesthetically, supported format wise, screen wise, navigation wise, and possibly sound wise. It's  not without its annoying drawbacks: Randomly reformatting if you don't unplug the usb cable correctly, mediocre battery life, error code 5 "return to manufacturer" (when the hard drive cable disconnects after a hard fall), and an equalizer that doesn't work, but even given all those, I wouldn't trade it for any other player.  I've had mine for over a year and only once has it reformatted itself (a big complaint for some reviewers), and you can easily prevent this if you turn the power on the player off before disconnecting the USB cable. Plus it's a rare occurrence even if you disconnect it with the power on.  Though Toshiba no longer supports the player, you can find excellent support on the MyGigabeat dot com forum, including instructions on how to upgrade or replace its hard drive, battery, screen, or firmware. And replacing or upgrading parts on this thing is easier than any of the other big name contending devices. Wanna swap the 60gb drive with a 100 or 120gb drive? Easy as pie. Wanna upgrade the battery to 1200mA to squeeze out an extra 2-4 hours of play time? Just remove 2 extra screws, pop the old one out and the new one in. You're set. None of this non-user serviceable ridiculousness.  Why 4 stars? It's not perfect. But it's close enough.

<Title>Better than an ipod
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have friends who have ipods, they're always smashing them against walls trying to get them to work, or get over errors, they have all complained about itunes and when they have had computer problems they have ipod problems too. Not the gigabeat. All you need is microsoft media player with a sync tab and you can use anyone's computer because almost everyone has this on their computer. The Gigabeat is more like an external hard drive so you can hook it up to a computer and go right into the folders on the MP3 player and delete things (nothing is saved with weird names),this also means you can open your gigabeat from a friends computer and click and drag a copy of all of your music to their computer for them to have. The only thing is if you need to edit a song name or a picture or video that is saved on the MP3 player, you need to edit it on the computer that you saved it from and re-sync the player. It's a pretty simple and very elegant player...don't let the up and down arrows misguide you either, you can still scroll by holding the arrow and letting go when you get to the letter (you will use this a lot because it holds a ton of songs)...  OH the battery life is only about 3 hours so if you plan on getting this for your car I recommend getting a car charger too, they're only about $8.00 if you shop around on line. you can play music while it is charging in your car so it's no big deal with the car charger.

<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my Gigabeat. I bought mine about 1 year and a half ago and it's still working great.   I wasn't a fan of the thing when I first received it but that was due to the fact that I didn't know how to use it properly. I've now gotten a hang of it and I never leave home without it. It's my perfect gym buddy. I listen to tunes while lifting weights and watch videos while on the treadmill. It's awesome.   I use Media Monkey (a program you can get free from the MM site) to transfer music and use Windows Media Player 11 to convert and transfer videos to the device.  I had no problem with the music/video transfer when I upgraded my computer to Vista.   I highly recommend it.

<Title>Great MP3 player.....When it works.
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product in Oct. 2006 because the reviews were so great and I didn't want to deal with an IPod.  It worked great for about 1 month and then the problems started with the battery.  I would charge it one day and the next it would be dead.  I called customer service and they said to reset the battery.  Some days it worked and some days it didn't.  It was a crap shoot every morning on wether or not the battery would be dead even if I had charged it all night.  I only put up with it because I had spent $250 on the stupid thing and had spent so much time downloading my music library.  It's been a year and after taking very good care of it, the thing dies without warning.  It gives me the message to return to the manufacturer for repair.  If Toshiba thinks I'm going send them any more of my hard earned money to fix this pos, they are sadly mistaken.  I've wasted enough time and money on them and won't do it again.

<Title>Stuck with WMP for transfering music files
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a 60 gb Toshiba player a few months ago, and returned it to Amazon. I listen mostly to classical music and WMP makes absolute hash out of classical albums. (Not really their fault; most classical albums have info on them that us completely messed up.)This is not a probem with my Creative player; I just plug it in to a USB port and drag 'n drop the folders I want to the player, then create a playlist. You can't do this with the Toshiba; you MUST use WMP. Microsoft strkes again!

<Title>Fat and easily breakable
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first I really liked this Gigabeat. It lasted about three months though as one small drop broke the player, disallowing it to play music. The Gigabeat is a very thick media device and by now I don't really suggest you buy it as there are plenty of other mp3 devices for the same price that are much more advanced than this one. The only thing I really liked about this Gigabeat was its loud sound.

<Title>Happy with the hardware - but not the software!
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've now had my S60 about two weeks and am getting to know it well.  I'd have to say that while I think it is better than the equivalent iPod for Windows XP users, living with the Media Player software is not fun.  First time I plugged the S60 into the PC - drivers install, everything happy - device manager says all is good.  Only one problem - no S60 visible in Windows explorer or the Media Player.  Consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and when I can eventually figure out the key words to get a useful search, I find the answer.  I end up editing a couple of registry key security permissions and then every thing works fine.  Registry key permissions!  This is like being told you won't be able to start your new car until you've modified the wiring under the bonnet.......  Media Player 10 is functional but limited.  More importantly the MTP drivers it installs give very limited drag and drop capabilities - and won't let you use the S60 for transferring data files.  If a file name doesn't have an approved media extension you can't copy it (but just changing the extension seems to work!).  Media Player 11 is much more functional.  With newer MTP drivers included, Windows explorer can see more of what's on the device (but not everything....), and depending where you copy files to, will either let you copy without limitation, or warn but not prevent you copying a non-media file.  My main use for the S60 is to play mp3 files.  As such all my problems have been in the Media Player.  eg. ID3 tags say artist is John Doe.  Media Player, twice only so far, ends up with "Artist" is John Doe, but "Album Artist" is Doe, John.  S60 handles this by giving you two entries for the same album.  So where does Media Player get "Doe, John" from randomly?  I can only guess it snuck off and retrieved bad info from the internet.  Other pet Media Player peeves:   - edit an album or artist name starting with say "S", hit enter and wham you're back at "A", scrolling down to find the album again.  - set the device option in media player to maximum quality, 192kb/s, and any mp3 it finds below OR ABOVE 192kb/s will be converted to 192kb/s WMA format.  Leave the device set to auto quality, and it doesn't seem to interfere!  - can see the mp3 files on the player and delete or copy them, but can't access them for editing tags.  - can't even see the player in other applications, only the Media Player and Windows Explorer.  The S60 itself looks good, feels solid, and is a breeze to use.  It comes with the ability and cable to download photos off most cameras, a plug pack, and FM radio, so you don't keep paying for extras like with iPods.  While the supplied headphones are utter rubbish (come on Toshiba - it doesn't cost anything more to provide a usable pair), the player gives excellent sound with a good pair.  Video conversion time is typically slow, but (unlike others???) I've had no problems with the six or so I've transferred to the S60.  Oh - and I do like the buttons on the side too (unlike others!!!).  Things I don't like about or could be improved on the S60 include:  - volume control only has 20 increments, I'd prefer a finer resolution.  - display is hard to read in daylight even at max brightness.  - can't delete files from the player itself.  - needs the ability to play files by folder.  - desparately needs the ability to change backgrounds and colour schemes.  Windows default - yuk!  - needs a case and these aren't so common.  - generates quite a lot of internal FM interference, particuarly around 101MHz, until the CPU goes to sleep in about 1.5 minutes.  - and of course the same old file type groans (give us DivX, m4a etc support) and the battery life/charging behaviour groans.  At the end of the day I cannot understand why we can't just have a media player that works by dragging and dropping in Windows Explorer.  Aren't any of the manufacturers listening to us consumers?  I don't want proprietry lock down, I don't need autosync anything.

<Title>Best Portable Video Player
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a man who loves both individuality and simplicity.  When the iPod became the biggest portable mp3 player, I sought out to find a great alternative that could hold several gigs and not give any of my money to Apple.  My friend found out about the Creative Zen, which is a great mp3 player as well.  But both the Zen and the iPod were so overstuffed with useless gadgetry that I just felt overwhelmed.  My gigabeat was both simple and sufficient; and that is why I found it to be the best mp3 player for its price.

<Title>Seems great so far... And *still* does after 1.5 months
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't really give a review yet on the battery performance or say much on all the features as I have only had this 1 day so far, but I like what I see so far... I should mention that I bought the Black 60 GB model...  I took it out of the package and set it up to charge, it took the 3 hours that it says it needs to fully charge.  I went to install anything to my computer (laptop with windows XP MCE 2005), and it says to install mediaplayer 10, even if you already have it as the install would also install a few other items that the player needs to work with the Gigabeat S.  I have the latest version of Media Player 11 on here, and I didn't need to do anything else (no installations of any kind) to get the Gigabeat working with my system and Sync properly.  I also already had the latest updates for MCE 2005 and so I am assuming that if you have the automatic updates turned on, that you would have everything needed as well.  I had never used Media Player for anything but music before (used it to sync with my -now old- Dell DJ 20 (2nd Gen)), but it was nice to see that it would take my files (video and tv) and automatically convert them before transfering/syncing them to my portable.  I love the portable's MCE style, and it's great to use in combination with a MCE computer, though I think anyone with even just windows XP would find it pleasant to use (very easy, as you can't go wrong with "My tv", "My music" etc) even without ever having seen the menu system before.  If you are like me and have your MCE using a TV Tuner to record TV shows/movies, then you will love the nice easy way that MediaPlayer 11 (can't say about 10 as I never used it much and only for music) takes control and adds your files to the player, converts them for you if needed, and then syncs them, and the visual quality is quite good.  I am sure that it could be better, but I was able to watch a "dark" show on the gigabeat with the brightness at 3 (out of 5) and it was not half bad, much better with the brightness up higher though but then you also will have to deal with the added battery loss (just turn it back down after you are down watching to help save battery power again).  And might I add that my TV Tuner has an Antenna Source, though I tend to forget it most of the time (except for anything recorded on FOX as it is difficult to get in clear where I am) as the TV tuner does a great job and it shows in the conversion as well. So if you have a bad quality file to start off with, there's probably not much that can be done about that, but otherwise, considering the device and size of the screen, you really couldn't ask for much more (well, you could, but you wouldn't need much more).  I have been constantly syncing and adding new items to my Gigabeat in the past 24 hours, and I have only had 2 music files show up with an error and that couldn't transfer.  I took these 2 files, converted them from mp3 to a higher bit rate WMA file (used a free trial version of some program downloaded from CNET) and on the next sync, they managed to transfer over as well.  The audio sounds great, though I am using a previously bought pair of Sony earbud headphones (the kind with the round rubber removable earpieces that fit into your ears for a nice fit) instead of the ones that come with the gigabeat, and these are great to use as they will bring out that sound quality for you to enjoy, are comfortable, and keep the sound going into your ears and not other peoples... So I would suggest to get these or something else a bit better quality (than the basic ships with ones) if you don't already own some decent headphones.  So I really haven't said much about the portable player, and I will do so after I get a real chance to test it out, but as of now, it seems great to me, and I have not been having any of the problems that some of the other people were having, and with the prices coming down so much... as low as ($260) even for the 60GB model... I would say it is worth it to get it and try it out.  I would recommend buying from a place that has a good exchange policy, as even though it ships with a sheet saying to not return it to a store, if you do have problems and don't want Toshiba to just "fix" it for you, you can always return it (to Amazon if bought here).  ***Edited on 11/20/2006 @ 12:53 AM***  So I have now had my Toshiba Gigabeat S for just over a month and a half (it seems like it has been so much longer, like almost 3 months) and all I can say is that it is great. I haven't had any more problems with transfering songs (though the re-coding into another file type did work nicely for those stubborn songs that just don't want to transfer on their own) and I have had no problems with the battery life (when compared to what it's specs should be, not by what I would like it to be...) and people should remember that there is that little switch to turn the battery on or off (for if you are not going to use it for a good amount of time and don't want the battery to drain during that time it is turned off). Turn the gadget over, look at the back, down on the bottom... See the "BATT" with "On  Off" below it... Look on the bottom edge where the USB plugs into, it is next to that, to the right, above the little screw. Hold player so you can see the back of it and the bottom edge, the "On  Off" show where you need to switch the switch (hah) to turn the battery on and off - the "hole"  in the plastic piece is your current position...  Again, the battery life could be better but is pretty much standard for most players, the audio and video qualities are also standard, if not more so... Just remember, you need decent/good quality ear/headphones to be able to hear the *real* sound quality from the player, and you should also watch out for the type of media format you are using (listening to) as this has a big impact on the overall quality as well (I try to stick with wma formats as they can get *much* better quality into a file of approx. the same size as a lower quality mp3.  If you LOVE sound quality and don't care that it takes up more space, always convert to wma 128 (MIN) or up to 192 -or is it 196? Dealing with too many numbers, though whatever setting that is around 164 makes a great common ground for size and quality, and this is usually set at 44,000Hz - or is it MHz? Again, forgive my tech details as it is late and I keep getting things mixed up in my head).  Overall, *still* great after 1.5 months and counting. Maybe some people got bad products, it does happen, or ones with faulty batteries. Also, check your music files, to see that they aren't what is causing you problems, and keep it simple.... Stick with Windows Media Player 11. Newest version is non-beta now and I have no problems with the software at all and it is the easiest way to sync your files and Auto Convert those video media files if you haven't done so before hand.  Prices are cheap, when I bought mine, the price dropped the day mine shipped, and then dropped *again* 2 days later. Amazon was nice enough to give me a refund credit for the $54.19 that was the difference. Now you can find the Black 60gb one for around $254 or so from some of these Amazon 3rd party Merchants... So go ahead and try it, if it has a problem, just return it to Amazon (if bought here) and either give up or get an exchanged product and if that second one is still not working for you, return it, get your money back and buy something else.  If the product is not giving you problems, then you should only find slight disappointment with some areas of it, which I am sure you could probably live with. If you are not sure about the style/menu/etc, try and find a store that has a working model (as a sampler/tester) to check it out first. I don't think Toshiba has a interactive working model online (which I think they should have), they might have something that shows a bit of the product, I used one of those for my Sony Ericsson cell phone that I bought, and after using it 2 times in 3 days I fell in love with the phone model (the K750i -unlocked International version) and ended up buying it 2 days later from TigerDirect.  So always look for online interactive models, where you can click on the different parts to mimic you using it, or at least watch a video clip of it if they have one on the website as you will get to see more of what it looks like through the menus, etc.

<Title>GUYS, I'm finally giving up the fight.  wimpy iPod it is.
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for a non-Apple mp3 player with a central-navigation-button that CLICKS.  CLICKS!  Got CLICK?  CLICKING is for MEN who either own a hog (NYSE: HOG), or wish they led a life where they didn't look stupid owning a fat motorcyle (those of you in suits or with military officer hair).  The popular and fairy trend of all mp3 players, both iPods and those thoughtless companies which produce devices modelled after iPods, is to use the sensual button technology, requiring you to pet, feel-up, stroke, caress, massage, soothe, tickle, and finger-blast the front panel of your music player.  I cannot stand those buttons, and if you have any testosterone running thru your delicate fingers, you shouldn't either.  If you feel comfortable with these new age strokey buttons, you should also have no problem proudly displaying a pink mp3 player for your homees, or a dildaically-themed device.  These fingerpuff buttons on the iPod, et all, are squirrely, hard to use, they overshoot, and I feel like a white collar hand-model pansy using them.  Frankly, even if those buttons worked, they still take forever to scroll thru menus.  The Toshiba Gigabeat S, however, not only has the cross-bar navigation button with a strong masculine clickable button that really puts hair on your chest, but also is built on top of a Windows platform that's a dream in terms of user friendliness.  Throw away the instruction book as far as navigating the device, it's that easy.  THEN throw away the Toshiba Gigabeat S.  Yeah, you heard me right.  Send the Toshiba Gigabeat S back to where you bought it for a full refund, cuz everything else about it STINKS ON ICE.  1.  Transferring media still sucks.  Apple figured out, that in order to create a music experience which didn't require you swearing in front of your children, throwing expensive furniture around the room like a teenage girl dealing with puberty, and having your blood boil you into a hospital visit, it was necessary to not only build and design the hardware, but also to build the software, and the internet service TOGETHER-- sorta like having triplets.  You dress them the same, you grow them up the same, you make them like each other and behave, and you get lots of time savings cuz driving 3 kids the same age to the same school and same soccer practise is a nice bennie.  Back to topic, Apple figured this out, and all the competitors are STILL struggling with it.  Tons of problems STILL occur with simple transfers, just like every other player I've had built on "To Go" or "Plays For Sure" MSFT technology.   This is what you get when you have a system where Yahoo or Napster or Windows Media Player provides your music, a Japanese company provides your hardware, and MSFT provides all your software.  It's a nightmare.  I'm fed up.  Been fighting the iPod monopoly since the craze started, since I like subscription music idea better than having to continuously buy music, but it's getting impossible to fight it anymore.  I've torched too much money into technology that doesn't work.  Thanks Microsoft, no wonder Bill Gates quit.  2.  It's a plastic model motorcycle, not a real one:  ie)  CHEAPLY BUILT. I dropped the Toshiba Gigabeat S 60GB on the floor-- ONCE.  Kablooey, the screen busted like a bullet had hit the center of it.  I phoned Toshiba, and they gave me a center to send it, which I did.  When they called back, they said it would cost 325 clams to repair!  Side Note:  A NEW one (in October, a mere 3 months after initial release at the $400 price point), now that Toshiba and MSFT have failed yet again, is now $270 on Amazon which includes tax and shipping.  Can you do math in your head?  $325...$270...$325...$270.  So I said to the phone, "well Toshiba can go "F" themselves for that amount of money", to which they replied, we're not Toshiba!  Apparently Toshiba just sends their cruddy hardware over here, and lets other deal with it when it turns out to be crappola.  So I told the nice outsourced repair people (they were very angry people right from "hello"), either send the device to Toshiba along with my note, or send it back to me.  They said, "that'll be $80, $15 shipping, and $65 for our expert inspection".  So the Toshiba Gigabeat S lasted one dropping.  For reference friends and nieghbors, I've dropped my Blackberry at least once per week for the past two years, and while I have a screen that has some minor scratchies on it, it still works like a charm.  Basically, Toshiba didn't do any drop tests that Blackberry does, and their design is inferior with cheap parts.  3.  MSFT threw in the towel.  Plays For Sure is now over, so Yahoo, Napster, Wal-Mart, Real, and anyone else that decided to jump onto MSFT's bandwagon have been left behind in favor of the new Zune player.  Sorry MSFT, but the Zune doesn't sound exciting.  It's made by Toshiba, and is essentially a Gigabeat S with a wheel istead of the cross-bar, which is why I bought the Cruddy Toshiba in the 1st place.  Furthermore, Yahoo's subscription service is the cheapest around, and money matters.  So unless the Zune subscription (which MSFT hasn't even talked about, so there's no gaurantee it will even offer subscription IF it comes out this November) is cheaper than $10 per month which is likely impossible (Yahoo can make the difference on some search and other ad revs), I am moving to iPod.  Since I am no longer willing to bet on an unsure thing, as I've burned $400 on this POS Toshiba, there's not a chance in Hades I'm going to put more money into MSFT's first experiment with hardware design.    I'm tired, and defeated.  I put my trust in Plays For Sure, and MSFT is now throwing that aside.  What if the Zune is thrown aside too?  Only gaurantee, is that Apple and music players that work will be around a long time.    If I sound like a typical Apple supporter, you must not have caught my drift.  This advice comes from some one that despises Jobs and Apple, from some one that attended CES last January (2006) and was very excited to get a Toshiba Gigabeat S as it seemed to FINALLY be the player we've all been waiting.  I waited, and I waited, and I waited, and then finally in July I got the device which was promised in January, delayed in April, May, June... and now I'm waiting again.  What's the point?  There's an Apple store less than one block from where I write this review.  How long will it take me to take the plunge, and finally get something that will work for 2-3 years?  Sink myself into the eventual monopoly that is iTunes, while watching the much-better subscription model die an ugly death.  Why am I still writing this, and not in the Apple store?  I just don't know.

<Title>Very Worthy Player !!
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I needed a player with no audio recording feature and narrowed my list to the iPod and the Gigabeat S. I've played with iPods before but wanted to go with something new. I read reviews and settled for the Gigabeat S 60  Great decision!!! I'm loving it!! I've had no problems using WMP 10 to sync up with the player as I've read in other reviews.  My one concern was ripping CDs I've created from previous mp3 files, and WMP not recognizing the track, artist, etc.  I was right. It did'nt. But using the album search function in WMP, I was able to find the right albums and it updated all the info correctly so I did'nt have to type in any infomation. Overall...I think this is a great product right up there with the iPod for a little less $$. Pros    - Great looking device.    - Slick and easy to use interface.    - Videos and pics look great.    - Interface to WMP 10 works fine. Cons    - Battery life    - The stupid earbuds!! They sound fine but whats with the different     wire lengths?!?! Since the left one is shorter it keeps trying to come     out of your left ear. WTF!!!??

<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I actually tried to stop shipment of the product after I read the reviews AFTER I placed my order.  It was too late to cancel so I figured I would give it a try even though others have been plagued by problems.  I already belonged to Napster and it immediately recognized the product and music downloaded seamlessly.  I had WAY more trouble (as in I am going to throw this thing out the window)  with Napster's own MP3 player which I bought previously.  I also joined Vongo and downloaded movies without any trouble.  I also was able to download music from Windows Media without a glitch.  I am an E-tard by nature and I really found this to be the easiest MP3 player of the 3 I own.  The capacity is amazing for the price.  It sounds great.  I have had no issues with the battery life since you can charge it with the included AC adapter or right in your USB port.  It sounds great...I bought a cheap $10 cassette adapter at Walmart and it sounds as good as my Boston Aucoustics CD player in my car.  I like the fact that it is not an Apple product and I am not involved with I-tunes monopoly.  The only thing I wish is that Toshiba would make some accessories such as a docking/speaker system.  I really cannot say enough about this product...do not be scared off by the bad reviews...and no, I don't work for TOSHIBA!!!

<Title>Gigabeat Experience
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I purchased my Gigabeat I was looking for a portable device that I could take on my frequent travels with audio capabilities first and foremost but also video (though I was not sure how much I would use the feature.)  Overall the Gigabeat hasn't disappointed.  The process of loading songs onto my Gigabeat went fairly smoothly although early on I did manage to erase all the files and had to reload them!?  My video use has been more limited so far.  The quality of the sound has been good and the display easy to use and read.  I purchased some Shure ear buds to replace the stock ones and they have been comfortable and enhanced the quality.  My primary complaints are twofold: 1) the battery life of the device seems poor in my experience.  Especially frustrating is that it seems to lose a charge even while turned off in my bag for extended periods of time (perhaps it is being jostled and turns itself on - not sure.) 2) I purchased a cover for the device from Zcover and discovered that it was very poorly designed and made.  The Zcover was supposedly custom for the Gigabeat but in fact was not configured correctly to match the locations of key buttons or the power connection and the overall cover was a bit too large for the Gigabeat.  A disappointing product.

<Title>Best thing since sliced bread or something
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third hard drive based MP3 player. The first was an Archos, then the Dell DJ20, but I craved more space for my music and wanted to be able to play videos. I will admit I am a PC person and don't care for Macs, so I wanted to avoid being locked into iTunes. Media Player for Windows is finally where it should have been 4 years ago and it has proven to be stable and quick for me. I did not install the Gigabeat software and use only Media Player. For those of you who have used Red Chair Software's hackware, I was hoping that they would develop something for the Toshiba but to date they have not. If Creative had come out with a 60 GB player when I purchased this Toshiba they would have had more of a chance to compete but I wanted the space.  The player itself has very easy menus. Even I could figure out how to use it.  About the only complaint on menuing I can give is that the scrolling doesn't wrap around. For example, if you seach by song title and it starts with a W you would prefer to go "up" to zip through the Z's rather than "down" to start at A.  It would save time.  The USB port being included on the main unit rather than a dongle like the Cowon unit is a plus.  The lack of iPod-like accessories is a bit perturbing but I understand all those people that bought the iPod would have a larger voice in the marketplace. The unit recharges okay, and with the Harmonics setting switched to Off it doesn't drain the battery like it did with the factory settings. The Dell DJ, a much larger unit, had an endless battery life but did not play videos or have a color screen.  Toshiba may be manipulated by either Apple or Microsoft because they don't have this unit in Best Buy, Circuit City or Target stores near as I can tell. It's hard to sell if you don't have it in the channel.  It is a great unit and I urge you to consider it if you are looking for a hard disk based mp3 player capable of playing videos. It's a Zune without the hype.

<Title>Gigabeat 60 GB - Lots of Room in here
<Date>Sun May 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With so much room it swallowed up my entire catalog of 513 albums, and over 2,300 songs in no time flat and still had over 45 GB to spare! That's including over 1,000 high quality photos!   Easy to use with Windows Media Player (though I'd rather use Real Player). Simple drag and drop adds any files you want.  The video playback is as good as any other media players on the market with a slightly bigger screen to boot.  My only complaint is the volume level is too low. It may be to protect my own ears, but I like my sound loud, and it only gets a 5 on a scale of 11 for loudness.   Overall, excellent product for the money.

<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've just been using the Gigabeat for the past couple of weeks.  No problems with Media Player 11, no problems with sync, very good sound (as good as wife's apple), very nice features, easy to use, holds tons of stuff, can use subscription services as well (which was the key reason i bought it over the iPod).  Ads informed me that it had battery life of 12 or more hours on a full charge.  So far I have yet to make it to 5 or 6.  I put the settings at dim backlight, almost never on after a button is pressed and still found it horrible.  I contacted toshiba, and all they could tell me is that it generally last for 4-6 hours on an average.  My wife plays her Ipod at work for 8 hours and still uses it at home.  Very disappointed as I was really excited about all of the write-ups on this product.  I was really expecting it to be at least close to the ipod and better in regards to subscription services, etc.  Not happy with the battery life at all.  If you don't mind short life on continuous play, everything else about it is very nice.  Maybe I have a lemon in the batch.  I spoke with Toshiba customer service and they blamed possible settings in Media player, but couldn't tell me where to find these same settings.  I went through all the possibilities and couldn't find anything that was set inappropriately.  They also informed me that I could bring it to a service department, no refunds.  Oh well, live and learn.

<Title>Great MP3 player, very sleek and stylish...
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this MP3 player for several reasons: the usual not wanting to be an Ipod drone, desire for lossless WMA playback, and large storage.  The Gigabeat has served me well in the 4 months I have had it.  I suggest (as with any piece of PC equipment) to make sure you have the latest drivers for Windows, motherboard drivers, and the newest version of WMP.  The Gigabeat has not had a firmware update since release but this has been no problem for me.  When I first hooked my Gigabeat up, I had astonishingly slow transfer times and hangups (often requiring restart).  I was frustrated beyond belief and wanted to break/return the player.  However, I caught a quick snippet online about an external storage device performing slowly off a front USB port.  So, I switched the cable to the back, and voila! no problem since then.  So, having a custom built computer, I probably have something hooked up wrong from the mobo to the front USB (another issue).  The Gigabeat has very fast synching in WMP (including 40 MB WMA files)  The menu system on the gigabeat is fast and colorful, the album art is a plus.  Only being able to make a "quick list" in the player once you have the music on is a bummer.  However, you can always go back and make playlists in WMP and just sync them over.  The Gigabeat also has good sound quality.  The only other major downside is a lack of accesories for the Gigabeat.  I found an armband on Ebay for when I work out but the piece of crap isn't skin tight on the player as advertised (not Toshiba's fault).  All in all, I'm willing to take a few downsides of the player and still give 5 stars, ESPECIALLY when you consider the alternatives.  The price on these is at times amazing so don't snooze!

<Title>Solid iPod alternative (if you can deal with quirks)
<Date>Tue May 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Gigabeat about 5 months ago, and I have to say I've been pretty satisfied. I'm not a fan of iTunes and I have all my music stored on my Media Center PC, so the Gigabeat was a logical choice. Sound quality is great, and the navigation system kills Apple's, hands down. The click wheel may be trendy, but the Gigabeat controls are functional. The Gigabeat also beats the iPod in storage convenience...it shows up as an external drive in Windows, and allows syncing to multiple computers (it's much less painful than iTunes).  Video is good, although the WMV conversion process is so slow that it's impractical unless you run it overnight. Photos are beautiful. The radio sucks (I receive maybe 2 stations).  The big killer is the battery life. The problem is a stupid programming decision: pressing the power button does NOT power off the unit. It puts the unit into a low-power standby mode. Thus, the battery is ALWAYS draining, albeit slowly. I bought an accessory kit from Amazon which included a "travel charger" and car charger, both of which are portable (unlike the bulky adapter included in-box), and they've been absolutely vital. The player can hold up for 2-3 days of intermittent usage before it dies, and there's a tiny switch on the bottom which allows you to power it completely OFF if you really need to conserve power.  It has its other quirks; like the one time it cleared off all my music for no apparent reason. Mine also had a pretty bad crash and I had to mail it in for repairs, but the service was quick and left all my media intact on the player. Any player will have quirks, though. The Gigabeat's quirks are compounded by the fact that there is absolutely ZERO documentation on them, but they're not impossible to deal with.  All in all, it's an excellent player--especially if you're a user of Windows Media Center. Be ready to deal with a few quirky issues, but this is the most solid iPod alternative I've seen yet.

<Title>love it
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had couple of these and every one has performed beyond my expectations. The only reason I have ever had to replace it was theft and one unfortunate experience with an airline stewardess and a drink tray (lots of smoke. When I first got it I played with all the EQ settings. I turned harmonics on and my battery wouldnt last for squat. Turning harmonics off increased battery life almost 60 percent. I have never had any issues with it losing my music. It transfers easily and plays every time. If I could combine its ease of use and function with my Wolverine Data ESP's 120 gig hard drive and crisp screen I would have the greatest mp3 player around. My current gigabeat is 9 months old and has been all over the world with me. it gets tossed into a back pack and ran through airport security, people not watching where they are going, and over crowded over head compartments. It is still going strong. Job well done

<Title>Nice on the surface, corrupt underneath.
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had one for six months and have had to send it back for replacement four times.  It has very poor software and no documentation.  It has trouble playing protected files, and the hard drive gets corrupted at the drop of a hat.  Once corrupted, there is no fix except returning it for replacement because there is no mechanism for totally erasing the hard drive and restoring the player to a virgin condition.  There are virtually no accessories and it appears to me that Toshiba may abandon the product very soon, especially now that Microsoft has decided to make Zunes with another company.  (In case you didn't know, the Zune so far has been a Gigabeat in disguise.)

<Title>The pros far outweigh the cons
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did alot of careful research before buying the Toshiba Gigabeat. I hated Ipods, as everyone in my family would call me when they froze or crashed etc. I also am a big fan of Window Media PLayer 11, and hate Itunes. I wasnt sure whether I wanted a Zune or a Gigabeat, but the Zune seemed too new and needed to work the bugs out. I have had my Gigabeat for six months and luckily I have had few problems with it. The hard drive is so massive I have been filling it for months and still have 20GB left!! I especially love its compatibility with subscription services. I used it with Vongo sucessfully (but Vongo's selection of movies stunk so I cancelled, nothing against the Gigabeat) However it is MTV's Urge that I use most often with the Gigabeat, which is also seemlessly integrated into WMP11. I download albums at will, quickly at that. The only problems I have had with the Gigabeat, 1) I have had some issues with deleting unwanted songs. I delete them from my library, but after synching, they are still on the Gigabeat! 2) Not to beat a dead horse, but the battery life is quite diappointing, a compared to what is promised. Turn off harmonics, and lower the backlight time, and that helps, but it still is miserable compared to some players. 3) It did freeze on me twice in six months, but that was easily remedied by shutting the battery completely off by a tiny siwtch on the back. I'm not sure if I'm just lucky, but my Gigabeat has had few of the quirks mentioned in the other reviews, and everyone who has used mine wants to buy one afterward. I love it, and it has become an intregal part of my life! Highly recommended!

<Title>bad choice
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We also did the research and thought this was the best from all reviews read. I bought it in january and it worked for a couple of weeks and then died work--screen froze.  amazon sent a replacement. it worked for well for two months (except we couldn't download tv shows recorded on our PC in Media Center XP), then screen froze and it would only turn on if plugged into the ac adapter. By this time, we had to return it to Toshiba. When we got it back, it was not fixed.  Just sent it back to toshiba again. we'll see.  It's a lot of money to spend on something that doesn't work.

<Title>Good user interface/Poor performace
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have this unit for about 4 months now. Knowing what I know now, I would not buy again. Good: - I like the MCE interface. It's intuitive and easy to use.  - Small, light weight and portable. - Was cheap when I bought it.  Bad: - Battery life is short (5-6 hrs for music). For my next player, I need something that will last me a whole week of commuting (10 hrs). - User interface needs some more refinement. For example, there's no way to sort a play list on the fly. It is sorted as it is listed in Windows. Since the interface is created by Microsoft, and now that Zune is out, it is unlike to ever be updated. This is a dead end product. The Zune uses an identical interface. Get the Zune if you want this unit. - Corrupted twice when I plugged into the computer for syncing. It happened twice during the first month but none since. It's not a big deal to re-sync the MP3s but for videos, it's a pain especially if you have a lot of videos to re-encode. - I hate the ipod but it got me green with envy when I went shopping for a dock/speakers.  In term of performance, the unit works fine, the sound is good, and it's EASY to use. If that's all you'll need and you can find it for cheap, get it. But for the battery life, lack of assc, and corruption issues, I would not buy again.

<Title>The gigabeat S is just a prototype for zune
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good product, the only thing is that it will delete all the stuff that's on it even if you look at it funny. I have had it delete my all my music and videos and pictures on it that took hours to put on in an instant. And what's worse is it happened more than once, 7 times is to many. So in the end would i recommend this product. To someone I don't like yes. Otherwise I highly recommend getting a microsoft zune. And it is just a really really bad prototype for the microsoft zune anyway, trust me I sold this player and bought a zune. The interface is the same, bigger screen, more color variety. What do you have to lose with the zune, memory? If that is the case you can just wait until the zune 2.0 comes out later this year.

<Title>Fantastic Portable Media Center!
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Toshiba have managed to produce an excellent portable media player that offers a massive specification over rivals. If you have an interest in Windows Media Center 2005/Vista Ultimate/XBOX 360 then this is the product for you as it is fully compatible with all and offers synchronisation of music, pictures, recorded TV and video. The display is very bright and clear and the sound quality from the head phones is great. This product would have got five stars if the USB connector was better and if it shipped with a protective case! Wonder what the Zune will be based on??

<Title>Teensy Videos, an UPDATE
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been using flash players to organize my moods and activities with music in combination with Windows Media Player, but recently a change in our household setup provided an opportunity to download our whole music catalogue onto one player.  I selected the Toshiba 60 Gigabeat. It's solid, easy to load and works as promised, and at a very reasonable price, too. My concern surrounded the "video" feature. Why would anyone watch video on a 2.5" screen? Silly idea.  And yet. Programs from the TIVO Series 2 download automatically to our computer. From there it's just a moment to download programs onto the Toshiba and there are many, many programs which work nicely on a handheld device. It's probably not satisfying for displaying an action-adventure, but your favorite series and talk shows are vividly presented. The crisp picture offers bright, saturated color, even to my old eyes.  I considered the Zune, but with half the storage and the unnecessary wireless feature (unnecessary to me), the Toshiba seemed like a more practical solution.  11.26.06 UPDATE: I still give it 5 stars. Love this thing. Not that some experiences aren't unfortunate, but I can see where some people might run into trouble. Consider:  Depending on how your Windows Media Player (or other software) is set up, some files on the ToshGB might 'disappear.' If files don't exist in the 'home' list because they were moved or deleted, then those files might be removed from the player unit when next connected. Check the 'synch' options in your media software.  Battery problem? Maybe -- just maybe -- you have the unit plugged into an outlet that is operated by a light switch. If the switch is off, no power to feed the player (hey, we've all been there). Not the player's fault. Or possibly you are charging the player via USB on your computer? If the computer goes into sleep or hibernate mode, then power charging stops.  Just two issues that might help.  Husband watching the game, I'm watching Jon Stewart. In our particular home space, hooked up to a Tivoli, it delivers beautiful sound for two solid days without recharging. Simple to operate. Lovely to look at. Done.  05.05.07 UPDATE: Still works. Still holds a charge. Still accepts downloads after upgrading to Windows Media Player v11 and Vista software. It continues to be a very fine bit of technology and I enjoy using it very much.

<Title>Dead in 5 days
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>During the first four days of its life I liked my Gigabeat 60. Its interface is intuitive, and the sound is good.  In fact, I ordered a second unit for my wife.  I don't play videos so whatever problems there are there is of no concern to me.  The only problem during this honeymoon was that the battery was dead every morning.  I assumed this was due to operator incompetency and wowed to plug it in every night.   However now, on day five the unit is dead. Toshiba service does not answer the phone, I cannot find any helpful information on the web.  They are both going back.   at in Florida

<Title>DON'T BUY IT if you value your data and time!
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>WARNING: At least 8 out of 36, or MORE THAN 22% OF AMAZON REVIEWERS, have reported mysterious software/hardware crashes and subsequent data loss with this unit. Do not buy this product. I, like several others writing reviews of this unit (and its cousin the 30GB model) got burned by the GigaBeat. I'm pissed off about it, but I will be as objective as possible in describing my experience to you.  FULL REVIEW: This unit is slickly designed, has great features, and tons of storage. The Microsoft OS and cross-shaped thumb control interface are both very intuitive...I liked them way better than the iPod jog wheel. Once you install the special-version Windows Media Player software that ships with the unit, it is easy to upload files to the unit and retrieve content from it. The GigaBeat also worked well with my digital camera, enabling me to download photos from my camera to the unit's hard drive directly via a USB cable. I found the battery life acceptable: at least 4-5 hours playing MP3 files.  Unfortunately, this unit is also incredibly unstable and prone to frequent and mysterious data loss. My decision to place my trust in the stability of this unit resulted in tragedy, as my Gigabeat's hard drive failed within 45 days of its initial use and I lost a ton of irreplaceable data. Despite well documented stability/data loss issues with this unit, Toshiba customer service was downright rude to me and provided no assistance in recovering from this situation - in fact, they even acted to prevent me from recovering my own precious data from the GigaBeat's drive!   Don't be misled by the 4+ stars overall Customer Rating. Read all the reviews word for word. As of this writing, including my review, at least 8 out of 36 Amazon reviewers have reported mysterious software/hardware crashes and subsequent data loss with this unit. That's over 22% of customers! Since when is it acceptable to launch such an expensive product into the market when less than 80% of them actually work consistently? Toshiba should be ashamed.   Like any computer user, I understand that disk drives inevitably fail at some point. However, if a vendor sells me a $300 (what I paid) piece of electronics that fails in less than two months, I expect at least an ounce of compassion and respect from their service department. Well, Toshiba sold me a lemon and could care less to help me out.  I will spare all the gory details because I am contemplating taking legal action against Toshiba for putting such a lemon product into the market. But in brief:  1) My Gigabeat's hard drive randomly failed one day when I went to turn on the unit, and Toshiba refused to provide any assistance whatsoever in helping recover the data I had stored on it. They simply told me that all they could do is take the unit back and refurbish/reformat the drive and reload the system software.  2) Despite the obvious existence of a data loss problem with this unit - again, read all of the Amazon reviews - Toshiba refused to refer me to a third-party data recovery company that was authorized to work on the hard drive in this unit, even though I volunteered to pay for any data recovery service charges myself. Something is clearly unstable with the GigaBeat, yet Toshiba has no plans or preparations to help customers that experience data loss. This is inexplicable to me.  3) The unit's hard drive uses a proprietary interface that prevented several data recovery services I hired from accessing the drive. When both they and I contacted Toshiba to obtain a simple part that enabled access to the drive, Toshiba refused to provide it. To repeat...their unstable product caused my data loss, I'm paying for the data recovery services out of my own pocket, and yet they still actively prevented the potential recovery of my priceless data (pictures from a dream vacation that had been planned for years).  To make matters worse, the Toshiba service reps and service manager were cold and unsympathetic at every turn. For example, they refused to tell me the model number of the hard drive in this unit...even though I OWNED it! Again, inexplicable. These are the kind of maddening interactions you can look forward to if you choose to buy this unit and then experience a problem.  I truly felt that on paper the GigaBeat was superior to the iPod in nearly every way. Unfortunately, I overlooked the most important factor. Whatever you do, don't forget to include product stability and quality in your buying decision - and this unit gets a big red F in that department.      CONCLUSION: Just be aware that buyers who rated the GigaBeat positively have not experienced the data loss problems endemic to this unit. That is understandable. Based on features and price alone, I also would rate the GigaBeat as 5 stars. The only problem is, using Amazon as a sample, more than 22% of the people who buy this product suffer from crashes and lost data. To me, that quality record is absolutely unacceptable for an electronics product in this day and age, and every day I regret the fact that I bought this unit before many of the current Amazon reviews had been posted.  So if you don't mind spending hours and hours reloading data on to the unit, potentially having to return it to Toshiba within weeks of your purchase, and battling with horrible service reps all along the way - and you have backups of all the files you put on it - the GigaBeat is a good value. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.

<Title>Awesome device... however.... (read)
<Date>Sun Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE THING.  The interface is absolutely amazing, looks clean and the screen effecs add an extremely nice touch. The buttons on the side, I think, work much better than a silly-ol' click wheel on an iPod, but that's just me. Now on to why I give this bad(litterally..?)boy a 3 out of 5.  I eaglery opened my package last monday very late night getting home from a friend's place. I quickly looked over the quick start guide.  "...charge device for 3 hours before intial use..."   Gotcha!  I leave it charging over night knowing it'll stop charging when it reaches full. I wake up early next morning and grab the gigabeat, and race to my computer. I install the enclosed disc's software which contains WMP10 and the horfixes nessecary for syncronizing the gigabeat.   Done!  I forget about the usb cable, I run back to my room, snatch up the cable and jack in.   Uploading my library...  Whew! 22gbs of music... I turn on the TV and patiently try to wait for the dang thing to upload all ths songs. about 20 minutes laters, Ding, finshed.  I go to my friends house later on in the night to show off my awesome gizmo and transfer some music to his computer. We have some freinds come over and we decide, hey, lets really try this thing out!@  I plug in my input/output sound cable in my friend's stereo auxiliary port, and oh yeah, music.  Sooo, we're busy all messing arround and having a blast a few hours later... and than... no music.  I look over and click the back arrow. Nothing happens. I try again. Again nothing.  SO I look over at my friend in confusion, and he's like did you fully charge it? I said "yeah", and he said, "doesn't it last 12 hours or something?"  yeah..?  We look at the clock its only 3AM, we had it playing from 10PM almost exactly (9:58ish). So only 5 hours of audio? I give up, and put it on the charger and pass out. I wake up, notice that it's fully charged, and wake up my friend. We let it play through my head phones continously to test it out thinking that maybe becuase it was jacked in the streeo it was draining power faster than the norm. This time it dies in just 4 hours in 45 minutes. I get frustrated and try one more time. 4 hours and roughly 53 minutes.  I gave up and went home, and contacted amazon asking for a replacement. It should be arrving monday, so I will update this.  again, the product is amazing, crystal clear audio and screen, extremely easy to use interface (although it doesn't have a clock which I think is retarded), and the Lock button doesnt feel like its going to break in a million pieces... *caugh*nano*caugh*.  Be back for part two. DUN DUN DUN!

<Title>1 Star on the first day, but I was way off!  Buy it!  DAMN!  IT JUST DIED!  DON"T BUY IT!
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>BACK TO 1 STAR.  READ FULL REVIEW.  Admittedly I was ripping my hair out on the first day I owned this player.  It seemed as though the battery life was terrible, and there appeared to be issues with the way it stored music.  I was completely wrong.  Give the battery a few cycles and you'll be impressed.  Yesterday it lasted over 10 hours.  The one thing that is essential is that you use this player with Media Player 11.  Trust me on this one.  It was MP10 that made my first day hell with this thing because of how it treats ID tags.  WM11 is nothing short of a breakthrough.  You'll love the interface and it's far better than ITunes.  It's the perfect companion to the Gigabeat.  Finally, it was Rhapsody music service that made this player worth it.  For $14.99 you can subscribe to "Rhapsody to Go."  Imagine how great it would be to just grab the latest albums and dump them onto your player...all for one flat monthly fee.  It's really made this player a joy to have.    So there you have it.  With a bit of patience this player is absolutely worth it.  Tiny size, great screen, and an intuitive interface for a fantastic price.    -------------------------------------WARNING!!! IMPORTANT NEW INFO!!! First I hated it. Then I loved it. Then IT DIED. After just one month of ownership I eventually came to love this device. Today I powered it up, and got this message: "contact manufacturer for repair." That's it. It's over. What a shame that such a great looking and functional player has so many problems. Toshiba's tech support is horrific. Don't buy this. Look to the Creative Zen M 60. I had the 30GB version and loved everything but it's capacity. That's my next purchase. I'm done with Toshiba!!!

<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great piece of technology and you should consider it before you go off and buy an Ipod.   I've had mine for about a month now and I love it.  No problems or difficulties have been encountered.  1. Ease of use: Using it with windows media 10 is a sinch,  in fact my 15 year old first transferred my music onto it for me.  Within the first 2 hours we had over 600 songs loaded. (And that was using the slower method of drag & drop).  When you sync files it is much faster . I love the way it shows the album covers for the music you're playing.  The controls are also very easy to use and learn.  2. Build quality: It feels solid and well built. I've dropped mine a couple of times... no problems.  3.   Appearance:  The unit looks great and the display is beautiful.  4.   Capacity:  60GB... More than you can get anywhere else for the price!  Which brings me to price.  5.   Price:  Varies but I got mine for $188.00 on Ebay.   6.   Battery Life:  Not the best but mine has never run out during use.      I think the reason that most people complain about the battery life      is that the screen is so beautiful that you want to see it lighted      all the time. This will drain the battery more quickly.  7.  Picture viewing:  The unit is great for viewing digital images of    various types.  8.  Sound quality:   Great. I am not an audiophile but it gives great response Bass highs and midrange even with the stock earphones.  Only problem is I now have to buy one for my wife.  :-)   STOP THE PRESSES!!! (A few weeks later)  Ok so I said that this is a great player. And generally it is. However within days after I wrote my first review the battery in my Gigabeat failed. Therefore it will now only play when the A/C adapter is connected. So it's no longer a portable media player but just a media player. I contacted Toshiba through their website and they responded (quickly) giving me a 1-800 number to call. First call they said to try turning off the battery switch and waiting 30 mins and then turn it back on. That did not work. Second call and we'll see what happens. I'll keep you posted.

<Title>Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB
<Date>Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice little player, love the color black and silver. It only works with windows media, wma format. It comes with an USB cable that allows you to plug it into your computer and connect it to the player. When you do that it will synchronize it self with windows media player, you can then follow the instruction and upload your music. For uploading my music I just bypass the synchronize process and just drag and drop the files into the player. Simple and fast, the Gigabeat will organize your files in different categories by, artiste, albums, genres, and more. It comes with a FM radio, no AM   It will also convert the files to wma format. For a movie it takes a long time to convert. The earphone is good, but one side is longer than the other don't know why the do that. Other than that it's perfect, have been using it for about a month with out any problems.  The screen it nice a bright but it's a little hard to see in the sun light.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new mp3 player.

<Title>Good player
<Date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a good player, especially if you get it at the discounted price. I use mine solely for music but it does allow for movies, photos, etc. A minor drawback is that I am yet to find a shuffle button. Also it can be hard to tell when it's off or not (screen goes black to save power after idleness), and since there is no auto shut off, your battery can drain without you knowing (like if you put it down thinking it's off when it's not then you walk away for a few hours).   It is very easy to navigate though and overall I am quite pleased with it. Just like any new toy, you need to get used to the configuration and location of buttons so don't get discouraged too early.

<Content>This mp3 player is great for anyone who never wants to have to think about deleting or changing the music on their player, just adding to it.  Easy to understand quick start guide gets you going in clear concise fashion, and this player will play a variety of music formats.  Good sound quality.  Also plays downloaded video on tv and has good picture quality, if you care about that.

<Title>Reasonable Alternative to iPod...
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: The gigabeat is considerably cheaper for more capacity than an iPod.  It is compatible with Plays For Sure and Vongo (movie download service).  Nice screen, although suited more for watching short recordings than full length movies.  Pretty easy to transfer almost any video in mpg or wmv to player (although mpg's require conversion to wmv's through MediaPlayer).  Cons: Battery life is not very good, I average maybe 7 hours.  The interface of the player is much sloppier than that of an iPod (play/pause, forward track, back track are on the side of the player and are pretty easy to accidentally bump).  MediaPlayer is a VERY buggy program, when you set it up to auto-sync there are often duplicate albums and other weird problems.  I recommend using something else to transfer your music and videos (even just drag and drop).  The player has slow response times when advancing tracks sometimes (a couple of seconds or more).  Overall:  Though I listed a lot of cons, I really do like the player.  It is very nice not being tied down to iTunes as the only major source of legal downloadable music, and the battery life issue isn't all that important to me - it made it Pittsburgh to Paris playing almost the entire flight.

<Title>Very Satisfied with my Gigabeat
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So yes, I while ago I was looking for an mp3 player. I wanted something good, something with a good amount of space, and something that could possibly play video.  I found the gigabeat and thought wow! But then I saw the reviews....I was really worried but there was always warranties just incase. I did read somewhere that's it's just the user possibly and not neccessarily the item. It's definately not as easy to use as an Ipod but as long as you know how to use it, it works well  It does what I wanted it to do, hold and play my music, excellently. I've changed settings for maximum battery conservation for example brightness to 1 (still very visible, don't even notice it) backlight timeout to 1 (used to have it at 5) you shouldn't need it that much (i like my electronice items to not have the backlight on, just general habit of battery saving.) I have not had a problem with the battery dying, except of course having used it literally all day and running out at midnight.  had that whole  data deletion problem once. but now I just follow procedure. when just charging, turn it off, wait a bit, then plug it into the computer. when syncing (which I don't have set to auto) turn it on, wait a couple secs, hook it up, sync, wait for it to be finished syncing then either unplug (don't close WMA) and it will finish by itself OR close WMA (which causes the gigabeat to finish by itself) then unplug. don't turn off or on constantly/back and forth/while plugged in.  have a slight problem with video conversion, but was solved using my own convertor with WMA.  the whole tag things is still a problem...I wish the music would go how I already have my music heirarchy....oh well. I'm gonna have to spend a good day fixing up all my tags...ugh. but that's not neccessarily the gigabeat's fault.  you have to know what you're doing when using this, unlike an Ipod. takes some comp knowledge and common sense.  Not sure what else I should write here, but I am very satisfied =)

<Content>This portable media player from Toshiba is pretty cool.  It's very easy to use. In fact, I figured out how to use it right after I took it out from the box.  The only thing that I don't like about it is that some of the video that I have on it, seems to glitch sometimes... otherwise I would have given this product 5 stars...I like this better than the Ipod personally...

<Title>So far so good...but could be better
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I've had thing for about a month now and as far as i can tell, Toshiba has made a good product that has some flaws but also many many more pros than cons that make me really appreciate the gigabeat.    Lets first start off with the flaws...First of all, and the biggest one in my opionion is that its very complicated trying to get any sort of movie on here.  Ive treid numerous encoding programs, converters and all other sorts of things but still ive had little luck.  Ive gotten Gladiator on here but the problem is that the audio gets away from the movie about a half hour in and the picture is pixelated a lot.  The second flaw is the battery life isnt the greatest.  I used to own a creative zen photo and the battery life on it was a lot worse so let me tell you this is a step up from i used to have but still it could be better.  The easiest solution to this problem is to charge it at night when im sleeping, and sense the backlight is on while it charges, put something over it and then you wont be bothered by the light coming from the screen while youre sleeping.  Other flaws include the absense of a 1 track repeat mode, the black finish and the screen show every fingerprint, and smudge on it and it gets kind of annoying but you eventually learn to deal with it.    The cons well, its 60 gb first of all, which holds all of my 3700+ songs and a movie and still has 41 gb left of space on it, so im really impressed by it. Second of all, the screen is amazing. Everything is so clear and the screen is so much bigger than i expected it to be, especially for an mp3 player but with the large screen comes less battery life, so it gets used sparingly.  The sound quality is great, but the equalizer settings could use some help, cuz there is only a slight difference in the setting and the only way you can really notice it is if your ears are really sensitive.  I turn mine off cuz i have some pretty decent headphones.  I wish it had a customizable EQ but its no big deal.  The interface is really easy to use, everything is all laid out for you, very 'dummy proof' for lack of a better term.  The quicklist or playlist-on-the-go setting is very nice, which allows you to make up your on list of songs you want to listen to certain songs and what not.  I prefer the tactile buttons on this gigabeat over the touch screen because touch screens are so sensitive and tempermental to use at times, so its a big plus for me.  All of the buttons on the side are a little wierd to get used to but after having this for a while you get used to it very quickly.  The unit seems very sturdy and very durable, I am way more comfortable with this in my pocket while walking around school than i would be with an ipod or anything else.  Plus i got a really good deal on it so for the price this unit is very much worth every penny.  Well this is getting kind of long so to all you who decide to purchase, enjoy it, i know i am!

<Title>My experience so far with the gigabeat
<Date>Tue Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my gigabeat in febuary 2007. The night after I got it, it stopped being able to charge, and it wouldnt recognize the battery for some reason, but I turned the battery on and off over and over and then it started back up.Three days after I bought it, all the songs magically got removed, vanished. I was a little nervous but put all my songs back on anyway. It was alright during the month of march, with no problems. Then a about a week ago,when i finished syncing some songs to it and pulled out the usb plug, all the songs vanished again. I was annoyed, and put them back on, which took awhile. Then today, the gigabeat stopped recognizing the battery again. I frantically turned the battery on and off. nothing. When i plugged it into the charger, it turned on but then without me doing any thing it turned off. so basically, it won't work when its not in the charger. I know your thinking "oh that couldnt happen to me" but it will. I garuntee that the gigabeat will dissapoint you. Cnet don't know what they're talking about. DO NOT BUY IT! GET THE 80 GIG IPOD!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!

<Title>Never a dull moment

<Content>By my title I mean that in a couple of ways:  downloading music and using the player great screen and audio.  As far as downloading I probably have a couple of culprits that aren't the Gigabeat.  I have Vista and Napster which I know have plenty of glitches.  When none of these are encountered this thing is a breeze to load up and use.  It's a great product, not deserving of the negatives I have read.  It takes some brain-power to use but it's worth it.  If anyone has any comments about my glitch issues I would be happy to hear them. Highly reccomended.

<Title>Great PMP Player
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item 3 weeks ago and can honestly say that I am very pleased with my purchase.  I was a little hesitant after reading some of the mediocre reviews about battery life and loss of files.  Well I already experienced the later issue with loss of files.  This occurred on my second day of use with the player.  I was attempting to sync with WMP 11 and the computer would not connect to the player.  I then clicked "reconnect to the device" and when this completed all my files were gone???  Well I never did figure out why this occurred and I have not experienced this issue since.    Now on to battery life...  I have not had any issue with battery life.  So far I have received continuous playback for over 6 1/2 hrs and 8 1/2 hours during a trip from NJ to VA and back.  After the 6 1/2 hr trip the battery indicator was only 1/4 of the way down and after the 8 1/2 trip back it was 1/2 down.  The player was connected to my car stereo, via cassette adapter, and the volume was at level 10.  (I can't rate how much more I got out of the battery after the trips because I used the player to show off video and pictures, which uses much more battery)  A very important thing to remember about getting optimal battery life is to limit the amount of time that the backlight on the screen is used.  Prior to my trip I created a playlist of music that would last over 11 hrs and then shuffled the music and hit the road.  I'm a little concerned that everyone who rates the battery at 4-5 hrs or less are manually changing songs, using the screen and draining the battery.  The unit ships with the backlight to remain on for 1 minute, this should be changed to 5 secs or 15 secs at the most.  There is a reason that the player only gets 2.5 hrs of video playback and 12 hrs of audio playback, but to get the benefit of 12 hrs audio you cannot continually use the screen.  I'm not saying that there are not defective units, just trying to keep expectations in order.  By the way, the sound quality on this player is incredible and once a song is done the next song is started without delay. (My old MP3 player would take 3-4 seconds to start the next song)  Other features.... Now here is the great thing about this player.  WMP 11 makes it so easy to add music, video, tv, pictures (takes a little while to get used to)(even better if you have Windows XP Media Center Edition).  Video and pictures on this little guy are very impressive and look extremely sharp.  It's great for sharing video taken with a digital camera with friends and family.    Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  The only thing that concerns me is that if all the songs disappear again.  I have over 30 gigs of music, video, and pictures on this and would be very disappointed if I would have to sync again.  By the way, music transfers are less than a second per song, very fast.

<Title>Looks good, but looks can be decieving.
<Date>Sat Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After I bought this product I was so excited.  I actually got this in the mail a day or two early so I was even more excited because I got to use earlier than I thought.  I opened up the package and started using it after I charged it to full.  The next day I had to teach a martial arts class and I had all the connections to connect it to the radio and I made sure it was fully charged before leaving.  After teaching an hour class before leaving I put the player to my ears to find that only after an hour the battery was dead.  For the next week the player continued to die during my classes even though it was fully charged.  I love the way this player looks, but the fact that it keeps screwing up on me pisses me off.  Until finally I returned it and bought the new zune player in brown.  Trust me, the toshiba is not worth the money, get the zune player, it's less gigabytes, but at least the battery won't die.

<Title>5 stars for design, but a lot less for functionality. 
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Gigabeat less than a week ago. Right off the bat, I was thrilled with the ease of the interface- I greatly prefer the nav ststem to the iPod's click wheel, I love the fact that it actually has a power button, and getting around was really simple and intuitive.   I loaded about 5 gigs of music on it, set some radio stations, and took it on a road trip.   The first half of the journey? Fantastic. Coming home, I got the low battery signal, and the player shut off by itself. I hadn't recharged it, because I had been going by the specs for battery life. I had only used it to play music, and I would estimate that the battery lasted about 75 % of the advertised time.   Still, I loved the product, until I fished it out of my purse and read an error message that it needed to be hooked up to my computer to update or reset the Portable Media Center (and to read my owner's guide for clarification.)  I looked in my owner's guide, and looked some more. Finally, after doing a search on "reset" (nothing useful came up with "update" or "Portable Media Center") the manual just advised to sync the Gigabeat with Windows Media Center.   I attempted to sync at least 10 times. More errors- I kept getting the "not working at this time- try again later" popup window.  I called Toshiba tech support, and they were at least friendly and helpful- but the best they could come up with was that the Microsoft software was corrupt, and they're sending shipping labels to FedEx it back . They said turnaround would be a week or so, that I'd have it back by Christmas. I don't have a lot of faith in this, primarily because of the negative stuff I have read here, but we'll see what happens.   I guess that if I have any other residual probs with it, I will just ship it back to Amazon for a replacement (or maybe a refund? I notice that the Gigabeat is $10 cheaper this week!), or maybe I'll just suck it up, give in to iTunes, and get another iPod.   12/07/06: I spoke to Toshiba on Monday, it is now late on Thursday night, and the FedEx Shipping labels that were promised to me have still not arrived. If I do not get them tomorrow, I am contacting Amazon for a replacement player. This is ridiculous.  12/11/06: Finally rec'd the tags from Toshiba in the mail- my husband convinced me to wait a week, and it took...a week. Ugh. Repackaged the unit and sent it in.   12/20/06: I have heard nothing thus far. I call Toshiba, and speak with Gary, who looks up my player by phone #, then puts me on hold for about 20 minutes (never a good sign). He comes back, says he's having a hard time locating my player, and that someone will call me back "sometime in the next two days." Which to me, seems pretty unacceptable, but there's not a whole lot I can do about it. The attitude is generally dismissive, and I definitely get the "dumb girl" vibe from him. Jerk.   My husband gets tired of my ranting and calls back, and somehow produces a more competent person, who has no problem producing the status of the device, and informing my husband that an e-mail was sent this morning with the status of the device. He forwards it to me. The diagnosis is "DEAD (intermittently) UNIT. TOSHIBA WILL EXCHANGE."   So presumably, I am getting a new one. At this point, I am just wishing that I has sent it back to Amazon, where I would have gotten a replacement unit within two days.   12/27/06: I got my replacement player this evening- brand new box (so I now have doubles of all the connectors, which is good, as well as a backup set of the abysmal earbuds, which is not so good.)   Loaded music back onto the player- everything looks great.   I am taking the 'beat on another roadtrip this week, and if it manages to survive, maybe I will up the star rating to the 5 stars this device deserves! In the meantime, I am adjusting the backlight setting and utilizing another tip from CNet- switching the harmonics to off- and I will see if that impacts battery time.    12/28/06: You've got to be kidding me!!!!  Right after I posted the update above, I picked up my Gigabeat to adjust the settings. I clicked the button a few times. There was NO POWER. Nothing. I checked to make sure the device wasn't locked. Maybe I had inadvertently left it on overnight and drained the power? So I plugged it in, and immediately noticed that there was no "battery charging" indicator. The unit was dead. I hadn't even LISTENED to it yet, just charged it and loaded some songs onto it, then scrolled through my music library. Then I turned it off and went to bed. The unit sat on my desk overnight, and that's as strenuous as it got.   Called Toshiba, spoke with Darla. They had me toggle the reset switch, etc, and finally agreed with my diagnosis (the words "expensive paperweight" may have been used.) They want me to send it back. They assure me that my experience is "unusual." Okay.    In the interest of science, I am going to send it back. At this point, I am curious to see what happens.   12/29/06: I slept on it, and decided to return the product through Amazon. That way, if I get another non-functioning player, I am dealing with their returns/refunds frogram, and not waiting a month for Toshiba to cut me a check.   I called Toshiba to explain that they didn't need to send the shipping labels, and spoke with Ray, who said, "Well, they've already been sent, so when they get there, just hold onto them in case you have more problems." Way to inspire confidence in your product, Ray!  Seriously? If I have a problem with the third one? It's going back to Toshiba in pieces.   1/2/07: A new year- a new gigabeat! Amazon got me my new one this afternoon. (Hear that Toshiba? THREE days, including the holiday weekend. Love Amazon!)  Moral of the story? That little slip that comes with the gigabeat, that says, "STOP! Don't return this product to the store!"   Yeah. There's a reason for that, and having experienced both Amazon and Toshiba customer service, I can say this with confidence. Go through Amazon. Toshiba customer service is strictly a 5 days a week, 8 hours a day operation, and the turnaround time is weeks, not days- not to mention, if you want a refund, you have to jump through a bunch of hoops (also weeks.)  So. I charged the gigabeat up, then loaded about 5 gigs of music onto it. Nothing has exploded or spontaneously combusted. (Yet.) I considered updating my WMP to 11, but decided not to chance it. I also didn't delete any of the pictures or music that came on the player, because at this point, I am superstitious. Can any of you blame me?   To cut to the chase, I uploaded stuff, and it still works. I am rocking out to Concrete Blonde as we speak. I am *cough cough* "cautiously optimistic". And yes, I am knocking on wood as I type this.    1/3/07- Ironically, the tags sent by Toshiba arrived today (the day after Amazon got me my replacement unit.) The new unit is still working perfectly, so it's already far exceeded the less than 24 hour lifespan of Gigabeat #2- hopefully, I won't have the occasion to use the return labels this time around. I am glad I have stuck it out this far, because I am loving Gigabeat #3!  2/5/07- Gigabeat #3 is still going strong. It is my constant companion through the day. With the harmonics off, and the screen switching off in a few seconds, my battery is lasting easily all day, which is great!  Judging from the shift of comments on Amazon lately, I am thinking that Toshiba has worked out some major bugs, because the most recent comments are overwhelmingly favorable.  It took me awhile to get a functional gigabeat- but I have to say, it was worth the wait!

<Title>The best sound/features. Great for large libraries.
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my gigabeat based on the review by PC world, who gave it flying colors for sound, ease of use, and bundled accessories. I recommend looking up their review for a good run down of the unit.  Like some other users here, i ran in to an issue syncing my library for the first time. The upload of my library to the 60 gig player took -8- hours, about 5 seconds a song, with the battery dying just at the end. Now, i'm using a custom built machine, with Vista beta, on WMP11 - so the quirk of a slow sync didn't suprise me, nor did the quirk of the unit either not charging fast enough, or just not charging, on the USB port it was using.   Either way i've learned that after adding media to the unit it must be disconnected from the computer before the unit will index the new media. If the unit dies before indexing, you'll have an empty library but the unit's hard drive will be full. A reformat of the unit from My Computer cleared the space, and i synced the unit from a different USB port, and had no trouble. I do not know if it will lose the index after the battery dies, down the road.  Aside from having to wait another 8 hours to get my music back on the unit, i've got to say compared to my previous 20 gig ipod, and my 8 gig microphoto, the gigabeat is the end-all of portable mp3 players.  It's ( relative to the ipod and zen M ) small size and clean corners make it comfortable to carry, and the interface is very fast and easy to use - it is designed perfectly for handling a large library. In my car, the volume on medium, 10, is loud and clear. The music clarity is excellent, and its very snappy and responsive. Even pictures look good on it.  All players advertise the three easy steps to use your player: 1. charge battery 2. install software 3. plug in unit. But the "plays-for-sure" Gigabeat really only has those three steps.   The ipod and zune have you download the latest copy of their proprietary software, then update that software, then create an account in their music store, then convert your music to their proprietary format using their proprietary sync cable - well the gigabeat is only three things. Charge it. Plug it in - WMP10 or 11 picks it up with no set up, no software download, and just one question: What do you want to name your player? After that it just works.  I have an Urge subscription, and there was no file conversion necessary. During sync, WMP automatically downloads your usage rights and uploads the file - without having to stop and wait. Easy.  I highly recommend using WMP11 - for a large library it is hands down the best player, and it's very easy to manage music on a portable device.  Lastly, unlike other reviewers, i have not had battery trouble in the few  days ive had the player. I set my screen to shut off after 15 seconds, and i'm getting a full day's use from the unit. I'm very pleased.  Why not 5 stars? I'm worried about what will happen next time the battery dies. I dont want to spend another 8 hours picking through my library and uploading music. I'm also not a fan of the headphones it is bundled with - very uncomfortable. I'd also have liked a soft bag or case for the unit.

<Title>Beautiful Player but the Battery Life Sux
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a techie, and this player is a techie's dream. It's slim, well designed, and has a huge capacity. It supports all the audio and video files that you can think of (and if not, a quick conversion in windows media player does the trick).   BUT: you have to be ok sitting by an outlet the whole time if you want to listen to this thing continuously. i am in school and i have days where i spend 10 hours studying, and i need my music to do so. this player maxed out maybe at 6 hours (and this is with the screen off). i got upset, because here's this wonderful player that just doesn't last. in the end utility won over aesthetics and i returned this one and got a 60 gig creative vision m (i had a 30 gig before, this was supposed to be an upgrade). yes it might be bulky, but with all the same features and a 20 hr battery life (which i have tested with my previous version).  Amazon are great about returns and I am glad I shop here.

<Title>love it but having a little prob now- HELP!
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>hello, is anyone else having this same problem with theirs & if you are,I'd love to hear how you resolved it.I don't want to send it back having to wait a long time for another one to get here. I got mine a little over a week ago & everything has been working fine until today.I have it plugged into my computer to charge & to add stuff to it (my computer/portable devices)-it acts like it's not plugged into the USB port-I've changed it out with all the others & still the same.It has power to it-the battery still shows to be fully charged. Is this the beginning of the end for it? If I'm going to have problems with it,Toshiba will be hearing from me & I won't let up until I get some help from them.After people spend all this money on their product,they will help us or we need to boycot all their stuff over here. If anyone had/has the same prob & was able to fix it to where we don't have to go to drastic measures,please get back with me- my email address is wyvern43@earthlink.net

<Title>Great mp3 Player
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>to me, music is the very thing that drives my life. So, when i started to look for a Mp3 player, I wanted something that was simple, different and capable. and that product was the Gigabeat MES60Vk. in my reasearch i found that the player was a nice alternative to the ipod. the player is very sleek and functional, it can sync pictures from a digital camera, and can download recorded video from tivo. the screen is larger than that of an ipod video and clearer too while maintaining the same size of a 60 gig video ipod.   some downsides to this product are - short battery life. - equlizer presets kinda suck - integration with WMP 11 is a little laggey but after owning the player for a while, it is really a great player and is deserving of consideration when buying a mp3 player.

<Title>Decent Player But....
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had one of these, sent it right back to after 2 weeks use. I have experience with many players, Zune, Ipod, Iriver etc and I can say the gigabeat is a nice player but the battery life fell way below the specified time quoted. Ex. I watched half of a (black and white) movie which had less than 1 hour remaining to watch. I had the player fully charged. After watching the remainder of the movie and then playing less than 4 hours of music, inconsistanly I might add the player gave me the low battery finger. I practiced the proper battery charging techniques etc. WTF?! Other than that the capacity is nice, it acts as a removable storage device which was a plus and the interface is great with the exception of it's almost total reliance on Windows Media Player for all of the aesthetic features. In addition to the true lack of accessories in America (and just about everywhere else at this point) for this thing I would say Do not buy this! Unless you think the aforementioned problems are minor and dealable. The 60GBs are great but in the end you have an easily scratchable heavily fingerprinted, low battery life, nice screen player with a hard to find simple accessories like a basic rubber case. Buyer Beware.

<Title>Don't be restricted by an iPod! The Gigabeat walks all over it.
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For anyone familiar with iPods and the iTunes music store, you can skip to the next paragraph. I'd like to explain what is so horrible about the two, so as to better explain what I like about the Gigabeat S. When you download content from iTunes, you pay a substantial amount of money for that content (.99 cents a song, which adds up after just two albums...get 1000 songs, and you are paying about 1000 bucks. By some estimations, you could spend upwards of $10,000 filling an iPod). Even though you have contributed this money to Apple and the record companies, you can't do anything with it unless you have an iPod. You cannot put it on ANYTHING else as far as MP3 players go.   Now compare this restrictive ideology to players, like the Gigabeat, which are "PlayForSure" rated. That means they will let you put any music from any download service (except iTunes of course) on your player. Most other download services are much cheaper too...I use eMusic for independent stuff, and it comes out to about .20 cents a download (although it requires monthly subscription). Other services like Walmart Music Downloads are .88 cents. If you are considering buying an iPod for movies, don't bother. You'll get such a nasty headache after 5 minutes from staring at that tiny screen. The gigabeat has a much crisper and larger screen.  As for the player itself, I have made some observations since I got it:  It is a very well designed product which runs on Windows Mobile. What that means is that your navigation menu is based of Windows. You have subcategories for TV (you can download tivo programs), music, movies, and what I think sets it apart from the iPod right out of the gate, radio.   Appearance:  Frankly I am tired of seeing iPods. I used to have one of the earlier versions, and HATED the silver back cover. It was impossible to keep fingerprints off of. The gigabeat has a glossy screen, but seems to be harder to smudge up. The back (where your fingers are going to be) is plastic, so its not a problem. The thing is very well put together, and feels like it would be ok to drop, though I havent dropped it yet (its only a matter of time, I'm sure). The screen is bright, and extremely clear.  Interface:  If you are a fan of the iPod clickwheel, you will probably not like this. The cross at the botton takes care of most of your navigation, and I personally like it more than the clickwheel. If you have never used the clickwheel, its alot like the touchpad on a laptop, in that it doesnt actually move, it just senses your finger. The problem with touchpads is that it only senses your fingers, so if you are wearing gloves, it will not detect your fingers. With the cross on the gigabeat, you can keep your gloves on. I also like that the volume has dedicated buttons on the side, unlike the ipod.  Performance:  The number one issue that it seems most people have with the gigabeat is battery life. Frankly, I have not had the same problems with it, and I think it has to do with being smart in your use. Many people have claimed that you only get 5 hours or less from the batteries when you play music, which of course would be horrible. However, right out of the box, the settings have the backlight (how long the screen lights up after you navigate around) set to display for one minute! The screen will obviously drain a massive amount of the battery that way. I dropped it down to 5 seconds, and I get well over 12 hours from the battery. IMPORTANT NOTE: I felt like an idiot, but when I opened the box and plugged it in for its initial charge, I thought it was dead because it wouldn't turn on when I unplugged it, yet it worked when it was plugged in. I thought I had a bad battery. I found out that you have to take a pen and push a switch on the bottow of the player to turn on the battery and allow it to charge. Strange.  As far as the music goes, it sounds great. I don't think, however, that after you spend more than 200 dollars on any MP3 player that you can discern any difference in the sound quality of any two players. You are going to want to go out and buy some better earbuds, though, because the ones that come with the gigabeat are awful. I suggest the Shure brand (I have the 3 series which goes for $140, but the 2 series is much less. If you are a total audiophile, the 4 series apparently is incredible, though it sells for like 350).   Scrolling from menu to menu is fast, and there is rarely any wait (the waiting animation looks like the Zune's screen when it is using the wireless function, if you have seen the commercial). When you play a song, you can access different views while it is playing. You can just show the song title, the song title and album art, or just the album art. I was somewhat disappointed that you can't customize the desktop with your own image, like the Zen series. It would also have been nice if you could upload other windows programs like Word or Outlook or your Contacts, but this is a media player, not a PDA.  Transfer:  If you like Windows Media Player, you will have no problem with this device. If you are like me, and had never used WMP, give it a try before buying this, because it might be the deciding factor between this player and another, since you have to use it (you can download it for free from Microsoft). The nice thing about using it is that you don't have to install anything after you get it. Just plug the player into your computer and open WMP, and you're ready to start transferring music. The intial transfer of your library can take a while. I had about 7 gigs of music, a gig of pictures and a few gigs of movies. It took about an hour to transfer all of that. Once you get the bulk in, its quick to update a few albums here and there when you get new music. The sync process is simple: just plug in, and the WMP will open a new box automatically with a button that says "sync," and it does the rest. I do not have tivo, but from what I hear, its equally as simple.   You've heard all the good stuff, so here's a few negatives.  I know that since something like 80 percent of players out there are iPods, there are bound to be a load of accessories for the iPod. The gigabeat is not quite as easy to find accessories for. However, be aware that many iPod accessories are really just MP3 player accessories with an Apple logo on them. That is to say, you can still use them with other players. If you want a case, they do exist (Noreve makes a nice one). In coming months, there will surely be more hitting the market.   Another negative is the ear buds. Most players come with crappy ones, but the gigabeat's are a joke. They sort of force you to buy new ones (they sound bad and they are super uncomforable).   All in all, this is a great player. Amazon has a great price on them (down substantially in the past few months from the original release price of 350 for the 60 gb version). The player is great for its versatility of use: you can use it if you are into subscribtion music (which is music that you pay a monthly rate to basically rent) like Napster or Rhapsody, or if you have a ton of CD's saved up from when they came out in the 80's that you want to stick on a player. I think this thing is, first and foremost, a music player. Don't buy this thing if you are ONLY planning on watching movies. If you want to go on trips and watch movies, get something with a bigger screen like the Zen Vision W or the Archos 604. The archos also allows you to record directly from your TV or DVD player. But if you want a well rounded device, this is great because it has the power to show you movies, music, and pictures. What sets it apart from others is the fact it also has radio capability. As I mentioned earlier, it is a huge plus when you find a device which is "PlaysForSure" rated, because it will basically play music from any download service.   I have owned many players in my life, including the iPod Photo and the Zen Xtra, and can say this is the best player I have ever owned or even sampled. I think the problems which others have had were due to buying the device too soon after it was released (I would never buy a car right after they unveil the new model...eg the Volkswagon Toureg). People buying the Zune are saying the same thing right now...wait for Microsoft to work out the bugs. Toshiba seems to have gotten any problems out with this device, and when you buy it from Amazon, you know returns are super super super easy if you need to.

<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>okay, now some of the reviewers here are either total morons or dont know how to use the damn software "coughpersonbelowmecough" but this item is truly incredible. there is NO problems downloading music or movies onto it (although you have to convert DVDs to WMA format but still, the movie and picture quality is unprecedented). Sound quality is excellent, the only negative is the few movie formats, but I have never had a problem with this player. so if you want an honest, reliable recommendation from a person that has not been diagnosed with down syndrome, buy this item. Trust me you wont regret it.

<Title>This thing is great (almost 5 stars)
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am picky about both music and gadgets, but this little guy was a great purchase.   OVERVIEW: After three weeks of owning this device, I highly recommend it.  It's slick, menus and controls make sense, nice sound quality.  I would give it 5 stars if not for the less-than-stellar battery life and dependence on Windows Media Player (nothing against the program, just not as likely to be running my friends' music).    PROS: 1. The menus and operating system are extremely versatile and intuitive.  My friends are quite impressed with the scroll speed and the letter icon telling me where I am in the lists. 2. The player itself is sleek and most notably NOT AN iPOD! 3. No thought of running out of memory (though I haven't stored any video yet) 4. Dedicated buttons on the side make it simple to pause, FF, Rewind, and power down without pulling it out of your pocket. 5. Pauses the track in place automatically when you power down. 6. It feels solid, especially compared to the Zunes and Zens I've played with in stores. 7. Screen color, brightness, and sharpness are EXCELLENT. 7. Did I mention it's not an iPod?  Go ahead, it feels good to snicker at white earbuds.  Get some Shure E4C's in black.  CONS: 1. No, the battery doesn't last forever.  The low battery indicator pops up right before the thing is totally empty.  Developing new habit of charging every two or three days. 2. I haven't found how to edit track names or add cover art to the tracks already on the player.  I have to delete the track and drop in the new information as a new track. 3. I set the screen to shut off after 5 seconds.  Thus, if I pause a track and the screen goes dark I have to remind myself to turn off the unit. 4. Not many accessories available yet.  I haven't even seen the thing sold in any store I've been in.   5. iTunes won't recognize a Gigabeat and Windows Media Player won't recognize an iPod, so sharing music with my friends always involves an extra step or two. 6. This one is picky, but when you are listening to a playlist, like a shuffle of all my tunes or a compilation album, I can only get detailed info like artist and album on the track currently playing.  If I click on the next--or previous--song title to get that info it starts playing the song. 7. I hate the name.  I feel like a 13-year-old girl when I tell anyone what it's called.  I usually just stick with "It's from Toshiba."

<Title>Sounds awesome, but has typical probs for this type of player
<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using this player (60g black model) for a few months now. The sound is fantastic, and this is the most important thing for me. I never have and never will use an ipod for many reasons, the #1 being they have always fallen short on sound quality compared to quality brands like Creative and Toshiba. I can't comment on the video performance, and I have used it a little for viewing pics and they look great because the screen is top notch. But sound quality is clearly the most important thing for me.   I of course am not using the stock headphones. I hope everyone knows by now that upgrading the headphones is the first thing one must do when using any portable music player. You don't have to spend a fortune if you shop wisely. I am using Sennheiser behind-the-neck style headphones that only set me back about $25 including shipping. They are all-day comfortable and the sound quality is, say, about 300,000% better than stock headphones. 'Nuff said about that.  The operating system, menus, etc. are pretty good. There are a few things - call them options, features, functions - that I wish it could or would do. I don't really blame the unit for this. These things are based on individual tastes and I believe it is impossible to make everyone happy. Toshiba would have had to sit down with me during development to get it just the way I want it.  Battery life is very good - I think - and keep in mind it gets substantially better the more the unit is used after the first few days. Try not to base your opinions about battery life on initial use. I use mine (on about half volume since my Sennheisers are incredibly loud compared to other 'phones I've used) for probably about 6 hours a day at work, then another hour and a half (on even louder volume) at the gym. When I get home the meter usually shows about half battery left, maybe a little more. And it only takes about an hour to charge it full again.  The major downside...the hard drive failed after a couple of months and I had to send it to Toshiba for repair. Now I'm not especially in love with Toshiba more than any other quality electronics brand, or an employee or anything, but I don't really harbor any hard feelings for this. As you may have read or heard, they ALL have failures. There isn't one brand - Apple, Toshiba, Creative - that doesn't consistently suffer hard drive failures. It is a fact with these things and must be regarded as a possibility when buying one. I knew it going in, hoped it wouldn't happen, and was bummed but not shocked when it did. If you can't deal with this possibility you should really try and focus on being satisfied with a much-smaller-capacity flash memory player that has no moving parts. They promise a 2-3 day turnaround after receipt of the damaged unit, and then ground shipping return to you. I overnighted it to them (I have an inside scoop on shipping) and surprisingly they overnighted it back to me after repair. All told, I was without it for less than a week (which was torture since I got so used to having it) and it was fixed and has stayed fixed since.  It is small, handsome, and the sound is incredible. I have heard Creative routinely rated the best of the best as far as sound, but I have developed a pretty good ear, and I can't imagine the sound getting any better, nor do I believe I would notice the tiny difference even if it was.

<Title>5 stars with some issues
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really wanted to give this 4 1/2 stars but since it was not available I went with 5 stars and I will explain the issues I have with the unit. All in all, I LOVE this player. The display is great! Big enough to see pictures. While I have not watched a movie on it yet, I don't think there would be any problem viewing it. The navigation buttons are easy to use and the control buttons on the side are well placed. Probably the feature I like the best is that this player IS TOUGH!! It already survived a fall from four feet. The back is especially tough- real heavy metal baby!!  Now for some function. I love that it uses Media Player rather than something else. In Meida Player I can change genras to anything I want- like 50's, 70's or 80's genras. I will probalby add a "bubble gum pop" genra. I love that kind of versatility. I created a "dance" category. It takes a lot of time to retag stuff but once it's done it's wonderful.  I still have not figured out how to convert movie files to wmv format but I will figure that out. I haven't really explored playlists either.   Now for the negatives. The equalizer seems to be worthless. It is loudest with it set at "none." Maybe if you had some premium headphones it would make a difference (more on that later). The battery life is speced out at 20 hours. I don't want to guess how long the battery life is but I know it is not 20 hours. I do have the display stay on for quite a while when I push a button so that could be affecting it.  My biggest gripe about this player are the headphones- they suck!! They are big round earbuds which keep on falling out. I have tried three other pairs and I get way more volume out of the player.  I know manufacturers read these reviews so I'm going to suggest a coulple of things. I have used slide control volume for headphones but they are subject to movement changing the volume. How about a hard click style? And for us people who had ear infections when we were kids how about a balance control. What is perfectly balanced is not my ideal listening environment- especially with headphones.   Well, that's it. To summarize- LOVE the player, hate the headphones.

<Title>Very High Quality
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For all you windows operators out there, if you're looking for a competitor that blows the i pod out of the water this is it.  If anything it may equal the i pod in many areas, but still my personal choice for space, interface, and software.  Instead of just listing pros and cons, I'll go in depth with all categories I can think of.  Overall Quality Very well built. It's a solid piece of technology and will never fall apart on its own.  The original was ridiculous and was practically glued together.  This one is bolted together and tightly sealed. If you're a stickler for looks though, i would get a case.  It can dent or scratch rather easily, but you really have to try hard to harm the actual device. It also still has a strap attachment.    Size Incredibly small and lightweight. it's so much smaller than the ipod and is no where near as bulky as it's predecessor.  It blows my mind how you can barely notice it in your pocket.  Interface I have to say this is one of the most easy and creative interfaces I've seen on any mp3 player to date.  You can scroll through literally everything with the cross buttons, which are now actual buttons by the way.  The dedicated buttons on the side make it very easy to pause/play switch songs and volume in any menu.  It seems a more applicable version of windows media center has been installed on the actual device.  Everything is very clear, and selecting is a breeze.  It includes a few nuances like the letter guide that shows up while scrolling quickly down the menus.  Unfortunately a few of the good little stuff is from the gigabeat F is not on the gigabeat S, such as the delete from device option, and some other features i would have like to see stay.  There are still other new settings and features  Software Works incredibly well with windows media player 10 and up.  Songs and videos transfer within half seconds.  The device is also very open with windows media player. You can go to any menus and edit anything.  Try that with a windows ipod.  Audio i never use the headphones out of the box, but I've always used sony wraparounds and it sounds fantastic. Just not as many equalizers as the original. Personally my favorite is "electronic" is the perfect balance for me, but that's completely subjective. It uses alot of different file formats, and unless you're doing some wacky stuff with file types, you may never have a problem. It takes all file types windows media player does and probably more. All in all, it sounds great  Video Although i haven't much use for the video mode, i have experimented a little, and people who are expecting FANTASTIC video support will not be thrilled here. It still plays video and the quality is still good, but audio is sometimes a bit tinny and file types can be a bit of trouble sometimes. DivX must be converted simply to .wmv or .avi. While the video and picture quality is still pretty good, it's technicalities need a little fixing.  The aspect ratios can be switched from 4:3 to 16:9 (letterbox). Plus the screen size is about 2 and a half inches. it's great for clips and music videos, but i'd love to meet the person with the patients to watch a 2 hour movie on that screen.  Picture Quality Obviously will hold alot of pictures, and it takes almost all file types.  For still pictures, it is great quality. So if you're really concerned about picture storage, don't worry about it. There are plenty of options for album art.  Not only is there a picture for every album in the menu but, the actual play sub menu has 5 other menu styles within it.  One which is nothing but the album art.  Battery Life It says about 12 hours but can be even more if you edit you're screen options.  Put at like 5 seconds for the screen to turn off and you shouldn't have any problems.  For video however, there's about 3 hours there and maybe even more depending on how often you charge it.  Again people who watch 2 hour movies on a small device will have a tough time.  Personally, the battery has never run out at an inappropriate time.    Other Features Because it has windows media center, you can also get other downloadable content from it if you're connected to it.  The "My TV" feature works kind of like podcasts except windows lets you record your own tv I believe. This may give a little more lasting appeal as well.   Space the 60 gigs feels almost infinite, a personal must for me because i listen to a lot of music. Even with loads of videos I can still can't see it getting too tight.    Price The s60 is pretty steep at msrp $500. But if you are buying it of Amazon at 250 or less it's a steal.  Summary A great product. My choice over ipod.  Battery life and video file types are the only things I could see as down points. I would definitely agree it is a better mp3 player than an overall media player. But you will still be able play videos and audio comparatively well for such a small device, and the interface right now I believe is unmatched.  For such a small device, it is very powerful.

<Title>Very unhappy with product
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was interested in the gigabeat, since I did not want to have to conform to IPOD.  The reviews were good.  First problem is the battery life is advertised at 12 hours...try 6.  I saw an article that said that 12 would be optimal conditions...my battery drains in 24 hrs if not plugged in.    Next problem...one day, I plugged in and started and all memory seemed to get wiped out...after discussing with Toshiba phone support (very friendly and helpful), the firmware was no longer valid.  Sent back to Toshiba and all was working. Less than a week later now, I just started up again and now all my info is removed again...this is all within a month.

Very small form factor- great for commute; watching TV shows, listening to music, viewing photos while in transit. Rhapsody To Go compliant as well as supporting "drag and drop" MP3 loading; Much more flexible than Ipod in terms of file support. Battery life not the best, and a bit disappointed w/ built in FM tuner performance but neither is a deal breaker. Black case and screen do smudge easily- would recommend getting screen protector and or a case. Not many accessories, but honestly "native" package gives you everything you need.

<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me first say that I'm very glad I did not buy an iPod Video.  I've been looking for a multi-media device (not just an mp3 device for awhile now).  In my opinion, with all the research I've done, there isn't any one single device that does "everything" multimedia related that isn't the size of a brick, but this device comes very close.  Things I love about it:  -Windows Media software, I really like this interface, very easy to use!  I like the software on the device.  I use WMP 11 for now to catalog all my media, but I have gripes about that software listed below. -I, personally, love the buttons on the side of this device, having dedicated on/off and volume controls is fantastic. -Stylish.  I think a lot of people buy into the iPod because it's like a piece of jewelry.  Well, the Toshiba Gigabeat S has the same thing going for it, very stylish!! -Screen size!!!!!  Of all the things I was looking for I wanted something that had a good screen size without being too bulky and this device is perfect!! -What it has that I wanted, MP3, Video, Pictures, Video, Radio, Video.... Did I say video?  :)  Video was at the top of my list.  I wanted MP3, Radio and Picture viewing also, but Video was the #1 thing for me.  While I've had some problems with certain video clips converting, it ends up being no problem when I use a 3rd party software package to convert them as needed. -A Feature it has that I haven't used yet is the TV Out option.  There is a way to hook it up to my TV and play videos stored on the device with my television, haven't done that yet, but will and look forward to checking it out. -There's integration or some kind of capability with TivoToGo, something I will also be using, but haven't tested it out yet.  I have things from my Tivo on my hard drive already, just haven't tried pushing them to the device yet, this is because of my gripes about WMP11 stated below.  Things I wish were different or better about this device:  -After much reading on the net about this device, I expected to receive it and right out of the gate get an error message with it that would wipe my media off the device.  Well, this happened to me.  But, I only synched about 20 megs of stuff to it, caused myself to receive the error I was told about and haven't seen it sense.  Really, this should be fixed. -It doesn't have a DVR capability.  I would expect that if I can hook this up to my TV, I should be able to record on my TV, but it's only an out port, not an in/out port. -ACCESSORIES!!!!!!  I do want to scream that out loud.  Whenever I can I've bought iPod accessories to fit my device.  The iPod Video and the Toshiba Gigabeat are very close in size.  I found an iPod case that my device can slip in to so when it's in my purse it's not taking a beating.  However, I would like a number of accessories and I'm very disappointed in the lack of accessories available for this device.  The proprietary port at the bottom of this device does not work with iPod accessories.  Last thing I have to say is about Windows Media Player.  I use WMP 11 and there are a lot of things I love about it, but my 60GB device isn't large enough to hold my entire MP3 collection, forget that I have 20 GB of Pictures and I lost count on the videos.  I would like a better and much easier way to catalog all my items with WMP, but tell the stupid software not to try and synch the almost 200GBs of media to it!!  The process to tell this software not to put something on the device is a real pain!!  I do realize there are lots of programs I can use instead, anything that is Play For Sure will work with this device, but I haven't found another package I like better.... yet anyway!  As far as devices go, I think in the next couple of years there will be enough changes to these kinds of devices that I will end up with another one that I like a great deal more.  But, for now, with what is on the market I think this is one of the better devices.  Thank you Apple for pushing in to this area, but you have competition now.  Even CNET gives this device a higher rating than the iPod Video, something to be said about that!

<Content>I love this machine. It's very easy to use, easy to integrate, has a great screen, and looks better than the iPod. I have over 6000 songs and 2 dozen videos on this and STILL have 10gb left to add more. Some complain about the battery life, but I use this at my office plugged in all the time to a boom box. Accessories are hard to find, but the player itself is fantastic!

<Title>I didn't want an ipod....ended up with one.
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did my research on CNET and bought the 60M gigabeat. Returned it after 5 days. I had the same problems that others have reported.   1.All songs on the gigabeat disapeared for no apparent reason After loading about 400 songs, they were gone the next day. Didn't want a device that would lose my entire music collection.  2. Short and then shorter battery life.   First day I ran it continuously for about 6 hours. Thought maybe the battery wasn't fully charged.  Charged the battery overnight and then it only ran for 5 hours.  Same story the next day, but it only ran for 4 hours.   3. No accessories.  I wanted to load all my music and use the gigabeat for a home jukebox player as well. They're aren't any accessories you can buy that use the port on the bottom. Sure you can use the headphone jack, but the quality isn't as good.  Loved the easy navigation and screen display as well as the sound quality but couldn't stand the loss of music, short battery life and lack of accessories.   Kudos to amazon.com for refunding me completely. Purchased the 30GB ipod for the same price, bought a docking station with remote control and now I can play the ipod as a jukebox from my couch.  I really tried to avoid buying the ipod, but Toshiba let me down.

<Title>A great deal! 
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Toshiba Gigabeat was by far my best purchase of 2006. I'm one of the many who have realized that i-pods aren't worth the money spent on them because, in my experience, they break too easily, you must use i-tunes, the sound is mediocre, there's a thousand other accesories not included that people end up needing to buy to have the benefits that other mp3 players already come with, and of course, because they are just too common and overrated. I love my Gigabeat. To start with, it's like a little computer, with Windows and everything. That's great because I can do everything through Windows media player including burning, ripping, and converting video formats (though many formats do not need to be converted). It makes things a lot simpler and look a lot cooler, with cool graphics (including the big letters indicating what letter you're on when you scroll through song lists). It has good radio reception and I have 8 of my favorite stations preset (though you can have much more). I love the fact that i can have a picture slideshow going on while listening to my music (the headphones have good sound, by the way) and it has a long battery life so that i can listen and watch for hours each day for days in a row. Also, there's a cord included that hooks right from the headphone jack to the tv, so you can watch movies or play music through your tv. Another cool cord included is one that can hook directly from your camera to your Gigabeat for a direct transfer. There's nothing I don't love about it yet. It's definitely worth the buy. (I got a 60 gig for 250, (the price of a 30 gig i-pod)!  -a pleased customer

<Title>Save yourself the time and look elsewhere, at least for now...
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to love the Gigabeat, and I did at first.  The screen is beautiful,  the navigation is awesome (both the buttons and the on-screen navigation), and for size comparison, this thing is just slightly bigger than a Blackberry Pearl cell phone, making it a joy to carry around after my clunky Creative Zen Xtra.  It would easily get five stars from me if it didn't fail to do so many essential things.  But after a week of patiently putting up with the Gigabeat's quirks, I'm through.  What good is the ability to load 60GB of media if the player randomly reformats its hard drive after you've just spent hours loading your collection onto it?  How does the video feature matter if the Gigabeat's battery, on a full charge, doesn't last long enough to watch a TV show, let alone a movie (mine died after a total of twenty five minutes of playback today, after sitting on my desk for two or three hours not plugged in, and right before it did, the battery indicator told me it was charged!)?  Why buy a media player that works only with incredibly buggy software that won't even let those of you with large collections pick and choose what to "sync" onto the player (WMP 11's help files say that you can "get around this" by either deleting all music off your hard drive that you don't want on the player or by copying EVERYTHING and then deleting the unwanted files off your player until you have enough space to repeat the process.  Or you can use WMP 10, which will choke on three quarters of your videos.).  At first I thought I had gotten a lemon, but after doing some research, I found out that these are extremely common problems with the Gigabeat, and that Toshiba has not released any firmware updates to fix any of these problems, despite the player's having been out for a while.  This doesn't bode well for the future usability of the Gigabeat.    Unless you're willing to put up with issues like these until Toshiba cracks and releases a fix or someone comes up with a good third-party OS, the Gigabeat just isn't worth it.  At the very least, do some serious googling before you hand over a couple hundred bucks for this thing.

<Title>Solid player, but eratic battery
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In a little over a month, I have had few problems (It's never crashed etc.). The first Gigabeat I bought had a battery life of around 7 hours, but Amazon replaced it and the new one has been closer to 12 hours. While just playing music, I've never gotten the 15 hours of advertised batteru life.  The battery life has also been a little eratic, dipping well below 10 hours on a full charge sometimes.  But the player has a solid feel to it, is very user friendly and produces an excellent sound.

<Title>Good product.
<Date>Sat Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought two gigabeats for Xmas, one for my husband and one for myself.  I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews, but decided to give it a shot since it was compatible with windows media center files.  So far, we have been very pleased.  Charged it as directed and never installed any software, just plugged into the cpu with a mini usb cable.  Files transfer to the gigabeat easily with windows media player or by dragging and dropping files in windows explorer.  Easy to navigate and I liked the buttons.  Battery life seems very acceptable although I haven't pushed the limits.  It is generally used in the house or car where it can be plugged in.  Does well with activity, I used it while biking and my husband used it while snowboarding without any complications.  You will need to buy new headphones as the ones it comes with are uncomfortable.  All my audio files and our recorded TV transfer seamlessly and play with good quality.  We no longer have to waste DVDs burning our recorded TV (since we use media center instead of tivo).  Cons:  I did decide to trial what happens if the battery dies.  It does lose all content.  Didn't take too long to transfer and I don't have a problem remembering to keep it charged so not such a big deal.  Just make sure everything is backed up.  The files are not organized by folder on the gigabeat like they are on the computer so you may need to edit your audio files using windows media player.  You can listen by genre, album, artist, or song.  I edited my files so that the folders on the computer match the genre listed in WMP.  This way I can choose to listen to my punk files instead of having to choose individual artists to add to the playlist.  File editing is particuarly tedious if your files are lacking alot of info (say you got them as a free download instead of ripping from cd).  Still, we have 30GB of music files and I spent a few hours each day during my week of vacation to edit them all.  Its not too hard once you figure out how it works and learn short cuts.  Final con, not alot of accesories out there.  I have found several nice cases though.

<Title>Great product.  Easy to use. Battery life is only dissappointment
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Other than the battery life (not much better than a couple hours), I am extremely pleased.  Set up was a breeze.  The unit is small and not overcomplicated.  The few buttons that it does have are logically located and are easy to differentiate (even in the dark or while in your pocket) and access. The menu's are simple to understand and very intuitive.  Selection of menu items is sure and if other options are available for that selection you are logically led to the next level of choice.  The screen is bright and crisp and the sound is great.  All in all, I am very pleased.

<Content>I purchased this 3 months ago and have had excellent results.  The battery life isn't as good as advertised but overall, the product is excellent.  I use it with Napster To Go and for downloading pictures off of my camera.  I especially like the fact that I can download pictures and use as a temporary storage device without having to go through a computer.  The built in radio is also very nice. I gave it only 4 stars because of the battery life but would highly recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Giga-size Mistake.
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Given both the limited amount of reviews here so far about the Gigabeat, and given the mammoth size headache/mistake I had in purchasing one, an honest review to help anyone thinking about the 'Beat.  Firstly, this review comes from someone who waited for at least a year and a half for the price of 60gb mp3 players to go down. And from someone who disliked in general the "Big Brother" & "We are your friend" approach of Apple & their iPod. As one might gleam from the above, I was ecstatic about the opportunity to buy a non-iPod 60gb mammoth to call my own. After some research, I really figured it would be worth it even though a couple of well-known sites gave it really dismal marks, I was willing to chunk it off to reviewers too awed by Apple.  I was wrong.  Exactly everything and more from their reviews were correct. A small list:  #1 - And most glaringly atrocious is the software Toshiba designed in order to 'protect' any music one uploads. With the Gigabeat, Toshiba has all but virtually made it impossible to put YOUR mp3 files onto YOUR mp3 player and ever hope to then get YOUR mp3 files back onto your hard drive in mp3 format. Why? Because the player will encrypt everyone of your files into a format dubbed .SAT, which is unreadable by any media player for any computer. Exactly so that the question of ever sharing or anything like that is out of the question with Gigabeat. Mp3 in; SAT out = Readable in / Unreadable out   Sure, if you spend hours looking for how to get around that encryption on the Web, you'll find that the solution just as undesirable. Namely that if you connect through Windows Media Player 10 instead of the Toshiba Gigabeat Room software, you can then ignore the WMP aspect of it and proceed to drag&drop files onto it like a external hard drive. With a HUGE catch: Only while docked in the units cradle; which ONLY can process such transfers at USB 1.0 speed, not the standard 2.0  I actually was desperate enough that I actually did this and in all truth: On a 3.2 gigahertz Dell computer, transferring my collection of 23 gigabytes came back with a waiting screen of 26 hours. I'm not even BS-ing. If you could do it normally with USB 2.0 that time would be 3 hours at tops. And if you ever wanted to get those files back onto your computer the same thing applies.  #2 - One of the reviews I read bashed the sound quality output of the player, but then also followed up with how good iPod was in contrast. I naturally disregarded the information. Wrong. Wrong. The output is atrocious; almost anything you will have sounds like it's in a very open room. And no, my mp3s are not of crappy 128 KPS. And forget about the equalizer settings...they are as equally horrid.   #3 - Finally the interface was simply put, terribly designed. Just trying to find the pinky size pause button for instance, located in the middle of the gigabeat cross-pad, and successfully hitting it without either turning up the volume/switching tracks became a unpleasant game of hit-or-miss every time. And that every time added up immensely.  There perhaps will be a day when some bright someone will devise a hack for the gigabeat that will make it overcome encrypting one's files, but that day remains to be seen and even if it were to happen, the interface/poor sound performance would still drag it down at every turn.  Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs.

<Title>GREAT player, but you have to be smart!
<Date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While it's not without its problems, and what player isn't, I've found the gigabeat to be just fine.  My previous player was a Creative Zen Micro 5G, so this was a BIG step up for me.  I paid $[...] and got a $[...] rebate.  60G FOR $[...]?? C'mon people - that's a STEAL!!!  I've got just about every CD I own on this thing along with 4 full length movies and I've still got like 30G.  I'll probably never fill it full.    I use it with WMP11, I just plugged it in, WMP recognized it immediately and syncing was a breeze, though it takes a little while for the initial sync.  Other than that, the two work together perfectly.  I have yet to use it with any subscription services (1 free month of Napster is included), but you can use it with Amazon Unboxed and Vongo for TV and Movie subsriptions.  I'll update when I add these services.  On to the complaints expressed here in the comments: 1. Battery Life - If you adjust your settings like this, I can guarantee you at least 15-16 hrs. of audio.  Video drains MUCHO battery life, but you'll still get over 3 hrs.  First - HARMONICS, set to off. Trust me you won't need em, especially if you've ripped your stuff at higher than 128kbps.  Second - backlight set to 5 seconds.  This will save you TONS.  Third - Brightness to 1, it's plenty bright.  I keep my charger at work (where I use this the most) and then charge at home via USB, I'm never without a power supply.  If you're flying or on long trips I'm not sure what to tell you, but the thing charges full in just a couple hours so hopefully that will help.  I'm still working out the kinks with the video, and when I do I'll update.  As of now, I only watch on the train home which is about 25 mins which makes the time fly.  My only complaint so far... C'mon Toshiba, you couldn't spring for an included case?  The surface is a beautiful glossy black which is prone to fingerprints and scratches.  I've been using the dippy plastic bag it came in until my ordered case comes in.  The only other thing I miss is a bookmark function, which came in handy if you needed to remember where you were in an audiobook or podcast.  Other than that... So far so good.  If I encounter any problems I'll update.  If you're considering, I say go for it.  You can't beat it for the price.

<Title>Worthy iPod alternative for Mac user
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:Visually appealing user interface, intuitive and quick navigation, great audio sound, tactile controls, seamless and trouble-free intergration with WMP11, size and terrific build quality  Cons:Short battery life, 60GB black model prone to fingerprints/smudges  As a Mac user for a few years I began to get bored with the iPod/iTunes setup on my MacBook Pro, so I took on building a library on the WMP11 of my desktop PC and needed a worthwhile alternative to the iPod to sync with it.  I have gone through owning the Creative Zen Vision:M and Zen V Plus, but I am due to return them both now that I've found this Toshiba 60GB black model.  After a couple days of owning this player I am truly impressed by the appearance of the interface alone. Not only is its navigation very quick and extremely simple, but it is also highly polished and refined compared to the aging 5th gen iPod. Moving through the multiple views of a playing musical track is very fluid with hardly any hiccups visible to the eye.  The quality of its construction with the metal backing and glossy front is very high, sturdy and polished and definitely trumps the toy-like plasticity of the Zen players. Size dimension is another plus over the Zen Vision:M which felt rather bulky, and it even fits into my iPod belt clip holster.  I am not an audio expert by any imaginative stretch, but every track that I've heard is absolutely on par with (if not better than) the iPod 5th gen. The same goes for the screen quality in viewing videos and photos.  I am impressed by the ease and speed with which this Toshiba handles my photos and videos in the categorized libraries. Whereas both the Apple and Creative players needed to initially have a few seconds to load the thumbnail previews onscreen, this device requires no such thing! Going through the hundreds of photos and watching videos is smooth and seems very effortless. Doing this is also trouble-free when you consider the tactile buttons versus the touch controls of the iPod and Zen Vision:M.  Syncing media via the WMP11 has so far been a painless and rather impressive experience overall. After years of being accustomed to iTunes with my iPod on my Mac I can finally say that the desktop PC at my house should not be underestimated anymore. Both Creatives and this Toshiba needed no additional software to talk to the PC, so this plug-and-play efficiency I've had with my Mac and iPod is definitely a welcomed aspect of my PC experimentation.  There is one concern I have that is certainly not a dealbreaker. The battery life when compared to the iPod and Zen players leaves much to be desired, but with my usual daily charging it should suffice nonetheless. The fingerprints and smudges is expected on the glossy, black front and is honestly not much of a big deal for me. Being that this is first and foremost a media device and not a PDA the omission of a calendar and address book, though sorely missed after using the iPods and Zens, is only spilled milk at this point...one can only move on. Also at this time I am not sure if there is a dedicated program for the Toshiba to download audio and video programs like TWiT, DL.TV and CNet Buzz, but I assume finding a way won't be difficult at all.

<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>4.5 stars: Nice, sleek design. Nice interface. Versatile. Superb sound quality (no need to use EQ). Newsworthy alternative to the bad-looking I-Pod and Zen Vision:M.  3 stars What could be improved: 1) What's the point in having a port when there's no docking station available? Gigabeat was out on 2006...time to think about it, Toshiba! 2) WMP sucks! Only Mp3-Tag-info file management it's no great idea. No way to use other software to use device interface properly (annoying for already existing MP3 on PC) 3) With a more powerful battery it could last longer: waiting for 3rd-party ones...  I hope there will be firmware releases in the (immediate) future, just to add new features: Gigabeat is now underexploited  I keep on waiting patiently...  A great buy! (half the original via Electronica Direct - and I live in Europe, where it not available)

<Content>At about $230 for 60 gigs, it can't be beat. I spent 2 weeks researching for this purchase and the Toshiba Gigabeat always came up as a great product on all the reviews. This is a great player. Huge amount of storage. Easy to use. Great sound. The software was a breeze to install. I love it! The only downfall is the battery life. It is horrific to say the least.  I am only getting 4-6 hours max for just the music portion. I use mine 90% of the time plugged into my stereo system so it really doesn't bother me to much as I use the ac adaptor. Bottom line: If you don't mind recharging every 3 days this is a great bargain.

<Title>This ones packed with great features!
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB Portable Media Player for my commute, which is an hour by ferry one way and I love it!  I can listen to my favorite downloaded music, listen to the radio, or watch a downloaded TV show.  I've used my Gigabeat on a trip to store digital photos that I downloaded from my camera and then viewed on the TV in the hotel, as well as watched a downloaded TV show and a movie from my Gigabeat on the hotel TV. WOW, this thing does it all!  I've been using it for about two months now and have had no problems with it in anyway.  Everything that I have put into it has been downloaded using Microsoft Media Player and Media Center.  My Gigabeat has been used with my Cannon Camera and worked flawlessly.  I've recommended this to a friend who tried out my Gigabeat and then bought one for himself.  I've paired my Gigabeat with a pair of Sennheiser PX 200 head phones, which give you a lot more sound range than the standard in your ear head phones and a Misticaudio leather carry case.  Buy all three items and enjoy!

<Title>Great Product but hampered by interface.
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Gigabeat is great due to the capacity and media support.  However, the media it will support are only .wmv, .jpg, and less than cd-quality (320kbps) .mp3.  If you have avi's or ripped your cd's in another format, you may be out of luck.  You can't convert the formats yourself, because it is never made apparent what you need to convert them into (as far as bitrates and framerates).  Also, if you tagged your mp3s incorrectly (or freedb did), have fun finding them on the player, because it does not have an option to just look at the file name.  All that aside, for the price you get a 60 GB media player that will play movies and copy pictures from your camera (if it encodes in .jpg).  I do like it but I could see how it would be a pain to someone who isn't that into computers.

<Title>Very competent package
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>+ Great integration with Windows Media Player10+ (Unlike MS Zune which fails here) + Good form factor, not bulky at all.  Fairly light. + Excellent sound quality.  Sounds better without equalizer! + Good battery life, but as with all players this size, playing video will suck up charge.  Charger is a little bulky but I found that you can charge it with USB. + Great overall build quality. +60 Gb for the price! + Well designed user interface on the player and buttons work well. On the fly playlists. Large alphabet index character appears when you scroll through. + Super bright screen just a tad smaller than the Zune (made for Microsoft by Toshiba! ) Album art on display looks fantastic. + Master batter saver switch that turns off the juice completely. - Need to learn how sync up with Media player works. Read the Manual and check the forums. Construct your play lists first. - The Hold switch is a slider that could be better constructed. It is OK. - Master battery switch is tiny.  On first use, read the manual, get an opened up paper clip, examine under a bright light and take time to understand how it slides.  It is tiny and if forced, you may break it. - Not many cases and protectors to choose from yet.

<Content>This is an excellent mp3/pmp with a very simple user friendly interface, lots of hard drive space, amazing screen resolution, and extremely versatile file conversion...it uses Windows Media Player. I am sick of the Zune and IPod proprietary file conversion and wanted something that will play nearly anything...and this is it. Battery life is somewhat subpar when watching flicks, but other than that....absolutely perfect for what i need =)

<Title>Buyer, beware.
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really, really wanted to love this player. It's shiny, it has a beautiful display, and before I had loaded my files onto it, I thought the interface was nice. That's why I've given it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.  Then I loaded it up with the stuff I usually listen to -- classical music, ripped from various CDs (not all of which show up in the CDDB), and a ton of audiobooks that I've ripped from CDs and also transferred from other file formats... so they have no ID tag information.  This was not a problem with my previous (and now, still current) player. It organized my files the way I put them on it: in folders that made sense to me. It played them according to their file names. This was perfect, and exactly how I wanted it.  However, the Gigabeat (and apparently, most other recent players) are now working almost exclusively on the iPod model, "organizing" files using ID tag information, so that files are organized by artist, album, and the like. That's great if you've ripped the files directly from a CD(or, I suppose, bought them from iTunes) and kept that info, but if you haven't, they're "organized" as a huge, unusable list of "audio track #". I have over 5000 files that have no ID tag information -- there's NO WAY I was going to go through each one and add the tag info, even *if* I could figure out how to do that.   So the Toshiba, although it is a beautiful, stylish little unit, is going back to Amazon. I will stick with my 3-year-old, black and white DMC X-Clef, which, although it's not pretty, and it's big and bulky, at least has the sense to allow me to organize my files without relying on ID tags.

<Title>Great Portable Media Player
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall, the Gigabeat is a fantastic little player.  I just plug it in each night so it can charge and sync with all my music and recorded TV shows (I use Media Center to record TV) and I"m good to go, although I'm very annoyed that HBO prevents their shows from being copied to it.  The player's interface is nice, in the same vein as MCE 2005, although not quite as polished as that of the ipod (doesn't pause when headphones are removed, backlight turns straight on and off rather than fading - little things like that).  It really could use a clock in the main menu though, and it would be nice to, in addition to adding to the 'quick list', be able to add media directly to 'now playing' but it's still, overall, very easy and intuitive.  Paired with WMP 11, syncing is also, on the whole, easy and straightforward, though not as much as it could be.  There are a few significant annoyances I've encountered while doing so, but on the whole it basically is easy to set up as a mobile extension of my media library.  It's a real shame there are no accessories for the dock, though.  The ipod wins hands-down in that respect.

<Title>Toshiba MESVK Gigabeat 60GB
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It should've been great, but wasn't.  1) Doesn't keep your music on it very long after you've transferred to it. 2) Doesn't transfer all of the music you tell it to transfer to it. 3) Talked to one of my colleagues; the player itself cut out after having served for less than a year.  Solve problems with what seem to be hard drive/memory errors, and design a program other than Windows Media Player (because it's buggy) to transfer music to it, give it what it needs to last for multiple years on end, and you'd have a 5 star product.  Don't know where Toshiba's going to get the money for the R&D, considering that no one really wants to buy anything other than those flippin' just-as-defective iPods these days, though.  Until Toshiba can get it together, go for a Creative MP3 player.

<Title>Move over ipod, there's a new sherrif in town
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this thing for a bout a week now, and am just amazed with it. I love it, it goes everywhere with me. For the price, it cannot be beat by a long shot. The major drawback for me, being a linux user is that you can't sync it in linux.. it must be windows. The directions say that you must use Windows Media Player to sync, but this is NOT true. I found WMP (11) to be lacking and a bit buggy, one time it formatted the whole player and erased all my music!  WMP is also lacking in features.  Music: So I was looking for an alternative and found that winamp (free) also syncs to the device. But what I recommend most is media monkey. Just google it. This is an awesome little program that has tons of features and the basic version is free. I went ahead and bought the gold version because I wanted the advanced features, but this program kicks Windows Media Player's butt up and down the block.   Movies, Videos: Most of my movies and videos are compressed using xvid and divx. The Gigabeat only plays wmv video files. This is another con about the device. So getting movies on there is a pain. Another program (not free) that I found very useful is called WinAVI, which can convert just about any type of video file to wmv and is easy to use. The best resolution to convert to video is to the screen size, which is 320x240. Even after you convert to wmv, windows media player again converts it before syncing it with the device. This entire process takes a long time.  Radio: FM reception is OK, not the greatest. You occasionally hear some static, but I hardly ever listen to the radio.  TV Out: One the best things about this device is the TV out feature. Even though the resolution of the video files are small, the video is surprisingly good quality when connected to a television set.   Although there are a few drawbacks, such as being a windows only device, and playing only one format of video, this little device is awesome, and I love it. In my opinion, this baby beats the ipod, and the low price in comparison is also a plus. Remember, if you find windows media player lacking, use winamp or media monkey (suggested) to sync your music.

<Title>Call a priest this thing is possessed
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really wanted to love this player and it had so much going for it. Terrific screen much larger than iPod's. A seemingly slick interface. Ability to watch TV recorded in Media Center.  An FM radio with usually ok reception. Well starting from the end, today for no apparent reason I find that my entire library of 4000 songs, several movies and TV shows were all erased.  It takes hours just to decode one DVD in a 3 step process and get it on the player. Now it will take untold hours to get everything back on.  Several other reviewers reported the same nightmare but I imagined they made some oversight and it was their error.  I wish I had sent it back before throwing away the packaging but now it's a bit late for that after 3 weeks.  Also I find the sound quality almost painful in some songs and I have used several ear buds including $500 Shure E5's.  There's a strange pop crackle that develops between songs for a second or two...wait, you'll see it develop.  There are almost zero accessories for this unit.  The controls seem to need more of a conscious effort instead of being intuitive and I have to look at the side buttons to do what I want to do.  Also, I can't just mute the radio when I am listening if for example I need to talk to a server at a restaurant. When everything works it seems like a steal.  But I never had any of these problems with my iPod using iTunes.  Sincerely hope not too many others have the vaporized content problem.  But this thing has been dropping stars since day one and now one is all I could muster.

<Content>I really liked the Gigabeat S60.  It looked beautiful, it sounded great, it synced pretty easy.  My only problem was the lack of the ability to customize(background, menus, etc), the lack of a microphone recorder, and the complete lack of accessories.  But for the price you can not find a better player with 60GB of memory!

I do not know HOW I ever lived without it. It is so cool to play songs from different artists, switching quickly from album to album and the quicklist feature for fav songs is so cool. I love the sound. I am going to invest in other headhones because earbuds let in too much noise. But I recommend this product highly!!

<Title>Great player in most ways.
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player mostly after seeing very good reviews for it on Cnet and I love it.  The interface is fantastic, and I perticuarly love having dedicated buttons on the side to control my music without fumbling with special entry methods (ipod).  The cross input interface works well and it was very easy to put all my music on it using Windows Media Player.  I find it easier to manage (move, rename, delete) using Winamp, though, but winamp can't put the album covers on it.  This is a minor gripe.  The worst thing about the player is definitly the battery life.  If you put it on the charger at night, you won't have a problem, but forget more than one day, or watch a lot of video, and you could end up stuck with a dead Personal Media Player.  The Radio works OK, better than any other portable radio I've ever had, but it only picks up a couple of stations.  Quality is excellent when I'm on-campus and listening to the local college station.  The second worst thing about the product is the lack of support.  Most people do not realize that the Microsoft Zune is identical in it's hardware specs, only with a bigger screen and wifi, making the whole unit bigger.  So basically all support has been abandoned.  All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.

<Title>Besides low battery life, no flaws
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I turned my ipod on one day and got a frowny face on the screen, signifying hard drive failure, which costs about $250 to fix.  Thats why I grabbed this bad boy, great format, large drive for the heavy collection...but do be warned the battery life is not the claimed "10-12" hrs.  When occasionally using the screen (only to switch songs/albums) it lasts about 4 hours, maybe 5 max. Ive had the gigabeat for a little over a month so I dont know if the battery life will gain over time and that this is just the battery getting "broke in" or whatnot.  Volume could go a lil louder than capacity, but i guess its objective to each's own hearing.  Drop the ipod, this things bigger and a very suitable alternative. By the way Rage Against the Machine is back together...for at least one day

<Title>everything good, except SOUND...
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using an iRiver H-120 for almost 4 years, the thing was becoming a thing of the past, but man, WHAT AN AWESOME SOUND I have enjoyed out of every tune played! Now, I wanted to upgrade to a player that would give me even more satisfaction, with the extras of viewing pictures, TV shows and movies. From the moment I opened the box I was happy, small size, great looks, beautiful screen and awesome Media Center portable interface. Huge letdown when the time came to put my earbuds on. The sound was as flat as a pancake. Don't get me wrong, for a person who's never had an mp3 player before, or for someone who is upgrading from an ordinary portable CD player, this could be bliss, but if you are used to quality sound that comes from players such as iRiver, iPod or Creative, and sound is a MUST for you, then don't buy this player. I even have great quality Sony earbuds MDR-EX81, which sell for about $99 on Amazon, and I couldn't get a decent sound even after trying the five preset equalizing modes. I returned it right away, Amazon provided a speedy refund, and then I went straight to the Creative Zen Vision M 60 GB. I chose this one over iPod as it supports more video formats (meaning less conversions), and also records voice and has FM radio.

I love that it has a radio tuner and the fact that you can just plug it into your TV and watch your movies is beyond awesome.  It just has so many features its great.  we will see how it holds up and I will likely get one for myself as I need a portable device I can upload my photos to when I am out taking pictures.  I am leery of all the randomly formatted drives, so we will wait and see.  Over all though, this thing is great!

<Title>Outstanding Portable Media Player
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my 60 GB Gigabeat five weeks ago and have been pleased with it since it arrived at my house.  The main reason I'm writing this review is to share my experiences with this product for anyone interested in buying one, and to set the record straight on a few of the misconceptions and/or complaints that are floating around the internet.  [...]  As far as I can tell, the data loss issue isn't even a problem.  I have no idea where this complaint comes from.  There's a possibility that Toshiba might have released some buggy units early on in the products initial run, but those problems have since been sussed out.  Failing that, the people who are complaining about this glitch have done something wrong and created their own problems.  My 60 GB MES60VK works fine with no data loss, software, or hardware issues.  The second common complaint is length of battery life.  Unlike the data loss complaints, this is a legitimate issue, although it may not be a deal breaking one.  From my experience, the internal battery does NOT last the 12 hours on a single charge that they claim it should.  On the other hand, it lasts a lot longer than 4 hours as some of the reviewers here on Amazon might have you believe.  Typically, I can squeeze out 7 or 8 continuous hours of music.  This is a problem if you somehow expect to go days and weeks between charges.  If you listen to music all day, you will have to charge at least once every 24 hours.  This hasn't been a real problem for me, however, because a two hour charge brings you to full power again (you can charge when you go for a cup of coffee, even).  It's not a huge price to pay and not worth denouncing the Gigabeat entirely over.    Those things aside, there's really not a bad thing you can say about the Gigabeat.  If you're buying this 60 GB version, it's almost a guaranteed thing you will have more hard-drive space than you need.  The video presentation is excellent, given the nature and limitations of the product.  Similarly, the sound quality is about as good as you could ever realistically expect from a portable media player.  The interface is streamlined and easy to use, and they include a software upgrade so that you'll be running the most current iteration of Windows Media Player (a necessity for using the Gigabeat).  It's simple, works well, and does everything you could expect out of a portable media player.  [...]  As far as I can tell, the Gigabeat only has one flaw: battery life.  And, if you're patient enough to make the quick trip to the charger on a daily basis, that doesn't even count.  The number of features offered by this player and its strong performance and storage abilities more than compensate.  In fact, that's why I'm recommending it unequivocally.

<Title>GIGABUST-Pretty but U S E L E S S!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The machine works great, but only when it is plugged into its DC power supply. I know, that's not what you are planning to use the machine for. You probably are expecting a portable media device. Well, if you have a long enough extension cord, you won't be disappointed. Or you might consider a 12 volt battery and an inverter, great pictures and tunes, but probably a bad back.  When you read that the battery S U C K S, believe what you have read. Battery life is non-existent, even when you are not using the machine!  SERVICE is obviously a  foreign word to Toshiba. Every time you have to return the machine for repair, you'll need an authorization code and a copy of the original bill. Turn around time will be at least two weeks and there will be no explanation of what repairs were done, if any. This is the voice of experience. I've had my machine since mid-October and its been back for repairs twice. I'm now waiting for a replacement machine.  DO NOT BUY this product, it is BAD! You are now an informed consumer. Learn from my experience/mistake.
