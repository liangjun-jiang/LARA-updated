<Title>very useful little device
<Date>Tue Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got my Sansa 4 GB MP 3 Player yesterday and am already using it. well, I must admit when I first saw it, I was a little disappointed ... it is very light and thus it looked a little cheap by material. But as soon as I played around with it, I got more and more satisfied. I really like it and am absolutely happy I got it. It's good for all the things I want to use it for ... playing my music in the car (without changing CDs all the time), going jogging and rollerblading (CD player is impossible to use there), travelling (CD player and CDs take so much space in my already crammed hand luggage), even for waiting at the doctor or at the post office.   yes, some of the things mentioned above are right: the headset is not very good (but i have got lots of those which I can use)  the little pouch is not too great either but sufficient  well, being not a computer genius I was first a little panick-stricken when I saw there was no manual how to download music etc. I have never worked with MP3 and thus I thought I needed to invest time in asking a friend. But I have always been a person that likes to try it ... and by playing around with it, I figured everything out quite easily. no problems downloading, even no problems establishing playlist. I mean it was that easy that I could already start using it today. I have got a couple of things on there and it's only a small fraction of what it can hold. I'm looking forward to putting all my favourites CDs on there and then I won't have to mess with them anymore.   The reason why I gave it only 4 stars: I tried and tried but I haven't found a stop or turn off button yet. I mean I turn it on and it's playing and playing. I know you can set a sleep mode. But what if I'm in the car, don't know how long I'm going, stop here and there and want to turn it off? If somebody reads this and has got answer, pl. let me know. I'm desperate to know.   I really recommend this player ... so far. well, I haven't had it long enough yet to say anyhting about long-term issues.

<Title>love/hate relationship
<Date>Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I, a 40 year old, finally got with the times and got an MP3 player. After doing the necessary research and asking advice of others I bought the Sansa 260. What I do not uderstand is the complete lack of a "how to" guide with this products. Maybe it's my age (wow, that sounded "old") but to me, this technology is not intuitive...in other words, I don't know what to do nor how to do it. The website is no help, and the "quick start" included is worthless. I've had lots of learnings that are trial and error and hit and miss...if there was a way to troubleshoot this thing -- either online or through a manual, I would be less tempted to throw it out the window.  Right now I'm listening to it; I tried to switch songs and selected one, but instead the CD that I downloaded started playing over...but the song I selected is showing as "now playing." Argh! So, yes it's great for convenience, but from a practical standpoint it's a pain in the....

<Date>Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was attracted to the M260 as I could Drag&Drop my wma files.  That was easy.  I also liked the use of rechargable AAA bateries.  Unfortunately, my M260 went into a "reformating disk" mode, then a "rebuilding library" mode for a couple of hours then DIED.  I had used it for aobut 6 hours total. I returned it to the POP and will research iPods!

<Title>Great for Unlimited Song Downloading Subscriptions!
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> The SanDisk Sansa M260 has an LCD display with a backlight, however it's often hard to read because of poor contrast. The Creative Zen V and V+ have a much brighter display, are much more compact than the M260, and can display color photos at good resolution (the M260 can't display any photos at all), yet they're also compatible with Napster-To-Go. I'd recommend either of the Creative Zen V/V+ models over the SanDisk M260.   The Play For Sure designation for MP3 players, and its logo on this particular MP3 player, don't guarantee it'll work for a Napster-To-Go subscription. Fortunately, the M200 series of MP3 players from SanDisk (including the M260) do work with Napster-To-Go so you can legally download an unlimited number of songs to up to 3 PCs and up to 3 MP3 players in one household.

<Title>SanDisk User 
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I originally bought the 1 Gig model, ran out of space, and a week later bought this one, the 4 Gig model M260. What I like: It's light and fits in my shirt pocket. The bigger models won't (without a sagging pocket). This model also has the built in equalizer. I don't think my 1 gig model did - but I only used it for a week before upgrading to this one.  What I don't like: The ear buds that come with this and all other small MP3 players aren't very good. Expect to pay for a new set of portable headphones - if you want decent sound. [...]. Be careful what headphones you pick; remember that your player and the headphones are being powered by a single AAA battery.  There is a downside to being this small and light. The screen is small and you can't see the whole album title when scrolling by album name. Just when the album title starts to scroll horizontally into view, the screen light goes out! One alternative is to make a lot of playlists with short names and download them to this device.  I use Windows media player 11 to synch this device. It does an excellent job.

<Title>A good basic MP3 player
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa M260 is the highest capacity (4 GB) flash-memory based MP3 player currently available that takes standard AAA batteries.  I have found it easy to use, both for listening to MP3's and the FM tuner.  (I have not used the voice recorder.)  I have used the player only with MP3's ripped from CDs I own, not with a subscription music service.  The sound quality is good.  Pros: Easy to use, good amount of storage space, takes standard AAA batteries, FM tuner.  Cons: A little bulky, although it fits in a standard shirt pocket; the headphones did not fit my ears and I replaced them with the Sony MDR-EX51LP, which are very comfortable; the LCD display is hard to read when the player is in the plastic case that comes with it and you are wearing sun glasses (which I usually am when I am using it outside).

<Title>very good for its class
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for an mp3 player with 2 features: 1st to work with regular batteries and 2nd without a hard drive. I know, I'm weird, but I wanted to be able to replace the battery when it runs out, not to wait until I have a chance to charge it again. And I wanted something that I drop and it still works, hence I excluded the hard drives. So I came upon Sansa M260, I got it and I fell in love with it. Pros: Easy to load songs from Windows media player. Long battery life. Easy to browse. Radio. Plays lots of formats. Cons: I didn't like the headphones. I replaced them with Sony ear-buds, dramatic improvement in sound quality. It turns off automatically a little too fast if you pause it for a few seconds. Over all, I'm very happy with my choice.

<Title>Coolest MP3 Player (updated twice)
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok, it has an FM radio that works swell, too.  But that little MP3 player rocks! I go to the gym 4 or 5 times a week, and I take this with me every time. Sometimes I work out hard for 45-minutes and other times I'm in there for a hour and a half. Anyway, I got this player on Oct. 12th, and today Nov. 15th I am still using the same single AAA battery that shipped with the player. I have about 20 of my favorite workout CDs ripped to MP3 and loaded on this player, and the player is set to play them on random. One thing I've noticed: about half the time the player picks 2 songs in a row by the same artist. Maybe it's a programming glitch, but I think it is neat!  The M260 comes with a printed QuickStart Guide and the full manual on a mini-CD, but the device was so simple to use that I have yet to look at it.  To turn the player off, you have to hold the power button down for about 5 seconds. This comes in handy and prevents you from turning it off accidentally by bumping it. Also, if a song is playing when you turn the MP3 player off, it starts right back up in the same location when you turn it back on! Nice, huh?  Another nice feature is using Windows Explorer to copy files to the M260 device. I wasn't sure what folder in the device the MP3s were supposed to go into, so I used the Sansa interface to copy over 1 song. It didn't really take any longer to copy the file that way than it does using Windows Explorer, but I'm more familiar with Explorer than I am with the Sansa software.  It does voice records. Kinda cool. It would have helped a lot for recording lectures while I was in college, but all we had back in the 90s were those mini cassette recorders.  The FM radio works well, and I'm in an office that doesn't get good reception at all.  Negatives (There are 2): 1) The Sansa draws a lot of power off of the USB port. Now, I develop software for PDA devices here at work, and PDAs also connect through and draws a lot of power from the USB port. I can't have the PDA and the Sansa connected to the same port at one time. Luckily, my PC's USB ports are not hubbed together, so I have other ports available. 2) I have not found a way to tell how much space is free on the Sansa. So, how do I know when my 4GB of space is used up? Maybe that information is in the manual somewhere that I've never had to read.  Overall? I like it, I do not regret my purchase, and I would not hesitate to buy it again. Death to IPOD! :)  --- Update: Ok, here it is 15 days later: Nov. 30, and I wanted to let others know that my first AAA battery just died. That means, I used it for a month and a half in the gym before needing to swap the single battery - I like that!  A little background: To turn the player on, one has to hold the power button down for about 3 seconds. Apparently the Sansa M260 displays a "Low Battery" note on the LCD when the battery is getting low. Unfortunately, I'm a creature of habit: I've gotten to where I just hold the button down without looking at the display. Well, yesterday the player died on me in the gym. Stunned, I looked down to see it had turned off. As I was turning it back on, I looked a little closer to find the "Low Battery" message that I probably should have responded to a week ago! Still, the player obliged me by playing my music for me, but I promptly changed that battery when I got home.  I hope some of you find this information useful! I still like this little gadget a lot! ~JP  --- Update 2: Still using this daily, 6-months later! It is great! The little IPOD Nano is cool, too, but it does not come with an FM radio like this one does.  Another thing I noticed: With song play on random, I can stop playing an MP3, listen to the radio, then restart the MP3 player: Every time, the MP3 player will start playing with the same song! I'd like to be able to "re-shuffle" the playlist.  Another request: I'd like to be able to delete a song using the device, but that isn't possible. I don't sync this player to my Windows computer very often (ok, I never have), and it would really be nice to delete that darned Diddo song that keeps wanting to play when I am at the gym. Ick! :)

<Title>Forget Ipods, get one of these
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK, let me clarify first I am not a huge fan of Apple/McIntosh or any of their products. My son received an Ipod for Christmas last year (2005) which has been functional about 4 weeks in that time. Other family members have had similar problems, and many online forums tell the horror stories of Ipods. I wanted an MP3 player, but until I saw the Sandisk version, none of them appealed to me. My first impression was it was smaller than I thought it would be. Beyond the size, this 4GB version is great. Includes an FM radio which works ok for me indoors, but can't pick up some stations I can in my car or on a regular radio, no big deal I got it for the MP3 capability. I have mine loaded with 363 songs, and still have 1.6GB left. I have yet to rip the rest of my library, have up to N in it now. With the new windows media player 11, it recognizes the player, and will automatically synch for you, or you can pick and choose what you want in there. Much easier than the Ipod (or Sony Bean my wife has), don't have to install any software, just hook up the USB cable and you are set. Can listen to certain artists, albums, favorites, very flexible on how you organize the music. As for battery life, I've been listening for about 6 hours a day for 3 or 4 days, and still have about 50% battery left, and that is with the cheap battery that came with it. Some cons though, can't be all positive. There's a cheap plasticy feel to the switches and the battery cover isn't snug. Also the display is rather small, but I don't think most people will have trouble with reading it. Overall, I think this player beats the Ipod hands down. Would highly recommend this unit, though the $299 price is double what I paid before Christmas.

<Title>Pass on this one - has some strengths but irritating weaknesses
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I too was enamored by the 4GB size, easy USB & Windows Explorer interface to move files instead of a proprietary software program, WMA compatible, and the FM radio.  AAA battery life is long enuf (as expected) but always keep spare batteries in your backpack, locker, or desk.  I consider that to be an advantage - when it dies, you pop in a new, commonly available, cheap, and disposable alkaline battery and you're running again wherever you are.  However, song selection and song play is maddening.  According to Sandisk customer service, it's COMPLETELY dependent upon the ID3 data for ALL songs so all songs better be consistent - lower case, upper case, punctuation, etc. or else songs are treated as separate artists, etc.  You can organize your songs in subdirectories, but it's a waste of time as there is NO option to make the player play by subdirectory and alphabetical order.  It's crazy - Sandisk won't let owners create and play collections of songs/podcasts simply by creating subdirectories named by users ("NPR podcasts", "jazz," "run tunes," artist names, etc.).  Although Sandisk states an ability to use playlists, there's absolutely no way to create mixed artist playlists that work.  The only playlists I could get onto the player are when I ripped entire CDs of tunes and transferred them onto the player.  Playlists of different songs made in Windows Media Player won't work on this player.  Other than a 30 song "Favorites" playlist you create by clicking buttons to select & designate each song in the player, you better like having your 4GB of songs play in a somewhat RANDOM order.  This player has essentially become my FM radio and USB memory storage device simply because I can't make it play songs in any order I want them to play unless I redo each and every ID3 tag in each song.  I bought an Apple Nano 8GB instead and it's MUCH easier to use.  Playlists created in iTunes work flawlessly.  The downers of the Nano are: I can't plug the Nano into my work computer to add songs (iTunes isn't allowed on it), I have to recharge the battery at home instead of replace anywhere, can't play protected WMA songs, and there's no FM radio (need a $60 add-on device).  But I can listen to my mp3 music and podcasts any way I want on the Nano and that makes all the difference!  I strongly recommend interested buyers pass on this player until Sandisk updates the firmware to provide an option to allow play "By Subdirectory."  There are plenty of competitors who make a more user friendly player.  I enjoyed my iRiver 390 player for years until it died.

<Title>Bad player with known, unresolved  issues. Bad customer service.
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this MP3 player for Christmas of 06, and have experienced a flaw in it's design that is well documented with it's user base. I will simply paste an explanation of the problem I found.  "There is a known issue regarding these players' tendency to display "unknown artist" or "unknown album" even when Windows Explorer, or Media Player clearly reflect the correct artist and or album of a particular song when the unit is connected via the USB port. This issue appears to occur randomly and even the most recent beta firmware (version 2.2.5) has not resolved it." [...]  Other discussions about said issue can be found will a small amount of research. However, there is no solution to this problem. I contacted SanDisk via their on-line tech support system on Jan-9, and received no response after several days. I then called their tech support line, as assigned case ID #982315 and was told I would be contacted the next day by somebody named Jason. I was never contacted by said person.  After a week of waiting, I wrote their customer service again. On Jan-23, I received an e-mail instructions to return my MP3 from where it was bought.  Replacing my MP3 player with the same model containing the same fundamental design flaw is not what I want, I want a solution. This MP3 player cost over $200, and it was shipped with a known defect.  Based on my experience with SanDisks customer service, the bug this player was shipped with, and SanDisks inability to correct said bug via firmware updates in over a year, I will not buy another SanDisk product.

<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have quite a bit of experience with mp3 players, because I've had pretty bad luck with them, but the SanDisk Sansa M200 series (I own both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP8AY2/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-0237131-1339863">SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> and this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EIHG96/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-0237131-1339863">SanDisk Sansa M260 4GB MP3 Player (Blue)</a>) has proven to be the most reliable and user friendly, hands down. I have *never* had a problem with this series of player, as I have with *all* of the others I have tried in the past, which consistently break down within months. I really like the fact that it is difficult to accidentally press a button and the sync process has always run smoothly.  You can pop in another AAA battery when you need to.  This is nice because, if you take long road trips like I do and don't always have access to an electrical outlet, you don't have to go without your music.  (That's why I don't care for rechargables.)  Also, the player is easily reformatted and made "like new" using Windows Media Player. The subscription "PlayForSure" option works well (I've only tested it with Napster To Go on my Media Center 2005 Edition PC using Windows Media Player 11).   I've been using this series for about 1-1/2 years.  There are also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BONJXU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-0237131-1339863">SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player (Blue)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BP50AY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-0237131-1339863">SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a> versions, which I have not tried.

<Title>Don't buy this player nor anything from Sandisk
<Date>Wed May 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was happy with this player in the beginning until I began having problems with some WMA and MP3 files.  They just won't play on the device unless I reformat it and copy them back on.  Sandisk support always say it's a normal process to reformat a device once in a while.  I don't think so!  Well, at least not every 2 weeks...  Now my warranty is expired since a week and Sandisk completely refuse to exchange it.  They just say "sorry for the inconvenience".  Well, I say "sorry, but you lost a customer!"    Also, be aware that they only support Windows XP under the MTP mode.  I tried putting some files on the device using the MSC mode which is compatible with Windows 2000.  The device will play the files but when you try to play a complete album, the songs will play them sorted by title instead of track number!

<Title>A good value, but overall a mediocre player
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this mp3 player for almost 2 years. At the time of my original purchase, this was pretty good player given it's price/capacity/size.  Today, given the strong competition out there and this Sansa's many flaws I'll detail below, I'd recommend most people look for a different mp3 player.  Pros: - Small/Light/Flashbased: The #1 reason I bought this player.... the physical size of this unit and it's solid state flash memory are perfect for runners.  I strap it to my arm and hardly know it's there.  The included elastic armband and clear plastic case work fine for running and gym use.  Yes, the plastic case is cheap and not likely to withstand rough use or repeated trips in and out of tight fitting jean pockets.  But this freebie is good for keeping light rain and sweat off the unit.  - Capacity:  This model is 4GBs... certainly not huge but MORE than enough for exercising and about just right for normal daily listening.  I typically use both MP3 and WMA's encoded using VBR 128 / 96 respectively and my player easily holds 30+ FULL albums.  At this bitrate the music isn't anywhere near CD quality, but it's good enough for when I'm out-and-about.  With 4GB's, I can go weeks before feeling the need to rotate new music onto my player.  -Backlighted display:  The display has a nice blue backlight that allows operation in the dark.  It's not fancy but it's very functional and allows me to operate the unit during early morning runs or in the car at night.  The backlight duration is adjustable and can be turned off completely to save battery power.  -Uses 1 AAA Battery:  Some people might consider this a CON.  For me, this was the #2 reason why I chose this unit.  When I go on vacation, I travel on a sportbike, sleep in a tent, and hike a lot.  I don't generally have access to electricity, nor do I carry a Laptop which many of today's MP3 players rely upon for recharging via USB.  This Sansa allows me to take a handful of AAA's and just go without worry.  When I'm not traveling, in order to save money and be environmentally conscious, I use 850mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries.  The rechargeables only last about 6-7 hrs, a little over 1/2 the runtime a normal alkaline battery provides, but who cares?  They're rechargeable!  I just pop another one in.  One NiMH easily gets me through a workday.  Windows Media Player or straight Drag-and-Drop for music management:  In MTP mode, the unit utilizes WMP for music library mgmt and syncing.  Personally, I like WMP.  It's fast, has a small memory footprint, and doesn't have processes that continue running memory resident even after I exit the application like iTunes.  I like WMP.  You may not.  If not, you can set the Sansa to mass storage mode and just drag and drop files onto the unit.  It's your choice.  Auto-Bookmarking function:  If you power down the unit while it's playing or PAUSE the unit and allow it to automatically power down after X number of minutes of inactivity, upon start-up the M260 will automatically resume playing from where it left off.  This is a must have feature for audiobook and podcast listeners becausing fast forwarding though huge .mp3 files is a pain.  Cons:  Poor Sound Qlty:  OK 1st off, this is not an audiophile product nor is it meant to be.  Also everyone knows sound quality is only as good as the source material so low quality encodes = poor sound.  But regardless, this Sansa like other SanDisk players I've used has "relatively" poor sound.  Specifically, bass and mid-bass are really poor and neither the custom EQ nor the handful of sound Presets (rock/jazz/etc...) do anything to improve the sound.  Actually, the presets make things worse!  Don't get me wrong, this player is NOT unlistenable OK!  It won't make your ears bleed :)  It's just not a GREAT sounding player compared to other brands, even those considered to have middling sound qlty like the iPod Video and iPod Shuffle in particular.  Even my cheap and outdated Creative C100 Sport sounds much better... deeper and tighter bass, fuller mid-range and clearer highs.  Plus the Creative's EQ is actually practical unlike my Sansa.  In order to get ANY KIND OF ACCEPTABLE bass out of this Sansa, you need to buy headphones that WAY OVER EMPHASIZE BASS.  I've found some inexpensive JVC headphone at Wally World that do just this.  These headphone sound terrible with a normal mp3 - way too bass heavy & boomy.  But paired with my Sansa, these earbuds fill in the low-end hole of the M260's audio spectrum.  Poor software/firmware expertise:  As a software developer myself, I'm rather shocked at SanDisk's level of technical expertise, or lack there-of.  This is a multi-million (billion?) dollar company!  Do these people understand the concept of Software Quality Assurance Testing???  I recently applied their newest firmware, hoping it would fix the music shuffle problem, and had disastrous results.  The good news is that my player still "plays" music.  The bad news is that the display is totally hosed.  As you skip through music, the ID3 tag info like Artist/Title from the previous song is not erased from the LCD display before the next song's data is displayed.  In other words, the display just continues to transpose song data on top of the previous song's data.  The display becomes unreadable... it looks like the Klingon alphabet!    Now Sandisk tells you NOT to update the firmware unless you are experiencing a problem that's addressed in the new firmware... some might even say, "well you did the update, so it's your fault"  I say total B.S!!  I'm a developer.  I actually TEST MY CODE before releasing it to the general public!  Also when I release code, I perform a little thing called Documentation in order to explain exactly what my code is doing.  SanDisk doesn't provide release notes with it's new firmware updates so there's no way to determine what problems/fixes are being addressed.  Oh, and their auto firmware installer is a horrid piece of software that automatically loads on boot-up and runs continuously in the background monitoring for new firmware updates.  The biggest problem is that the firmware updater seems to interfere with the m260's ability to sync with WMP!  You have to uninstall the firmware updater application to get syncing to work again!   This brings up the question of why a firmware updater needs to run 24x7 in the first place - especially if SanDisk says don't update unless you need to?  Me thinks they're sending mixed messages!  Music Shuffle doesn't Shuffle:  This unit has a "shuffle" feature but it doesn't do anything.  If you activate Shuffle and select PLAY ALL, the unit will play Songs X, Y, Z.  If you turn off the unit, turn it back on, reactive Shuffle, and select PLAY ALL, the M260 will play the same songs, X, Y, Z in the exact same order.  What's the point?  I was hoping the new firmware would fix this... well we know how that turned out!  - Doesn't play songs in Album order, uses Alpha Order instead:  This is a huge problem if you listen to Ebooks, podcasts, or are the type of person who enjoys listening to music in album order.  This Sansa does not obey the ID3 tag for TRACK #.  Instead it plays all music alphabetically by title.  This is beyond annoying if you listen to audio books or podcasts... You'll have to go in and rename all your files alphabetically like "Chaper_01-01.mp3, Chapter_01-02.mp3, Chapter_01-03.mp3" instead of relying on the ID3 Track# tag.  I have ebooks that are made up of hundreds of MP3 and this renaming is a royal pain in the a$$.  Random Lockups / Crazy Static sounds - Now this is NOT a huge problem.  It happens infrequently, maybe 10 times in 2 years.  But it's still not very assuring.  A solid state piece of equipment should not randomly lockup.  Also on a few occasions the unit just starts putting out static laced music and really low audio volumes for no reason.  The rectify either problem, you simply have to pop out the AAA battery and restart the thing.  Takes like 5 seconds.  With players without removable batteries, I've read these types of issues can be terminal.  Again, not a game stopper by any means, but just one more negative issue a "modern" mp3 player should not have!  Windows Media Player:  In general, WMP works just fine as a syncing/music manager.  But occasionally, it does not recognize the Sansa upon plugging in the USB adapter.  You then have to go through the process of unplugging, waiting, re-plugging, waiting.... with the Sansa until WMP recognizes the unit.  Again, this doesn't happen very often... maybe I'll have an issue 5% of the time.  But still, 5% of the time is still NOT GOOD ENOUGH for a piece of consumer electronics gear.  CE gear should work 100% of the time.  Flimsy battery cover:  I'm not a huge stickler for build quality.  I don't require my things be made out of aircraft aluminum or titanium for me to be happy.  As long as something is constructed fairly solid I'm good.  That said, the battery cover on the M260 is definitely CHEAP.  It has 2 TINY plastic points on one end that act as a hinge.  The other end has a really weak plastic clip that holds the battery cover on.  If you are not an extremely careful person like myself, I can easily see you breaking the plastic points or clip off the cover.  Even just putting on the included plastic carry case can be dangerous to the battery cover.  The plastic case has 2 snaps on the back to keep it secured.  If you press too hard on the snaps, it puts pressure on the battery door and can easily break door's plastic tabs!  In summary, this is not the worst player out there.  It's great for exercising, but so are a TON of other players on the market today.  If I had to do it over again, I would not buy this unit.  But in the 2 years I've had it, it's be useful... painful and annoying at times YES... but useful.  Even with the screwed up display, I'll continue to use my m260 for my morning runs, but I'll have to find a better behaved unit for daily use.

<Product Name>SanDisk Sansa M260 4GB MP3 Player (Blue)
<Title>Love this brand!
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had a 2GB Sansa for a couple of years now and love it.  It is easy to use and holds a great number of songs.  This Christmas I decided to get one for each of my parents (a 4GB and a 1GB) and they are both thrilled with theirs.  Though it is not considered to be the "coolest" brand or model, I would continue to buy SanDisk products before any other.  They are combatible with many different types of music files and digital books.  This brand provides a high quality, easy to use mp3 player available in many different formats!
