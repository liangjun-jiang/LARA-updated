<Content>Good affluent product with defined characteristics, but with a high consumption of battery. Also the salesman would have to improve the packing, because to receive the product opened in folder he gives bad impression

<Title>Not bad for what you pay

<Content>It's cheap.  It works.  The instructions that come with the unit are worthless, but with a little ingenuity one can find very good ones for identical devices sold under different names by other importers. Although the device will play .wma (Microsoft media) files, it does not meet the Microsoft standards to play copy protected files -- even if you have paid for the rights to play them.
