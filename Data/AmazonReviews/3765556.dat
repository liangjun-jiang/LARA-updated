<Content>I bought this on ebay for less than $25. After using it for over a month now, I can say that I'm very satisfied.   Pros -> Rechargeable battery.. no AAs.. connect to USB.. works like a charm. -> Thin.. front is like a mirror..  -> Fits in the change pocket of my jeans..  -> Seems sturdy. Good sound. I'm using $5 Sony headphones with a volume equalizer. -> Battery Life is awesome.. I ran it for 3-4 hours straight and still the battery was half full..  Cons -> 128 MB.. Doesn't fit a lot of songs.  -> The software requires a little getting used to. -> parts (headphone jack/ USB cable) cannot be replaced. -> No shuffle feature.  Overall I gave it 4/5 stars. It's a great product. The
