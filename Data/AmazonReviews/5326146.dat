<Title>Basic functionality is okay
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to be used as a music player in my new baby's room.  I have it connected to powered speakers.  This is always connected to the external power adapter.  Computer interface: USB2.0.  Works exactly as expected; when plugged in, it shows up as a removable drive.  I'm using Linux, and it couldn't be easier to connect.  Display: multiple colors.  Interface is slightly clunky, but usuable.  Buttons: small.  It takes extra concentration to make sure you press the one you intend to.  Built-in speakers: they seem to produce some type of sound.  They can be used to verify that the song that has been copied to the player will work, but you really don't want to listen to them more than a few seconds.  Sound quality: adequate.  I encoded the MP3s with a fairly low bit rate, and everything sounds fine for my application.   Two drawbacks: - Can't be turned off when plugged into external power - "Shuffle" mode only plays songs from the current folder

<Title>Something wrong
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everything was looking great. The shipping was fine with a little delay. The device is awesome, its small with big sound and good quality. And the design is simple and this is what I like about it, with enough 512mb flash memory. But... The only main problem that makes me mad is that it came with dead battery. I tried to charge it many times with the provided USB charger but it's only working when the power is plugged in.

<Title>Poor Quality! Dead in 2 days
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product description is not correct This player do not have SD slot, but it can show 7 colors It is tiny for a MP3 player with built-in speakers. However, the quality is the most terrible part of this unit, dead in two days! When I turn on the power, it just shows logo and THAT'S IT. Reset the unit several times but no luck. Worst quality ever!
