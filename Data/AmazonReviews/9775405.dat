<Title>Great Step Up
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've rocked out an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y7976/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-4812178-4699210">Apple 2 GB iPod Nano White</a> for a while and loved the mobility and such but figured since I'm heading off to an out of state college next year I'm gonna want more then 2GB storage space...which brought me to this iPod video. The upgrade in space is amazing and you dont lose too much of the great mobility the nano affords you. Costs a bit more then then nano but if you search out for one you can find one at a decent price. I got mine for $120 through an Amazon registered seller and it's been perfect.  I highly reccomend for college kids since you and your room mate may differ on what to watch and you might have some down time between classes but not enough to go back to the dorm or lug out and get all set up with a laptop.  Also highly reccomend for somebody whose nano just doesnt hold enough.

<Title>Battery life is horrible for music
<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got the ipod 30g.  I had the dell digital dj 20g prior.  the dell would easily go 10 hours plus on one charge listening to music and advancing songs as often as you like.  I cannot even do one leg on a flight with the ipod.  I get 2-3 hours per charge at best and that is trying not to touch the unit and have backlight set to 1 second.  If it try to plug into my laptop in flight you cannot use while it is 'connecting' and never stops saying that even when set to manual.  I always heard that ipod had battery issues but thought the newer ones solved the problem.  I did look at the battery tips page and they do not help, not a good sign that they have a whole page dedicated to just that issue.  Mine is likely going back.  Amazing how many they sell of these with these issues.  unit looks good but not practical

<Title>catch up on your desperate housewives
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this the day it came out in the stores...not on purpose though. I was bringing my U2 edition ipod in to the Apple store to be fixed, and when I saw the quality of the graphics on this screen, I found myself in a semi-sort of trance handing my credit card to the cashier. So far, I have brought it to a pre-party for u2's concert, and we all watched the videos on my i-pod while it was plugged into the awesome Bose base....it was fun...great sound and fun to watch.... Also, I have caught myself being very content eating alone in thai food restaurants watching my missed Desperate Housewives episodes.....how fun is that? and no commercials too....easy to download videos, songs, pictures from your computer....I have the Kate Spade case (very reasonable price and it perfectly protects it) and it clips easy on my purse so I can listen all the time to my ipod.....only thing i recommend....phillips makes better ear buds than the ones these come with...i bought them for under $15 I think....Enjoy!

<Title>What's with the complaining?
<Date>Sat Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player is fantastic. For me, the battery life is solid, i've shuffled through songs for 5-6 hours without ever thinking about the battery, and last night i fell asleep with a 3/4 charge and forgot to turn it off, but was shocked when i woke up in the morning with music still playing. I have the white model and it looks great, people notice it a lot. I've had it for well over a week and still haven't taken the plastic screen protector off and I don't plan to until a skin comes out for this new model, and i recommend everyone else do the same, it's really hard to even notice that it's still on and the player is fully functional.  Yes you do have to tweak your videos before adding them, but you have to do this for most portable video players so I don't know why everybody is yapping. My only complaint is with adding photos to the ipod, there's no obvious way to add one photo at a time, you have to have a folder for the ipod to sync to, and delete and add photos accordingly, but its not that big of a deal. Overall i have been verry please with this product and recommend it to all.    Side note - everyone should realize that while customer reviews are very useful, people are much more likely to review the product if they have had a bad experience or a defective product than if they have had no problems, so the proportions of negative to positive reviews are somewhat skewed. Just something to keep in mind while reading reviews.

<Title>iPod Video 60 GB
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is undoubtedly the best iPod yet.  I have had the last three versions and this one is my favourite.  Like the iPod photo, the support for USB2 is much better that in earlier iPods (where there either was no USB support or if there was you still had to use a Firewire cable for power).  This version you can sync and charge via USB which is great as all you need on the move is the USB cable - you can normally find somewhere with a PC (or use your own laptop pc if you have it with you) with USB to charge up your iPod.    The screen is bigger so you can see your photos better and the iPod video is significantly thinner than the iPod Photo too which is great.  Width and Height seem pretty much the same as the previous iPod (with the exception of the screen which as mentioned is much bigger than before).  You can definitely watch movies on the video iPod.  I used it recently on a trip over to Europe and watched a few movies I had recorded on my Tivo video recorder on my iPod.  The quality is reasonably good and the battery life sufficient to watch a movie.  The current iPod is still a long way from ideal (I could easily list off a whole raft of improvements I'd like to see), but given the highly portable nature of the device, huge disk capacity and the not too unreasonable battery life its a very good effort at video, music and photos on the move.  Update Feb 2006: Having had this device a few months now, I remain very happy with it.  The main issue I have with it is the inability to play most video formats other than MP4.  Converting video into MP4 format to watch on the iPod is a pain.  If I go to considerable time and trouble I can do this using my PC, however it takes hours to convert a movie into MP4 and in my experience there are frequently conversion problems (e.g. sound getting out of synch with the video).  I'm hoping that the forthcoming support from Tivo for conversion of Tivo content for viewing on the iPod will make this simpler.  Until then (or until Apple upgrade the iPod firmware so that it can play back a wider range of video formats) I will probably continue to use my iPod mainly to listen to music rather than as a video player.

<Title>pretty good
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>when i first saw the video ipod online i was DYING to get one, but it's important for you to go and look at them in the store first.  this is my second ipod, my first one being a 4G mini. i bought the video primarily for more song space. the picture quality is great, even for the small screen.  however, i must say that i'm very disappointed in the scratch factor. i've only had mine for about 3 days and much of the faceplate has scratches on it. i have the black model and i'm seriously considering returning it for the white model, in the hopes that it will show less scratches. i've babied mine and there still remains to be numerous scratches.  any advice for returns?

<Title>disappointing
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Its an ipod and so, of course, you have to love it but... I was pretty annoyed to find that in order to transfer video to it I would either need to download from itunes store or buy a separate piece of software to do conversions. For $300 this baby really needed to include that. Also, the itunes that came with this one replaced my old itunes install but doesn't recognize my pre-video 20 GB ipod. This is causing some trouble as my husband and I share a computer but each have different generations of ipods. I still love the little guy. It's thin and the color screen is great but the annoyance factor is taking its shine off mighty quick.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the 30gig unit in the middle of October.  Like most of us I was a little worried about scratching, because of the media blitz on the nano.  I pretty much keep it in its case and if it's in my pocket it is always in the case.  I find this being a little annoying, but I'm going to keep doing this until a better case is on the market.  The screen does have scuffs on it but by NO MEANS DOES IT IMPARE IT'S USE.    I haven't timed the battery life, but it has never been a problem where it has drained and I couldn't recharge.  Recharging seems quick. Sorry haven't timed it.  I purchased a video online and that whole process was about the same has music but a little bit longer.  I also copied a DVD to it and that took about 3hrs to encode.  Both the Pixar video and the DVD look great on screen.  I haven't tried it on my TV yet.   About three years ago I got tired of replacing cd's that I already have bought, so I copied my whole cd collection to my PC.  Unfortunately I did it with wma codec.  The process of converting my collection took forever.  I haven't noticed any degration in the sound quality.  What is cool is after I copied everything over I still have about 14gigs free and that's the 30g ipod.    My laptop is only USB 1, so it is slow transferring to the ipod.  I hooked it into my PC with USB 2 and it was much faster.  If you are married pay attention.  I give the Ipod a WAR (Wife approval rating) rating of 10 out of 10.  She loves it.  I had a netgear 101 wireless audio media center for our home stereo and in her mind it was a disaster.  Now we just hook up the Ipod to it and everything is great.  I bought the monster fm transmitter for the car, but I was not happy with it.  I returned in and got the Transpod FM Transmitter and power dock. It works great with the video Ipod.  I don't believe it states that it is supported yet, but it works fine. The Transpod places the Ipod at eye level, so you are not distracted from the road.  I have had some complaints about the Ipod.  First, I hate the earplugs.  They make my ears sore and sound is not that great.  Also, don't like how itunes and the Ipod handle soundtracks.  You can group them but that removes them from the artist list and put's them in another menu screen.  I wish it would group sound tracks and leave them in the artist menu.  Hope this helps I love this unit and hope to buy another for my wife.

<Content>iPod Video 5th Generation Review The 5G (5th generation) iPod with Video and Photo viewing capabilities is the latest evolution in the iPod line. The key word here is evolution, as, for the most part, it only includes a few minor improvements from the previous 4th generation iPod. Read on, and I'll tell you exactly what I think of this hot new product.  Installing Installing the iPod, I decided to just plug it into my computer. Unfortunately, the iPod locked up! That seemed pretty bad to me. After browsing the web a while, I figured out how to reboot the frozen iPod (hold down the middle select button and the menu button at the same time for about 6 seconds to reset/reboot it). Also, make sure that the iPod hold switch is not set when you try to reboot it. After rebooting, I decided to upgrade my iTunes from 6.0 to the most current version at the time (6.0.1.3) just to be safe, and then plugged in the iPod again, and it worked this time.  Design The 5G iPod has the same classic iPod look of the 4th generation design. From a design standpoint, it is gorgeous, the same width and height as the 1st generation iPod, but about half the thickness. It has a classy and classic design that looks beautiful and elegant. In the hand it feels nice- moderate weight but solid. One thing that you'll notice is how minimalist the design is- there are very few buttons and knobs and switches. The most notable thing is its round touch wheel which has 4 buttons embedded on it and a button in the center. The 4 clickwheel buttons have a nice tactile feedback when you push on them, however, they are completely flat on the touch wheel. In fact, it's so minimalist that there is not even an on/off switch (you have to hold the pause button down for several seconds and then flip the hold switch). There is no volume knob- you use the touch wheel (which also serves also to scroll through songs and also for rating your songs). Sadly, the latest touchwheel is a downgrade from all previous versions. It is much more "twitchy", and error-prone than the one on my second generation iPod mini, and much inferior to my 1st generation mechanical wheel in feel and accuracy.  The LCD screen is color and it's beautiful. It is 2.5" diagonal and has a resolution of 320x240. Videos look good on the screen. Motion is clear and smooth, though the screen is really too small to watch long movies on. On the top edge, there is one headphone jack and a hold switch. On the bottom, there's a custom connector which you can use a cable to connect to your computer's USB port (Firewire is no longer supported). No docking station is included, a money-saving tactic on Apple's part.   I Call It Scratchy The 5G iPod has a very scratch-prone screen. In fact, after just 1 day of using it gently, and putting it in my pocket (without any metal objects or coins) it somehow developed far more scratches than my 3 month old 2G iPod mini which was not babied at all. In fact, it's rather upsetting that the screen in some parts is so marred with scratches that it causes video playback to sometimes shimmer in that area. At least Apple now includes a new ultra-thin neoprene-like case. I like the case a lot, it's very simple but compact and provides just enough protection for carrying around without adding much bulk.  Features  The iPod is fairly light on features. It plays music files in AAC format (used by Apple's iTunes music store) and plays MP3s and Apple Lossless format. Apple has finally added reasonable recording support (though you need to buy a separate add-on microphone). And, the big news is, Apple's video support. Actually, video support is pretty good. Apple's web site says it supports H.264 video at 320x240 resolution at up to 768 kbits/second, or MPEG-4 resolutions of up to 480x480, and 2.5Mbits/second but. The MPEG-4 video size limit is slightly misleading, as it in reality supports resolutions that have up to 480x480=230,400 pixels. That means with a normal 1.33 aspect ratio, it can actually do up to 554x415 pixels (good for output to a TV, the built-in screen is 320x240 and downsizes the video shown to fit the built-in screen). Note, using higher resolutions increases file sizes significantly and could severely decrease battery life because of the increased computation power needed. Other reasonable resolutions for a 1.33 aspect ratio are 512x384 or 480x360. I've decided to standardize my video content on 480x360 at 1.5Mbits/sec. as a reasonable compromise in terms of quality and space.  Photo viewing on the 2.5" screen is very nice. However, Apple left out the most important feature, being able to zoom in on the details of an image. Even my obsolete 3 year old digital camera could do that. Also, the iPod doesn't support viewing RAW photo file formats.   There is still no FM radio, there is no bluetooth wireless connectivity built in (you can buy extra 3rd party addons for bluetooth, but really, it should be built in), there is no 3rd party software support for applications to run on the iPod. I hope they'll correct these deficiencies soon. There are a few extras like an alarm clock which which is practically useless because the built-in speaker is so weak, and there are a couple of games that aren't very good.   Other extras include a contact manager, a calendar, and the ability to show text notes.   A recently added feature is support for Podcasts. Podcasts have their own menu and also are bookmarked if you switch to something else in the middle of listening to one. Also, a dot appears next to podcasts that have not yet been listened to (a nice touch). Happily, smart playlists work correctly (if you set the star ratings for a song for instance, it will dynamically get updated on the iPod without having to re-sync with the computer). This feature had been broken by Apple for my 2nd generation mini with Firmware version 1.3.   In Use With all this talk about design and features, we shouldn't forget, it's all about the audio. My opinion is, the iPod's audio quality is very good. Audio is clear and clean. It seems to be an improvement on the iPod Mini I own, as it doesn't seem to have audio glitches when switching tracks. I'm not an audiophile, so you may want to check for yourself if you're particularly picky. Overall, I'm happy with the audio quality.  Where the iPod really shines is on the software side. iTunes integration is fantastic. Keeping your music in sync between the computer and the iPod works really well. iTunes is great at managing your music, if you are willing to give it full control over organizing your music- I fought this for a while, but in the end gave in as it's just easier to let it manage and consolidate your collection. It has nice little features like finding duplicate songs so you can clean up your collection. The iTunes user interface and functionality is excellent.   Playlist management in iTunes is fantastic. It is easy to create playlists and rearrange music within playlists. In addition, playlist management is very good on the iPod itself as well. Smart playlists are playlists that dynamically get updated (for instance, you can have a playlist of all 5 star rated songs, or of the most recent songs you've downloaded). You can create on-the-go playlists on the iPod directly, which is one feature I really love.   This 30GB 5G iPod I own is advertised as having an 14 hour battery life, or 2 hours for video. The iPod battery is also not easily replaceable, so you can't just switch batteries when it runs out, instead, you have to recharge the iPod. Your battery results may vary. (Come back later for a full report on battery life!)   Video content is now available on iTunes. However, the quality and the restrictions are a joke. You pay $1.99 for video content (such as music videos, or TV shows) but you get poor quality 320x240 resolution videos that you can NOT burn to DVD. Low quality and severe restrictions, together with a lack of much content to begin with is a disappointment.   Trouble in paradise: There is a very dark side to using the iPod and iTunes, however. Apple has been very consumer unfriendly by refusing to let iTunes protected AAC format music to interoperate with other software and other MP3 players. You can not play music purchased on iTunes using any other MP3 player on the market. Although you can burn the music onto CD and then rip it again, that is a rather annoying and time-consuming barrier. Furthermore, if you purchase music from any other online store such as Real's or one that supports WMF, you can not play it in the iPod. In fact Apple has threatened to sue Real for making their music files playable on the iPod. This level of anti-consumer monopolistic behavior is beyond comprehension, for a company that has so much going for it. They basically lock you into their system and keep you there through incredibly anti-consumer practices. There is no excuse for Apple's monopolistic behavior and consumer unfriendliness here. They have a good product that stand on its own merits.  A Note on iTunes Encoding Sound Quality: When ripping songs from your CDs, you need to think about what sound quality you will be happy with. The audio encoder and quality settings are found in the iTunes Preferences (under the Edit menu --> Preferences), and select the "Importing" tab. The general consensus is, the high quality 128K bps AAC setting is adequate for most purposes, though definitely not CD quality. In general it's a lot of trouble importing your entire CD collection into iTunes, so, I recommend picking a higher bit rate AAC encoding to get higher quality (select the "Custom" option). I experimented with MP3 encoding and it seems to be produce poorer quality audio in iTunes. I ended up choosing the AAC Encoder at 192 Kbps, which is a reasonable compromise in terms of space usage and audio quality. At this quality level, all but the most serious audiophiles should be satisfied. See A Report on Apple's iTunes AAC Compared to CD. See also the iPod Audio Page for more details on audio quality.  CONCLUSION: The iPod 5G is an excellent music player, though still missing some important features. It has style and design that's unmatched, and works well with Apple's outstanding iTunes software. It is functional and works well for what it was designed for. Features are lacking, certainly lagging behind the competition, and you get locked in Apple's system, so that's a tradeoff you will have to weigh. I like my 5G iPod video edition, and plan to keep it at least until the next generation comes out

<Title>Well... it's an iPod.
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, I've had this new iPod Video for about a week now.  I've had one iPod before; the 4th generation 20gb.  I won't waste your time by writing the things you've read a thousand times.  I'll try to put a fresh spin on things.  First of all, the video capabilities.  Right now, I'm going to be honest, it's a pretty overrated feature (unless you're buying it simply for music videos).  There is very little you can purchase on iTunes currently.  All they have are 6 different TV shows and 7 Pixar shorts.  However, there is a plethora of music videos available.  Now this is not what I really want to utilize the video feature for, but there is a variety of them for those who do.  Granted, I'm sure Apple is going to be releasing more shows and even movies for purchase on iTunes, but as of now (Nov. 21), it's limited.  Of course there are alternatives, such as capturing your own video, but unfortunately this process can take hours to do.  Also you need Quicktime 7 Pro to convert it to the special iPod video format, which will cost you an extra 30 bucks.  But it'll probably be worth the money for some extra video on the iPod to watch.  So take my opinion with a grain of salt, but for those who want movies or TV shows alone, you might want to hold off on this for awhile.  Now, the style of this new iPod.  Of course, it is thinner than the previous model, which is nice.  It's about the same length and width, the clickwheel is smaller, and the screen is obviously bigger.  Now one thing that I did notice that was different about this iPod (and also the nano) is that the front faceplate is no longer rounded off but cut with sharp edges (see the side profile picture above).  This shouldn't bother anyone, but for me it was a change I'm not too sure I like.  I mean, an iPod is supposed to be round all over, just like every model before it... I don't know why the designers made this change and I hope that they go back to the old style eventually, but for now, it looks like it's here to stay.  Also, the headphone jack is offset to the right, if that makes any difference.  I'll also mention that I have the white model, which scratches less.  I've seen the black one at Best Buy and it is all scratched up and because it's black and everything shows.  Right now there are no official cases for sale at the [...] or Amazon.com for that matter, but they do have quite a few on eBay and I ordered the brand new leather one on DLO.  You can find that here:  [...]  All other features are still intact: music, videos, colored screen and the like.  The battery life however is roughly only 4 hours.  The backlight and keeping the backlight while video plays really sucks the life out of the thing.  But for me I usually keep the Pod close at hand or in the car where I can keep it charged.  So if you are always travelling and want to carry it with you to watch videos, you should probably get a full charge before you leave.  I think eventually this iPod will grow to the 5 stars it truly deserves, but as of now, there really is no improvement.  It meets all expectations for Apple's iPod, but it needs more video options to get a real step up from the previous model.  I hope this review has been helpful to you.  _Max

<Content>This is a great product (quality, design, functions..., are all great).  However the battery charger is $30 (the battery charger is a necessary, if you share computer with someone else you can not charge the ipod anytime you want.  How can you price a regular battery charger at $30?).  The software for converting video for playing on Ipod is $30 (Ipod video only support H.264 and MPEG-4 format. Ipod video does not have video software with it, how can you rip off customers this way).  A cover (to prevent scratch, Ipod is very easy to get scratch) is $30.  A Universal dock is $40 (for transfer video to TV, you also need a cable to do that, $20...).  I like Ipod, but I am not happy about the way they rip off customers.

That means that you will be able to put the video you recorded on your tivo onto your Ipod Video.  INCREDIBLE!  Yes this is an amazing little product, but the reviewer that said thier is no video is correct, unless you want to watch Lost again or Desperate Housewives or the Disney Chanel.  But, now you will be able to use Tivo recordings on your Ipod.  Finally video worth watching!  Hope this helps.  This story was reported on Ign.com a very reputable video gaming news scource.

<Title>Nice update to iPod line but video drains battery too quickly
<Date>Wed Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's nice to be able to play videos and I can even rip a DVD movie using third party shareware software and play it on the iPod. Although the screen is much larger than prior iPods, it's still a bit uncomfortable to watch a movie on it. Also the battery will only last about 1.5 hours (60GB model lasts slightly longer) when watching video so it would probably be better to just watch TV shows and music videos when using the battery. If you want to watch a full length movie, you should probably plug the iPod in to a power source either using the included USB 2.0 plugged into your computer or using an AC Adapter which costs extra. Apple absolutely should have included the AC Adapter/Charger with this iPod like they have with the previous 4th generation iPod.  The good news is that for music, this iPod lasts quite a long time! And it sounds great (better than prior iPods) and it's physically much thinner (with the same outside dimensions). Most of the accessories that I already had for my prior iPod work on this 5th generation video ipod (such as my Belkin Tune Doc and power adapter). If you use a case for a prior iPod, you will probably need a new one though.  While I recommend and like this iPod, if you plan on doing a lot of video, be prepared to have some other power source available. Music is still the main thing it's good for, with the video capability just being a secondary extra.

<Content>I purchased two 60 GB units recently. I love the size and features of the new iPod but have been disappointed when I search online and find there are virtually no accessories yet available for the new models. (The 60 GB comes with a flimsy cloth case (no belt clip).) I also visited a local Apple store where they only had one case for my units. I had an older 40 GB model and grew accustomed to cases, iTrips, chargers, etc. Anyone have any ideas?

<Content>i travelled with my friend who had one of these, and i was jealous the whole week!  it's beautifully made, thinner than previous IPODs and the video play back is actually pretty decent.  only downside is that battery life is not great, needs to recharge daily...  - Dazhi Chen - Dazhi Chen

<Title>I'm Amazed
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wow. Thats all I can say. This ipod is so incredible. When I first opened the box, my heart started to race. When I saw the slick, thin, 30gb ipod sitting in its pocket, I was amazed. The downloading was easy and fast, and I cant stop listening to the music. Not only is the sound quality amazing, but the bright, color screen makes it a must have. Going from a 10gb orange lit button ipod (dont know the generation) is a huge step. I love this ipod, and you will too. i have no regrets at all buying this ipod!!! :)

<Title>Better than I expected
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When buying this I expected the video capability to be okay. I found it to be excellent, with vibrant colors and very clear picture. You can easily convert your own videos to fit on it using one of many free converter programs available on the net.  There is only 1 problem I have with it - the battery power. Watching video sucks the life out of the battery in about an hour and a half of use. That aspect of it is annoying, but its not the end of the world unless you plan on watching a full feature film on it

<Title>this is an amazing ipod!
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my new white ipod video about a week ago and so far it has been wonderful.  i got it with a case, and a very nice case to be specific.  so far i have kept it scratch and fingerprint free.    the sound quality is amazing.  it is like listening to the songs straight from the recording studio.  ok, maybe not that good, but you know what i mean.    the ipod also allows you to put in album art too which is a really neat feature in my opinion.  although i haven't tried out the video feature of the ipod yet i have seen it and it is in fact very cool.  i wouldn't watch like full feature movies on it or even television shows but it is nice for music videos!    pictures can be put on it also which is pretty cool.  they take up pretty much no space so i have almost 500 already!  the battery is the only problem with the ipod.  while listening to music, the battery lasts a good 10 hours at least if you have the backlight off or to a minimum.  if you look at pictures the battery is sucked up pretty good.  and watching videos gives you about 3 hours of battery!  aghh!!  not cool! other than that the battery is pretty good if you just listen to the music...  the ipod comes with a "case" if thats what you wanna call it.  it is more like a well ... er...well i don't really know what you would call it but it sucks!  i use it to put headphones in because my case's headphone opening is in the middle instead of to the side but that is a different story.  also, if the case was a bit bigger, it might be a good temporary case until you get a real one but other than that it is crap.  also i have said before that my case doesn't support the video ipod.  it is actually a GREAT case but i am still gonna have a shoe maker put a hole in the top for me.  but i would suggest getting some sort of thing to hold your ipod because of the vulnerable surface of the ipod.  overall, the ipod is a WONDERFUL mp3 player.  in my opinion it is the only good one available, and if you are stuck on whether to get an ipod or a zen or iriver or whatever, i 100% recommend getting this because it is just as expensive as all of them more or less but is definitely the best!!!  you can't go wrong with these things.  hope this helps you decide if it is right for you.  enjoy!!!

<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this iPod a few weeks ago.  I took good care of it, and only put it in my pocket for listening.  Within three days it was extremely scratched.  Now it is in the same same as my old 20GB 4th generation iPod was after a year.  I like this iPod, but getting it without a case is out of the question.  Also, I recommend the white one as well, since it is harder to see scratches.

<Title>The COMPLETE need to know for your 5th Gen  iPod (and why it costs over $500)
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For those of you that are about to break down and get a MP3 player (like I did), let me share a couple things about the iPod 5th Generation with Video.  1) Best Value of all the players!!!    For the 300 bucks retail, you can't beat it.  The iPod Nano goes for around 50 bucks less, and it only has 4 Gb. The shuffle is cheap, but has no screen.  And the other brands like iRiver, HP and Creative have some nice features compared to the non-video iPods, but generally have less storage, and you still don't get the video of the 5th Gen.  2) Is 300 bucks really 300 bucks - No! (you'll want accessories)  Think of the iPod as being like a cell phone.  You get the phone, go to use it, and realize that all you got was the phone.  No car adapter, no hands-free for driving, and no case to protect the phone.  Well the iPod is no different.  If you're like me, you'll get into your iPod the moment you upload your first 100 songs into it.  Let's break it down...  2a) You need a computer.    This may sound silly, but a friend of mine won an iPod last month, and couldn't use it because he didn't have a computer at home.  Hopefully you have a computer at home, and if you're still using Windows 98 as your operating system, either you're getting a new computer, or the iPod will get dusty.  2b) Charging the iPod.    The iPod comes with a USB cable that allows you to charge the iPod while connected to your computer.  Now think...how are you gonna charge your iPod after using it on the plane, or at the beach?  No home computer = dead battery.  Cost of a 120VAC wall outlet charger can run around 30 bucks.   TIP - go to TJMaxx or Marshalls, and look around the accessories area for a knock-off brand home charger that could be as cheap as $13).  2c) Using the iPod in the car requires hardware too.    There are two choices:  I) Use a cassette tape adapter to connect into the headset port on your iPod, or II) Get an FM transmitter attachment.  This allows you to tune your radio to an obscure station, like 87.9FM, set the attachment to the same frequency, and your iPod will play through the radio.  The first option, the cassette one, is better, but how many cars after 2000 have cassette players in them.  RECOMMENDATION - the Monster brand FM transmitter with car charger cable, which goes for around 80 bucks.  Connect from the cigarette lighter socket into the data port on your iPod, and not only does it let you use the iPod in the car, but unlike the AirPlay2, the FM transmitter draws power from the car, instead of the iPod.  Think of your road trip from NYC to Ft. Lauderdale, using the AirPlay2, and the iPod goes dead in South Carolina and all you have left is two kinds of music - Country & Western (Thank you Jake & Elwood :)  2d) Protective Cases are a must!!!    The iPod has video, please protect your screen.  When you buy it, it only comes with a soft leather sock.  And the Apple stores and other retailers do not have the leather cases with screen protectors on hand yet.  ADVICE - DO NOT REMOVE THE PLASTIC FROM YOUR IPOD UNTIL YOU HAVE A SCREEN PROTECTOR!!!  Scratching the iPod's screen is not covered by the standard warrantee, and ruins any video you watch on it.  From what I found as I searched for a case, the only cases Apple plans to offer are cotton tube-sock types, again, you can't see through these things, what good are they???  I recommend going to a 3rd party website like [...].  Cost of a iPod jacket can run upwards of 35 dollars, depending on your preference.  Bottom line - if you want the flexibility to use the iPod in the car, charge it without your PC and protect it with a case, expect to spend an additional 100+ bucks.  3) Do you want the extended warrantee?  YES YOU DO!!!    Think about it, you're already dropping four bills on the iPod, the chargers, the FM transmitter and the protective case.  For the extra 50+ bucks, you get the AppleCare plan for iPods.  It's essentially unlimited coverage on your iPod for 2 years.  And if you're getting this for your son/daughter, keep in mind - you're paying for it, not them, and they probably won't respect it for the amount you paid for it.  Just do it for peace of mind.  I was at a retailer over the Thanksgiving weekend, and a sales associate told me that countless 5th Gens were coming in for screen repairs, and most of the customers were less than happy when they found out they had to pay for the replacement, even if they only bought the thing a week prior.  Get the warrantee.  4) iTunes and video uploads cost money too, even if you have the videos already.    I'm speaking of those "mpeg" commercial clips we all e-mail around for a 30 second laugh.  I tried to upload them, and failed miserably.  I found out that most mpeg files are "MUXED", or MULTIPLEXED.  You'll know if your files are MUXED if they can't add to the iTunes library from your PC, or if you are lucky enough to get them into the iPod, the video plays without sound, or vice-versa.  HOW TO FIX THIS - you need a couple of things.  1) You need QuickTime 7 Pro on your PC.  Most of the PCs have QuickTime 7, but not the Pro version.  Cost for the Pro version is $29.99.  2) This only enables conversion of video files to iVideo versions.  You still need to fix your MUXED problem.  This requires another software patch from Quicktime... Sorry, I forgot how much I paid when I wrote this.    Note - Quicktime is owned by Apple, what a surprise.  All in all, you could find yourself spending over five bills, like I did.  And if you ask me if it's worth it.  I would say "yes" every day of the week and twice on Saturdays!

<Title>A tip to prevent scratches...
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a big fan of the new Video Ipod;(I have the black one). A few complaints include the battery life as well as the surface which does scratch pretty easily (this is why I gave it 4 stars). Before getting the I pod I read about this scratch factor, so I was prepared, especially because they don't make cases for them yet. I bout some LCD screen protectors from an electronic store, and they work great. They stick right on the surface of the ipod, and stay there very securely. Then you can use a razor blade to trim around the periphery of the ipod, and you can barely tell its there. The click wheel feels a little different with the protector, but it still works fine. I highly suggest this until you can find an appropriate case for your ipod!

<Content>This is an awesome i pod probably the best yet. When you read the reviews about the black ipod they all say "get the white one it doesnt scrach as easily" well theyre bolth the SAME!! Black is just a different color so they bolth scrach just as easy as the other. another thing is that the scraches show up more easily well that might be true but for only 5 more dollare you can get the Apple iPod Video Anti-Glare Screen Protector [5th Gen iPod] (Single Pack) by JAVOedge for only about 6 dollars! Trust me on this one i hav a black i pod and its awesome. i have the JAVOedge screen protector on it and there not a scrach to be found. So sereously get a black ipod video they're a lot cooler than the white ones.

<Content>hello, i just recently bought one of this babies in black, and let me tell you it's awesome!!!! love it!!!!! i have read about how easily the black ipod can get scratched,  and for the moment all i do is after i use it i put it back inside the case it came with, and i don't take it anywhere, at least not for the moment until i find a protector, but the sound quality is great and love the fact that now i can see the cover art for each of my 2,2302 classic rock albums!!!! i don't really use it for the pictures or movies, but the fact is that it's really a great little gadget and if you're a music fan like myself i highly recomend this ipod, the nagatives???? i haven't found any of them yet, i know the battery can sometimes be a little problem, but that's not a "BIG" issue either, so i'm very pleased with this purchase, and like i said before, if you really want to get a cool ipod this is the one, it doesn't matter if it's black or white or yellow, get one and enjoy your music!!! p.s. if you don't want your ipod to get scratched, don't put it in your pocket along with nickels or keys!!!!!! ramoncito te extra�o y se te quiere gratis primo!!!!!!!

<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this iPod for a week, and I am going to tell you exactly what problems I have experienced, since the pros are already well known.  Cons  1 Screen cratches easily, even with religious use of cover provided in iPod package (Screen is now paramount to protect with video capabilities)  2 Fast Forward maxes out at just 4 seconds when held down for video! What the hell! What if I want to skip to the 60th minute of a 73 minute file. That means 15 minutes of holding down Fast Forward??!! Really now!  3 No FireWire? USB 2.0 is significantly slower in transferring data  (Though, I must say, black is a rather fetching colour. Too bad scratches are even more apparent than with white.)

<Title>A New Level of Music
<Date>Fri Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple continues to evolve the mp3 player and now on top of music, pictures, and playlists there are videos. The new ipod allows you to play movies either from itunes or convert from your own computer. The 30 gb does give you room to put as much as you need for songs, photos, and videos but for those that need the extra space to use as a external harddrive or storage or for those that just have that much music and videos.  The video quality on the new ipod is viewable and moves in sync with the audio.  As of now itunes has posted some videos and a great deal of music videos that you can buy for 2 dollars but it might be recommended to convert files on your own in order to save yourself some money. The audio player is just as good as the last generation and the photo resolution as also increased.  The con about this product is that the battery life is not very long if you plan to watch movies. Its a primary mp3 player with the capacity to play movies.  http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=22601006 In my time i have owned a 10gb, a mini, a nano, a 40gb and now the new 30gb video and it is well worth it if you are an mp3 user.

<Title>iPod Video 30GB review
<Date>Sat Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am very pleased with my new iPod, does everything it was designed to do (plays music) with a little bonus (plays videos and pictures).   Apple has gotten it right again, with the perfect compromize of function and size. I really am amazed at how thin the 30GB iPod. I got the 30GB iPod as an upgrade to my old 20GB, and the 30GB is considerably thinner.   This iPod generation (the 5th one) is the first one that has been competitively priced. Prior to this generation of iPod, there was always a cheaper option from Dell or Creative that offered the same features without the simplicity and beauty of iPod. Now it's really a no brainer that iPod is the better choice, since Apple has packed a lot of bang for your buck.  The video looks stunning and crisp. Even at at mere 2.5 inches, it is still enjoyable to watch last night's episode of Lost or Desperate Housewives. I have even ripped DVD's to the iPod using "Handbrake" (a program for Mac only).  As with previous generations of iPod, music is the primary functionality. It is still the best music player out there, hands down.   The only negative thing I can think of is that the screen and back scratch easily. I suggest buying an invisibleShield, for 100% durable, permanent protection. (check out theinvisibleshield.com)

<Content>I just rcvd my new ipod about 1 week ago. Even without using the 30gb ipod for photos or video, I'm only getting about 2 - 3 hours of music time with it! It's my 1st ipod and I'm really disappointed. I chkd out the apple.com site and even DISABLED the equalizer and reduced the backlighting period to 5 seconds. I'm going to do a couple more test runs this week by charging it via my laptop for 4+ hours at a time, if I can't get more than 2 - 3 hours of music time, it's going to be returned to amazon.com ASAP. I LOVE the features of the ipod, but with this battery record, I might as well go back to my portable cd player!  =(

<Title>Scratching is NOT an issue. Please read.
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>In other reviews, people mention how the iPod Video has a great tendensy to scratch. I have owned my 30gig white iPod Video for about 3 weeks now, and the iPod has minimal scratches. (Just a couple hairline scratches, but that's normal on ANYthing you own, even cars.)  The simple fact is, if you aren't a dunce about it, and know how to take care of your things, this iPod will NOT scratch. If you are careless with it, and drop it on rocks, then yes, it is sure to scratch.  As for the little case that now comes with it and the iPod Nano, the case is the PERFECT accessory for the iPod, and just so happens to come packaged with the iPod Video (black or white, 30gig or 60gig, doesn't matter), for free.  As about the battery life, it is fairly stable. On a sensable level, there is no need to listen to your iPod a STRAIGHT 14 HOURS without a stop to charge. The iPod charges very quickly (around an hour), and is perfect for people who are always "on-the-go". Video playback, however, is quite a damper on the battery. Then again, if you are going on a 5-hour drive, and you are the driver, there is no need to watch movies while you drive, now is there? 2 hours of video watching doesn't seem to fit my fancy on such a small screen.  There is a small problem, however. Every now and then (especially after you watch videos of a large length), the iPod tends to "lag" when navigating through menus. For example, if you are trying to go from the "Videos" to the "Songs" and then "Artists" sections, whenever you press the Menu button, it may take up to two seconds for the section you are trying to get to for the iPod to get to it (mostly when backing up from a menu).  Over all, this is a pretty solid piece of equipment, and is a must-have for someone looking for a sturdy music player.  If you currently own an iPod of any model, this may NOT be the best MP3 player for you (especially if you are buying it mainly for the video function). However, if you are a first-time-buyer of an MP3 player, and are looking for something GREAT that will play your music in a flawless quality, and even has a video ability at that (even though it isn't the best on earth), the iPod Video is perfect for you.

<Title>Don't get it for your own video
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you intend on using this for your own video or for movies wait until the next gemeration iPod.  Using Quicktime 7 pro to transfer a movie (One & half hours long) to my iPod took two days..yes TWO DAYS.  It took me about 12 hours to transfer a thirty min show to my iPod.  Sadly enough, my iPod rejected the file, saying it was the wrong format.  The file's property tag states differently.  If using it for music, I swear it sounds better than the last generation.  However, it seems to be made a little cheaper.  The first iPod I received did not work.  Apple replaced it, however it took a month.  The second iPod works, but it is less stable than my 3rd generation iPod and the dock interface is loss in the iPod.  Also, I hate the click wheel...I don't know why they changed it.

<Title>Like MAGIC, it even makes HOUSEWORK fun!!!
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didn't even know I needed one and now I really love it!  Even my 4 year old can work her way around it and navigate exactly where she wants to go.  I recieved it for my birthday, and this little thing makes everything more fun.  The video quality is very impressive, considering it's size especially.  I have to leave home for a couple days a week for work, so I asked my technically inclined husband to load my pilates video on to my 30GB unit.  All be it no Matrix reloaded as far as grahics go, but I am extrememly pleased with the picture quality. (Now if I could just motivate and do the videos). It is a great size for someone wanting to watch something on the commute, plane, train or sitting on the bike at the gym.  Really amazing, and really easy to use.  I agree with other reviewer, the "included case" is nothing to write home about as it is difficult to get your Ipod in and out of.  It does serve it's purpose of protecting the screen though.  I bought a dlo rubberized case, it fits but does obscure the outer edges of the expanded screen.  It will do until the come ut with accessories for this unit. The head phones are a bit uncomfortable ( for smaller ears) as well, but the sound quality is great.   Great gift for anyone, techy or not, who loves music, movies and portability.

<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love everything about my new video Ipod except the battery life.  The box claims it can play songs for up to 14 hours but I've found reality to be more like 8.  I don't really watch videos on it but I can only assume that would deplete the battery very quickly.

<Title>To buy or not to buy
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am writting this review because I saw couple of people complain about Apple launching too many products too soon. If waiting for the next best thing to come out is the reason for you not to buy this product buy it please. It is sad but tech companies even confess that they no longer make products to last, I dont mean durability, the popularity. I mean I was so excited when the first digital cameras were launched. Then the best thing was 1.3 megapixels. Then the ipod came out it was great I didnt know how many generations of the mini they had until I read it here. Then they had the photo one which was the coolest for like 600 bucks. Anyways what I am trying to say is that when the best of the best ipod nano or video comes out (if it ever does) apple will launch another version for sure. Its just the way this game of consumer seller relationship goes. Apple is the coolest thing now but who knows in ten years whats going to happen to that. It is alot of money to spend but if you are thinking this as this great investment and saving money by not eating or feeding your infants to buy this, dont buy it,This stuff is meant to be replaced after a couple of years. So if you like the idea of owning an Ipod buy it, if you like the design buy it, if you like the features buy it, I have to say that I didnt experience major problems with ipods but if the customer relation department is bad, people should put solid reasons and evidence of how it was. Just saying my screen was burnt and I called them is not enough, where did you buy it from how long has it been, why was it burnt, what else did you do to fix the problem, things like that. Although I can see it happening, I wouldnt go by these comments. It is your choice, think what u going to use it for, if you can honestly imagine putting all of your cds in to this and playing it buy a higher memory one. If you just want to put 100 songs or so buy smaller one. Think you might play video on it buy the video one ( would go with the higher memory with ipod video, it wouldnt hurt. It should be a simple decision to buy something like this. Go ahead treat yourself if you can spend the money. If not SanDisk ones work great as an mp3 player for workout. Its not like anyoneat the gym is actually looking at your mp3 player. Cheers.

<Title>Battery, lag issues with 5G video iPod
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I own a 3G iPod and was getting old of the 3 hour battery life, so I decided to get the new video iPod.  I purchased it (30gb black one) and enjoy the wider screen as well as the color display.  I especially enjoy the album artwork being showed on the display. However I do have some issues with it in.  First of all, as I have been reading these posts I can see that I am not the only one that has complaints about the battery life.  I listen to music on the train to work (45min to 1 hour), listen to music at work (2 hours to 3 hours), and then listen to music on the train ride back home (1 hour) and usually on that train ride home the battery icon is showing red.  I am just listening to music with the iPod hold button as well as my backlight on for 2 seconds so that the battery is not drained more.  The 14 hour battery life they are claiming?  I have yet to see it.    Second, the lag that one post commented on.  It happens most of the time even scrolling between albums, artists.  Sometimes the "center button" works when you click it, sometimes it basically double clicks and your selection starts playing music and you do not want it to.  This is really aggravating.  I hope Apple releases a new iPod update with something that fixes this bug. Compared to the battery issue, this issue is a lot more aggravating to me.  In response to all of the scratching posts.  I have owned the iPod for at least 3 weeks now and still see no signs of scratching and it is used daily.  The case that comes with it is very soft and does a great job to protect it.  I definitely enjoy the new video iPod.  It is a great deal with all of the technology involved.  I paid $399 for my 3G 20gb when it first came out.  I hope Apple is able to fix the two main issues I have with these units, when they do I believe those iPods will be the best ones Apple has ever issued.

<Content>One word, incredible! this new ipod 30gb is the best mp3 around these days. its soo nice, sexy, thin, plays video and music and is incredible. and for all thos people who whine about scratching get one of these   [...]  and for all those people who cannot properly get music to the right format go here. jeese im 13 and i can even do this easily.  http://www.bittorrent.com/  and lastly for people who cannot find good shows or dont wanna spend 2 bucks a show at itunes go here and get stuff free  http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/  thats that and overall the ipod is a great buy.  some of the bad things to this ipod can be the battery life which is quite slim when watching video. i bought the charger that you can charge your ipod anywhere. this works perfectly. another thing could be the scrachness. this baby can easily get scratched so i suggest not even playing woth your ipod before getting an invisable shield or other skin.   so imo, i think that his was a great buy and everyone else should think the same. dont let whiners discourage you, this is a great buy

<Title>These things are awesome!
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Thank you, Apple!  I ran out and picked one of these up as soon as people started carrying it, and I was not disappointed.  The first thing you might notice upon seeing the box is that it's about a quarter of the size of the old boxes.  Yeah, Apple was pretty stingy on the accessories this time, but you get what you need (Ipod, computer cable, manual, earbuds, "case"), so what's the big deal?  I don't really know what I was expecting out of this thing, but as soon as a loaded a video on it, I was thrilled by the awesome video quality.  One con about this piece of equipment is that it DOES scratch very easily, but a nice case can solve that problem.  Definatley worth the money (A good value too)!

<Title>Is this ipod really worth it?
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this ipod for three weeks and I love it. The itunes program was easy to set up and use. It was easy to transfer songs to the ipod (when you hook up the USB cable the program opens up and transfers all of the songs on the playlists that you've selected). The video quality is amazing. I was blown away at how clear the picture is. Overall, I am very impressed. The downsides are that the battery life is very short when you're watching a video (maybe two hours instead of the claimed 14). It also scrathces very easily. They send you a little pouch with it but I would recommend getting a case for it. Probably the best part about it is that I got it for free. It took me about a month to get but it actually worked. I was blown away. [...]

<Title>Very good, doesn't scratch
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The new ipod is definitely worth the money. $299 really isn't a lot for all the new features.  Video is very easy to get on.  If you want to get DVD's onto your ipod, you need a dvd to ipod converter such as cucusoft.  I find that the free videora converter messes up my videos.  Also, don't Quicktime Pro unless you have home videos from digital camera, etc.   The ipod doesn't scratch if you take good care of it.  It is defintely a product to buy if you really like music, videos, and photos. (don't buy it just for the games, it's not worth it). Also the battery life is 14 hours, i timed it, but only if you just play music and turn off the backlight completely. When playing DVD's, i usually get aboubt 2-3 hours, then have to charge again.   Overall, the only flaws would be short battery life for videos and no charger.  PS. GET A CASE. It will definitely prevent most scratches. I suggest one from Agent18 as theirs look awesome and are usually out right after the ipods come out.

<Title>I LOVE THIS iPOD
<Date>Wed Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No doubt, the best mp3 player. Sleek design, easy interface, very user friendly iTunes. For the price, the iPod is absolutely the best buy. It use to be a matter of price, but now for what you get 300 is pretty cheap. An additional 10GB, even smaller size, photo features, and the new video features. Think about it, the photo was a whole separate model and now they combined it into the standard iPod without raising the price.   I use to own a Zen Touch, and I was against Apple. But ever since the video iPod came out I have just been in love with this player. It's everything I wanted and for the same price I got my Zen Touch a few years ago.   When compared to the Zen Touch there is really only one problem and that's the iPod takes scratches and smudges so easily. Of course that can easily be solved with a purchase of a case, and I recommend the agent 18 ones. Those are really nice and they protect the whole iPod with an opening for the click wheel, hold lock, and plugs.  Really the Zen Touch is a good mp3 player, but the iPod just does it better. The click wheel is far user-friendly than the Zen Touch scroll. The interface is far nicer. iPod has color and album artwork. That really isn't that big of a deal, but it's nice to have. Zen Touch is way bulkier than the iPod and its much heavier although this is because the Zen has a longer battery life(5 more hours). Still 15 hours for the iPod is really good and if you get the 60GB it's the same battery life to the Zen Touch.

<Content>Overall the Ipod Video is an amazing piece of equipment to have. It's screen is alot better in resolution and size that i ever thought and runs videos smoothly.   I would though, like to mention that instead of buying quicktime PRO to convert your videos into MPEG-4 you can use free alternatives like videora ipod converter. This is just as good as quicktime PRO and is absolutely free so i urge you to get this software instead of paying 0 or however much money it is.  Also if you are contemplating buying one of them i would urge you to buy a case before or right after purchasing the product. I was foolish and didnt bother buying one for a while and even though i was really careful with it, it still managed to accumulate quite a lot of scratches and blemishes.  Overall this is a great buy and one that you won't regret!

I get at most 3.5-4 hours of music and at most and hour and 15 minutes in video per charge even with my backlight setting to 2 seconds, volume about half way, and the equalizer off. (Is this happening to anyone else or is there something wrong with my iPod???? lagging is very annoying. sometimes when you wanna switch songs or get in and out of menus, it lags a few seconds.  All i wonder about is how Apple comes up with with their numbers. 14 hours of battery life?? I have yet to see it. The iPod is a great music player, but it has its flaws. mainly the battery life. I am still debating whether to take mine back to the apple store. an iPod is just trendy, thats why i got mine, but there are far better mp3 players out there.    (...)

<Title>why I pod sucks
<Date>Tue Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Last year, against my better judgment, I let my teenage daughter buy a mini-I-pod (since this is a service related complaint, it applies to all apple mp-3 players).  I had advised her not to do it.  I knew that the hard-drive was fragile, and the words "fragile" and "teenager" are not normally a good mix.  I also didn't like the battery. But my daughter wanted to use I-tunes.  Plus she thought the other models were nerdy.  In order to protect us against normal teenage behavior, I paid for the extended warranty, which is 60 dollars, or about a third of the price of the I-pod. Our mistake. Technically, it is OK other than the battery issue (the battery cannot be replaced).  But the service is insultingly bad, the worst service I've ever experienced from a retail company. We first learned of the service problems when my daughter had a sound problem that turned out to be multiple headphone failure, not Apple's fault.  I tried calling the local store, but they are not accessible by phone.  The phone links to a central tech support line, which on high use hours may require 30 minutes or more on hold.   So we took it into the store, which has a tech support section (the "genius bar" or "Conceirge service").  But you cannot get walk-in service.  To get to talk to a tech support employee you have to make an appointment on line.  You cannot make an appointment in advance unless you pay 100 dollars for "Procare" service (I don't know any other retail operation that requires you to pay 100 dollars to make an appointment for service).  Otherwise, appointments are available only on a same day basis, first come, first serve, assuming their server works (more on that later).  In order to make an appointment after normal working hours (so you don't have to take a day off to service an I-pod), you have to wait until all the earlier appointments are full, but not wait too long or the "genius bar" will be full.  I thought of just making 20 appointments and filling up the day-that might work, although it inconveniences everyone else.  Our big problem came when my daughter's battery died after about 10 months of use.  This is not a problem that can be resolved by the "genius bar".  You have to call the central number for technical support, which will send you a shipping package with a DHL label (our mailing label was missing the proper return address), which you then have to deliver to the DHL mailer. We did this, and after over a week with no response, I called the central tech support unit.  It took me 20 minutes to get a service rep.  He checked the computer, then put me on hold for another five minutes.  When he came back, he told me that they found a small dent in the unit, and that voided the warranty, but for 210 dollars they could send me a new machine.  I asked to speak to his supervisor, which just got me another 15 minutes on hold and a lecture on how this small dent eliminated their obligation to repair the machine.  I told them that we had not noticed any damage when we returned it, and it could have been damaged after shipment.  I reminded them that I had purchased an extended warranty, and that if they were voiding this during the original period of the warranty, I would demand a full refund of the warranty price.  Nothing dissuaded them from their position. We had them ship the machine back (DHL packages require a signed receipt, and had we not been home when it arrived we would have had to make a trip to DHL to pick it up).  I tried to make a service appointment, but their server was down for a week (and this is a computer company?).  My wife and I finally walked in and demanded to see the manager.  The manager and sales rep were actually sympathetic and friendly, but the tech supervisor looked at the I-Pod (with a very small dent in the upper right hand corner), and lectured us on how that voided the warranty and they could never allow for a return.  My wife and I (both of us were now furious, both at the time we had to waste on this and the 300 plus dollars we had invested in this machine, accessories and I-tunes) then had full scale tantrums, yelling and screaming until their techie, lecturing us on how to use their equipment properly and warning us that this is a once in a life-time exemption that would apply to any future purchases (I told him that was no problem--I would promise to never buy an apple product again) gave us a new mini-ipod--otherwise we would have driven every customer out of the store.    What I don't understand is from a purely business point of view, this makes no sense.  If they voided our warranty, they would have to refund our extended warranty contract (we are still in the period of the original warranty), which is 60 bucks.  That is probably more than the cost to them of the item, which is now discontinued anyway.  Instead, they have permanently alienated a family who already owns two I pods (we had to buy one for our younger daughter so she could use her sister's I-tunes) worth over 600 bucks w/accessories, and a household with 2 computers and 3 mp-3 players.   I remember when Apple advertised themselves as the David fighting the IBM Goliath.  Now that they have a near monopoly on a product, they are the big, unfeeling company.  Their business model seems to be modeled after an elite club for those worthy of their great product.  But no other retail business gives this kind of shoddy service (other than other quasi-monopolies like cable companies).  There are other Mp-3 players available that you can buy from normal retail outlets, and if they die these companies will accept them back even if they have a small dent in the right hand corner. So why buy apple?

<Title>Black 30 Gig ipod video 
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm extremely satisfied and excited with the new ipod video.  This has been very hyped and it's extremely difficult to get one before Christmas so if you do congratulations.  The new ipod comes in 30G or 60G varieties and black and white.  For me black was the only one available and it really didn't matter to me much.  Here are a few things I noticed  APPEARANCE It's beautiful simple as that.  The major difference between ipods and other competetitors such as Zen and Iriver is the simple and elegant apppearance of the ipod and the easy to use interface.  The new ipod based on pictures looks wider and the larger LCD screen makes it seem somewhat awkward looking.  However, I was pleasantly suprised when I got one in my hands.  The new ipod is much thinner and no wider or longer than the previous models, despite seeming so in pictures.  The ipod photos could be stood upright from the ground, but the new ones are so thing they cannot stand on its side.  The screen is small but it really supports videos just fine.  You don't need to put it extremely close to your face to view it well.  Although I'm not a tech wizard about videos, the resolution and clarity of the videos seems great to me especially with such a small screen.  MAJOR DIFFERENCES There is more space for the same money than previous models, which is a definite plus.  The addition of black as an optional color is probably a plus for many cutomers.  The size is smaller and supposedly the sound is crisper with less noise from the hard drive, I personally can't tell the difference.  Also there is the stopwatch and screen combination lock features that were available in the nano and the battery life is nicely extended (20 hours of music playback on the 60 gig ipod).  The big difference is video, which is somewhat complicated to use.  You must mantain a MPEG-4 format with a specific resolution limit to be converted onto your ipod.   This requires either QuickTimePro, which costs money or downloading Videora Ipod Converter on the Internet, which I did and it works brilliantly on my computer.  Within minutes I had a movie and some music videos downloaded onto my ipod.  I definetly reccomend checking that out.  SCRATCHES I know this is a big concern for everyone with the ipod.  My previous ipod was my first and I purchased a silicon case with cutouts for the screen and scroll wheel for only 5 dollars.  Within a week it was scratched up miserably and the screen had many large scars.  So this was a huge concern for me.  The case supplied with the ipod is not really a case, but a small velvet sleeve for the ipod.  Obviously you can't see the movie if your screen is covered up and you need to remove the case in order to plug it into an adapter or computer, so the sleeve will be removed.  I reccomend buying a good durable case with a screen protector.  Although I haven't gotten any scratches on mine, it's because I have been extremely careful with my ipod and have only had it for about a week.  However, despite this I still think the new ipods are slightly less prone to scratches than the infamous nanos.    APPLIANCES It no longer comes with an AC adapter so if you don't have one from previous ipod purchases, it sucks because you have to spend 30 dollars to get one unless you just keep it charged to your computer, which I don't do.  Also there is no dock but there wasn't one for the ipod photos and I don't really find it that useful.  As usual there is the headphones and the Itunes software in the box.  WORTH UPGRADING? If your ipod is aging and you really want a new one, I'd say go for it.  But if the video function isn't useful to you, and your old Ipod is working fine for you, then I don't suggest upgrading.  And knowing ipod, in a year or two there will be a new model that you'll envy for anyways.  But if your not upgrading from a previous model and want an MP3 player, I DEFINETLY reccommend the ipod video.  It's reliable for me and works like a charm.

<Title>Video and Music come out Crisp
<Date>Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This has to be the coolest gift I have ever recevied.  Sound quality is incredible and the video looks great on the new screen size.  A friend had bought the iPod photo 2-3 weeks before this one (iPod video) came out and she is visibly jealous.  The new version is slimmer with a bigger screen.  Downloaded videos and tv shows look great.  You'll miss your bus stop...unless you are in NYC right now (MTA is on STRIKE),  The podcasts available are AMAZING!  You can get audio only or video and just about anything...news, comedy sketches, how-to-guides.  There is are a few drawbacks...you will need to purchase Quick Time Pro (29.95) if you wish to import your own videos.  Once you do, though, ANYTHING is possible.  Another option is handbrake (http://handbrake.m0k.org/) which allows you to rip most of your dvds into Mac format.  While this is a gray area (duplicating media electronically is illegal), I feel that copying a dvd that you own for your personal use on your ipod is considered fair use.  The other negative is that battery life typically only last 1.5 hours for video playback...just under a typcal movie length.  You can rememdy this with a battery pack that runs off a 9-volt and adds another 1.5 hours.  Auto integration was a bit pricey.  I didn't like the quality of sound provided by the FM radio transmitters on the market (and I tried a bunch of models and brands).  In the end, I had to get a new car stereo (Kenwood has some nice ones) that was iPod ready (you'll probably spend around $400 to do this right).  The results are FANTASTIC!  I can control the iPod from the dash unit or remote control.  It charges while it plays.    Cross-country road-trip?  No biggie!  Fire up a Harry Potter audio book and roll withough ever having to change a disk.  TV busted in the motel?  No biggie!  Catch up on your favorite tv series one day after they broadcast.  The best gift this holiday season

<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First, the only good part: the display is incredible.  However, that's the only good thing I have to say about the video iPod.  The movies are pretty much limited to movies that have been specially encoded for the iPod so it is not a good general media player.  However, I was mainly going to use it as an MP3 player anyway.  This is where I was shocked.  I was expecting the best MP3 player I've ever use and discovered the iPod is actually the worst.  I've had several MP3 players.  The iPod is by far and away the hardest to use.  The UI makes no logical sense and my touch is too heavy causing me to always end up somewhere unexpectedly.  The volume selection is extremely hard to use.  I also found iTunes very, very difficult to use especially after using the free MediaMonkey software.  I told my wife she could have the iPod because I couldn't stand it and I would use the 2.5GB Rio Carbon I already had instead.  My recommendation is to save your money and buy the cheaper and better Rio.  The Rio is easier to use and you just copy your files onto it without needing special software.

<Title>Beware: it can lose files, but I found a way to recover them
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am on an expensive overseas trip taking many photos. I had downloaded pictures to the 30GB video ipod successfully several times. After a 500MB download from my camera with many gigs of space left on the ipod, the photo menu disappeared except for the slideshow settings submenu, and I can no longer see if the photo files are still there. These photos are critical to my work as an artist, and I sure hope apple has some file recovery software or much of my trip is lost. Meanwhile, I have to recommend: DO NOT PUT CRITICAL INFORMATION ON THE IPOD! Later: I got to a fast internet connection and found info on the Apple site that allowed me to recover the lost items by resetting the software. Phew!  I still can't figure out why the stuff disappeared in the first place. So, it's up to you....

<Title>Not a bad gadget, but....
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this gadget for a week.  Battery life is horrible [non-video use, just audio: 2.5 -3 hours max] AND, it takes longer than that to fully charge!!!!!!. The proprietary accessories and the price of them are highway robbery!  An ac/dc charger plug-in unit should be part of the original purchase!   However, the audio and video quality are extraordinary!  The data storage size is great.  I haven't had a lose of data [yet] as mentioned in other reviews. So I guess we take the good with the bad... We are at the mercy of the techo geek manufacturers.

<Content>I got this video iPod 30G a few weeks ago.  Went ahead and put on invisibleShield on it right after openning the Apple box and I am glad to say that my beautiful iPod is well protected.  Who wants to hide this awesome piece of art in a protective case.  Back to the iPod.  I give it a 5 stars because of the the audio quality, style and design.  I am just so impressed with Apple.  Everything about this iPod is well thought out.  The video is extremely clear (even under invisibleShield).  There will never be anything on the market that come close to the iPod.  I was the same guy who thought that what is the big deal with iPod and made all the excuses not to buy it.  I am here to tell you that I am fully converted and if you are reading this, go and get one. Believe me the audio quality will knock your socks off.  I can't say enough on this.  I will name my first child iPod 30G Nguyen and I am not kidding.  This is the BMW of MP3 player.

<Title>5th generation iPods -- well worth the wait and cost.
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been eyeing the Apple iPods since their release in 2002 but held off buying one; they were good, but I figured they'd get better. While waiting for Apple to live up the potential that I knew they had, I bought two MP3 players: a Rio Cali 128MB and a SanDisk 1GB. While both proved themselves very reliable, I simply needed more space for my 17GB music collection. Right around the time I decided to upgrade my MP3 player again, Apple released the 5th generation iPod with video capabilities. I was enthralled and quickly decided to buy one.   The first thing I noticed about the iPod was its size. It's quite a thin device, but still feels very sturdy and expensive. I chose to buy a white iPod as I'm a fan of that "classic" look and the iPod ships with white accessories (case, USB cable, headphones) and Apple is not currently selling black docks. After holding the iPod for a few moments, the metal back was completely covered in fingerprints. While it is slightly annoying, the problem can be solved completely by purchasing a nice case. I've ordered an Agent18 VideoShield case, which should arrive any day now, and I would recommend you do the same. If you're not a fan of hard cases, the new iSkin eVo3 is worth taking a look at.  After ogling over the iPod for a bit, I plugged it into my computer and transferred over some 3,700+ songs and 200+ pictures -- all of which took only an hour. That's a pretty good transfer time considering that my computer isn't top-of-the-line (a 2.4Ghz Pentium 4 running Windows XP). A tip: when transferring music, close all applications that you do not need running, it makes the process go much faster. There are two options to choose from in regards to transferring music to the iPod: automatic or manual transfer. With automatic transfer, iTunes & iPod sync automatically when the iPod is plugged into the computer via USB. When using manual transfer, you drag the files you want over to the iPod. The iPod can also be used as an external disk drive to transfer other types of data, a very useful feature indeed.   Video playback on the new iPod is a lot crisper than I had expected it to be. When watching video podcasts, I experienced no lagging, no frame skips, and the audio and picture were always in sync. The only complaint I have regarding video playback is that DivX playback is not supported. This essentially forces you to go through a multi-step conversion process using several free programs to rip a DVD to iPod compatible format or to spend $30 on Quicktime.   The Breakdown:   Pros:  - Very thin  - Much better value than 4thGen 20GB: Same price buys you a bigger & now color screen, video playback, 10GB more space  - Very easy file transfer  - Excellent audio quality  - Photos & album art look amazing on the new screen   Cons:  - Lack of wall adapter  - Quicktime needed to convert DVDs to iPod format  - Black iPods ship with white accessories   Overall rating: Buy this product you will not be sorry. The only factor that prevents me from giving it all five stars is Apple's cheapness. I really feel that Apple skimps on the extras to encourage people to spend more on its products and using your customers is never good.

<Title>Better than other mp3 players I've used.
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Approximately 365 days ago, I had found an Aireo 1.5 GB mp3 player waiting for me under my tree. For a while, the two of us were inseperable. Of course, it did have some flaws in design. For a 1.5 GB player, it was pretty thick, almost triple the thickness of the 20 GB iPod. I didn't really care about the design at the time. I was happy with it, although it didn't hold much. Then all of the sudden, about 2 months ago, it started to 'malfunction', as the customer support group had put it, and they said that I had to pay 35 dollars to get the thing replaced! I thought about it, declined and hoped I got an iPod for Christmas, particularly a Video iPod.  Thank god I did.  The new '30 GB iPod video' actually holds 28.8 Gigabytes, but who cares? The picture is probably better than my PC! I downloaded some of the episodes of a show called 'X-Play', and they looked better than on my LCD! The only downside was that there was no wall adapter in the box...so sad. Oh well, I already have a compatible adapter, so I'm not upset! The sound quality is perfect, right now I'm listening to Blur's Leisure and I've never heard it better! Plus, the design is downright flawless. I've heard that the iPod Video is 45 percent slimmer than the iPod 20 GB. I've used a 20 GB model, and I never had problems with the thickness...but this is so thin, it's like a supermodel...only I can't marry an iPod.  Overall, this would be a great buy for any music lover, not just the hardcore indie rockers like many I know. The price may be a bit steep, but if you care about your music collection then an iPod is just what you need!  END COMMERCIAL

<Title>Great Hype, Poor Functionality, Junk.

<Content>First, $300 Bucks, no case, no manuals.  Ear buds, USB cable and IPod.  You now have to buy tons of accessories and software just to use this Piece Of S***.  What a marketing scam.  Buying this 30GB IPod has been a nightmare.  It proceeded to lock up every computer in my house and was in a constant locked up state until I figured out Apple's 2 finger salute to reset it.  It has consumed days of my life.   If you have a library of Mp3s that are older and do not have ID3v2 encoding (ie Artist, Album, Track information embedded in each mp3 file) the IPod will scramble ALL your albums and audio books.  This is a very non-intuitive device that is still very buggy.  I would wait until it is ready for release, maybe 2007. I am returning this piece of Junk Tuesday.  Good Riddance.

<Title>How did I listen to music without it?
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I LOVE my iPod! Since I got it and put iTunes on my computer I haven't been able to listen to a full album. I love being able to shuffle through 4.2 days worth of music. One minute I'm listening to Linkin Park, and the next I'm listening to Tchaikovsky. It's a beautiful thing! It did scratch very easily, but as long as I can still hear the music I'm happy. I imagine if you'll be using it to watch video, that would be a problem, but I don't intend to use up the GBs for that. I read a lot of complaints saying their batteries don't last long, but I've had no problems. I just went on an eight hour road trip and still had battery life left. If you can afford one, what's the problem? I actually baught mine directly from apple.com and got a one year warranty, so if you get a malfunctioning one, just send it back. What's the worst thing that could happen?

<Title>I love mine! The screen is beautiful!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I absolutely adore my iPod with video. I have had a Nano and the B&W 20GB one as well. This video iPod is my clear favourite. I have had my iPod for over a month now (kind of a Thanksgiving present to myself).  The music runs great, as it did on the other ones. I have been fortunate never to have had a problem with my iPods yet (knock wood), and this new iPod is no exception.  I had reservations about the screen's being small at first, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I watch the iPod on the train in the mornings on the way to work, and I think the detail on that small screen is exceptional! True: you can't read, say, subtitles or small credits, but it's great just for good ol' TV- or video podcast-watching.  One drawback: the number of video shows available is limited. However, even in the short amount of time that I have had my iPod (around one month), I have seen the number of shows available double. I imagine that this number will continue to increase.  I think the size of the iPod is quite manageable as well. Although not nearly as small as the Nano, it's still a tiny size. I think it's still small enough when working out or running.  I love my iPod. If you have the money and the inclination, I would recommend getting one for yourself.

<Content>I got lucky a couple of days ago and actually found an iPod in the store. They have been sold out totally here. So far I love my iPod. The sound quality is awesome! It is easy to use. The hardest thing so far has been how to turn it on and off. This is my first iPod.   I think that the case it came with is a piece of junk but for the time being it'll do. Of course the case I want is sold out everywhere too. I don't like the USB being my source of charging but I suppose that's a small price to pay for this great music player.   I will use it for video also as soon as I find a program to convert the files.   I love the size of the iPod, it's sleek yet large enough that you don't need a microscope to see the screen.   I also think price wise it was a deal. Unless you are dead set on a nano consider going up to the 30GB because the price difference is minimal.   I look forward to learning more as I go along but for now I am totally happy with it : )

<Title>great iPod
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a 30 GB Black iPod yesterday for Christmas. I already have figured out all of the controls. First, I will tell you the good side of it. I watched the TV show Lost on it and it has great graphics. Peoples' faces' look great, but the trees and scenery in the background aren't the best. On the headphones it came with music and movies both sound great. Other reviews say the screen breaks easily, but I have been pretty careful with it. I don't even have a case yet, though I am getting one this week, and I haven't had any trouble with the screen. I am glad I got this iPod. Now the bad parts. I don't know if other people do but my mom and I had lots of trouble getting the iTunes software to work. It took us two hours to figure it out. Also, sometimes when I try to download music it says, "The network connection is offline" or something like that. When that happens you just have to re-sign in and then go back and try it again. If this doesn't work, I would just exit the software then get back on and sign in again. Overall, I think this is a great iPod and maybe you will too. The iPod is awesome. I only had problems with iTunes

<Title>iPod, quite nice, but still has a long way to go.
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'd been wanting an ipod since they were released, but I had to opportunity to buy my first one 2 weeks ago. I thought I'd wait somedays before I'd write a review, so I could write more accurate information.  As soon as I bought my iPod, I bought a silicone skin, since I had read that the black iPod scratched very easily. I've never had my iPod outside the skin, but it's already very scratched. That's a major flaw of the black ipod, it's more beautiful than the white one, but the scratch factor is way too annoying.  The battery is an other problem that the iPod faces. I have my backlight set up for 2 seconds, and the battery lasts about 3-4 hours. It says that supposedly the battery lasts 14 hours, but that's in Apple's dreams.  Another problem with the iPod, is iTunes music store. I'm from Colombia, and since music store is not available here, I can't download music or videos. I had a couple of music videos in my conputer, so I thought I'd download them to iPod, but the conversion process is a pain in the butt. I've been able to download just a video so far.  Other than that, the iPod has an incredible sound quality. And lots of functions. I can carry all my music collection without worrying about cd's or md's. iTunes is very easy to use, and the USB port 2.0 is almost as fast as the firewire.   I wish that apple would improve these features.. all we have to do is wait.

<Title>30 gig Ipod in comparison to the iPod Nano
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I am very pleased with my Apple 30 GB iPod with Video Playback.  However, it's biggest competition is my black 4 gig iPod Nano.  In comparison to the Nano the 30 gig model seems slow and bulky.  By slow I mean when you are using the click wheel to switch from video to music or to another menu selection I have literally seen the little gaps or mini-freezes that several other reviewers have mentioned.  I was frightened at first when I saw this but the iPod was just fine.  I previously had the most current version of iTunes on my PC so I did not use the installation disc and I literally had no trouble adding my current library to my new iPod.  I transferred close to a thousand songs in less than 10 minutes.  Charging time doesn't take long for the 30 gig iPod either.  I originally planned to give away my iPod Nano after purchasing the 30 gig model but now I plan to keep both because the nano is so quick and so lightweight.  The 30 gig iPod is smaller than previous versions of the popular iPod MP3 player but it is heavy to a degree, but hey it plays awesome video.  I downloaded two music videos from the iTunes store and they look really awesome.  I have heard people complain that the scree  n is too small to enjoy a program.  This is not true, yes the screen is small, the device is small but if you are used to watching television programs on handheld devices you will easily get used to the screen.  I am lover of the iTunes software program for music and video and find it very easy to use.  However, I will mention in this review as I did in my iPod Nano review that they need to include more information about getting started with iTunes for people who are new to using the iPod.  Also I may be the only person who noticed this, but when it comes to volume, my iPod Nano seems much louder than the 30 gig iPod. As for scraches, the reason I went with white this time was because my black Nano scratched up very easily. The 30 gig iPod says it comes with a case.  This "case" is more like a small sleeve that the iPod fits in.  You can't access the navigation wheel or anything when it's in this case so it's more like a protection sleeve.  Overall, it's a great purchase and I'm pleased.  Personally, I will be glad when Apple can release an iPod that is the same size as the Nano but with more space.  I buy my iPods to listen to music so smaller is always better for me. It's a bit pricey but with all of the space and the cool new features I will be using this iPod for quite some time.

<Title>Very Non Intuitive
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Warning!!  There is a $30 restocking fee if you buy this from an Apple store.  I noticed that there is a 15% restocking fee if bought from Target...if they remember to charge that to you.    I think the Ipod was created to drive PC users nuts.  I have had many mp3 players and this is the least user friendly and has the least functionality of any I've owned (minus the video capability) which I didn't get it for.    For instance, try to go to thestreet.com and download Jim Cramer's Real Radio show on mp3.  No problem so far...you just downloaded the mp3 to your PC.  Now the fun part.  Try to transfer that mp3 to your new Ipod.  It won't work!  That isn't encoded the Apple way so you are screwed.  The unit is designed to accept specifically encoded music and if it isn't in the proper format, you are SOL.  The file system is screwy.  I wanted something I could use that was more like a flash drive, or a normal file system, where I can just drag and drop any ol file in a logical to me fashion.  Nope, you have to do the mystery import into a Library where it may or may not appear.  Then you are still not done!  It takes so many clicks just to get the darn file onto the unit.  If it worked for any file that has mp3 as the filetype, it would be a good unit for the price.  But it doesn't and I've owned too many mp3 players to be suckered into the hype of this one and know where it falls short for me.    The deal breakers were that I couldn't get Cramer's radio show on the player and I couldn't hang with the unintuitive file system.  Not much turns me to violence, nor does this, but my mind was seeing images of me jumping up and down on the unit.  I'm going ditch this player and get one that uses uses a standard battery, either AAA or AA.  The file system on my new player will not require a third party software and will be drag and drop.  It will optionally allow for expanded memory via SD or MMX.  And it will likely come with a belt clip which is all the accessory that I use/need.  The memory doesn't have to be gigantic as I tire of music easily and need to keep my selections fresh.  For all of this, I'm thinking a RCA Lyra or maybe a Rio.  The beauty of these machines is that when one part fails, say the memory, you can ditch it and replace without tech support.  [I ended up buying the RCY Lyra 512 meg and LOVE the drag and drop file system like I am use to using with my other flash drives.  Sound on that is great...super easy to use, light, FM radio, voice recorder and line in as well..Wooohooo!!]  If I could edit my stars, I'd give the Ipod Video 30g another star and up it to two stars because they give you so much memory or space for the money.  That's about all I can say positive about my experience with this thing.  But I store all my media on 10cent CDs that have up to 700 meg each on them so my storage situation is ok.  I don't need to carry my whole media library around with me at all times.  Not recommeded for advanced users that want more than ITunes.

<Title>As an actual owner of this particular Ipod...
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It not only plays music... not only holds pictures... it plays videos!  Pros: -Space: As one who previously owned a 256mb mp3 player, a 30gb ipod is a MAJOR relief. It's very comforting to know that no matter how much of my music I place on it I will never exceed the (roughly) 7,500 song limit.  -Resolution: I only have few pictures on it so far, however those few that I have look absolutely wonderful! And believe it or not, the screen isn't a bit to small. It's not different than the screen on a Gameboy, and much better than a cell phone.  -Ipod 'Prestige': This means you can the great feeling of "Yes, I own and Ipod!" Isn't so important with adults as it is with the teenage crowd. The satisfaction of owning an Ipod (ooh ahhh!) is part of the package. Also, with the exception of the 40gb and 60gb models, this is basically the most up-to-date Ipod. It's like the nano, except with a bigger screen, seven times as much storage, and plays videos. Therefore, it will mostly likely take longer for this Ipod to become obsolete.  -Easy Scrolling: You can find a song by looking alphebetically through songs, artists, albums, even composers! Convinient if your looking for that one song but you don't have a clue what it's called.  -Harder to see scratches: As opposed to the black version. I've read reviews and many customers say that with a black ipod scratches are much easier to see.  Cons: -Horror Stories: Because the Ipod is a very popular music storage system, there are no limit to horror stories about it on the market. Depleting battery life is one of the most common. Kind of makes me worried about my Ipod 24/7.  -Price (duh!): It takes alot to shell out $300+ for something you can fit in your hand (it takes alot to shell out $300 for anything).  -Itunes: I happen to have a 2000+ song collection in Windows Media Player. Imagine my dismay when I found that all 2000+ songs were going to have to be converted to AAC format. And with 20-35 seconds to convert each song... well... let's just say I don't have my whole collection on itunes.  -Earbuds: Yes I know, such a small con. But these are nasty little devils! After listening for twenty minutes with those things I had an earache that lasted an hour (and no, my music was NOT too loud).  -Accessories: And you thought paying $300 for the ipod itself was bad. Now you have to $30 for a case (heaven forbid a scratch or fingerprints got on it) and +$30 for a plug-in charger! This is a huge pet peeve I have. Apple dropped the price of ipods, then jacked up the price of accessories.  All in all, I love my Ipod to death. I realize I do have more cons than pros, but its easier to find negatives with anything than positives.  However, if you are completely unconcerned with the Ipod Craze, than you might want to choose a music player that possesses the same qualities but a different brand.

<Title>iPod File Support
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This statement below from a review below could easily be misunderstood. While WMA files have to be converted (probably rooted in the old Apple Microsoft rivalry, which has softened but may never go away), the iPod supports most other popular formats: AAC (16 to 320 Kbps), Protected AAC (from iTunes Music Store), MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps), MP3 VBR, Audible (formats 2, 3 and 4), Apple Lossless, WAV, AIFF.   I had a bunch of MP3 & MP3VBR files prior to getting my first iPod, and did not have to convert any of them. I have a 15G-3G and a 1G Shuffle and my wife has a 20G-4G, so obviously we love the iPod.  "-Itunes: I happen to have a 2000+ song collection in Windows Media Player. Imagine my dismay when I found that all 2000+ songs were going to have to be converted to AAC format. And with 20-35 seconds to convert each song... well... let's just say I don't have my whole collection on itunes."

<Title>Worth The Hype!!!!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was one of the lucky people who got an ipod video for Christmas and I think it it amazing. The look of it is a lot cooler and there are so many neat features on it.  Space: In my opinion, there is enough space to upload every song you listen to. My dad has an ipod photo, and he has put every single song that he owns on it. He listens to a LOT of music but the amount still only came to 3,500 song. That is only half the amount of what the ipod video can hold.  Battery life: If you are just listening to music, then the battery should last you a good time. Playing games on your ipod though will just wipe it out. This is bad if your on a trip and start playing games, unaware of that.  In conclusion, this ipod is the best yet. Yes, the the screen is bigger. This means that pretty soon you'll be spending 30 bucks on a good case. Unfortunatly, there are not many good cases out right now. You need the case though if you want to protect you're screen from scratches since you now need it to watch videos. The price of the videos on itunes is low and are well worth it. All in all, this ipod will go down as the coolest one out.

<Title>I love Apple
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had an ipod mini for several years.  I have a very large music collection but, I chose the mini for size.  I had just decided that room for more music was more important than size when the ipod video came out.  I love it.    The slimmer design makes for a lighter and easier to carry ipod.  The actual hieght and width is the same as older versions.  I'd still like it smaller but, I guess I can't have everything.  The video play is a great bonus.  The screen is small but the quality is good.  I'd still rather watch a DVD on a larger screen but you can't beat the ipod for packing many diversions into one package.  I've got a stack of videos and season one of The Office on my ipod video.  I've watched episodes on lunch breaks, at the doctor's office and in the Airport.    Overall, the ipod is still the best player on the market and the ipod video does not disappoint!

<Title>No doubt that iPod is good, but could be better
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Ipod has many good qualities. It has an excellent user interface ( which was taken from Creative)and releases endorphines in the brain during usage do to its visually pleasing shape. It has a sleek design, a photo viewer (above average) and a video viewer (average). Whether or not this ipod is right for you depends on your needs.         If you are soley interested in audio, then this player does a pretty nice job sorting and orgainzing your files, and itunes is relatively easy to use. However, it is important to note that the ipod does not support many different files, and that many other mp3 players do. For instance, a different 30gb mp3 player that supports wma's ( a smaller music file than the mp3) can hold up to about 15,000 songs. This player is limited to only mp3's and wavs, and can hold about 7,500 songs. These players are priced the same! If having double the amount of songs is more important to you than an aesthetically pleasing device, then i recommend buying something other than the ipod. I dont think that enough people are aware of the importance of compatible file diversity in a player, and that too many people are caught up in the "apple craze".         This is not a PVP first! The video player should be viewed as a nice bonus, but again does not support as many file types other players such as iaudio, iriver, archos AV series, and Zen Vision. The Ipod does work fine, and does everything I expected it to do, but I wish I had waited for the Zen Vision M. (Is similar to the ipod in browsing abilities and interface, but has a nicer screen and a larger array of software, audio, and video compatibility. It should be on shelves in the US for Jan 2006)         The ipod also tends to screw over their customers by forcing all software and accessories to be apple oriented, and as some other users said before, if the files arent in the right apple format, then they wont upload to the player. Also the ipod screen has only about one fourth the amount of colors that other players do (like the Zen Vision M). A purchase of a 30$ dock is also required in order to charge without the computer via usb.         If battery life is your most important factor in buying a player, the iaudio X5L boasts a 35 hour life after one charge, while the ipod and most other players have a 15 hour battery life.           Overall the ipod is more than sufficient for the casual music player, and will satisfy the needs of most people. However, if you are a person with more advanced music and video needs, then I suggest a different player. I'm not knocking the ipod, but I do feel that other devices outperform it in some aspects.

<Title>30 GB VIDEO
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The 30 GB video is a nice device but it is not without its shortcomings.  Some of the deficiencies of the ipod could easily be remedied if only Apple would act on owner complaints.  Considering that Apple sells itself as the David battling computing Goliaths, it is especially unacceptable that these complaints have largely fallen on deaf ears.  And yet for all that, I do really like the ipod video.    Pros:  1.  This is a sleek and aesthetically pleasing player.  The screen is vivid and clear and the overall design is very sharp.    2.  The sound quality is excellent.    3.  The click wheel is intuitive and the interface with itunes is flawless.  Cons:  1.  The ipod video does not come standard with an AC wall charger.   It will charge through the buss, but it takes longer and, if the apple discussion boards are any indication, may crash your ipod and or computer.    2.  All the accessories that the black ipod video ships with (earbuds and USB cable) are white.    3.  The standard earbuds that ship with the ipod are bulky tortuous things with the rough diameter of a dime.  By the end of the day my ears were sore from having to jam them in place.    4.  Battery life.  I'm averaging about 8 to 8.5 hours on one charge.  Also, when the battery finally dies it can only be replaced by Apple for a fee.  And here's a tip that may save you precious hours when you first start playing with your new ipod video: if you have it set to manually transfer files from itunes to the ipod there will be an on screen warning that flashes, "Do Not Disconnect" even after you have transfered your files.  Mine flashed for many frustrating hours before I finally figured out what the hell was happening. Apparently when set to manual the ipod works as an external drive and, to prevent damage to files, it will flash this warning indefinitely.  So if you choose to manually transfer files, you must click the eject button which appears as a triangle-over-a-horizontal-bar icon next to the ipod icon on the itunes source list when you choose to disconnect.  This will disengage the ipod from itunes and the warning will disappear.

<Title>Excellent.  Easily the coolest gadget I own.
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off, let me tell you that the iPod is amazing.  The music sounds excellent and watching video on the Liquid Crystal Display is like watching my HDTV.  ~The compactness makes it easy to store all your music, and pictures, and videos and listen to/watch them in the car or while your in a place you really don't wanna be, but are forced to by greater powers (Mothers, wives, etc.)  ~The click wheel, although it takes a couple minutes to get used to, is fascinating.  It makes it so easy to scroll through all your music.  ~The song shuffle feature is great!  I can listen to all my music and not have to take it out of my pocket to change the album.  ~So far, my only dissapointment is the huge number of scracthes that randomly appeared on the surface (On the Black Version).  However, when the backlight is on, the scratches are invisible on the screen.  I have a feeling that the case is actually what scratched it, as many people were complaining about that with the nano.  But I can live (I'm sure it would've gotten scracthed sooner or later).  ~Accesories are very expensive.  You need to charge the iPod through your computer, which although isn't that bad, can be a problem if you dont have a desktop hidden in your back pocket to whip out when your on vacation.  The adapter to charge it through the wall is like 30 bucks.  The cases for it are 30 dollars as well which can be difficult for someone who doesn't want to drop 30 dollars on a little piece of leather.  All in all, it's excellent.  If you want it, buy it and don't expect to be let down.  You can't listen to all the negative reviews that say that the software was faulty, becuase I'm sure that their computer was too old, or they didn't read the instructions.  If you're torn between this machine and the iPod nano, it all depends on what you are using it for.  The video has a hard drive, it has a little disc spinning inside it.  This allows for much more storage, but it will skip if given the chance.  If you plan on using this for exercising, I recommend the nano.  Instead of a hard drive, it has "flash memory", which means the songs are digitally encoded into the machine itself, much like an mp3 player.  This will not skip but has much less space and can't play video.  &lt;marquee>If you have any more questions, feel free to email me at bass46slinger@yahoo.com.&lt;/marquee>

<Title>I'm a bit disappointed
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wanted an iPod for the longest time and I was really excited to finally get one.  I owned a Shuffle, which I liked, and decided to upgrade to the iPod Video.  I like having ALL of my music to carry around with me but things just keep popping up that make me second-guess my purchase.  Here are the things I like:  - The design is great.  It's nice and slim and doesn't take up a lot of space. - The screen is huge compared to older generations of the iPod.  The quality of the screen is superb and the fact that it's bigger makes it that much more pleasant. - Navigation is a breeze w/ the Click Wheel.  In my opinion, it is the most intuitive navigation system of all the mp3 players out there. - iTunes integration makes organization easy. - A large selection of EQ settings lets you choose which setting fits your taste.  Overall, the features are great and I think Apple really hit the nail on the head in this department.  Here are the things that I don't like:  - As I mentioned above, there are a lot of options to choose from when looking for an EQ setting.  However, it is lacking a customizable EQ.  I have always preferred to be able to adjust bass/treble on my own and the iPod does not offer that.    - With the EQ off and using the included earbuds, the quality is decent but not great.  Bass is lacking but the highs are good enough.  Also, when I listened to a hip hop song and used the hip hop EQ setting, the bass was distorted and it made me want to change songs.  In my opinion, the Shuffle (which has no EQ settings) sounded better than the iPod Video.  I was more than happy to use the included earbuds w/ the Shuffle.  I can't say the same for this model.  - Battery life is horrible and this is probably the killer for me.  I listened to my iPod for about 4 hours straight with the backlight on at 2 seconds and it drained about half of the battery.  This was with minimal song switching.  I was well aware of how much the battery would be drained by scrolling through menus so I did my best to avoid it.  Unfortunately, I didn't know it was THIS bad.   That leads me to another negative.  The screen is so bright and nice to look at but they recommend turning off the backlight completely to get the most out of your battery life.  C'mon!  Part of the reason I bought this product was because of how nice the screen looks and now they're telling me that if I want good battery life, I have to sacrifice the beautiful display?     To conclude, this is not a terrible mp3 player but it also did not live up to the hype or the expectations for me.  Having the video is a nice feature to add on but you will have to sacrifice major battery life to utilize it.  On a side note, my rating is based on the iPod being an mp3 player, not an mp3/video player.  The video portion is a FEATURE and is not meant to override the fact that the iPod is still an mp3 player first and foremost.    The new features combined with the design makes this iPod very appealing and attractive.  Where it really lacked for me was performance.  If you can look past the poor battery life, definitely get this iPod.  You'll love it.  If battery life is important to you and you don't want to charge your iPod every other day, consider another option.

<Title>Just a fangirl review
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wont bore you by going into specs and the like, you can read that online. What I will tell you is that I am not a very techy minded person and I love my new Ipod. Mine is a black 30 GB. It is amazingly easy to use, I wanted it primarily for MP3 usage. Now that I have had it for a week I store photos, MP3s, Episodes of Lost and Podcasts. I love that I can watch these little video podcasts, its like having an electronic magazine or a good radio show at my finger tips. I cannot believe how easy this thing is to use. I did have to disable my firewall at first to get the Itunes music store to work, you may have to do this.  Anyway, I enjoy how versitile this thing is, how easy it is to use and its just fun. I spend alot of time sitting in a carpool line listening to talk radio. Now I can carry my Ipod, catch up on my TV shows, listen to a podcast I actually care about or just listen to my favorite tunes.  I also want to add that there is an album I have been wanting for years, its been out of print and Amazon and the like could not get it for me. I found it on Itunes and was able to with one click download the whole album for less than it would have cost me to buy.

<Content>All I can say is wow.  This is a truly amazing product.  As you know, this is essentially like the other iPods.  It has the same layout, a click wheel, etc.  However, this iPod is much thinner and has a larger screen than the others.  It can also play video, which is a plus.  At this time, there is a limited amount of video avalible for purchase on iTunes, for $1.99.  You can also put your own home movies on here, but you cannot put DVDs onto the iPod legally.  The only really negative aspect about this is that it scratches very easily.  Because of that, I highly reccomend purchasing a case to go along with it.  If you do get alot of scratches, you can purchase a polishing kit from www.applesaucepolish.com.  It will remove most scratches.

<Content>I recently upgraded to the 30gb Ipod Video after owning the mini for a year. I was a little hesitant at first but I'm glad I did it. It's awesome. The only downside is the lack of accessories that they offer for the video ipod. But I did purchase the socks from Apple and that seems to work fine for now. I noticed people complaining about the USB, and also noticed most of them had previous models of the Ipod. I use the adapter that came with my old Ipod. It works fine and in our house we now have 3: the Mini, the Nano and the Video so it benefits all those in our home. Hopefully Apple will come out with some accessories such as the armband and a case for the Ipod. I've yet to see any scratches on mine and I was afraid of lots because of all the reviews saying that they scratch easily. Not a problem for me. I just hope it stays that way. All in all a great investment but I gave it 4 stars again due to the lack of accessories.

<Title>Wonderful device, but poor battery and video is a chore.
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I could bore you with technical aspects, or I could offer a more personal review of the iPod 30GB white (with video).  Considering the majority of purchasers, I'm sure, aren't incredibly tech-savvy, I will go with the latter.  I will offer this: I am using a PC. ;P   The device is great, but it isn't as user-friendly as it lets on.  The BIGGEST problem I have with Apple is that they never keep their older generation iPods on the shelves (thereby lessening the price), but instead upgrade with peripheral features such as photo, video, album covers, and other unnecessary acoutrements to keep consistent $300 and $400 price tags.    If you want the iPod as a strict mp3 player, it's great.  Sound is clear, and iTunes makes the organizing of files an absolute breeze.  Insert CD, copy files, drag files over, and voila.  The iPod click-wheel interface is a dream to use, and the screen is bright, vibrant, and full of color.  Thin, easy to carry, and with lots of curb appeal, it's a wonderful .mp3 device.  ----- But THIS iPOD WILL SCRATCH!  I kept the initial plastic stick-layer on my iPod, and immediately put it into a work-out sleeve so I haven't had any front-side scratches, but the back side has a few.   My cousin received the black 30GB video iPod for Christmas, and she made the mistake of peeling off that plastic.  3 days out, her iPod is already noticably scratched.  So watch it!  Keeping it in a work-out sleeve may not be as cool as showing off your sleek iPod, but it's worth it.  Caveat emptor. -----   Anyhoot.  I have had no qualms with the player as far as mp3s so far, but this device is fairly cumbersome in the following areas (most of them are the marketing/flash-n-pop areas).  I have worked around them so far (excepting battery life), but for many users I'll see some roadblocks:  - Battery Life.  It is abysmal.  2.5 hours of music play on shuffle drained about 1/3 of my iPod battery.  Worse, this iPod does not come with a wall-charger!  Luckily I am not an iPod addict, and am content to leave it connected to my computer when I am home for play purposes -- this way it can (slowly) replenish through the USB connection.  - Album cover art.  All of the iPod promo show that you can display the album cover art next to the songs when you're playing.  You sure can -- with a bit of work!  If you want this feature, you need to manually input the album art (copy/paste from somewhere online) to the tracks once they're in the iTunes library (and BEFORE you put them on the iPod!).  They do not automatically download, like when you put a CD in the computer and play it on Windows Media Player.  Blah.  What a chore.  - Video conversion.  Quicktime/iTunes Music Store is the biggest scam on the planet.  You cannot save quicktime files, so bye-bye favorite movies.  And because of the necessary .mp4 video format, most movies will not play on the iPod.  You need a video converter.  Now you can pay $30USD for QuicktimePro, or download a shareware, non-Apple program to convert.  Either way, it takes a lot of legwork.  If you want to take advantage of iPod video (aside from select films with iPod-ready downloadable movie trailers through Apple's web site), it will take more effort.  - Lack of hardware accessories.  No wall-charger, no (real) protective sleeve, and the manual is online.  Nothing notifies a novice straight out-of-the-box that you need to manually disconnect the iPod like a piece of hardware.  If you don't, it might cause some problems.   Overall, this is a great .mp3 player, and once I got the necessary kinks out (mostly re: video), I have taken advantage of the additional features.  But it will take a lot of extra work that some users and households may not be prepared for.  Video is nice, but a major battery drain and not worth the price.  Apple should honestly keep out their older "generations" so that consumers can purchase a more affordable, strict .mp3 player from Apple, rather than throw ill-prepared flash features at an unexpected audience.   Overall:  + 4 stars for the mp3 player, design, ease of navigation and access.  - 1 star for lack of accessories (charger!), and very unclear instructions regarding the video/photo/album cover features that are so heavily marketed.

<Content>you can go ahead and search for a player that holds more songs for less money, but this is apple material and they have made a great name for themselves. exept for a few customers they have also proven most reliable. i got the 30gb white video ipod. I love it. with a capacity of 7500 songs, it will be years before i finish filling it up. It sucks that videos take up quite a bit more space than songs. if your still searching you should stop and think about this!

<Title>Changed my life...
<Date>Wed Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first Ipod. I have had an mp3 player for a few years and was dead set on the fact that I didn't need to spend 300 dollars to play music. Well.... once my friends all started getting Ipods I got sucked in because I wanted to be in the "cult" too. Well I bought mine and it literally changed my life. I can't even listen to my old flash drive mp3 player anymore because the music sounds sooo bad. Before my Ipod, i would listen to my mp3 player while working out and sometimes walking to class, with my ipod I don't go anywhere without it close by. The only reason I give it a 4 is the battery life. I am not impressed with battery life while watching videos, but other than that the  music quality is unbelievable.

<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It seems to me that more people are much more interested in downloading music off the internet, rather than purachasing it in the tradional record stores. With Apple's success of the Ipod, many companies have all tried to capture the success that they've brought out within the past sevral years. The previous main edition had a very good shelf life with a 20GB capacity. The edition not only was successful, but many thought it couldn't be done any better. Well, Apple has proved that they could top the MP3 success they've had before, in a all new Ipod. Is it ready for you?  The Apple 30GB Ipod is a sleeker and more portable Ipod than its previous edition. This edition holds much more in the way of music it had before, with as many as 7,000 songs possible. On top of that, you also can hold video clips of television shows like The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, or South Park which can be downloaded as podcasts from the itunes website. The battery life is also an important improvement, with a battery that can possible last for up to 20 hours. The color display is also a brighter, and more elequent display for anyone who loves to watch movies or television shows. I just wish though that there could've been a improvement in volume control.  All in all, if you don't own a Ipod, now is the really the time to get one. With the hype of upcoming MP3 players from Microsoft and Sony, many still want their music on he go. I love this MP3 player a whole lot, because it is a lot more convient than ever before.  Price: B+  Easy To Operate: A-  Convience: B 1/2+  Fun & Enjoyment: A-  Overall: B+

<Title>Awful Overrated Product
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After using my Ipod for about 1 month I have to say it is far worse than it's counterparts. Most other MP3 players can be used as a hard drive as well. The Ipod cannot. I am very good with computers, but have had constant problems with the Ipod. It doesn't recognize songs names or album names of many CD's. You have to enter it by hand. Now imagine doing 15,000 songs by hand. It's absurd! In addition, after I spend 4 days copying the music it was erased when the ipod died and crashed my computer. I still gave it another chance. I tried copying all the music that I had backed up. Well, I have a brand new generation 2 Dell XPS with 2 gb of random access memory and it Apple tech services, which I have spent quite a bit of time with on the phone, told me all my problems were a result of my computer being too slow. This leads me to believe that since my top of the line computer is too slow to copy a large file load to the Ipod then no computer is fast enough. I have an Iriver IHP and I use it for MP3's that don't need to be converted and I use it like a hard drive, I use it to back things up, and I use it for a lot of other things. The Ipod doesn't match up to other multimedia products. It's not a good product.  The only reason why people are buying the Ipod is because it is popular. I fell into the trap. It's not a good product unfortunately, but because all the secondary vendors are making products for it a lot of people are buying it. Don't bother buying it.

<Title>fragile lcd screens
<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been a happy ipod owner since the generation one ipod.  As a musician, teacher and traveller the ipod has met my needs for a high-quality portable music player.  The quality of sound is unsurpassed, ITunes is superb  for organizing and playing music and a no-hassle program for burning CDs.  That said the 30gb video ipod I purchased in May is now completely useless with a cracked lcd screen. It appears that the screens are rather fragile and are  NOT covered by the extended warranty, which I purchased mostly because of battery replacement.  I'm an adult who is rather meticulous in caring for my digital equipment, and as a long-time ipod user I have never had an ipod breakdown on me.  This one was not exposed to abuse, yet the screen cracked and while it will still play tunes, the screen is dead. When it happened I checked the Apple web site to see if anyone was experiencing this problem.  There are a number of postings of ipod owners frustrated with the cracked screens.  Additional complaints can be found vial googling cracked lcd screen video ipod. This is a real problem for me.  I use the ipod for teaching and now its dead and I'm out almost 300 dollars. This is a real disappointment. So be forewarned about the fragility of this IPod.

<Title>Product perfection
<Date>Sun Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Initially, I planned to hold out for Apple's forthcoming "true" video iPod -- the one that is rumored to have a larger LCD screen. But the reduced pricing ($249) of the updated 5G iPod swayed me to get one now. What a thoughtfully designed product this is! I keep finding hidden little gems about the iPod's design and operation that make me think, "Wow...somebody put some real thought into this."  McDonald's says their "secret sauce" makes their Big Mac sandwich different than an ordinary hamburger. It's clear that Apple's scrollwheel technology makes their iPod superior to other MP3 players on the market. The four buttons (up/down, left/right) found on most other players are less functional and elegant than the iPod's scrollwheel.  I've owned several Apple Computer products since the 1980s, and only one of them (knock on wood) has failed. Apple promptly replaced it. I haven't encountered any defects with my iPod; but should there be a future problem, I'd expect Apple to give me the same good service.

<Title>Avoid iPods at all costs, I'm trying to find a brand with better quality.
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I do not actually own this iPod, but I do own the 20gb discontinued iPod. I chose to write this review here so that it will actually be seen and because the products are similar.  I have no good things to say about Apple products.  I purchased my iPod right as they were discontinuing it so as to save fifty dollars instead of buying the new 20gb in color iPod.  It looked nice and had no immediate problems.  However, less than two months after I purchased it, it stopped turning on.  I called Apple who said that I needed to send it in for repair.  I did so at my expense as I had to pay shipping fees for their broken product. I did, however, promptly receive a new iPod.  This one had no immediate problems either, although the click wheel was slightly loose.  Anyway, it suited me for about another two months before it stopped turning on.  This time I was smarter about getting it fixed and brought it to an Apple store.  They again replaced it with a new iPod.  After another couple of months, the iPod randomly stopped turning on the normal way, however I found an alternative.  I found that this time I was able to reset the iPod to turn it on.  Unfortunately, it wouldn't always reset.  I would have to try time and time again for it to finally reset every time I wanted to listen.  The reset itself also takes about ten seconds.  Also, if you want to pause during a certain song, album, or whatever, reseting the iPod puts it back to the main menu so you can't continue anything you were playing before you turned it off.  So it still worked, although not properly and at an inconvienence to me.  I decided not to take it back to the Apple store as I was just tired of doing that and since it worked slightly anyway.  After owning that iPod for about 10 months, it stopped turning on. Now, however, I can not get a free replacement.  The iPod standard warranty is a year.  This really isn't too bad for a product that works, but the iPod is just terrible so it really doesn't help.  Also, whenever the iPod is replaced, the warranty only continues for the remaining time of the original. So now I am stuck with either spending over two hundred dollars on a new mp3 of a similar size capacity, going back to cds, or just giving up.  I already forked over $250 to Apple and I really don't want to give another $230 just because their products don't work.  Before I purchased the iPod, I was using a Sony cd player that lasted five years before the headhone jack  got bent and the sound began to only play through one ear.  If I really wanted to, I could have continued to use it.  My first and second iPod made it for two months.  What sounds like better quality to you, two months or five years?  I can't believe how terrible Apple's products are.   If anyone has had similar problems with the iPod and has found a better mp3 player brand, I would love to hear from you.  I'm still trying to find something better than this junk from Apple.  I'd give this product a zero out of five if I could.

<Title>Unreliable - watch out for hard drive failure
<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple IPODs have lousy hard drives that are expected to fail within 1-2 years. This means that for your $250+ you get to use your IPOD for 12-24 months before it becomes completely worthless. Apple's customer service completely fails in this regard. If you have "applecare" they will give you a new IPOD (if it fails within the first 24 months), but, if not, you are SOL. What they don't tell you is that your hard drive WILL fail - maybe in a month, 12, 18, 24, either way Apple seems to find it unreasonable that a customer would want an IPOD to last longer than that. I had planned to buy 2 IPODS to give as Christimas gifts but will not now. I don't want to give my family a product that will break.

<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Like Ralph Parker, I have been dreaming for a gift of this calibur for an excruciatingly lengthly time.  After my parents both had iPods, the green monster of envy slowly but surely nibbled at my butt for months, until Christmas morning arrived with the intoxicating stench of plastic and liquid crystal display screen: I got the newest iPod, and as a hardcore music fan, it's like achieving nirvana.  If Apple isn't the world's most innovative company as TIME magazine boldly proclaimed them to be, I don't know what company is.  With the storage capacity of 30 GB (about 7500 songs), you've got it made for the rest of your music life.  It's relatively easy to use, although the volume control on the click wheel is a tad too sensitive.  The sound quality is naturally exquisite and the video quality on the LCD, which is pretty dang sturdy, is also great.  As anal retentive as Apple is on control, they haven't given the excuse that control means sacrificing quality.  Although it isn't the MOST comprehensive service ever made, iTunes does beat the competition with incredible finesse, but you might want to wait a long while before immediately accessing its incredible library.  After all, you have your entire CD collection to burn.  Don't worry, hardcore technofiles.  This thing also plays a few games and houses a calendar and a clock, but ultimately, it's about the music and the videos.  Also, about the make and model, this is America after all.  It's all good whether you're black or white.   Obviously Apple's going to upgrade the 'Pod before, say, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, given their track record, but this should last you a lifetime.  After all, with 7500 songs to store, you'd better get busy.  Apple has entered its Renaissance indeed: reclaiming their hipness lost to Microsoft with a Messianic device that has made Apple widely ACCEPTED for the first time since probably 1977.  The fact that they have virtually saved the music industry in the process proves that it's all in a day's work.  n3ur010g1c gives the iPod a 10...out of 10.

<Title>One of the best mp3 players on the market
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At first I was a bit reluctant to buy an iPod Video, but with my 3G  10GB iPod battery life deteriorating fast, I took the plunge. Let me tell you that I have absolutely no regrets. The extra space this iPod provided over my old iPod was very welcome and the quality on the video playback is nice for a portable device. The price may seem a little high, but considering that my 10GB iPod was bought for roughly the same price, Apple has found a way to add more feature without raising the price or without sacrificing the quality of their product.   Everything is not perfect with this little device though. The battery life for video is not that great, about 2-2.5 hours, so don't expect to watch more than one movie without recharging. As with the black iPod Nano, the black Video iPod scratches very easily. This can be prevented if you buy a protective covering such as an iSkin. It is VERY important to keep this iPod as scratch free as you can. If the screen gets scratched enough, it will get difficult to watch video on it. The Video iPod also DOES NOT come with a wall charger, which can be a negative for first time iPod buyers. In order to recharge the unit, you have to plug it into the USB port. The last thing I can think of that can be considered a drawback is that there is a lack of radio and voice recording, which is included with the iRiver.  Even with some minor drawbacks the iPod video is still the king of the hill when it comes to MP3 players. If any one is looking an MP3 player, your search stops here. This is a must have gadget  for anyone looking for a portable audio player. If the price seems a little steep, I recommend going to http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=26374814 where you can get one for free or at very little cost.

<Content>I received an iPod video over Christmas.  I have never owned an ipod so I had no idea what to expect.    All in all, its a nice toy. I give it three stars.     Positives  Small More than enough storage for my needs The MPEG4 Video playback works fair on a standard TV Was able to use the RCA video jack from my video camera (however the video was swapped with an audio channel) Battery life is good, even when playing video as long as the backlight is turned off Internal display is big enough to actually use it   Negatives  Had to hunt around a bit to find software to do the mpeg4.  Videora is free and seems to work fine.  I would have thought it would came with some sort of software.    The iTunes software seems a bit clunky.  Loading pictures/songs/video is not handled the same.  Too many hidden features.  It would have been nice to be able to create some sort of disk structure for the music, like you can with the video and pictures.  I have been using the unit every day for at least 8 hours. I have had it lock up once where I could not power it off.  I could still navigate the menus, but the that was it.  Strange enough also is that the backlight would not turn off.  I was able to just do a reset to recover.  No lost data.  Twice I have had it pop up the www.apple.com/support/ipod on power up twice now.  This bug seems to have something to do with the when the PC I am using goes into power saving mode.  If I leave the iPod plugged in to charge it and walk away and the PC goes into power saving mode appears to have something to do with it.  The worst part is that I have to reinstall all of the software to recover from this failure.  To load up 20G of data takes a bit of time.  I make a point not to purchase anything from Toshiba after they sold US military information and equipment to Russia in the 80s. The iPod's disk drive is made by Toshiba. It will be interesting to see how well it holds up.

<Content>We've had one of these since Thanksgiving time.  It gets used all the time.  So far the quality is holding.  There are tons of new accessories available...our favorite one is a leather flip case to help protect it.    One drawback is that it can take a lot of time to download movies and you have to find a machine that runs the right formats to download off.  My laptop runs the right format but for some reason is so slow that we cannot use it for loading.  Our desktops don't play dvd's so the only way we can get dvd's into this is by using a friends pc.  (That's a hassle).  But still we use it every day.  It's a lot of fun.  Video quality & sound quality are ok.  What can you expect from something that fits in your palm?  I think the price is a bit high, but you are getting a 30 Gig drive...and look at what XBOX 360 gets for only a 20 Gig drive! $499  So maybe it's not a bad deal.

<Content>Get a case immediately. No question. Honestly, who cares about scratches on the back of the device? However, you want to protect the front because the video playback is beautiful and you want to keep it that way. I Received this as an upgrade from my 3rd gen ipod. I can carry LOTS of photos of my kids, watch tv while on break @ work, listen to music. Headphones that come with it aren't that great, get some new ones, you'll get much better sound. When you watch video, the battery does deplete quickly. I kept my cable from my old ipod and can plug it into the wall while at work if I need to. Also, read some gripe from a PC user who wanted to drop files into folders. You CAN do that, if you enable the ipod to be used as a hard drive. Look under the options menu. I'm also a PC user, and my only gripe is that syncing my calendar through itunes never worked, I actually had to export each event that I wanted to load onto my ipod. Well, he got me a music/video player, not a PDA. Also, my jog dial is very sensitive. Maybe it's just my magnetic personality. iTunes is intuitive and easy to use. Makes organizing your music (and video) a snap. I'm almost at the point where I want to buy a mac so I can use iVideo (or whatever it is) and put my home videos on my ipod. How cool would that be? Have fun with your purchase.

<Content>I have many problems with this iPod. The battery life says 14 hours right on the box. If you watch 4 videos on this iPod, you will have half the battery life left. Also, on iTunes, it is $1.99 per video! This iPod is set to hold 7,500 songs. Who in god's creation is going to have that many songs? What is also annoying is that it is two times wider than the Nano. It is 4 ounces heavier than the Nano and is more expensive for space you are not going to use. If you want to spend money on music videos that you can watch free on aolmusic.com, be my guest. The Nano holds 1,000 songs which is more than enough and the battery life is the same as this one. The Nano is more affordable and holds more than enough.

She took VERY good care of it, because it was her pride and joy.  Well guess what, at that time the hard drive packed it in.  We sent it to Apple under the warrenty, within the covered period and guess what?  They sent it back as "uncovered by warranty, due to abuse".   I looked at the thing when we had them send it back, and there's not a mark on it.  Apple's warrenty coverage is a scam, and they know they have a problem with the hard drives failing and they won't stand behind there product.  So much for the idea "you're better with an Apple".   I hope Steve Jobs likes his sales numbers now, because he is losing the generation that would have bought his products in the future.  My daughter will never consider an apple product again.

<Title>WARNING!!! Don't Waste Your Money
<Date>Tue Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am sorry to regret that I am one of apples many victims. I am not rich and it took a long time for me to save up to buy this product. After a couple months of owning it I plugged it into the computer and it "automatically updated?" the software and "consolidated the library?" without my permission. Normally I wouldn't have cared but after it was done it wouldn't allow me to eject it from iTunes. Although it said "Do Not Disconnect" on the screen. Since I couldn't just leave it plugged in forever, I had no choice but to take it out. Then later I plugged it back in and it said that it couldn't read the contents of the library. Afterward it started to erase random songs, freeze all the time, and couldn't ever turn off. Then no more than three days later I couldn't access any of my music, games, or videos. So then I sent it to the apple repair center and had to pay a $30 fee. But they sent it back to me saying that they declined fixing it because the iPod was damaged... OF COURSE! They were the ones that damaged it.        Do not let the people of Apple take advantage of you like they did me. All I wanted was a reliable 20-30gb mp3 player that could last at least a year. I don't really care much for the videos or games. Apple should focus more on making the product reliable instead. But then they try to attract customers with it's good looks. But don't inform you about the cheap, fragile, and lazily created interior. Get a Zen or Archos. Unlike iPods, they don't focus on the looks but the quality. Plus they actually have a power button to turn the device on and off. Just don't support companies, such as apple, that only care about taking the customers money but not about the customer himself.

<Title>Amazon should stop misleading consumers
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Amazon sells their iPod 30GB without making it clear which generation they are selling.  There are two iPod generations the 5th & 6th Generation iPod.  The new generation iPod offers 60% brighter screen & almost double the video battery life from 2 hours to 3.5 hours.  I'm not sure, but what I can tell is Amazon is offering a small discount for the older generation 30GB model..but they aren't even making it clear which generation is which and that is misleading to consumers.  If you're looking to buy an iPod, don't think you're saving a little money by buying here at Amazon; you're just buying the older generation and that's why they offer it at a slightly discounted price!

<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have been using my ipod 12 hrs a day nearly every day since july and find it to be perfect. excellent video quality, button response, and battery life. I even dropped it accidentally about 3 feet onto a concrete floor at work. it was only in the thin cover supplied with it but was fine. However, the version of itunes that came with it does not organize artists or songs well at all. It put several listings of the same artists with only a few songs each that all came from same source on the ipod. very annoying. Then the latest version of itunes it suggested i download a few weeks ago causes my Dell jukebox i use at home to crash everytime at startup. Still havent solved that problem yet. The software is loaded with gliches when used on a PC.

<Title>Good Until the Introduction of iTunes 7
<Date>Wed Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My iPod worked fine until I uploaded iTunes 7... sure it froze at least once a month, requiring me to reboot it... but no music lost, no harm no foul.  But then I wanted to download an episode of Lost I missed on iTunes and it told me that I needed iTunes 7 to do so (which is a blatant lie - i later found out - if you look at apple's own description of iTunes 6, it's under the new features for this version)... so I downloaded the new version, and low and behold I can no longer upload music to my iPod.  Also, the episode of Lost I bought restarted downloading half way through after "a bad connection", which I assume is Apple-speak for "you're tying up too much of our time with your dial-up".  So now I can't find iTunes 6 on their website or anywhere else... I wouldn't recommend Apple Products to anyone I liked.  Maybe to the dumb kid down the block.  But that's it.

<Content>I just received this iPod for Christmas and I love it.  My 1st generation mini just died (which was a pretty sad, short life of only 2 years), and this new iPod is a completely different world... much thinner and lighter, better battery life, and amazingly clear videos!  I can't get enough.  However, I must warn you... the front scratches extremely easily!  I had barely even gotten it out of the packaging and I had 4 scratches. Keep it in it's case when you are not using it or buy a case.  It is well worth it to preserve that fabulous picture.

<Title>Very Delicate
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own the 30 GB White iPod with video playback. Before I got it, I was looking for reviews on it, because of the big issue over it scratching. I was reading people bashing reviewers telling them that they're iPods are only scratched because of poor care. Well, I'm going to clear everything up.  The iPod's case is VERY DELICATE. I have taken excellent care of this device. I keep it in the case it comes with and use a soft cloth to wipe the fingerprints (the 5th Generation iPod gets fingerprints like crazy!). I took it out on my second day of having it to recharge the battery (that dies quickly if you watch more then 20 minutes of video).  The iPod was inside my (new) jacket pocket with NOTHING ELSE in the pocket. No change, no keys, not even lint. When I recharged it I noticed from a certain angle in the light it shows a row of 5 long scratches going up the screen.  I am kinda mad that my nearly $400 (Canadian price) mp3 player is  already scratched, but I still love this thing because I can get music videos and copy all of my CD collection onto it and still have more then half the space left.  PS: It's not really 30 GB of space, its 27-28 GB, because thats what it says in the bar that shows the maximum space.

<Title>Great functions...iffy batteries
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my iPod video for 3 weeks now and I have to say I love it. My previous iPod was a Mini which I loved.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend the iPod video. However, I would strongly suggest you find a good case/protector. I bought the evo3 from iSkin and think it's perfect. Complete iPod coverage without compromising the view screen or click wheel.  Pros:  - Good capacity in a nicely sized package - That awesome click wheel we know and love - I think the sound quality is great...but I'm not an audiophile. - Video playback clarity is excellent. All of my friends and I are impressed with how crisp the picture is (I downloaded The Office from iTunes as a sample.) The viewing area is small, but the clarity makes it easy to watch shows/videos.   Cons: - The exterior scratches easily...which matters more than ever with the video playback - It can be "slow" to load the video - I'm getting poor battery life. I'm probably going to exchange in the hopes of getting 15-20 hours of music (as promised) instead of the 4-5 I'm getting now.  - Playing videos will eat away at your battery faster than you can blink. I think my batter may be bad...but I don't get a full hour of video before my battery indicator goes red.  - As usual with iPods the earbuds that come with the machine are awful. - This is NOT packaged with a power core...it only has a USB cable included. However, it appears to be compatible with the usual Apple charger since I'm just using my iPod mini charger box.   I know it looks like there are a lot of "cons" but this truly is a  great machine. The interface is incredibly intuitive and the quality of the playback (audio and video) is very high.

<Content>Yes I like the features, the looks, everything, but I can't give a good review due to a major material problem- breathing on the unit will cause scratching. Apple should recall these units and put on a scratch resistant coating. My Quick start guide said nothing about putting on gloves and a mask to transfer to a protective case. I did not use my Ipod till it was in a hard case, yet I have scratches. The black is sleek but if you put it in a clear skin you lose the look, put it in a hard case and it's no longer thinner than the 4th generation.

<Title>Howard Tuttleman joins the I-POD revolution.
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hey guys, Howard here.  I was looking around the house last-week, when I stumbled upon a huge stack of un-opened christmas-presents under my parents bed!  I had to think about it for a minute, and then I remembered.  Christmas-Morning I had ran down the stairs because I was awoken by the sound of a dog barking.  I thought it was Morris (my dog), but it just turned out to be the new Jack-Russel-Terrier (a different dog).  I remember getting so mad that I began throwing and kicking all of the other presents around the room because I was angered that Morris didn't return.  I remember putting my foot through a really big present, kicking some medium presents and throwing a few small presents.  Well, looks like I found where they went!  And since I forgot they even existed it has been making this week a real-treat.  So many new products to review in such a short time-period!   Anyways, this was the first one I opened last week, so it's only intelligent to review this one first.  Okay, I figured I was getting one of these I-POD things a while ago.  You see, my parents never like the Christmas Wish-Lists that I give them, so they usually ask Lyle what would be a good present for a boy my age.  This is sometimes-good/sometimes-bad.  I mean, I always like all of the things Lyle likes, but sometimes I would rather have the things I ask for.  So this year, I'm denied a parachute, but I get this I-POD instead.  Hardly an even trade, but Lyle is always raving about his I-POD so I figured I would give it a chance.  Okay, from what I've heard and read, joining the I-POD revolution is a choice of individuality and displays a real sense that you only buy the best things.  I'm not quite sure how I missed out on this phenomenom for so long because Howard Tuttleman is usually pretty clue-ful about what the next-big-thing is.  Anyways, I'm "in" now, and I'll tell you all about what to expect when you sign-up, and how your life will change.  Okay, right off the bat, I opened the box and now I really wish I would have been able to go to the store and pick out my own I-POD.  I heard that these things come in all different sizes, colors, and shapes or something.  I could have spent all day picking-out the I-POD that defined Howard Tuttleman as a person.  Well, my parents must not think very highly of me because the one that I recieved was just plain-white and RIDICULOUSLY small.  It's so...not-me.  You know, I'd be shocked if it didn't go something like this at the store:  I-POD Merchant: "So Mr. Tuttleman, you're buying an I-POD for your son.  Tell me some important things about him so we can find the perfect match for him."  Dad:  "Uh...hmmm.  Well, he's small and white."  I-POD Merchant:  "Ah yes, I think I have the perfect I-POD for him.  Mom: "Ooooh!  That reminds me so much of our Howard since we know nothing about him and don't really care anyways!  We'll take it!   Now I've never seen Lyle's I-POD, but I would imagine it would at-least have some sort of personality-defining features on it like probably a Canadian theme with a little hockey style going-on or something.  I'm sure HIS parents care enough to do this for him.  The I-POD that defines Howard Tuttleman would have to be the biggest, flashiest one available, with the most gizmos and lights and in the color of GOLDEN.  Anyways, forget about it.  I'm stuck with this one for now.    I'll do a quick run-down of what you get.  Lots of wires come with this thing.  My parents even got me an extra wire that I figured out how to plug into an electrical-outlet.  There's a mystery wire that you can plug into your I-POD with one end, but the other one into...well, pretty much nothing.  It's kind of like a tail for your I-POD if you just leave it in.  Oh, and you get head-phones that HURT!  They are like sharp, hard ear-plugs.  I don't you should plan on using them much because you shouldn't have to feel pain every-time you use your I-POD.  Okay, now for the part you've been waiting for.  What your I-POD can do for you once you turn it on.  For starters the screen is so small it makes the menus WAY too hard to read without putting your face right up to it.  Not too happy about this and I'm hoping they have a screen-magnifier available like Game-Boy.    All gripes aside, this thing can do a LOT!  I've spent about a week with it so far, and I find myself taking it EVERYWHERE.  The clock eliminates the need for a watch, and it even has a current calander.  You can even look at old calanders or even peer into the future and see days of the week yet-to-happen.  I think it says I can also put people's phone numbers and addresses in it too.  All-in-all it's got some pretty handy features in it.  What I'm most excited about however, is the games it comes with.  I find myself getting lost in these games and spending hours on them.  Solitare is a confusing yet fun game of cards where you match-up cards in a reasonable order.  I haven't beat it yet but I'm getting close.  There's another one called "Brick" where you bounce a ball off of a platform and destroy red and orange things at the top of the screen.  I'm getting VERY good at this one.  The best thing about the I-POD to me though is the game called Parachute.  You are a tank and you can shoot helicopters that drops parachutists.  The explosions aren't very good though and I feel they could have done better with the graphics.  You can also shoot the parachutists but it isn't very realistic when they die.  Does anyone know if there is a blood-code or gore-code or any other cheat codes for these games?  I've been searching on-line but found nothing so far.  There is also some Music-Quiz game that I can't get to work.  I get error-messages every time I try to play it.  That's a shame because I'm really good at Quiz-Style games like Math-Arcade, Scramble-saurus, Spellaroo, and Translator-Alligator over at the fun-brain web-site.  A quiz-game could have provided something that had some educational value.  Playing cards, bouncing a ball and performing a tank massacre are fun and all but I don't feel I'm learning much or expanding my mind.  In conclusion in the past week I've really grown attached to my I-POD.  I'm starting to master all of the games so I'll be buying some new ones soon.  A wish-list for my next i-pod would have to include a calculator and an alarm-clock, because even my cello-phone has those features.  Maybe a camera too.  And you should be able to connect to the internet.  Oh yeah, and I'd really like to be able to hear the sound-effects on my games, but those head-phones just became unbearably painful and I was forced to throw them away.  Next time I-POD should consider including the really big head-phones that cover your ears completely.  I'm getting so tired of telling you about my I-POD now and I want to play on it, so go buy one or don't.  I just tell you about it because it's my job.  I don't care if you get one or not.  I really don't.  You will probably pick a dumb color anyways.  Later.  Whoops!  That wasn't how I wanted to end the review!  Sometimes I just get mad at the end of my reviews and I yell-about it.  Sorry!  No I'm not.  Later.  Yes I am.  Later.  howardtuttleman.com

<Title>I love my iPod!!
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I decided on buying my first mP3 player, I did a bunch of research on which ones were best rated. I decided on a 30gb video iPod. Let me just say, I'm very happy with the choice I made.  Most reviews complained about scratching and poor battery life. About the scratching, I have NONE. I've kept the plastic cover that came on it in the package on the front screen and wheel. ABSOLUTLY NO SCRATCHES. You can't even tell the plastic is on it! Just wipe it clean if it gets smudges, and you're good to go! The chrome back is prone to fingerprints, but if you get a case, like I did, you don't have to worry about that!  The battery life, I'll admit isn't as good as I have thought. I haven't completely drained my battery yet, so I'm not sure of the actual hours of battery life. One way to use less battery is to change the option to have the screen light on for 5 seconds instead of the 15 it's preset with. I haven't used video, but after just seeing cover art pictures on it, I think the video quality is pretty good.  Pros: -Tons of storage. I've uploaded every cd and mp3 I have at my house on my ipod, and I have over half the space left!  -Easy to work with. iTunes is a great music program. Uploading is a cinch. It organizes playlists and artists for you. Searching through songs is very simple.  -It looks so awesome! If you're looking for a fashionable case and are willing to a little spend money, the gold kate spade broome street ipod case looks amazing with the black ipod.  -Free engraving on apple.com. Why wouldn't you want it personalized?  -Good sound quality. Being in the music business, I know a thing or two about sound quality. It sounds better than cds!  Cons  -Battery life isn't 15 hours like apple claims. Real battery life is probably between 5 and 8 hours. Longer if you don't keep the back light on.  -It doesn't come with a wall charger. That was really my only complaint about this product. Apple.com over charges for them and you have to buy the cord seperately. You can find cheaper/better deals on ebay or at target.  -The ear buds kind of suck. I have really small ears though, so maybe that's why. You can plug pretty much any headphones into an ipod as long as the jack size isn't too big.   So if you're looking for an mp3 player with lots of storage, and cost isn't as important as quality, an ipod would probably be a good choice.

<Title>A detailed review of a simple product
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>At first glance, this iPod seems to be the best thing since sliced bread. It is stylish (I bought the black one), incredibly thin and lightweight, and it holds a gigantuous amount of information. After owning the 4GB mini, it was a wonderful upgrade. Besides the obvious 7500 songs that can be downloaded onto this device, there is also the option of adding up to 20,000 photos, or 75 hours of video playback. The itunes music store only allows you to download 30-minute tv shows,or 5 minute music videos (at about 2 dollars a pop). However, don't limit yourself. There are plenty of programs out there that allow you to make your own videos ipod ready; even the DVDs from your collection. I use PQ DVD Recorder and it works like a charm. An entire movie takes up about one third of a gig. The screen is bright and colorful and and it is big enough to put away any worries about being too small. You don't have to squint to see your ipod screen. You can watch TV shows, movies, photoslide shows with music, and listen to your songs until your heart's content. All of these things make the ipod an ideal portable media device. But there are some faults that caused me to give it just 3 stars.   For starters, Although 75 hours of video can be stored on the ipod, only 2 hours of video can be watched at any given time without being connected to a charger. In most cases, it is unlikely that someone would watch a whole movie in one sitting on a 2.5 inch screen. Most often, I don't. However, I realized what a pain the battery life was when I had to take a five hour flight to arizona. I ended up playing a movie for an hour and preserving the rest of my battery life for music playback. And those who have owned other ipod products know that the battery deteriates over time. Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to what battery life on video playback will be like a couple months from now.  Also, I have had my ipod since November and have experienced some minor glitches with the hard drive. When i put the ipod on Shuffle all songs, it has a tendency to freeze around the 500 mark of song playback. To combat this, I recommend reseting the device (holding down the menu button and play button) after every other charge or so. You won't lose any information, it just refreshes the device.   When I got my ipod back in Novemeber, there were no cases available to keep it from scratching. It comes with some cheap little gimmick of a case, that proves to be useless if you want to watch video; there is no window for the screen. Also, I found that the ipod accumulated light scratches even using the given case. BUY A CASE FOR THIS IPOD, and plastic screen protector too. When i finally got the released case in December, I had to use iDrops to remove all of the light scratches that were on the ipod. the iDrops work for all of the apple ipod products, i would recommend those as well.   Finally, there is one more small, but fixable annoyance. That is, the included ipod headphones. They have terrible sound quaility, and they put the world on high alert that you have a 400 dollar ipod in your pocket. If you listen to music with heavy bass such as hip hop or anything of that nature, these headphones are bound to tick you off. At around 70% volume, they bass sounds muffled and can make your songs sound bad. This is easily curable. I bought a pair of black sony earbud headphones for about 8 dollars and killed 2 birds with one stone. They sound excellent, even turned all the way up. Also, the black headphones match my black ipod (who would want white headphones with a black and silver ipod anyway?), and if my ipod is in my pocket, no one knows that I have one. It's a cheap fix.  With all of this being said, my Ipod is one of my favorite electronics purchases ever. I can fit All of my music and a lot of my DVD collection on it with no problem. Currently, I have 2000 songs, 9 or 10 DVDs and a few music videos on it, and i still have about 17 Gig left of space. Like the other color ipods, you have the option of adding album art to each song that will be displayed next to the song everytime it plays.  That's more than half, and it's more than enough. Any problems i've had with it are pretty much fixable and it's a great item to have if you work out a lot, travel a lot (train, plane, bus),love to consume large quantities of music, or just like to keep up with what's new in the electronic world. Lastly, if you are a college student i would recommend that you buy this item directly from the apple store...Apple will give you a discount of about 30 dollars, which could mean the difference between the 30GB model and the 60GB model. Hope this was helpful.

<Content>The sound is awesome!  Same size as 2nd Gen 30GB, but thinner, lighter and bigger screen.  Battery is great, but I have only had it 3 days.  Video drains the battery.  I thought the scratch warnings were hype, but they are not!  This screen is made of butter!  I was hypercareful about the screen (not having a protective cover yet).  I was doing fine until I put it in my dress shirt pocket with the earphones and walked 150 ft from my truck to my office and they were SCRATCHED!!  Two nice long scratches and few smaller.  I have never seen anything scratch like this.  Should have came with protective cover or a better quality screen.  Wall charger is extra, that is kind of cheap.

<Content>Like the guy below, I also actually have it. (I dont know if he realizes about 2 million others do.)The screen is very nice, 2.5 inches is great for watching the videos. For movies its not quite as good as PSP but it gets the job done if you want ultimate portability. The thinness is also a good thing. The 60 gb is thinner than the old 20 gb. My brother has a 4 gb ipod nano and he wants to get this now. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it will be very common after a while. It doesnt have the wow factor that a moto razr or psp has.

<Title>LCD NOT covered under Apple Warranty
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is from the Apple service website:   If your iPod's LCD display is cracked due to accidental damage, do not send your iPod in for service. Coverage for this type of damage is excluded under Apple's Limited Warranty for iPod and AppleCare Protection Plan for iPod, and service is not available under the terms of Apple's Repair Terms and Conditions.   We bought a nano.  It lasted ~ 6 months and then the screen cracked.  Is it worth the premium for this device when Apple doesn't warranty the LCDs?

<Title>You can't go wrong with an iPod
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So, I bought a 30GB iPod Photo a few years ago, and can't say enough good things about it.  The thing is still rockin' along, and I love everything about it - the sound quality is top-notch, it's easy to operate, and iTunes is so simple to use, does just about everything I need it to do.  I just got a 30GB iPod Video, and I have to say, I'm a little disappointed - the first time I powered it on and pumped out some tunes, I was MORE than just a little disappointed, but read on...  When it comes to music, I am meticulous (to say the least), and demand a certain sound and a high level of performance out of my equipment; the iPod photo fit all those needs.  However, the iPod video...well, it didn't sound nearly as good as the photo, even after jacking with the EQ's and upgrading my firmware to the latest version (the latest when I received it, anyway).  I bought new headphones, revamped the quality of some MP3 files, all with the same result - the sound quality was much more tinny and had too much mid-range, causing distortion, not just on a few songs, but on ALL songs.  I compared it with my iPod photo, which still sounded fantastic, and concluded it must be the iPod.  So, over the past week, I've pretty much ignored the video iPod, and stuck with my photo iPod.  However, the new version 1.2 firmware came out, and I just upgraded to it...I don't know what happened, but it sounds much better (still not on par with my Photo, though).  The sound quality I can live with; as far as the video quality, all I have to say is WOW.  Such high quality for such a little screen!  It's absolutely phenomenal (and I'm just as picky with my video output as I am my sound quality).  If videos/shows/movies are your thing, then the video iPod will blow you away.  What I was truly disappointed with - and why I only give the iPod 4 stars, and not 5 - is the battery life.  Again, my only point of comparison is my iPod photo, and with continuous use (about 8 hours a night), I had to charge it up about once every three days.  The video iPod?  It barely lasted 8 hours before the battery died, the first night I used it (yes, I gave it a full charge the day I got it).  I was not pleased, and I'm still not pleased; to me, it's the most annoying feature, since I work 10 hour shifts.  The primary function of my video iPod is a music player, so I knew it wasn't sucking up battery due to video playback.  Either I got lucky with the battery in my iPod photo, or I have a bad battery in this iPod video.  I know Apple got bigtime grief over their batteries in some of the early generation iPods, so I suppose I should count myself lucky, but come on!  If we're going to shell out 300 bucks for an MP3 player, the battery life should AT LEAST live up to what it says - up to 14 hours.  A max battery life of 8 hours is just not good enough for the price you pay.  So, overall, as long as you upgrade the firmware, you should be good for sound quality; the video quality is excellent, but the battery life didn't cut it for me at all (8 hours max out of a promised "up to 14."

<Date>Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Apple iPod is the best electronic out in the market today. iPods are taking over the world and they continue to dominate the sales. They are a part of pop culture. Everyone should have one. The only problem that I have with this device is the battery life. If you have a lot of TV shows on your iPod u can only watch about 4 20 minute shows before your battery is on the red. But otherwise it is a magnificent player and it's quality is excellent. I never leave it alone. Alot of my friends have actually gave me the nickname Mr. iPod because I listen to it so much. The iPod is a must for anyone who truly loves music. It makes it easy for disorganized people like me to organize all of their music with iTunes. 2 thumbs way up

<Title>iPods can be fickle things
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My sister and I both have this exact iPod model. She loves hers; hasn't given her once ounce of grief or had any problems with how it works. I got mine as a birthday gift.   Right from that day, I've had to deal with various glitches and minor problems that hamper what would otherwise be a very useful and fun item to invest in.   I got an iTunes music card with this, and immediately went online to buy music. I bought a few songs, put them on the iPod, and went on my way. I had a few other songs put on it from my personal collection as well. I ran  into glitch #1, which to this day I have not been able to fix (and to my knowledge, cannnot BE fixed).   My purchased songs do not play when directly downloaded. Ever. The iPod simply brings it up on the screen, skips it completely without playing it, and goes on to another song. All my other songs from my CDs play fine without any problems. Purchased songs from iTunes do not play. They play in the iTunes program itself, but not on my iPod. This was extremely frustrating that a product brand new and right out of the box that costs so much would already fail to work properly.   The Apple website has no useful information, so I went to the forums, and found DOZENS of people with the exact same problem, and with different iPod models. (Video, mini, nano, etc...) There's some combination you can do on the control pad to do a "soft reset" or something like that. It's supposed to make the Apple logo appear on your screen. I've never been able to do this on mine. De-authorizing and re-authorizing your computer is also supposed to work, but it didn't. And you need to have your computer authorized in order to play your purchased songs in iTunes.  To work around this glitch, I have to burn all my purchased music onto a CD, then transfer the songs from the CD BACK to my iPod, and then they'll play without any problems. There is the added hassle of having two copies of the same song on here, and needing to go through and delete the one that doesn't play. Not to mention you won't be able to have the album art displayed on the screen. (Disappointing as this is the VIDEO iPod.) However, it will make the music work.   The sound quality, though, is excellent. Sometimes I notice that songs played from CDs in CD players have slightly different pacing. Some play faster in some players, some play slower. Song speed is pretty consistent, and music is played clearly. I've always enjoyed listening to music on it.  I've never played any movie files on my iPod yet, so I don't know what video playback is like. Personally, I'm not sure I want to watch video on such a tiny screen anyway. But with a 30 GB drive on it, you can carry THOUSANDS of songs. I only have about 430 or so on mine at the moment, and I'm getting pretty close to 2 GB right now. I'm not sure if I will ever fill this thing completely. If you are a person who has THOUSANDS of songs that you want in one place, this could be the iPod for you. If you can't imagine owning that much music, then I'd opt for a smaller model. For an iPod, this is kinda big. You might want to consider a belt clip for carrying it around. The only pockets I have big enough for this is the front one of my sweatshirts.   Turning off an iPod, at least this model, invovles holding down the play/pause part of the control pad. This can be tricky if you don't hit it just right, and I sometimes have to take a few minutes just to turn it off because I just can't hit it in that one spot.   The shiny black cover and black silver casing is very nice, but smudges easily. This comes with a soft cloth cover, but it's not pratical for transporting and too difficult to use the control pad with. I recommended getting a belt clip for this, and I still do. Make sure it's attached to a nice cover that keeps everything clean but still lets you use the controls.   The signature white ear phones that come with all iPods are nice, but I found them uncomfortable to wear at first, even with the provided cushions. My cat thought the earphones were cat toys and no matter how high a shelf I put my iPod on, he'd get to it, rip the cushions off and I've never seen them again. Without these covers, I pretty much couldn't wear the ear phones without serious pain. I got a pair of Phillips earbuds at Wal-Mart that were recommended for iPods. They were $15 (dear gawd) but they fit in your ear much better and with less discomfort.    The battery display isn't very accurate. I've turned my iPod off with half a battery, switched on the hold so it won't turn back on by itself, and when I've activated it again, I'm down to a sliver of a battery. The instructions never said anything about the hold button using battery life. Even while playing back, the battery meter comes and goes. Sometimes that sliver of a battery turns into a good chunk of a battery, but I'm always worried that even at half a battery, listening to one song is going to kill it completely.   My sister's iPod, however, hasn't had any of the problems mine has, so I could have a second-rate model, or one otherwise that just isn't up to par. Others I've talked to who also own iPods (though not the same model) also seem to have ones that work without glitches. Who knows, take a chance.  As with all iPods, you have to use iTunes to organize your library. iTunes is nice, but I'm not going to sing its praises. It's a large program, requires you to also have QuickTime (uck) and uses up a good chunk of RAM. It is nice as it works as your browser for the iTunes music store, which I don't mind using. I have a hard time finding the kind of music I like, but recently they added some of Ayumi Hamasaki's music, so that was worth getting an iTunes card for. The cards themselves are nice, and I imagine much safer than using a credit card to buy music. iTunes does let you burn a CD so long as you have a burner drive on your computer. The first CD I burned played fine, though there is the ending of one song that has a really bad skip. I'd recommend burning your purchased songs onto a CD instead of just storing them on your computer and iPod. Just in case.   Overall, it's a handy device for playing music and cutting down on lugging around a case of CDs, but be wary of glitches. There's a lot of hype concerning iPods, and while I think some of it is earned and worthy, you may not need a model this large and as expensive. Do some research before you buy.

<Title>Very Nice
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a proud owner of a 30 GB ipod Video and so far its been great. Its not too big so it can be carried w/o any problems. The ear piece is nice and can get really loud. If your like me and own 100+ CD's and can not live with out them than this is for you. I put 9 GB of music in the first 2 weeks i had it. I really havent used the video but i will - ive been told you have to download a program that converts your videos so i will do that soon.    I have found iTunes to be really useful and easy to use. I am organized as it is and already had the songs on my computer organized and they transferred like that to my iPod.  One thing i found was that - when i first got it my brother placed 5GB of songs from his iTunes to my iPod, when i went to install iTunes on my computer and hooked up my iPod - it said it had to replace the songs in my iPod for my iTunes songs which was zero, so it cleared them and loaded the songs i placed.  JUST a few days ago i was charging my iPod thru my usb port on my laptop and found that the songs my brother put on my iPod are still there and can be played on my computer, but not on my iPod - infact my iPod doesnt even read the songs. Besides that it works fine and have had zero problems with it.    The only thing is that the battery life lasts up to 3-4 hours. The advertised 14 hours is only for standby battery life which it can do for about 10 hours.

<Title>Played 19 songs and  * D * I * E * D *  the FIRST day
<Date>Sun Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am absolutely furious and have returned the product for a replacement. I bought it on Saturday around lunch. Loaded a few over 1000 songs on it. That's what? 1/7th of advertised capacity? In any case, I'd decided on this model becuase I really won't listen to 20,000 songs in one day and didn't need the extra capacity. On Sunday, I played 12 songs and it froze up, then started playing again. I thought that was odd but okay, maybe it was just the song. On the 19th song, it froze. Forevermore. I sync'd it up and was told it was corrupted and I needed to RESTORE. I hit RESTORE and it said it couldn't find the source. Okay, so I spent that much money to listen to 19 songs??? And I've been assured that I should get a service agreement because it probably will have lots of these "frozen" moments after the first 30 days. Not that I'm happy at all with that answer, but IT FAILS within 24 hours?

<Title>Great Portable Device
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ipod is a great little device that plays back music and now plays back video. I think the video ipod does both of these task admirably, though watching a full lenght movie on this would be silly.   In regards to loading up your video ipod, I had no trouble loading all my music on the ipod. The only problem I've found is that the new itunes (7.0) doesn't load the album art that it finds onto your ipod. For example, itunes loads all your album art, but for that obscure Winger album, you may have to go to allmusic.com or amazon to find the actual album art. When you load your albums onto the ipod, the album art you personally loaded all makes it into the ipod, but the cover art that itunes finds for you doesn't. So you end up copying and pasting all the album art in yourself. Not a big deal, but kind of annoying.  In regards to video, I think this is a great playback device for short videos and TV shows. I don't think I'd want to load in a feature length movie on it, because you kind of are creened over watching that 2 1/2" screen. It looks great, but is'n't really meant to be watched for 2 or 3 hours.  The ipod comes fully functional, and you can accessorize it to your hearts content. Do you NEED a universal dock connector? Nah...but it's nice. Do you NEED another case? You don't need it, but it protects it better than the soft sleeve that it ships with. Do you NEED new headphones? Not necessarily, but it's probably wise to get some new ones.   I haven't had any problems with mine, and find it a great tool for the road.

<Content>I love this product. Owning over 2000 cds it really is easy to load music and play what I want, when and where I want. The software is excellent and the sound quality is great. Wish that it could rip directly from a CD, and having to charge it with the computer is a bit of a drag but does not offset my enthusiasm.     Optional outlet charger should be included as an incentive to buy the product. Apple could easily afford to do this. However, I am thrilled with how easy it is to use and carry around. Lose the tinny earbuds and upgrade to better hearing as soon as possible and you won't be disappointed that you did so.     I really recommend this 30 gig unit; it holds over 7,000 songs and you can edit music easily to change songs around should you have it fully loaded. Would recommend that you learn to manage your itunes manually as soon as practicable as it gives you the best controll over what you load into the unit.

<Title>Buy the Extended Warranty
<Date>Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My wife has a 3rd Gen iPod 40GB that has been returned for the hard drive crashing twice, fortunatly we bought the 3 year extended warranty.  This issues happened literally 3 days after the 1 year warranty expired, and after I bought the 30GB iPod video.  I am a runner that trains for marathons so I thought an iPod would be great for this type of activity since I sometimes run for more than 3 hours and listening to music makes the time go by much faster.  However, when an issue occurs 10 miles from home you can get very upset especially when now 2 of 2 iPods need to be serviced (remember 1 was over the 1 year warranty, and my new one was within the 1 year warranty).  Fortunately the service is quick (my wife's iPod that was sent back by Best Buy took two weeks, and mine that I went through the Apple online service took 4 days).  My iPod didn't have a hard drive crash but instead a click wheel failure meaning I couldn't turn on my iPod unless it was hooked to the computer and then couldn't do anything with it.  This is an issue that can't be fixed so you get a new or refurbished iPod.  The bad thing about the 1 year warranty is that if you have had the iPod for more than 6 months you pay $30 for shipping.  Upon researching the iPod issues I found out that the iPod is a bad choice for runners and I ended up buying a SanDisk 1GB MP3 player because it was rated the highest for runners due to not having a moving hard drive which reduces the potential for the disc to scratch or skipping.  All in all, I've had 2 iPods one for 3 days over 1 year and 1 for just longer than 6 months and both have had repair/replacement issues.  I'm not impressed.  Plus, no matter how convenient iTunes can be it can be more of a royal pain in the rear and Apple should really tell you that the program needs 512MB of RAM which means you need 1GB to keep your computer moving at a normal speed.  However, I am impressed with SanDisk and would highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in an MP3 player that doesn't already have one and it's ability to use whatever music service you desire to download music from, which is great if you like live music instead of just studio stuff.

<Title>Overrated
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hi,  My employer handed these out for the holidays.  The device is pretty neat, looks nice, and is reasonably user-friendly.  But this thing could be a lot better.  Some of my beefs: - If you "import" your mp3 collection into iTunes, everything gets entered twice, and the only way to fix is to wipe out your iTunes library. - This bug is not documented, but the secret is to drag your mp3 folder onto the iTunes window. - Okay, so when you hook up your iPod, the mp3s copy over, but a lot of the meta data get lost, and a lot of your mp3s are entirely inaccessible. - Even when the meta data is found in the iPod, things are still a mess.  I see multiple identically-named entries for an artist, ditto with albums, and then the tracks are unordered ... so, how does one enjoy the White Album? - If you connect the device under Linux, you can see the entire filesystem, but the "music library" is a whole bunch of xxxx.mp3 files all over a bunch of subdirectories ... bah, so you have to get more software. - The "killer app" imo is podcasting.  I tried a couple video podcasts, and much of the time videos that play fine within iTunes will lock up the iPod, which will go black for about 5 seconds, then return to the nav screen. - You can't always watch podcasts from the music->podcasts menu ... you have to navigate up to video->podcasts ... annoying, since a fair number of podcasts mix video in to their existing audio podcasts. - No iTunes store for Linux. - The interface LOOKs neat, but you can not seek very effectively, and if you hook this up to your car stereo, it is a real hassle to try to "skip" songs because as you feel your finger across the interface to figure out where to press, you're also adjusting the volume.  What is the point of a primarily-audio device if you have to /look/ at it to do a basic operation?  Were I in the market for a gadget of this nature, I would look at what the competition has to offer.  Apple get a lot of credit for innovation, but in terms of execution, you either do it their way or no way.  Cheers, -danny

<Title>Nice, but there are worms in this Apple
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Apple Ipod G5 is the latest personal audio/video system available from Apple. This latest version heavily plugs it's video abilities. With these units you can transfer downloads music and video to the Ipod and listen at your leisure. You may also download and watch TV and movies as well as video podcasts.  Here's what you need to know:  The Ipod is very small and thin and is available in black or white. Both versions are highly vulnerable to surface scratches to the point of being ludicrous. You will have to buy cover/case for the unit from day one. The software included is Itunes and it's a somewhat clumsy and dated chuck of software. Once you learn it you'll wonder that they couldn't make it more intuitive. It does work fine after you've mastered it and you can easily transfer CDs and downloaded music files to the Ipod.  Navigating the Ipod's simple menu system is used with a touch sensitive non-mechanical wheel. It works well, though it's a little to easy to make a wrong selection. Practice won't make perfect, but it works okay.  The screen is bright and has good resolution, better than other units currently out. Amazingly, Apple Quicktime and other common formats won't play on the Ipod. Apple wants to you spend 30 dollars on software to covert files for video playback. This bad business is easily solved since free software is available online to covert files. You may also connect the unit to a TV set for video quality that's worse than VHS tape, but serviceable, especially on smaller screens. Apple will try to sell you a cable for A/V output but any Mini to RCA stereo plug will work as will any camcorder mini to stereo/Video plug set. Apple switched one of the audio lines with the video to make people think they needed the Apple cable. Just find the Video line of the three and your done. Sorry Apple.  There's been a lot of complaints that Apple did not include the charger with the unit. I have to say that Apple should be ashamed and if I had not gotten this as a gift I'd never have bought it on that point alone.  The Ipod's audio quality is good, but not with the included ear buds which may or may not stay in your ears. I threw mine away. They are junk. A proper set of headphones will be a worthwhile purchase. There are no user EQ adjustments on the Ipod, only volume. Older folks who's hearing has frequency loss will be unable to adjust to suit them.  To summarize: The new Video Ipod is a stylish and useful player, but it is marred by lack of features and Apple's efforts to force owners to buy basic essentials that should have been in the box...such as a charger, cables and basic video software. Apple's attitude has kept me from being a fan of their products for many years and the Ipod, even as a gift, has proven to me that they continue to abuse their customer base while pushing style of substance.  Still, this IS a good player, once you buy the extras and it's fun to use. In spite of my complaints 4 out 5 stars.  Capt. RB

<Content>this is a amazing iPod i got one for christmas and the review will compare the iPod Photo with the iPod video  Memory:the 30 GB video is very capable in storage but video will take up more data and will limit the song & photo.  Battery:Apple claims that the video has longer battery life than the Photo but when you watch video it will wear down the battery faster than songs or photo slideshow.  video: (applies to iPod video only) many people will think  "oh i bet the video won't be very good i'll wait for a later version" THINK AGAIN! the video capability is as good as a TV exept of course a smaller screen.  Thinness: if you took the photo and just cut it in half that would be the iPod video thinness.  Accessories: i recommend getting a case immediatly and a cable (that i do not no the name of) will connect the iPod to your TV  that concludes the review my take is buy it.  but if you buy it from [...] you can laser engrave your iPod

I love my ipod!  However, the first 30GB video ipod i owned, which i received just before Christmas 05, came defective and I had to return it to the electronics store from which it was purchased whose name I will not provide:-) That's why I gave it 4 stars, because I expected my electronic wonder to work, and that problem sort of pissed me off.  Also, the earbuds don't fit in my ears but that's a personal issue i think; not wholly Apple's deal!  2nd time around my ipod works like a dream and I truly love all of its great features...sound quality, visual quality, etc etc.  So if you are shopping around for mp3 players, and you want all the best features and not to mention good looks an mp3 player can offer, and don't mind dropping 300 bucks for those features, ipod is calling your name!!  In the world of mp3 players, I love my Benz and you will too:-D

<Content>We bought two of these, and less than two weeks later, my son took his back!  The iPod kept making a 'clunking' sound, and we kept trying to resolve it on Apple.com, nothing helped.  Then finally yesterday, it just stopped working.  It would play the music already on, but anytime we plugged it in, it wasn't detected.   After following all the directions from Apple, we finally took it back.  My son is keeping the money for now, and thinking about whether or not to try to invest in one again.  The guy who handled our return, said he had had problems with his as well and had had to exchange it. Seems to me, that in the rush to meet Christmas demand, their quality might not be what it should be.

<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My first encounter with an Ipod occurred when I got a third generation Ipod, which faithfully withstood my harsh abuse for a full 18 months. I recieved the 30 gig video version as a Christmas gift, and have been impressed so far.   Since im probably one of the least tech saavy people around, i hope to keep it basic. This ipod plays video, as well as having an excessive storage for songs and pictures. Coming from an ipod with the four buttons across the wheel, im still adjusting to using the wheel for all of the commands. Howeve, after downloading the first season of Law and Order, the only complete season of such programming, the video quality impressed me greatly, especially for such a small screen. Overall, i think this is a highly recommended item.   However, the small issues im having, other than adjustong to the wheel (which has decreased in size, to my dismay, since i have hands that are on the bigger side). I should add that everyone i know who has an ipod has freezing up problems, but that seems to go away after regular use and regular full draining and recharging of the battery. The video likes to freeze up occasionally, which falls into the previous sentence. I recommend that you shouldnt fast forward or skip through massive quantites of video for more than 5-8 seconds, if that, at a time.   great piece of machinery, seems to have improved loads.

<Title>All you could wish for in a portable media device
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved the 30g ipod video for christmas this year, and I am quite impressed with it. I must say I'm a bit confused by some of the negative reviews on here. One person complained about the low battery life for video playback, but even on the box Apple only says it can do about 2 hours of video playback, which is accurate. Of course we all wish it could play video for longer, as it renders long movies pretty much unwatchable, but its not as if Apple had decieved us all on this point. As for the battery in general, it does seem that it goes for less than the 14 hours promised on the box but really it all depends on how much you make the screen light up. If you're someone like me who is always toggling through the songs looking for the next one to pick, the life will drain faster, but if I just made a 10 hour playlist and let the thing play without touching it I have confidence that it would run for the entire time. So basically it's up to your individual use. Even if you light up the screen constantly it goes for a good 5-8 hours.  Another complaint I saw in one review was that the reviewer had difficulty putting his mp3s on the ipod and organizing them. I highly suggest you ignore complaints of this nature because they speak more towards the competency of the reviewer than the competency of the device. Everything you need for organizing your ipod is easily done through itunes. Now it can often be time-consuming to go through the library deleting doubles or editing song info, but by no means is it difficult or undoable. Everything is very user-friendly and once you get the hang of it it shouldn't be a problem.  For the people who complained about their ipod being faulty or not working properly, there's really nothing I can say to defend that other than that you can return it and get a new one. Some people might end up getting shafted with a dysfunctional one, and I know that can be frustrating, but believe me, they're not all like that, and if you have the patience to return it for one that works properly you can enjoy the benefits of an ipod video.  Other people complain about the earbuds. Now I don't listen to rap music so I can't really say how they are for that type of stuff, but to me they are of acceptable quality. The sounds comes through loud and clear, I guess some more options for sound equalization would be nice but I don't really think there's much to complain about in this area. They aren't the best, but they're good enough in my opinion. This point of course is debatable and you may want to get new earphones with your ipod, but I don't think that should be enough to stop you from getting one.  The video quality of the screen is quite good actually, I was impressed by it. When I first heard of the ipod video I questioned whether watching video on a 2.5 inch screen could even be enjoyable, but it has good resolution and quality and I absolutely love being able to watch video on the go. 20 minute bus rides go by in the blink of an eye when you're watching your favorite episode of the Simpsons. As someone had previously stated Apple wants you to pay an extra $30 for the file converter for videos, which I agree is lame, but not really an issue given that similar software is available for free download on the internet.  Probably my favorite thing about the ipod however is that it allows me to keep all my music in one place. I have about 15-20 gigs worth of music on mine that in CD form would take up a couple of those huge CD booklets, but now it's all in one small, convenient place, and I love being able to switch freely between artists without having to switch CDs or anything. I think 30 gigs is a good size, it allows me to have all my music (which is quite a lot) as well as about 100 episodes of different TV series. Also being able to purchase indivudual songs on the itunes store (and discounted full albums) is very convenient.   There is one complaint that I do have, something which has been mentioned in many other reviews, and that is that the ipod does scratch VERY easily. Mine has some minor scuffing on it just from me cleaning it! No scratches, mind you- nothing that renders the screen unwatchable or anything, but if it scuffs that easily I can imagine it doesn't take much to scratch it. If you don't just buy a third-party case for it make sure you NEVER put it in your pocket or anywhere like that without the white case thats included. The case included is crappy in that you can't watch video while its in the case, but I am very glad they included at least something to stop it from getting scratched while you carry it around, and it succeeds in that regard. Another reviewer mentioned a product that eliminates scratches and scuffs from the ipod, I don't know much about it but it would probably be worth looking into. The only other negative thing I have to say about the ipod is that they should have included the outlet charger and not just the USB charger, but I guess they were trying to keep the product costs down or something.  All in all I love my ipod video. If you are the type of person who loves music and movies/TV shows this product is perfect because it allows you to take those things with you wherever you go. It's extremely easy to use and does everything that it advertises. Watching video on it is better than you would think, and I can't even begin to tell you how convenient it is for me to have all my music in one place. I guess for those who already own previous incarnations of the ipod this is less of selling point as they already have all their music on that device, and for those people I guess I would only really recommend this product to those who wanted the video playing capability. But if you don't already have an Mp3 player or are intrigued by the possibility of video playback, I would highly suggest getting the ipod video. Most of the complaints in these reviews seem like they could be resolved by getting more experience with how it works and handling it with care. All things considered I think this is without a doubt the top of the line when it comes to portable media devices and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>This is perfect for anyone who wants to be sent into fits of rage on a regular basis.  Operating it is counter-intuitive, the brochure tells you nothing, and even the counter-intuitive moves are not CONSISTENT.  So you scroll down to go up MOST of the time, but not ALL of the time.  You click Menu, and you never get anything remotely resembling a Menu. You call the toll free number and get a snotty jerk who refuses to help you.  I'm going to return mine and have a lot more fun hitting myself in the head with a hammer.

<Title>Great player in almost every aspect
<Date>Sun Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have a 30gb ipod. It is kind of expensive but i got mine for 90$ with the student discont because my brothers in college(we bought a mac). At first i had my issues, like the battery lasted and hour with music and it wouldnt let me put videos on it. I brought it back to the apple store and they didn't do much, later we found out we had to talk to a mac genious to exchange it, so we did. With my new one i have had no problems. I think that everyone should get an ipod not an mp3 player. Some mp3's are OK but theres a certain thing about the ipod that makes it the best. In my opinion there is two things neccesary for your ipod, 1 a case i bought the incase leather sleeve and it's been alright, the clck wheel protector slow it down. My guidlines for a case are to not scratch it, and to have a clear plastic screen protecor. Some people like click wheeel protectors but i dont thats your call. 2 the wall charger, it makes it so much easier to be able to charge it on an outlet, i think it should be included. Overall the iPod 30gb is great a must but for shoppers!

<Title>Thinking different is cool, Apple iPod is not.
<Date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I sincerely hope iPods have improved...  I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.   That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).   I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time.

<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this iPod about 4 months ago.  I had it for 10 days and the hard drive malfunctioned.  Apple arranged to have it picked up and a new one was sent to me within 2 weeks.  The service process was not a big hassle but it was very disappointing that I had problems with the iPod.  Since then, the iPod has been working great and it is definitely very easy to use.  It is irritating to only be able to use iTunes, but it is not that often needed to synchronise with it.  I have loaded 25 GB of songs on the iPod one time and have not used iTunes since.

<Title>Truth from an actual owner.
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been iPod user for the past 3 years. Since I recieved my first 20gb 3G iPod for Christmas one year.  I have never used such a well built device. Load music and go. After searching and searching for an application that can store my music well, easy to manage, and be usable with actual devices I couldn't be happier.  I have used Winamp for years and years.. so bulky, unreliable and way too basic. iTunes has definitely helped a lot. A lot of stubborn reviewers on here complain about having to use iTunes to manage your music.. grow up. If you bought an iPod, you knew what you were getting into.  The entire time I had my 3G iPod, it locked up once when I was at an airport. Never happened again.  And as of last year I bought a brand new Black 5G iPod and now am a Macintosh user myself and couldn't be happier. With the release of iTunes 7 and the brand new 2.1 upgrade for the iPod firmware, i'm still very excited about using this device.  I don't know exactly what you people are expecting from MP3/Media players.. but you're expecting something way too much. As of 2001 we had either a few choices or no choices of media players to use. You had to either carry around a ton of CDs to listen to your choice of music.. listen to it in your car stereo.. or not listen at all. Media players in general are a godsend for music lovers, such as myself, or anyone else for that matter. Being able to carry around thousands (in my case, over 5000 mp3s and still have 7gb to spare on the iPod's harddrive), and using a simple click wheel to go to the song and play it, nothing could be easier.  People review this device and give it lower scores because what it doesn't have. I can't quite understand that. If you're not satisfied with what it has, THEN DON'T BUY IT. You have a choice, you can read exactly what the device does before you buy it.. so there is no need to say "ohh it doesn't have a Radio (which the new 5G iPods do so i don't know why people still complain), it doesn't have voice recording, it can't do this or that"... then why did you buy it?! Sheesh. Most people on here that buy one are the true users, who shop around, learn what it has to offer and buy it based on those facts. But many on here buy one just because everyone else is using one and they don't want to be left out. It works for the cell phone industry too. People buy certain phones because someone else has it, and they find out they don't even want it.  And I can guarantee, from a person in the Tech and 3D industry, most of the problems encountered by users are 95% user error. There may be that 5% error that is true, and needs to be dealt with.. But 95% of the time, it's because the user does not know what they are doing. Simple as that.

<Title>Here's a few negatives
<Date>Tue Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Of course all you know why this is such a hot player.  I give it 3 stars because of the "cool factor" and the ability to store every song I own on such a small device.  But here are some glaring faults: (1) The battery life is minimal (even playing music).  It runs out after 3 trips to the gym (total usage time about 4 hours).  Then I have to hook it up to my computer to charge it.  I'm playing MP3s at 256K so maybe the songs are eating up processor time.  I'm also planning on creating playlists on my PC so I spend less time with the screen on. (2) Sound Output.  The earbuds sound bad compared to the headset that came with my $40 CD walkman.  This may just be the difference between the over-the-ear headset vs. earbuds.  Then I plugged it into my high end headset, and the power is too low to drive the headset.  Again, my $40 CD Walkman did fine here.  Dissapointing for a device that should produce CD quality music. (3) There are about 29 Equalization settings, but no way to simply adjust treble and bass manually.  Maybe this is picky, but why add all those settings but no manual setting? ---> Bottom line, if you aren't picky about high fidelity, and you plan on charging the player every night, then get one!!

<Title>Overrated and Overpriced
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the very first mp3 player that ever came out. I have owned dozens of them since then, but never an IPOD. All Apple has done is to popularize the idea by lavish marketing and advertising. I suppose I am a purist, but this product was made for newbies. If you aren't a newbie, you wouldn't bother with it. My latest mp3 player is an RCA Lyra jukebox. It holds 20 gb of music, video, pictures, and/or computer data. The screen is about 4 times the size of the video IPOD's and movies look great on it. I paid $350 for it a year ago. I rarely watch movies on it, but always take it with me to the gym for the music. The only problem with it is that it's not easy to use. I have extensive experience with the devices, so I can cope, but even I don't know everything there is to know about it. But, I know enough. I guess my whole point is that if you're willing to do the research and learn more about audio and video compression technologies (in other words, become a geek like me), there are better products out there that'll do what you want with them for less money. What you're really paying for when you buy an IPOD is all the advertising Apple has wasted its money on by overmarketing its products.

<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have only come to the world of iPod recently and, I admit, somewhat reluctantly.  I started with a Nano which I have been very happy with. Recently it occured to me that an iPod 5G could serve very nicely as an external backup drive so I immediately ordered one (can you spell "Business Expense"?)   Here is what I love about my iPod:  1) Beauty 2) Clear, crisp, large display for videos 3) Got to love that click wheel interface 4) iTunes, the best software bundled with an MP3 player that I've seen. 5) Great battery life... this thing will last through a full day of travel. 6) 30GB is enough to back up just about everything on my laptop! 7) The ear buds that come with this iPod are actually very nice, comfortable, stay in my ears (thats the big one!) and have good sound. 8) Equalizer, I got my rock and roll sound goin on! 9) I love the clock feature, I setup all the time zones that I could want with a separate clock; from Hawaii thru Florida. 10) I downloaded my calendar and contacts from Outlook so now my reminders show up on the iPod, how cool is that! 11) I love rating my songs as I listen to them on the iPod; lets face it I'm a ratings-aholic!  Now you may be wondering, why didn't I give this baby 5 stars?  1) Where are the accessories? you might as well tack on an extra $100 to the price of this for the accessories you will need to buy: AC adapter ($30), case ($30), etc... 2) I get frustrated with the fact that I have to plug this thing into a computer to do anything with it. At the very least I would like to be able to delete songs. And why can't I modify playlist settings and stuff like that? 3) You better just buy a case for this before you even take it out of the box, and even with my case on it I see it is getting scratched. 4) I'm a little miffed with Apple that they sabotaged my favorite player (MusicMatch) so it won't work with the iPod :( At least my Rhapsody can talk to it...  You've been warned, now get on out there and buy yourself one of these puppies. I vote the iPod Video my favorite business expense of the year!

<Title>Brilliant piece of technology
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased the 30gig video ipod in black.  When I first saw the new ipop I couldn't believe how crisp and clear the screen was.  It is a bright, crisp, and beautiful display that is a marvel.  Although a little small, watching movies and pictures on this thing is amazing, to be honest.  Videos play perfectly and look beautiful.  I had never owned an Ipod before, but I can see what all the hype is about.  There is so much thought put into its design and functionality.  You can store appointments, set up an alarm clock, keep a contact list, use this as a "flash drive" if you wish.  And of course, as a music player the Ipod is incredible.  The sound quality is amazing, and the beautiful screen shows album covers, lyrics, etc.  The scroll wheel makes cycling through songs a breeze.  The cons have been stated in other reviews.  Short battery life for videos and not enough accessories are included.  Scratches fairly easily but it never effects the screen itself.  To sum up, this is an absolutely brilliant piece of technology.  Apple has amazed me, and I carry this little thing around with me everywhere I go.

<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The near religious fervor with which so many of Apple's customers embrace its overpriced, under featured products would be amusing if it were not so sad.   Apple Fan Boy (AFB):  Dude you don't get it - look at how cool the styling of this thing is.  Person with IQ above room temperature (IQ): True it is good looking but the first thing one has to do when they buy any of Apple's Ipod's is go out and immediately cover it with a $30 sheet of plastic (thereby eliminating its acetic characteristics) or it will look like a scratched up dumpster within a week.  Cost of product now up to $330  AFB:  People like you just hate Apple because of its cutting edge technology and styling.  The other MP3 makers only copy Apple.   IQ:  Apple was neither first to market with an MP3 player nor a mobile video device.   On top of that Apple does not even provide decent features - most glaringly the lack of a radio receiver.   AFB:   Dude that just shows how lame you are Apple knows that real people want to control their own music and not have it thrust upon them by the man like corporate radio dj's.  IQ:  Oh really - then why has Apple just announced a $50 "accessory" that does little more than provide FM radio reception, a feature that just about every other MP3 player provides for free.   Moreover - Apple is the quintessential "Man" as it is charging you extra for features such as FM radio and charge cords that just about everyone else gives away for free.  Cost of product now $590 when a $10 power cord and $50 radio remote is added.   AFB:  Maybe you have a point but the Ipod is also a status symbol, making me cool by association.  IQ:   So did the hula hoop for awhile. When every grade school kid in America is carrying around the same overpriced, under featured, prone to damage product its status a status symbol is well on its way toward becoming its opposite., namely a symbol that one is part of a great gullible unthinking herd.  AFB: But Apple has iTunes which is the best music purchasing service in the world.  IQ:  Sure it is - that's why when you buy a video or song there it will only play on their devices.  Would you buy a movie DVD or music CD if it would only play on a Sony DVD player?  Of course not, but people like lemmings buy iTunes that effectively lock them in to buying only Apple products forever- if that isn't a great business model I don't know what is.  By the way that's probably also why they don't provide a radio for free because they want you to spend even more on songs.  Cost of product now unquantifiable.    IQ Summary:  Music and video portability is great.  But buying an exceedingly delicate over priced under featured product is not.   If MP3 players are for the mobile lifestyle then buy a product that can stand up to abuse and one that doesn't cost so much so if you lose or damage it - it won't break you.   Better yet buy a book instead.

<Title>The Apple Bubble
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hello typical american idealists. You have allowed yourselveS to be sucked into apple's bubble. They knew you guys weren't going to think out of the box and were going to think, "wow iPod is the only mp3 player out there, and i just love it, nothing else of this sort exists in pretty little apple La'La land." WELL GUYS, GUESS WHAT, YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF OTHER OPTIONS. SUCH AS DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYERS LIKE THE CREATIVE ZEN VISION:M WITH 4 HOURS OF VIDEO BATTERY LIFE COMPARED TO THE WEAK AND EMBARRASSING 1 1/2 HOURS OF YOUR YAY-IM-COOL-NOW-BECAUSE-I-HAVE-WHAT-EVERY-OTHER-BOY-AND-GIRL-HAS 5G IPOD. did you know that there are players out there such as the archos av 500 (ya, search it on google) that actually record shows from your tv just like tivo, and let you take these shows wherever you want. Yes people of america, there are other options. dont be trapped with a player that scratches easily, has WHAT?!?!? no fm tuner, horrible battery life, and a fragile screen...oh man apple really screws you guys over...."no, they will always be soo narrow minded, so we can just sell them junk" go with other players and buy yourself the ultimate entertainment source PLEASE PEOPLE JUST THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR ONCE.

<Title>Basically a music player
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Biggest disappointment is that you cannot manipulate / edit / rename photos neither in iTunes nor in Windows Expplorer. Also, when data is stored on iPod by using it as external hard disk, you have no access to it from iPod even if it is music, photos or videos. I believe it is doable. Some much cheaper gadgets on the market can do it.

<Content>Do NOT buy the iPod; The iPod works as advertised; iTunes works flawlessly with it, of course since they where made for each other.  Copying CD's to the iPod was easy and movies too.  I had to use third party software to convert movies to it but it worked just fine.  Do I like the iPod, yes I do!  Would I have made another choice, yes I wish I would have!  I looked at the Zen M Vision and decided to go with iPod, after all my friends have Apple MP3 players, they helped me with it.  The problem with iPods is that if you want to download purchased music, you can only do it via iTunes.  This is a monopoly.  You cannot download from Wal-mart or Yahoo or any one else in the world and make it work on the iPod, again they have a monopoly on this.  Yahoo offers unlimited downloads to your portable device for less than $10 dollars U.S. per month, not good on the iPod, good on every other device you can imagine.  So if you want to fit in the crowd and have the white device with the white ear phones and be stuck with a company that is not flexible and dictates to you who you can purchase music from then, go ahead and buy the iPod, other wise be free to choose from anyone else and download from anyone to any device, that IS the American way.

<Date>Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod video rocks. I can play music and watch my videos on it and stuff. I am a very busy kid and keep up with the times cuz i m always moving around and stuff. I travel a lot so i use the ipod as my personal pda. I use the notes and contacts features to keep up with my mails and to know any number of any friends that i want to contact at anytime whatsoever. I love that it plays video cuz my little sister is always buggin me so i let her watch my videos with the help of the ipod lock which keeps it tied up to my desk so that she doesn't lose it. It is awesome, the only things that suck about this is that it scratches 2 easily so before u buy this item, make sure u buy a case first. That is what i did and my ipod is still in mint condition. It totally rocks. I read my email, call friends, and listen to music. I really love the item because of the maximum of 30 gb of music and photos. I use it to back up my computer photos because priceless family portraits can't be restored in case ur computer crashes. This would be a great backup hard drive and a great music player.   Keep it real,  Eddy

<Title>Not for everyone, but I love it
<Date>Wed Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The size and weight of an iPod is impressive, as is the audio and video quality (especially for such a small screen).  The availability of accessories is unparalleled, and iPods are rather easy to use.  I have a 30GB model (free from my employer), and my only regret is not getting the 60GB model, which in addition to being twice as big packs better battery performance.  I wouldn't recommend buying an iPod for watching videos all that often, as the battery life is quite limited when watching videos (2hrs at most), but short 5-10 minute clips won't kill the battery, and they're fun to watch.  I listen to mine all day at work and all the time in my car, and if I ever had to give it back to my employer, I'd have to run out and get one to avoid withdrawals--this time a 60GB model.  I say not for everyone, and all I mean by that is that some people would prefer to have some selection as to where they can buy music (such as a subscription service where you can have an unlimited # of songs), which I'd agree with if I didn't already have a large collection of MP3s, which makes the whole music store issue moot for me.

<Title>Best Gift I've Ever Gotten
<Date>Thu Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a music junky and now I'm hooked on itunes. The clarity is unbelievable and even with the worst headphones, music is presented at its best.  The screen seems a little small at first, but once your eyes adjust, the display is multi-dimensional and very clear.  I travel often and laptops are sometimes cumbersome.  I have all of my contacts, photos, videos, tv shows and music in the palm of my hand.  The unit is built strong and you dont have to pamper it.  I mean if you haven't named it [ IDA ] and if you're not buying fashionably colored skins, socks and butterfly outfits for it ***smile***The battery is not too demanding for recharging. This is one product that I honestly have no complaints!!!

<Title>A very satisfied iPod user...
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had the 30 GB iPod Video for 6 months now and am extremely happy with it.  Pros: Slim, cool looking. Great resolution screen. Easy to use menu's on the iPod. The iTunes software is also fairly easy to use. Video resolution is great. Battery life when just listening to music is satisfactory. In my case, the black casing did NOT scratch easily - as other reviewers have complained. My iPod still looks as good as new.   Cons: 1)Can only be recharged by hooking up to a computer. For the price you pay, Apple should have been generous enough to throw in a regular recharger. 2) iTunes software does not allow you to convert your videos to .mp4 format (there is software out there for this purpose, but you have to purchase them seperately). 3) iTunes has an EXTREMELY WEIRD way of saving your mp3 files. It automatically saves them with its own file names, meaning that were you to go into your iTunes folder, and search for songs without using your iTunes software - this would virtually be impossible. 4) Battery life when watching video's isn't great - so if you're planning a long trip - find a way to recharge.   Overall: A fairly good mp3 player -- especially when compared to the competitors. It's a shame that Apples is stingy with the accessories, and they need to fix up the software a little. I would definitely recommend the Apple iPod - but I hope that Apple takes note and improves what is as of now a fairly decent product.

<Title>Not Worth It
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod video gets scratched so easily that it ruins the whole point of portability. I purchased my first video and it got scratched the same day by placing it gently in my silicon case. So i returned it and got a new one at a different store. I purchased a leather case for it and the screen protector on the scratched my ipod. By placing it in your pocket it will get scratched. What is the point of a mp3 player you cannot carry around with you because of the fear of getting it damaged?  An ipod is a nice accesory but you do not need it and do not believe the hype. When I purchased it I felt no different than when I got it. I thought I need it because I have a 6000+ song collection, but I don't. The worse purchase I ever made, and the biggest waste of money out there. I believe it is delicate so that people worship their ipods, and think about them 24/7. I am no longer part of the ipod fad, and I beg of humanity to longer be to.

<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Can't tell how disappointed I am to see plenty of micro scratches on my iPod video! Paid $317 for the damn thing and can't stomach the scratches! Have a strategy.. will order for an aluminium-polystyrene case and then return this one. When the next piece arrives it will go right into this case.  I am surprised how could an expensive product be released with such a glitch! Grow up Apple! elase let "intel" handle your exteriors too!  By the way I was reading that the HDD is Samsung, Power management is Philips, Video chip is some other make(can't remember)... battery and display are yet another(unknown so far) so the exterior is the only stuff actually done by Apple and that's where the new ones need to improve... or is it? The wheel is too and it's superb so all apple needs to do is fix this lil problem and also give out a GOOD cover with this iPod too.

<Title>I like my mini better, to be honest
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Video iPod roughly four days ago. I already own an ipod-a year-old first gen ipod mini, blue.  The blue mini has a battery life of 6 hours-it is the older of the two minis ever made.  It has survived me owning it for a year, and this is why I was impressed with Apple.  I mean, any gadget that can survive being thrown in a fit of rage, being dropped out of a car or the 4 degree freezing cold days of Logan, Utah, is well worth your time.  And for all the abuse its suffered, it only has a few minor dings, none on the screen, and a minor hard drive problem where the ipod no longer recognizes that it has played a song in a playlist and will repeat the song and omit other songs.  My cell phone has not held up as well.   Well, then, I get this thing.  There was the initial oh ah, this is sooo cool feeling of just opening it. It was fine and scratch free until I left the house go to a restaurant. I then put it in my hoodie's front pocket alongside my ipod mini, and wouldn't you know, the cotton hoodie and the other ipod caused this thing to scratch!  Three people besides myself handled the ipod at the restaurant, each of us handling it with care, and it scratches even more!  In the space of a few hours, it is looking like my ipod mini did when it was over two months old.  Already showing age, and it has hardly been used!  Luckily I saw a kit at the school store, a clear film that you can put on the ipod that prevents scratches.  I bought that-it cost $10.50 without tax-and applied it to the ipod.  Now I am able to listen to it and download all my songs to it, as well as over 2000 photos I have taken.  The "up to 20 hours battery life" only applies to listening to music, backlight off.  This thing is not like my ipod mini-you need the backlight on for at least a little while because the screen is in color.  Next, when you view the photos, or do a photo slideshow, the battery instantly drains to almost empty.  When looking at my photo collection, the best the battery has fared has been four hours-the same battery life of my mini.  When listening to music, the record battery life has been ten hours.  I have never gotten the 20 hour battery life that is advertised by Apple.    This thing may look sleek and play very nice, plus it holds all my music and photos-but it does have its drawbacks. Between the mini and the video ipod, well, the mini fares better. For those of you who already own an ipod-one of the older ones, most of your gear-all the gadgets that work with ipods with the extra jack on the top-will not work with this one.  And thus far, I have not seen any suitable replacements.  I cannot currently play this ipod in my car.  It is a nice investment, but from my angle as the owner of two ipods, this is the lesser of the two.  You will want to have more than the advertised sticker price if you plan on buying this, because you will need a case to protect this particular ipod.    3 stars (shown as four above)    P.S. I have not used this ipod's video capabilities yet.

<Title>Not what I thought it to be....
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the first Ipod I bought, and I also have an older style Creative zen touch.  First let me say that this is a pretty nice product, but it is WAY to flimsy.  This product is not durable, I've only had it about a month and there are scratches all over it (though I keep in the case most of the time), and if I press on the bottom it makes a clicking noise (not from the wheel)  For the ups  First, I was really excited to get a smaller skinnier player, because the creative one is NOT skinny at all (thing is freakin huge).    Second I love the 2.5" screen, it is very pretty  Third, I love that it can play videos.  Now for the things I don't like...  I HATE the itunes program, it may be my computer (p4, 2.6gh, 1.5gb ram) but it is extremely choppy and takes forever to load the music store (I run dsl, not dialup)  Second, the thing scratches SO easily, I've been lucky and the screen doesn't look all that bad, but the rest is another story. (its from going into my pocket, I usually keep the case on but not always)  All though I do know I have to be more careful.  Third, I'm sure the little clicking on the bottom is just my model, but it sure does bug me.  And yes it has been there since i bought it.  Fourth, I can't use the videos on my computer without buying quick time pro, and I just wasted $300 so I am a little short on money right now, looks like the free podcasts will have to do until i find an alternate way.  Fifth, I couldn't beleive it, but the sound quality actually sucked compared to my zen touch.  Even with the EQs the same, the creative still sounded better.  That is what I think, I wish I would've invested into a better player, but I thought this was supposed to be the best.  Though I do like it, I think I would've been happier with a newer creative product.

It locks up and looses it's mind like a Windows product (God Forbid :-)  and it scratches if you breathe on it.  I like the mini my son had much better as far as functionality.  The thing has a terrible time staying in sync with Itunes.  Maybe a software update in the future will solve some of the problems we are experiencing.....that sounds familiar doesn't it?  LOL

<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are tons of reviews here and by the time you get to mine you will have read the same garbage. i'll make it quick:  pro's 30gb is more space than you realize the screen and picture resolution is decent sleek design, yadda yadda yadda portability etc  con's the battery life is not 20 hours. I would reccomend purchasing an external battery charger or something of that nature because you can't carry a computer with you when your ipod dies.  itunes has the potential to be a good program, but if you like to do things manually, it is going to give you a problem. and heaven forbid if you want to delete a song from a "smart" playlist. yes, a 5 year old can operate it, but it leaves a lot to be desired...especially when uploading songs from cd's. if you have a compilation or anything that is not an original album be prepared to manually name the tracks.  the only feasible way to upload video is to convert it using quicktime pro...and who wants to pay for that after spending $300+ ???

<Content>There are a lot of good mp3s out there but this is one is really good i tell you.  Although it is highly unlikely that any thing is gonna be 100% good in all catagorys to ill make a list of goods and bads. -Pros- Very high quality music, unlike my last mp3 Plays AAC format (a high quality and space saving audio format) Small- fits in the pocket easily Easy setup (read the starters guide!! essential! do not start without it!) Nice bright backlight with butifull color screen Fun click wheel Other good extras like timer, date, time, a few games, and contacs (load from computer)  -Cons- Does not come with very good accessories (but im judjing the ipod not the accessories) SCRATCHES TO EASILY (in other words i suggest a tunewear case) because it is essential Claims it has 12 hours of battery and i get 6 hrs  Not very good instruction manual (buy a dummies book with it)     Ok with that said good.  -NOTE TO PARENTS- if you are buying this for your kid (like my dad did) expect to spend $400 instead of $300 because of accessories and itunes the accessories that your kid might want and that i diddent get are: A dock for ipod, better headphones ect ect. ok g2g see ya Ps. please say this review was helpfull Thanks lots, Andrew T

<Title>Best iPod Yet
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For me, this iPod replaced a 10GB, first generation model. Thin and light, with plenty of battery life for a normal day's worth of listening, this thing is light years ahead of my beloved old music player. I wasn't sure I'd use them, but all of the extra little software tweaks have made this thing a much more powerful pocket jukebox.  The video feature makes it a great travelling companion; as an iPod slips easily into any carry-on bag and can sit on your seat back tray table right next to the little plastic cup they give you. The screen is bright and clear, and watching it from close proximity -- like in an airplane seat or on an elliptical trainer at the gym -- I might as well be watching a normal sized TV. Sound quality is excellent, giving you a convincingly immersive viewing experience.  My only wishes:  1. Longer battery life for video - they promise two hours, and that's about what you get.  2. More scratch-resistant faceplate - I have a black one, and the complaints aren't exaggerated. Even when kept in a case, any speck of dust can cause tiny but visible scratches.

<Title>An object of desire
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This iPod is a beautiful product. The design is elegant, the construction solid, the feel of it in your hand smooth and strong. Apple understands very well that functionality alone doesn't sell, that a product should appeal to the passions and the senses, not just the mind.  The functionality of this product is extraordinary. Its capacity is usually described in terms of the number of songs it can hold. Consider it another way: I've stored over 100 hours of music on my iPod (enough to fill every waking moment for six days), 500 photos and a movie, and still I haven't used even half its 30GB storage capacity. The screen is sharp and the pictures look beautiful on it. I wouldn't bother watching a movie on a screen so small - I loaded one onto my iPod simply because I could. The sound of the music when played over regular speakers is as good as a CD player would provide. The battery life when I just listen to music is very good, though at about ten hours, not close to the theoretical maximum advertised. That's probably because one occasionally changes the volume or hunts for a different play list thus turning on the screen, a real power hog. It recharges quickly. The iTunes software that's included updated the version on my Mac with no problem, as I expected, but I haven't tried putting it on my PC, where my expectations are lower.  On the down side, while this device is smooth and sensual to the touch, it ends up a smudged mess. It demands a case, but this adds bulk and takes away from the joy of holding and looking at the thing. I can't say how easily the screen scratches because I've assiduously avoided scratching mine, but I wish I didn't feel the need to take quite so much care to avoid marring it. The case that comes with it is pathetic and the ear-buds are inadequate, though not entirely a joke. The fact that the batteries can't be replaced by the user (and that Apple charges $60 for that service) is deplorable, but that's a tradeoff one makes for the seamless design.    The iPod isn't the cheapest way to listen to high quality music on a digital device, nor is it the smallest. Very few people are likely to need even half its storage capacity. There are more cost-effective personal music players out there, some with better features, some better made. The iPod uses a hard-drive to store music, so it isn't as good for people who listen on the go as some flash-memory devices are. All that said, the iPod is beautiful. There are some good, rational reasons to choose it over much of its competition, but one buys it just because one wants it, not because one is a rational utility maximizer. In the end, it's an object of desire.

<Title>Awesome advanced technology
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my ipod (30 GB) today as a birthday present.  Not supposed to open it yet, but was forced to by none other than a parental unit.  I handled it very gingerly, it fingerprints easily, but it has a plastic cover layer over the front.  I suggest leaving it on until you find a good case for it.  The ipod comes with .. an ipod!  And headphones, and headphone covers, hard to put on, a disc for itunes and quicktime, the most updated ones, a usb dock sort of thing, usb connection cable, and the instruction manual or course.  Unfortunately, when I plugged it into the computer, it immediately put in all of the songs on my itunes library.  This annoyed me, because some of the songs on it sucked that itunes gave me.  There is a simple solution, you have to go into edit and then preferences.  Go to ipod, and then check the only selected songs box.  Then update your ipod, and only the songs you choose will pop up.  I also had a video on itunes, and I of course put that on the ipod.  I wasn't expecting the quality to be that good with a 2 and a half inch screen, but it came out like a plasma screen.  the sound quality is amazing, on the songs and videos.  As for putting movies on the ipod; Apparentlym itunes is going to release a movie section for your ipod.  But, for those impatient people like me who don't want to wait, there is a program called "DVD encryptor"  just type that into google, it's a free download.  Then when you pop a DVD into your CPU, the DVD encryptor thing immediatly pops up, and just follow the instructions, and it'll convert it into itunes.  The ipod already has a section for movies, so just go there.  I never really spend much time for podcasts, but when I do, they work great.  I fully recommend this ipod, considering how Amazon will save you $40 on taxes and original prices, compared to best buy, circuit city etc.  However, it will fingerprint and scratch extremely easily, so I recommend buying a case beforehand, or getting one almost immediatly.  Happy listening

<Content>I've had my iPod video for a few months now and I'm still just as pleased with it as I was on the day I purchased it.  The new matieral definitely scratches more easily, so before you use it too heavily, buy a case. I bought a hard plastic Agent18 and it's working wonderfully for me.  Is the video feature overhyped? Maybe a little bit. If you travel a lot by mass transportation, it's a huge plus. I'm on a sports team, and we often have to take rides of over an hours on a school bus, so it helps to have my Desperate Housewives during that time. ;) One thing I would do if I were Apple is to add an option to turn the backlight off during Videos -- when the sun is shining right on the screen, the backlight only interferes, and without it you could save battery life. The quality of video is good enough, though, and I use the feature enough to justify the $299.  The battery life is adequate. Other MP3 players on the market can undoubtedly beat Apple in this area, but if you buy a car charger and a wall charger (try the Belkin Powerpack for iPod shuffle; the chargers do work for all iPods) then you should be fairly covered.  I'm a runner and I run with my iPod video on a regular basis. I had heard horror stories about the movement disrupting the hard drive, but I haven't had any problems. I wouldn't use it during a race because of the added weight to my arm, but I have enough motivation without it while racing.  All and all, I'm very pleased with this product. I've had aNano before this, but my library exceeded the 1,000 songs and I decided to up the $50 while I had the chance. Walmart is very good with iPod returns, by the way. :)  Let's review the basics.  Decent battery life. Scratches easily, so get a case. Unbeatable capacity. Just plain FUN. And attractive. ;D  So if you're going to buy an MP3 player, the iPod is the way to go, whether it be Nano or Video. Don't buy a Shuffle; mine died and all it would do is give me flashing lights. (Walmart, again, very good with returns.)  BUY AN IPOD VIDEO. You'll thank yourself.

<Title>I could find better
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, one good thing is the sound quality has improved from the last one (4G, color iPod, no video) but the fact that the EQ still is mind-blowingly-horrible is not very good. I also don't like the fact that FM doesn't come with it (i have to buy a $50 dollar remote? HELLO RIPOFF).   The screen is also very very nice, but they still have the problem with 1/5th the colors of all other screens out their (have you seen the creative Vision:M compared to the iPod? It has  5 times the colors).  Also the battery life. 2 Hours for video? I can't even watch a full movie without it dying. That sucks for travel.  Then their comes the iTunes part. Eh. I'd rather have control of my music thank you, and too bad theres no Drag and Drop. Also the fact that it doesn't work with any Music Subscription Service (except the iTunes, of course). No other recording features either.  I'm returning this. Apple can do better then this. They should figure out how to stick a FM tuner as well as get recording features without me having to pay an extra 50 bucks a piece for each of those features.

<Title>Merry Christmas Honey!!! Now can I use it?
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Background I purchased this model for my wife for Christmas.  Our only past experience with an MP3 Player was a 10 Gig Archos from several years back.  The old Archos is fine from a file storage perspective, but the interface is awful - that's were the Apple shines, but more on that later.  The iPod was purchased from Amazon.com and cost the standard $299 (free shipping).  Packaging  The unit was packed very solidly - no moving around during shipment.    Included The new generation of iPods do not come with a traditional power charger, but rather a USB cable that charges the unit when it is plugged into your PC's USB slot.  Along with the USB cable, you get "ear bud" style headphones, a very simple slip case, and an install CD (for the iTunes software).    Initial Usage and Set up I already had the iTunes software installed on my PC, so I was able to connect the iPod directly to the PC (Windows XP SP2) without problems.  iTunes launched and then prompted me to set up the iPod (name of user, etc.).  The only suggestion I would make here is that if you have multiple user accounts on the same PC, make sure you are logged in as the main user of the iPod - so it gets associated properly.    Registration with Apple I had some trouble registering with the Apple site for two reasons: (1) It was Christmas Day and the site seemed overtaxed - I will give Apple a pass here.  I was able to do it cleanly the next day.  (2) The Serial Number is so small on the back of the unit (MAYBE 6 point type) that it takes good eyes to see it.  Again, not a huge deal.  Getting songs there In its most simple use, iTunes sends all music in the iTunes Library to your iPod each time you connect (anything new, changed, or deleted).  Both iTunes and the iPod flash a message "Do Not Disconnect" when songs are transferring.  Unless you are sending over 100's of songs it does the move VERY quickly.  Getting at the music The iPod itself is very intuitive to use - don't think files and folders, think menus.  I guess you could say all the songs are stored in one big folder, but the iPod uses the information "tagged" on the music file (artist, song name, album, genre, etc.) and lets you find the music through menus with those tags types.  So... Bruce Springsteen's song 10th Avenue Freeze Out - would be listed under Bruce's name by artist, Born to Run as an album, 10th Avenue... as the song name... well you get the idea.  It's a good idea to make sure all your music you are sending is tagged properly so it shows up nicely on the iPod - you can edit the tags easily in iTunes.  Design People who love lots of buttons will not like the iPod - this model works exclusively with a "click wheel" - you basically slide your finger along the wheel to move up and down the menus and lists.  There is a single button in the center of the wheel for "clicking" or selecting items and 4 other "buttons" on the wheel itself - really just points of the compass - for commands like pausing a song, turning off and on the device, going to the previous menu, etc.  It takes a little while to get used to how much movement of the wheel it takes to scroll up and down lists, but you get the hang of it quickly enough.  The iPod itself fits nicely into your hand and can be used with one hand with very little practice.  Sound Just using the simple bud style headphones that come with the unit provides great sound.  You can control volume while the song is playing using the click wheel and even maxed out the sound is clear (and loud).  There is an equalizer with many presets (the same as the one with iTines) and that does make a difference on some songs (e.g., piano, pop, rock, etc.).  You can even tag a song to always use a specific preset.    Video I downloaded a music video to test the capabilities - and the display is amazing for such a small device.  There was no lag or pixelization.  The video does drain the battery much faster than just audio music.  I don't see us using this feature much, but it is interesting for things like video podcasts and the like.  Battery As I said, the battery charges via the USB cable and it is fully charged in less than an hour (if you are not using it at the same time).   Playing around with it - not just listening to music exclusively - and the charge lasted 3 hours.  Music only would probably go for a little longer.  As a side note, you can buy a "typical" wall outlet dock style charger for it (Apple and other brands).     Misc. "Playlists" is a neat feature that lets you create a.... well... playlist of songs.  So... if you wanted to listen to 3 Jackson Browne songs, 2 Elton John songs, and 1 AC/DC song, you would add them to a playlist in iTunes and the playlist will get copied to your iPod.  It doesn't make another copy of the song file, but just a list of songs.  You then select the playlist and listen to just those songs (as opposed to all the songs on your iPod).  There's lots more to say - like shuffling songs, sending photos to your iPod, but I am sure other reviews cover that.  Two more suggestions Buy a "skin" or cover for your iPod to protect it - the shiny metal back gets fingerprint marks and you don't want the screen scratched.  Buy a wall charger - you don't always have access to a PC for the USB.    Overall - a great device!

<Title>Overrated, overpriced
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is okay but I've never owned an iPod before so I didn't know that they had a difficult file system in place to make it harder for people to put music on the iPod and take it off and to encourage you to make all your music aiff and to use iTunes so that if you needed a new player, you'd have to convert it all if it wasn't an iPod. The fact that files are renamed as numbers is really annoying considering that some songs have messed up ID3 tags but file information in the file which disappears when it's renamed obviously. If you could just drag and drop files onto it and play it, that would be much better but I tried it and it doesn't work. It shows up but it won't play it. In any case, you have to give Apple kudos for charging you $300 for this thing and not even giving you a charger with it; that's really nice because of course, I don't need a charger at all nor will I ever need one. It also scratches easily and for some reason, all the on-the-go playlists I create and save are deleted if I connect it to my computer and then disconnect it again. Maybe it's a compatability issue with Media Monkey or something as I don't use iTunes so perhaps you won't have that problem. If you want to use this thing as a back up for your music, make sure you get something like SharePod to help you transfer it back if you ever need to because otherwise, I don't think you can do it. Overall, I wish I hadn't gotten this as an engraved present with no receipt because I really would have rather had a Cowon iAudio M5 or an Archos Gmini XS202, but alas.

<Title>Its hard to think of a time before iPod... (UPDATE READ)
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(((Ok its been about a month i think since i got my new ipod. I just wanted to say its great but i need ed to buy a new case beacuse i was so scared of scratches. PLEASE BUY A CASE UNLESS YOU DONT MIND SCRATCHES BUY ONE AGENT 18 IS A VERY GOOD ONE GET IT.))) Yes i do own this new ipod first off im sure some of these reviews are people who have just touch or maybe even seen one. Anyway Apple is one of the most inovative companies in the world, in my opinion if it wernt for Microsofts monoploly on the world Apple would be have more product out than Microsoft. THe new iPod is no kids toy first off. They have taken all comforts and putthem into a small little white box which looks great. My last iPod i had was a iPod mini which i enjoyed very much. When i saw the nano come out i was blown away with how small it was and i could not wait to see the new iPod. Know first off when i saw it i really did not like it that much. I thought that the screen was a little too big and it looked unporportioned, NOW that was before i saw how thin it was and before it played video. Now when i saw the videos on the commercials most of thoses are not the actual picture but its taht good. THe screen is like high defination i dont know much about it but it looks stunning. The size is another huge improvment its less than a inch thin it weighs less carrys more and does more why could you not like THIS, (the only thing i could see as a problem is lossing it in some papers and throwing it away or sitting on it) but thastis if a idiot bought it. The battery life was also improved which is nice but videos last about two hours just music is fifteen i think photos are three or four but i cant remember. Still it is very nice to have video even if it does last for only two hours. Itunes is also fair priced i think two bucks for a tv show like lost is a very good price. SOngs of course are just one dollar. All in all Apple has really made everything about the new iPod perfect (for right know wond what they can do next) and has made it user friendly and easy to use. THe price may seem a little high but trust me its worth it. As for the two models the thirty gig and the sixty gig i think in my opinion you shpuld go with the thirty gig its the perfect amount and Apple will make a  new one in two or three years so save it for the next one. Any waythe new Apple iPod is a perfect gift for you or someone else so its a definant 5 star item.

<Title>I'm a convert
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I admit I have resisted the ipod craze for a long time and finally gave in with the release of the 5th gen ipod.  It's expensive, but adding video and reducing the profile of it makes it by far the best player around.  I owned a Rio Carbon before this and was happy but frustrated that I couldn't keep all my cd's in one place.    The unsaid accolade is also for itunes.  I have struggled with musicmatch, napster, rio music manager, and rapsody.  None of them can compare with the simplicity and functionality of itunes.  If you haven't been a convert to the ipod age it time you were.

<Title>Great player, great features, stylish, a tad below 4G in the scrollwheel
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would give this 4 stars, but one of the issues I have might be fixed through software in iTunes at a later date... hopefully, they make it easier to upload videos to the ipod and itunes.    iPod Video is great, no doubt about it. There are two issues, One, having video on iPod takes some learning and a little expertise.  It is difficult to add videos (it only takes two formats).  Therefore, you need software to convert AVI/MPGs to apple's format.  Its not difficult to do, but takes an extra step to perform.  I use videora ipod converter... this takes preexisting avi and mpg files and converts them in one step.  This is how I got all my music videos on my iPod.  Converting from DVD is totally another issue, I haven't done, but you have to get anothe piece of software.  And don't believe what apple tells you, you don't need quicktime pro to convert videos.  Videora is free.  The other issue I have is, compared to my 4G, the scoll wheel does not seem as smooth when pushing down.  It makes a louder click, as if there was friction between the wheel and the case when pressed.  My 4G was soft, no noise came when pressing it.  I sold my 4G to get the video, and while i missed it dearly, this one is growing on me.  I really like how its much sleeker than ever before, it plays videos (once put to correct format) really well, and the display for album art/photos is much better.  Issue of sound for music is still at good, maybe better, than previous iPods!    A Must buy.  I chose white, for it is an iPod!  Though people say black would be better to watch videos.  Its your choice.

<Title>Soooooooo Worth Saving For
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am sooooooooooooo saving for this! It is sooooooooo awesome! My dad has one and he let me borrow it and it totally, and I mean totally rocks. For anyone who is like totally addicted to music like I am, buy this iPod! If you don't you are nuts! Here's why you should buy this thing: 1. It holds 15,000 songs, about all of my dad's songs, and he has over 1,000 CDs! 2. It holds 25,000 photos, about all of your photo collection, probably even more! 3. It holds 150 hours of video, that's 9,000 minutes! Sweet, huh? 4. Like OMGG, it has 20 hours of battery life, 20 hours,20! I mean that's long enough to last a car trip from Northern Georgia to the Bahamas! 5. It has almost all the features of Microsoft Outlook, except the e-mail part, in it. I mean it has a timer, a notes area,a calendar and even a contacts list! This thing is soooooooo cool!  6.And now it's even smaller than the regular iPod, with more features! Sounds like an iPod to me! Why you shouldn't get a Nano: 1. Only 2 hours of battery life 2. Can only hold 500 songs and that's how much I have and I only have 30 CDs 3. They like barely even work 4. They're out of style, DUH! Why you shouldn't get a Mini: 1. Only holds 1,000 songs 2. Loses battery life like that 3. Loses it's value soooooo fast 4. It freezes when you hook it up to the car Well, that's all I got, Later!

<Content>I recieved a new 30 gigabyte ipod video for christmas and two weeks later the screen managed to short out, causing ink to start spilling out and ruining itself. Apple will not replace the ipod because they are saying it is physical damage done by the owner, which it isnt. Afterward the battery also stopped working entirely, but apple is still not willing to replace it. I say get a quality mp3 player or even an older photo ipod because its not worth being out 300-400 dollars . I also have the 3 year warranty and a service plan on the ipod.

<Title>Great Product - Beware of Some Limitations
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned a 2nd generation, 2 Mini's, a Nano, and this - the iPod video is by far the best:  * Great size and "feel" (not too thin like the Nano) * Wonderful video - I have easily ripped numerous of my DVDs to fit on this screen (using free software). Though laborious, this works just fine. Ripping DVDs is one glimpse of the future of portable video Serious limitation: * Still no radio - must pay $50 for a remote with FM radio Other limitations: * No Firewire anymore * Does not come with a useable case or dedicated power cord (only power through the USB)- must buy these separately [ADVICE: Rather than buy separate power cords, get the wonderful universal iGo adapters] * Likely to scratch - use plastic stick-on screen protectors + case Note: * iPod does not support the (subscription) services. This is a reflection of the state-of-the-art. This does, however, present a choice for us mere mortals buying the products.

<Title>Enjoying My New iPod
<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm loving my new iPod. I've had the Shuffle for awhile, but I finally got this model. Truth is I haven't tried the video playback yet though because I haven't talked myself into buying a television episode and doubt I ever will. So for me it'll be mostly songs and pictures on the iPod, and 30 gigs is more than enough to hold my entire collection of CDs and I could fit all the songs I want to listen to on there twenty times over.   I'm working on some of the new features like reading text files, but haven't tried a text version of an eBook yet. A friend told me she's done that, which is part of the reason I went with this model. I think I'll try some audio books, and I've found a few podcasts at iTunes.  Admittedly I like this model better than my Shuffle. But I still use the Shuffle every day when I drive to work.

<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Imagine over 500 CD's of music, listening to your CD on your CD player and looking at the back of the jacket so you know what song your listening to- In my mind with Mp3 players that is no different than listening to an 8 track. My entire library is in the palm of my hand letting me know what song and how long it is. Lighter than any CD player without skipping the only thing the Ipod lacks in it is a satelite radio or AM-FM. Plug it into a Bose, or other stereo- and Bam! what a device! No wonder I've had one stolen from me in the gym when I had to run to the bathroom! I have 22 GB of music and 6 remaining- when I get older and sick of Biggie smalls- he can stay in my itune library and get replaced by Mozart. Why decide what I want to listen to on the train or the gym at the beginning of the day when I can carry around my entire collection with the greatest sound! One complaint- why can't they make this item like some cell phones- this item scracthes up so easily its like a five dollar watch- I spent so much money on plastics and protectors its silly- but a device worth keping perfect. The old one that was black and white- archaic. Watching something on V-cast are you nuts?- the video playblack is crystal clear- I watched the entire second season of Lost on my Ipod it was great! Get this before the price drops- because if it does they will try to be coming out with something better and I don't know if that's possible.

They didn't bother to ask for id or anything.  The guy on the post before me is dead wrong. iTunes true was a little hassle before, but with the new version of of iTunes, it seems that most problems have disappeared.  Also the 5th generation video iPod seems to be much more stable than before.  And, the guy before me says that he cannot go to a song quicky. Do your homework and do your playlists.

<Content>Well I have a 30 gig iPod photo.  I do not really want a video ipod and I shall tell you why in this review.  Well first of all go ahead and watch a few videos and watch your 100% battery die faster than Michael Jacksons sex appeal.  Second while your sitting in a car being driven down the road go on and play a video and watch whatever food you have rise from you at a massive speed.  I like keeping things apart.  I mean you have 1 thine that can do the things 10 things can normally do and when it breaks your down 10 things.  I think iPod is an amazing thing.  The music store and being able to keep lists are all great.  However I do not think iPod can be used seriously as a video player.  Actually I did just buy one of these for my brother because he didn't make the high school football team so ya know I guess if I truely hated it I would not have bought it.

<Title>like it
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my ipod about a month ago and I love it. Downloading songs and videos from itunes only takes 20seconds, theres tons of memory, great extras, nice clear picture quality, easy navigation, and very sleek design. But I also have some complaints. My biggest complaint is the freaking battery. They say the battery lasts something like 20 hours.... I wish..... the battery only lasts 2-4 hours. But if u watch a video (like a 3-4 minute music video) it pretty much sucks your battery life dry. If your battery is completely charged and you watch a music video, your battery will be half dead when your done with the video. Also I for some reason cant charge my battery on the computer in my room, I have to use the other one, which is very inconvenient. I also think its stupid of apple to make u spend $30 on a wall adapter and call it an accessory when I think it should come free with it. Another problem I have is how easily it scratches. If u buy one.... dont take the protector it comes with off..... you will regret it. I planned on getting a case before I even got it because if im spending $318 on something I dont want it damaged. So i got on ebay and found a really nice black silicone case and it came with 3 screen protectors, which is exactly what I was looking for. The only downside..... I had to pay for it to be sent from Hong Kong. But trust me $13 is really worth it, the protectors cover the back of the ipod (which scratches easily and gets unattractive fingerprints on it), the front, and the click wheel. But dont get me wrong, everything but the above about the ipod is amazing. I love mine. If you want something easy to use and can hold alot of songs and has great music and picture quality, you should definately get it.

<Title>Please dont waste your time...
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I do not have an Ipod but I have several friends who do including my best friend who got hers for Christmas and is now returning it to get an Archos AV700 (the 40g one). I've played with her Ipod for an entire weekend so trust me I've got experience on it. 1. Price: 30g for $300? It's a decent deal, not wonderful but decent 2. Screen size: No one should ever have to suffer with a 2.5" screen 3. Size: It's horribly thin, the wheel is smaller, my hands rejected it right away. 4. Video quality: The video quality is actually pretty damn good it's very clear and crisp 5. TV Transfer: I was very disappointed that the video ipod couldn't record from TV, apple is on what the 6th one now still no real improvements. 6. Podcasts: Probably it's only major pro, the podcasting is easy and fun. 7. Worth it? I'm sorry it's not, ipods are just a fad, if you want a decent media player with recording capabilities get a mustek 3.5" screen that's only $12 more in price and 40gigs. If you can spend more get an archos pvr with a huge 7" screen. Please wake up, there is more to personal media than apple and Ipod.

<Content>I just bought a brand new black video ipod last week. It sucks really bad because it dosent work with subscrition services, and it is a pain in the ass to get videos on. The black color smudges easily, and the only way to charge it is to plug it into your computor, unless you want to buy and dock fo 50$. Trust me, get a Zen Micro Photo, or even an iRiver H10. Way better than this waste of $300.

<Title>VERY COOL
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple stays true to their design heritage with the new iPod. It looks similar to previous product offerings, but with a slim new build and look. From a design perspective, the new iPod succeeds in some aspects and fails in others. It's truly remarkable that Apple can manufacturer a player this thin considering its large storage capabilities; it's a cue that others in this market can learn from. Yet on the other hand, Apple took the easy way out by widening the existing screen rather than invent a whole new design concept. For video playback, isn't ideal. I would have preferred a horizontal screen. The headphone jack should still be positioned in the center of the player too; I always thought it added to the uniqueness of the iPod. Overall, the latest iPod is still one of the best looking players out there. When I first got my hands on the new iPod video, I thought it felt wider than it should have been. Its slim design just fools you into thinking this player is wider than it really is.  So what makes the new iPod better than previous versions? Well for starters it includes a larger 2.5-inch QVGA color screen and is capable of video playback. The player is slimmer as well, measuring in at less than half an inch thick. Despite its thin size, Apple has added a larger battery to this years model which promises five more hours of playback when compared to last years. That means up to 20 hours of total audio play time before this baby runs out of juice. Available in 30GB and 60GB flavors, you can store up to 150 hours of video, 15,000 songs, and up to 25,000 photos (all on the 60GB version) - that's a lot of media. Included with the new iPod is a set of ear buds, the latest iTunes (version 6) and a USB cable for charging and syncing the iPod with your PC. Apple decided to cut some costs by leaving the wall charger out which really puts a cramp on things when you are traveling. You can buy a wall charger, but it will cost you $29 dollars.    The 2.5-inch screen that's on the new iPod is capable of displaying photos and video at up to a 320x240 resolution,  The new iPod can play podcasts, music videos, audio books, and display photos in addition to simply playing music.    The new iPod is helpless without Apple's iTunes software. Announced at the same time as the new iPod, iTunes 6 allows users to download music videos from a library of more than 2000 titles. Apple has also partnered up with Disney and ABC so you can download your favorite television shows to your iPod - commercial free.

<Title>It's Great, but...
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recieved this iPod as a gift, and I absolutely love it.  BUT... beware! The iPod with video is incredible and is truely a 5 star product. Videos are clear and smooth; sound is great; and for me it doubles as a portable player and a component of my car stereo. You can use the FM transmitter with it, but my stereo has RCA input jacks. So, I use a headphone (3.5mm) to RCA adapter cable to pump perfect sound right into my system! Not to mention, the iPod and iTunes are an easy way to organize all my music. So, what the hang up? Why not 5 stars? You have to be sooooo careful with screen. GET A PROTECTIVE CASE BEFORE YOU EVEN OPEN THE PACKAGE OF YOUR IPOD. I single swipe with the wrong material on the screen with scratch it! My old, soft cotton t-shirt streaked the front right after I opened it and took it out of the box! The protective pouch they give you is NOT good enough either. It's a shame that you have to accessorize the hell out of a product to be able to use it. It should come with an adequate protective case, or more importantly, it should come with a warning about it's delicateness. Had I bought it myself, I would have researched and known since others have had the same problem. But it was a gift, so I had no way of knowing what I consider a DEFECT in Apple's almost pefect iPod product. Otherwise, I love it, and you WON'T be disappointed, as long as you can protect it from yourself.

<Content>Ok let me start  by saying that until you've owned or tried using an MP3 player for at least a week, you might not realize how incredibly awesome it is to have all your music in the palm of your hand.  Pros- 1) plays music,videos and can show photos      -videos are actually very good quality      -I don't really have that many photos (I don't own a digital camera)      -MUSIC!!!!!! what can I say? 2) has some extras like a calendar, 4 games (brick, solitar and music are my favorites), a stopwatch, and programable world clocks. 3) incredibly small for holding so much 4) overall just amazing  Cons- 1) no charger- you can still charge it through the computer but that takes much longer. (I share with my sister because her photo iPod came with one) 2) videos cost $1.99 but only look really good on the iPod 3) I wish the battery could last longer when playing videos 4) This iPod will most likely be replace with an even better and slimmer iPod within about 6 months (though it will still be wonderful to use)  Overall I love my iPod to death, and carry it everywhere with me.    @  I**>               l           l                   ___   i   l**   /**\   /**l   ---   l      /**\\  / l__   l   l      \__/   \__l   ---   l___ \__/ \/  \__     (iPod=Love) [sorry if you cant read it the format changes}

See if it is pluged in all the way( You must use a USB 2.0 connector. Not the one on your key bord. It's not strong enough) 3. You need the updated software for this year.

<Title>The Revolution Has Begun
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a revolution, a paradigm shift in the way we approach audio (and now video) content. I'm not going into the technical specs. I'm just encouraging everyone to get into this. It's awesome. It's any song you want any time you want it. More importantly (for me) it's the ability to listen to podcasters. I was so sick of getting nothing but the same old news/politics/music on the drive to and from work. Now I can find shows on virtually any topic. Some, like one I was listening to on vocabulary, are just mediocre. Some are downright amazing and have the potential to rock the establishment-- like one on iTunes called "Christian Universalism" hosted by Rhett Ellis.    Anyway, I love the medium. I love the concept. These things sound great. They are not "the coming thing." They are NOW. Get into podcasting. Find the good shows. It's worth it.

<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have an Ipod video that I got for graduation, didn't really use it for a while.  The music organizational system is annoying because if your music isn't tagged correctly you will have a ton of &lt;unknowns> ...who wants to go through and tag their entire collection of music again?  I plugged mine into a computer that just got it's itunes update and disconnected it when I was supposed to.  It wouldn't stop "restarting"  It was possessed.  Mind you, the first time I use it, it dies, after a software update, after installing the software.  It dies.  And It got really scratched while i was putting it in the case.. :-(  If you're going to get an I-pod get the Apple care, otherwise you spent money on something you'll just have for a year. Also, even though they replace it for you, you have to go into the Apple Store, and it's inconveniant to have to put all your music back on it and to wait in line at the store.  Even though it's sleek, it really isn't that good of a product, I know some people swear by these, but I'm obsessed with quality.

<Content>This is a GREAT product and is visually stunning! Show friends my pics, watching movies, listening to music anywhere, my contacts, appointments and of course it's a great size. This is the best IPod product to date!   Cons: Need a protector, buy it at the same time and never handle it directly once it's in the protector, trust me, it can scratch easily. IPod software interface is lacking! Trying to play the songs in the order you desire is not easy via the software. Mu IPod occasionally locks up, does not play or the sound does not come out, a reset (no loss of settings) fixes it, downtime = 30 secs.   But, it's one of my best purchases and I have NO regrets!

<Content>I love my ipod. Granted I have not used any other portable digital music player other than the ipod in order to do a comparison, but i don't know how I lived without the ipod before. A few years ago I had considered purchasing the 400 CD changer from Sony. I'm so glad I didn't do it. Now I have the ability to put all my CD collection in one little package, play it through my stereo system at home (its primary location) and take it with me in the car on long trips, eliminating the need for CD changers at home, and lugging the CD's in the car.  My wife loves it because she no longer has to keep switching CD's in the CD changer every few days.  I don't have any complaints about the unit. I have it on a Kensington dock which is connected to the stereo receiver at home and have a Kensington FM transmitter for the car. Both work great.

<Title>Best iPod yet. Video out works better than expected with right settings.
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I actually bought the 60GB version and this one as a gift. This is the 4th iPod I buy and is of course the best one I've owned. I've had absolutely no problems whatsoever and it has worked great for me. I was a little worried about the scratching issues that I had heard before buying it, but in my own experience can say that it is not as "delicate" as others claim. Of course it CAN scratch as any other of the plastic iPods can. But as of today 2 months after getting it and using it a LOT, only a few scratches are visible on the chrome side because I hadn't gotten a case for it. I went with the white because I find it more "classic".  One of the features I was interested in trying when I first got it was outputting video to TV. I purchased a US$5 video camera cable at an electronics store which worked just as well as any advertised iPod-specific AV cable. (Note: With the cable I bought two of the RCA colors where "switched". I'm not sure if it was the particular cable I bought but video goes out through red and right audio goes through the yellow. Left audio goes through the white as it normally would. I guess that with an iPod-specific cable this is not the case. Just hook them up until you see video if you get one of these cheaper cables.)  Apple's "standard" settings can be a bit confusing if you don't know anything about compression. You don't HAVE to encode in 320x240 or 480x480. There are other settings as well. Look up "last ipod video guide" with your search engine to find a good article which includes handy tips about the video settings you can or should use with the iPod.  I found that compressing widescreen footage to MPEG-4 video at 640x352 pixels at 2.5Mbps was the greatest quality I could get. I would leave audio at the standard 128 kbps AAC encoding. H.264 looks great on the iPod but because of its size constraint I think it's not the best option if you want to output to TV. I tried hooking the iPod to a Samsung 42" widescreen television (HDTV-ready) with the first settings I mentioned and I was surprised by the quality. There are plenty of shareware apps and one or another freeware apps (such as iSquint) with which you can achieve great looking video which compress video even faster than Quicktime.  Of course the iPod has many other cool new features like the stopwatch, the lock and a higher-res screen. But I mostly use it to listen to music or output video to TV.  I definitely recommend it.

<Title>AVIOD THIS COLLECTION OF BLUNDERS
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't own an iPod, my best friend has owned an iPod since gen 2 was released a few years ago. He is also very scared to post anything online so I'm doing it for him. His 2nd gen finally died and he decided to upgrade to the 5th gen iPod, the iPod Video. He has been having problems from the moment he opened the box.   First the screen was cracked; understandible if he had purchased it at a Walmart, but he ordered from Apple.com directly. Thier return policy covered it, but it was a very time comsuming in the time needed to track everything down.  When he finally recieved his replacement problems arose with synching. A good sized portion of his songs that he ripped from CDs for his 2nd gen were not recognized by the iPod OS in the 5th gen. The iTunes on his Toshiba computer said that they were good and compatible, but the iPod itself said that the tracka were incompatible. This is a big problem because of the fact that 2,000 songs are not compatible out of a collection of 8,000. Apple never did respond to his emails for that problem.  Another problem with the synching was the fact that the iPod only charged half the time it was plugged into the USB port. The remaining time it displayed the message "check cable", funny thing however was that it DID synch the music over while it displayed the message. This was a problem from day one. This is another issue that Apple has yet to respond to at all. I should note that we tried to charge the unit with an extra cable set and a docking kit purchased at the Apple Store with similar results.  The next hurdle thrown his way was the lack of a remote port next to the headphone jack. He owns quite a few of those iPod add-ons and was fairly upset to find out that they just turned into a collection of paperwieghts. This loss of a remote port means that one of his main uses for the mp3 player has to be reconsidered, using it in the car with an FM radio and the Griffin Itrip device. This design flaw is probably Apple's greatest mistake, seeing as a good portion of the iPod masses grapped those little add-ons with the remote plug that was unique to the iPod.  (I fixed this by giving him my Belkin TUNECAST II that I no longer use, but that uses a single AAA battery so the cost is a bit more than the Itrip. Unfortunately, I didn't have a way to fix or replace the other add-ons that he has and used on a regular basis.)  He loved the ability to watch music videos and ABC hits while waiting in line at places until another problem sprang up. When he set the player to shuffle the music, the audio AND music video files were thrown into the mix. This drained the battery at a fierce rate due to the fact that some of his favorite playlists had 200 songs and 16 videos. He had to check each track to see if it was a audio or a video file, there was no simple way to sort them when they were in a playlist.  It did not help that he hated the fact that the entire front of the unit was a smear and smudge magnet. Scars and hairline cracks also plagued the unit's face. Apple included a pouch to carry it in, but you can not watch videos or use the clickwheel while the player is in its pouch.   Finally it was the charging problem that made him put this pretty machine up for sale. It lost the ability to charge the player entirely and he was tired of waiting for a response from Apple to the problem.   He gave them two months to respond to the song and charging problems, but they have not responded. Unfortunately, this lack of response means that Apple just lost a mp3 player customer to Iriver, Creative Labs, Sony or Dell. This company switch will have its problems (can't watch the music videos or LOST away from the computer or use any of the 200 odd iTunes songs purchased on the new player, but he says NAPSTER will provide. {I really don't like NAPSTER}) but he sees them as minor in comparison to the problems he had over the 2.5 months out of nearly 4 months ownership.  I should state here that I am typing this review on a school iMac G5{I want one!!}, so please don't think of me as an Apple hater. I just never had the cash to buy an iPod, and after this collection of fun affairs, when it comes time to replace my old flash-based Lyra which I have had forever, it most likely will not be with one of the iPod line.

<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just read your review on the new Apple Ipod that plays video.. I will add now that I am an Iriver owner(H340).. When I first started to dabble in the MP3 portable jukebox arena, I started to quite vigorously study the pros and cons of all players on offer and the Iriver won with flying colours.. The Ipod, at the time, had many flaws..  They have since, rectified a few of these but it was great to read a bad review of this product.. Are people finally waking up to the crap Apple are pushing onto the public.. If you advertise enough, put enough backing behind a product, a lemon could be the next MP3 player..  So, to your friends dilemma of missing out on the video side of things, the H300 series of the Iriver can and has for at least a year before the Ipod could, play video on the colour screen. All you have to do is download the latest firmware from the Iriver site and upgrade the unit.. It is a little chunkier but a small price to pay for a player that doesn't require crappy drivers for every computer you connect to to load songs, files etc.. No copyright crap..  It can record voice, outside sources and has FM built in all for the same price.. The Ipod requires many accesories to require all this.. The Mysic River site  informs you on how to upgrade your hard drive, making it bigger, changing batteries and even skins.. The Iriver has more versatility than a lot of players I have researched.. So fear not, there are many more and better products than the over advertised, product placed Ipod..  It irks me when people get blinded by such.. Cheers..

<Title>Keep on playing music long after the other mp3 players stop
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is by far the best iPod yet.  This iPod comes in black or white, and it comes with 30 Gb of memory.  That's something like 15,000 songs and 25,000 pictures, and multiple movies.  Can't complain much about that.  I definitely would recommend this for anyone who has the money to pay for it.   The only downside is the price. I had to look around a while, but I finally found a way to get one for free. I went to this website:   http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=26960987  Then I signed up for a week of free service from a list of possible businesses. I canceled this within the week to avoid being charged. I then referred five friends to do the same thing and I had my ipod video within a month. Give it a try.

<Title>My experience with an Apple iPod
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a Video 30gig iPod for a Christmas/post-operation present, although I was intending to get a Creative Zen Neeon.. (I was always against iPods because they were so trendy and I thought they were overrated) But my brother wanted to order an iPod for me, because he could get a 20 percent discount on it.  So I said, what the heck and let him order it.  I saved up for it, but my mom decided to pay the 50 dollars for it.  I ordered it from target.com, and about a week later I received it. When I recieved it, I was quite pleased with the video.  The colors were simply dazzling, but it was a pain that you had to buy videos.  A day later, I look at my iPod and realize-just like most of the reviews here- that there is a significant amount of SCRATCHES on it.  I left it in its case, and only listened to it about 2 or 3 times.  A few days later, I brought the iPod to my doctors appointment on full charge with it playing a playlist (because I didn't want to drain the battery from constantly using the backlight- so I made a playlist to eliminate that).  And the thing died in about 20 minutes.  However, the same day I decided to return it to a Target store and returning it was extremely easy.  I told them how it was defective and they checked the box to see if everything was there and they went and got me another one.  Before I even OPENED the iPod's box, I ordered a case and screen protector on eBay for about 10 dollars in total- to try to prevent those scratches from happening.  I suggest if you want to prevent your player from getting scratches, buy screen protectors/a case FIRST.  Sure, you might have to wait a week or two (if you bought it online/ebay), but it's totally worth it.  Now, I've had my iPod about 2 or 3 weeks and it's scratch free and I totally love it.  PROS + All the songs this thing can hold.  I mean wow.. 30 gigs?  I have about 20 gigs in my whole familys music library- and thats 6 people. + The video feature- I didn't get the iPod just for the videos, but hey-it's a plus.   + The colour screen.  I know if its a video it has to be colour screen- but I like it.  It's snazzy.  CONS - I cannot stress this enough... HOW EASILY/MUCH THIS THING SCRATCHES!  300 dollars and we can't even have a product that we wouldn't have to worry about getting scuffed up?  Even so, Apple should have gave us a better case.  They can afford it.  This flimsy thing we get doesn't really even protect the iPod (not mine, at least :/ ) - Replacing batterys- I think we should get like a free battery replacement or something, but eh.  Oh well.

<Title>Pretty nice, but ditch the headphones and get a case for it.
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A pretty good device, slightly on the heavy side I think compared to my other player, and I have two complaints: 1. The headphones that come with the Ipod are pretty bad in terms of sound production. You'd think they would ship it with a decent pair for the price they're charging for this device. Bought a pair of Sony MDR-EX81LP earbuds, which sound much better.  2. The ease with which it scratches is shocking. I ran my thumb over the black part of the case next to the click wheel and it scratched it. I couldn't believe it! Bought a clear case from Raddtech and put it in there from day one.

<Title>King of the Hill
<Date>Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had one now for over 2 months.  I love it!  Very well made, easy to use, tons of add on parts, and enormous storage capacity.  This is by far the best MP3 player I have ever had.  It does cost a little more than most of the others, but it is well worth the added expense.  Pros: ****High storage capacity ****Excellent battery life ****Fits in a shirt pocket ****Recharges quickly ****Intuitive controls Cons: ****Expensive, but well worth it ****Strongly reccomended to use with a USB 2.0 port.  Works with older USB, but slow. ****Screen is a tad bit small to watch something over an hour long on.  I heard that a 3rd party company is rolling out a pair of sunglasses that will interface with the iPod, and display the video on the inside of the glasses.  Sorry, but I cannot remember what company is planning on doing this. Over All, the iPod is the king of hill and will please the masses with it's ample features.

<Title>Awesome, but it doesn't play .wma
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my ipod (30 gb video, black) for several weeks now, and love it!  My ENTIRE music collection is on it, and it is only half full (approximately 10 days worth of music, according to the iTunes software!), leaving plenty of room for photos and video.    It is so easy to create playlists, and the "smart" playlist is a great feature.  Keying off of the "children's music" genre tag, for example, I created a playlist of all my baby son's music for those car rides when he wants to listen to "five little ducks went swimming one day ...!"  Of course, I've also got custom playlists for myself set up, and I am still amazed at the iPod's ability to shuffle my entire music collection in a matter of seconds.  I remember when I thought my five-disc cd player was cool.  Regarding reliability, which seems to be the main complaint of the one-star reviews, I actually dropped my iPod two days after getting it (how's that for sending a jolt of fear into the pit of your stomach!) onto a concrete floor, and it is none the worse for wear.  I read somewhere that 75% of the U.S. music player market is cornered by Apple's iPod ... maybe the one-star reviews are just the unfortunate folks who received a lemon out of the millions and millions sold?  I haven't interfaced with Apple customer service, though, so can't write on that account.  Headphones are not good, but with quality headphones, the sound quality is great.  It's too bad you have to buy the docking set up separately, though.  While the synching feature is great, using the USB 2.0 port, I have to say that I don't completely like being bound to a powered-up computer to charge the battery (it won't charge if the computer is in standby).    My biggest complaint, and the reason for 4 stars, is that Apple won't play .wma files.  WMA is the best file format out there.  Better quality at less size than either MP3 or Apple's format.  I bit the bullet and imported much of my music collection in the Apple format, but am not pleased.  There is a nice feature when importing that will let you convert all you existing .wma formats into the Apple format, but I suspect I experienced some sound quality loss during that process.    For the package: great audio, easy controls, size, video, photo, and more, the iPod cannot be beat.  It's the best out there.  You're just binding yourself to their proprietary music file format until/unless they wake up and see the light.    Highly recommended!

<Title>not worth the money
<Date>Sun Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been extremely frustrated with the ipod for the last few days, so for each problem I've removed a star: 1. Very temperamental software - works well at times and doesn't work at all at others. I thought machines were supposed to be predictable. 2. Extremely pricy. It's a big hard drive with music playing software on it. For a bit extra you can buy a computer or at least another MP3 with more features. 3. And this is the reason i bothered to write this review - you can't put the songs from the ipod back to your computer. My laptop regretably had to be reformated. I was able to put back on everything from my pocket pc, including the mp3 files. Not so with the ipod. I was not "authorized" to perform this operation this is what the stupid thing told me. I thought it was my ipod! Seems I need to be "authorized" to use it! So now if I decide to put new songs on it it will rease the old ones! I called Apple they told me for copy right protection they didn't include such an option, but that there might be a third party software that can do this! What?! Third party?! Isn't this their product? I should go surching on line for somebody else's software? This is absolute pure stupidity. The cutomer service representative advised me that in order not to lose what I already have on the ipod i could use the manual transfer option when adding new music. I tried - for the last 2.5 hours the thing is still working on one single cd. I don't know how this protects any copy rights - if i've ripped off a cd i can do it again, what's the point? Are they trying to make more money by making you buy the itunes again and again? Not that I ever bought any. How much money can a company make form a simple music playing device? I only hope that by the time I need a new mp3 player the competition would have bring proces down and hopefully improved the quality of the product.

<Content>I'm a college student and I have to say that the iPod is the best thing a student can have.  You can listen to music while running, you can watch videos in a boring class, or show your pictures to your friends. It has 30Gb so you can actually use it as an external hard drive where you can save important documents, so you can just forget about your memory stick.  In general this is a great device, the only thing I don't like is the ear phones because you cannot run with them and also all of the accessories for the iPod are very expensive.

<Title>The iPod gets 5 stars, iTunes gets 2
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, I will say, the iPod itself is a wonderful 30G MP3 player, it holds close to 14 hours of music (I believe that's what the 30 Gig holds) and Video! BUT, iTunes is the biggest peice of crap I've ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon, I've found out that if a brand new cd doesn't touch oxygen before you rip it, the MP3's won't skip. That's right, I bought a cd at Best Buy 2 days ago, let my cousin put it on his computer, stuck it back in the case....I get home a day ago, and try and rip it on to mine, it's starts playing then....."TTTTTTTTTTTTTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" it abruptly stops and then starts again, and then it repeats itself for pretty much the whole song....you have to use Nero, or Roxy (or similiar program) to rip the cds and then manually add them to iTunes, or else your songs will be destroyed, and especially with close to 3,000 songs on there, why, and when do I have the time, to go through all that crap, and pick out what's bad, and then re-rip the cd. If you're a download junkie, you won't have this problem. All in all the iPod is wonderful, but have fun getting your cd collection on iTunes.

<Title>Over-freaking-rated
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod 30, by itself is an awesome little toy.  But everything peripheral about it is absolutely terrible.  The software (iTunes) is a horrible interface and bogs down even the fastest systems.  Every time you open the program, there's yet another stupid upgrade for either the firmware or for the iTunes software.  The iTunes software now cannot be installed without Quicktime, which is a substandard player which is beaten out by VLC or even Winamp.  The headphones sound great, but fall apart if you used them regularly and you can't replace the original ones, you have to get some overpriced nonsense. Also, because Apple still believes it is the best (even though 90% of the world doesn't use their computers and you can't get most software titles for a Mac), you can't use .wma files, you have to convert to .aac, which is a lower quality compression. Oh, and don't believe the 14hr battery life claim - if you get more than 8 hours out of your player 3 days out of the box, consider yourself lucky.  You can have the games, the daily planner, and the video, just give me a week of commuting tunes without a lengthy recharge.  Oh yeah, it doesn't come with a plug for the wall, only for the usb. The player itself is great, looks cool, will make you like every one else and will get you stabbed in Brooklyn.  No, really, some 10 year old got killed by an older boy for his iPod. All in all, keep trying apple, i'm sure you'll get it perfect soon.

<Title>Great Player, but...
<Date>Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got it about 6 weeks ago and I love this player.  Having almost 30 gigs for your music, videos,photos is great!  The video quality is awesome for a portable device,  everything is crystal clear and the colors are vivid, the sound is great but I use Sony MDR-EX51LP earphones which I bought for a previous mp3 player. I can't stand the white trendy earphones and as you'll read in other reviews, their sound is mediocre (if you are picky about sound, otherwise you might be OK).  The reasons I did not give it a five star... 1.  Battery life..I bought it originally for music during my 45 minute commute (eachway) but ended up watching a great deal of video on it and it drains the battery so quick, I could not believe it,  Apple has some recommendations on settings to increase the times between charges but it only helps a little bit .  I hope when the actual Video iPod comes out (keep in mind, this is NOT the "video iPod") they'll improve battery life so you can use it longer between charges.   2.  Get some protection for it, regardless of high risk of it being scratched... remember they are not cheap, and I don't mean how much you paid for it, I mean it has a lot of technology, which is meant to be portable but it is still sentive to falls or being banged around in a backpack or other such places.  If you are willing to put up with those items, you will enjoy your 5g iPod.  Remember, you are not limited to the iTunes store for purchasing music or videos to enjoy it, or encoding them in ACC.  If you encode your music in MP3 at 160 you'll have similar sound (slightly better, IMO).  It might take a bit more space in your HD but you'll guarantee portability to other devices.  You can also rip your own DVDs to your computer and encode them so you can watch them on the ipod, and take the movies with you on your next vacation and watch them on regular TV (requires additional cables and I recommend an charger).  Quality is not HD or even DVD but still is really good (depending on how you compress them).  You can achieve this using free software.  Just google it (dvd to ipod) and you'll get some options pick according to your OS.

<Content>Ill keep this review short and simple. I never was really into the whole ipod thing until i bought my nano. It looked awesome and was very small, so i decided to get something i could put my entire music library in. Just like the nano it looks cool and is easy to use. Its great haveing something that small that views photos, videos, and plays music. The only thing that i kinda didnt like was that it doesnt play all kinds of video formats which i already knew when i bought it but there are some that i can formatt to play. The apple website had some tips and instructions on that. The player itself is small compared to the old ones ive seen. Its a bit bigger than a deck of cards and thinner than a DVD case.  Overall its just a great little piece of equipment. Id recommend getting a cover for it that comes with a screen because fingerprints are left easily. J&R have some really good ones.

<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In my time I have had three Ipods total.  Recently I have purchased a Creative Zen Vision  and creative has also released a new player called the Creative Vision M.  They both are way better then the Ipod video.  Here is a list why i think it is better.   1.Most importantly you can buy an extended warranty on the product that Apple does not offer.  I am not sure if they offer it now but when I got my Ipods they did not.  They have tech suppport but not actual replacement warranties.   2.Replaceable battery..That you can buy! 3.Screen is the size of the Ipod 4.For us Windows users it is plug an play compatible.  I can hook my Vision up to any computer and it will work.  5.Never gives me an error sign with a folder..Which happened allot with the Ipod.   6.Good video player. 7.Has FM tuner and recorder, built in.  Yeah the ipod is the best selling.  It is a ok player, the zen vision lacks some things the Ipod is great for.  The way the ipod works with Itunes is great but its not the reason to buy a good mp3/video player.  If you are looking for a good video player go for something with a larger clearer scratch resistant screen.  Only problem i have with the Vision is you cant buy shows like you can with Itunes.  Itunes files wont work with anything but the Ipod.  Kinda stingy of apple.  I think if you are looking for an MP3 player look at other players..See if something else may work for you.. The Ipod is not the only player out there.  Keep that in mind.

He says the songs and videos are all in the same list and cant be differenitaed between songs and videos. This is untrue. The newest iPod 5th gen lists videos under the video menu and songs under, guess what? Yep, the song menu! lol.   This iPod has amazing video and sound. Any product made by iRiver is garbage compared to this. Just plain and simple garbage. I used a program called iSquint for converting fire sharing video files and I use Handbrake for converting DVDs to watch on my iPod. This thing is amazing!!! There simply isnt a better MP3 or video player on the market. Any of these people who say you shouldnt buy an iPod just because you should be different need to get real. Lemme see, dont get an iPod because they are popular and everyone h as one? Hmmm Maybe thats because they are the best and 9 million people cant be wrong. To those people I say, grow up. And go buy yourself an iPod.

<Content>I received a 5G 30G iPod video for Christmas, and it has become my new best friend.  I take it with me everywhere.  I can honestly say that I do not know how I lived without an iPod for so long.  It is very easy to use.  Those of you who already have an iPod are familiar with the click wheel.  When I first opened the box I thought "OMG, this is going to take me forever to figure out."  But in about two seconds I knew how everything worked.  Fortunately, I already had iTunes on my pc and was using it as my media player, so I was able to connect the iPod and listen to my music right away.  I was a little sceptical about the video feature.  I thought it would be crappy and the screen would be to little to see anything.  I LOVE IT!  The picture quality is great, and while the screen is small you can still see everything clearly.  I hope this has helped.

The screen is a good size and i must say that from my 20gb ipod this is an upgrade. my old ipod was not good so i decided to spend all my summer earnings on this and trust apple one last time...also another thing is dont take off the protective screen unless you have a great case for it because (especially with the black one which i have) it scratches. i think that the storage capacity is so large the one thing that apple needs to realise is they need to think of a newer and cheaper way for people to fill there ipods if it holds 7500 songs thats 7,500 DOLLARS that tons of ipods to fill it...so i think that there are only a few cons and a lot of pros...good cases are the ipod socks and the custom ipod case at ifrogs.com. i would suggest this and if you think that you will be returning this then you shouldnt have your name engraved my friends broke becuase she dropped it and they would replace it so buy one!!!

<Title>If I send them back my lemon - maybe I can get an apple...
<Date>Tue Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Oh where do I begin? This is my third apple in three years. I can not believe that I keep getting the only defective ipods out there so how come there are so many happy ipodders?   First and foremost the customer service for this company sucks. Their website product service request form would not accept my Canadian postal code (maybe this whole thing is a Canadian problem). When I finally got a customer service rep on the phone I was told that they needed me to give them a different postal code. I explained I didn't have another postal code and the CSR suggested I give him a neighbours postal code. I told him One - that I did not know my neighbours postal code and Two - how would they get it to me if I gave them the wrong info.  To make a long story short, they were horrible on the phone, refused to forgive the $45 shipping charge (which is ridiculously high) even though I have had this thing for six months and days.  I am so fed up with this company. I now know why they never were able to take over the computing world. ANything more serious than some entertaining music and apple couldn't hack it.

<Title>A great product, but...
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod is a wonderfully innovative product and definitely worth having, just make sure you know how to work it.  Of all the companies I have purchased goods from, Apple is by far the rudest, most inconsiderate corporation I have ever worked with.  When my iPod mini was not working, I sent it back to apple.  It was returned not fixed and my warantee had expired while it was being repaired, thus they refused to look at it again without me spending $50-$150 dollars.  When I argued it, the response was "We here at Apple do not have to service customers who do not treat us with the utmost respect.  This call is over.  Goodbye."  (I was in NO WAY rude).  Be warry of the fact that the new iPod Video freezes frequently (mine has twice since I got it), and Apple has been just as helpful as they were before: "You'll need to ship that out.  We can't do anything for you here."

<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I often complain about my old Ipod, the mini, which just recently died on me. I found out, though, that I'd been ejecting it wrong SINCE THE DAY I GOT IT from my computer, among other various no-nos. Like anything in life the upkeep is the real battle, the damage control is what really MATTERS.  I think Ipod is in it's own standard, and ever since getting the video I'm so excited to be able to utilize that feature!   All in all I'd say it's a good buy, and if you've got the money to spend go for it.

<Title>This iPod Rocks
<Date>Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this thing! This is actually my 1st iPod, but 3rd mp3 player, I had two of the same Samsung mp3 players that tore up in the same week, wouldn't reccomend buying it.  I had heard people talk about how great the iPod's were so I thought I'd give one a try. Turns out I love it! This is the perfect thing for a music nut like me (I love music!) It's really handy to have at school to listen to at lunch, between classes, and on baseball trips.  One thing that i really like about this is it's ability to play videos, which you can buy for $1.99 off of iTunes. I really like watching the videos, they're extremely clear. Another feature I like about it is it being able to view my pictures on it and being able to dislpay the album art, which is pretty cool. This is by far the best mp3 player out there. Thanks Apple! All of my friends wish they had one now, so it has the "cool" factor for sure. I would reccomend buying some kind of case for it because the back and screen scratch very easily. Even the earbuds that come with this are really awesome. They have excellent sound quality and they stay in your ear pretty easily.  So if your looking for a mp3 player, get the iPod!

<Content>Prior to the iPod Video debut, a few nerdy types discovered that iTunes allowed movie/video playback in release 4.x.  These same nerdy types were acutely aware of the resemblance of the 1st gen iPod to an innocuous mp3 player included in the Mac OS X beta, which curiously disappeared from the general release of OS X v1.0.  4 stars because I'm waiting for iPod (handheld Mac).

<Content>I know everyone thinks that this ipod is selling for a great   price, which it is but that will come back to haunt you. After   your 1 year apple limited warrenty runs out you will not be able   to return this ipod to Amazon. It would be wise for you to buy   this ipod at Best Buy and get the Performance Service plan for a   extra $50 dollars. Do not be cheap and purchase this ipod on   Amazon thinking you are getting a hot deal  with   this dicounted price. You will be very sorry for your decision   when something goes wrong with this ipod after the warrenty runs   out. Amazon wont do anything for you and then your stuck with a   $254.87 piece of junk. Also do not purchase the Amazon   service plans. Both service plans are worthless, just check out   the reviews. The Apple service plan is $52 dollars and only   lasts for another year. Best Buy gives you a better bang for   your buck for service plans. Do not purchase an ipod from Amazon   you will be frustrated and sorry in the long run.

<Content>Hey I got the Ipod 30 GB Black which I totally recommend to get or the New Creative Zen Vision: M , however it is so easily scratchable so you need a case like a silicone case or a leather case. If you buy from Apple they give you a flimsy pouch which could scratch your Ipod from just sitting in the case. Invest in it early and buy the protection plan.

<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a generic 1GB mp3 player when it started to act funny so I decided to get an Ipod. The screen is awesome and that fact I can watch movies completly blows my mind. The only oversight is that the screen is still small, you have to hold it up to your face and eats up battery like nobody's business (from a 14 hr battery life, it goes to a 2hr). I actually was prepared for all the scratches I heard about so I bought an Ipod jacket from Circuit city. I DEFINIITELY recommend it, the little bugger doesnt take nicely to touches in my opinion. Plus the fact that you have to buy the charger separately really blows. But other than those gripes Im pretty happy. It still is first and foremost an MP3 player and it plays those just fine.   Not mention I got it for free. So check it out: http://ipods.freepay.com/?r=25770024

<Content>This is my second iPod, and just like the last one I think the product is great. My only problem is the compatiblity issue - I am a PC user and actually enjoy Windows and deal with linix form time to time - but Apple refuses to allow other products than iTunes to operator with this device (there are a few alternatives, but none thats just amazing).  Even worseif you buy a song off iTunes your stuck using iTunes and the iPod - you can't transfer it to another brand MP3 player (although I've heard if you burn the songs to a cd as a standard music CD you can then rip them back as standard MP3 instead of AAC)  SO overall I'ld rate this product as 4 stars for its amazing quality and 1 star for compatibility.

NEVER let them wet, a friend made his ipod accidentally wet and it never turned on again, YOU CANNOT send it for repair (again i think because they dont want another pieces than apple on the market, they want the exclusivity).  BUT IN GENERAL IT IS A WONDERFULL GADGET

Also, you can use an automatic installer found at iPodwizard.net  I wouldn't buy an ipod if I didn't plan on installing rockbox.

<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had several other brands of MP3 players over the past few years.  I can honestly say Apple has done it right with the ipod. Works perfect, battery life is awesome and the way it shuffles the MP3 libraries is perfect. Never hear the same thing twice. I've had other players that have a setting for "shuffle" but they just play the same songs over again. They don't really mix them up. If your in the market for an MP3 player this is the one to get. Great disc space, and fast access to your songs. Fast transfer from the PC. I suggest an FM transmitter such as the "Griffin ITRIP" also if you do any driving and wish to listen to your player.  Of all the ipods this one is priced the best for what it does. About $15 to $20 extra for 10GB of space. Enjoy!

<Title>Good quality: music sounds great as expected and the video/photo capability is top-notched also
<Date>Thu Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like this iPod.  The click wheel is an improvement over the iPod mini that I received as a gift last year: it responds better when searching up and down the menu.  The picture quality is very good when you store your photos at high res.  30 GB is a sizeable chunk of memory (I remember when 2 GB is a lot).  But it is much needed for all the photos and videos you may want to store.  It is a bit pricey compared to similar mp3/video players.  Hence the 4 star ratings, otherwise it'd be 5 stars.  I was going to buy a player from Creative Labs, the Zen MicroPhoto 8GB MP3 Player, that was less expensive (at about $229.99) but relented at the last minute when I thought I would need a lot more memory than 8 GB for photos and such.  I was on the fence also because the Zen player had more features (FM tuner and voice recorder) that I wish the iPod had too.  Thinking about the features, however, I realized that I simply wouldn't need the tuner and recorder features much at all, but I really need more memory.  Thus, so far I am satisfied with the purchase, provided that the iPod doesn't have a breakdown of some kind in the near future.

<Title>The next step in the evolution of the iPod!!!!
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What an amazing product. I bought mine mainly because I had run out of space on my 4GB iPod mini, and was looking to upgrade to one that had more space. The main reason that I have bought this iPod, as is the same reason I bought my iPod mini: It is the only mp3 player that connects you to it's own music store where you can download music, of course, but with this new iPod, you can download entire tv shows, music videos, video podcasts, and movie previews for a very low price.   The Positive: Well, first off, it plays video! You are probably asking, "Why would I want to watch an entire TV show on a 2 inch screen?" Well, this screen held about a foot in front of your face is about the same proportion to your eyes as a 25 in. TV from 7 feet away, so you will not be squinting to look at this screen, unless, of course, you already have bad vision! ;-)Plus, the video quality on this new screen is of extremely high quality! You can see the small details even on this relatively small screen. But, once again, whether or not you can see these details depends on your own state of eyesight.  Second, the battery life on the 30 GB model is 2 times longer that it was on the previous generations of iPods. On this iPod, the battery life is 14 hours!!! However, if you just use it to watch videos exclusively, the battery time is about 3-4 hours. I read a review of this somewhere that this iPod is not a Personal TV, It is still a mp3 player that just happens to play videos. Even with normal everyday use, you should still get 12-14 hours out of a single charge.   The Negative: My only problem with this new iPod is not with the iPod itself, but the lack of accessories that come with it. Like I said earlier, I already have an iPod mini, and for those of you out there with it, you know it came with a charger. However, you could only use this charger with the supplied FireWire cable. If you already have this, and wonder whether if this new iPod can be used with FireWire, the answers are Yes, only if you want to charge the battery, No if you want to transfer music. It is not capable of transfering information via FireWire. You can only use USB 2.0 with this iPod.   My other problem is the lack of decent looking cases that are available. This iPod does come with a leather pouch you can use to protect it from scratches, but if you want to change songs or adjust the volume, you have to take it out of the pouch, which is a relatively minor inconvenience. The pouch will have to hold you over until better looking and more protective cases are made for this next generation of iPod.   Overall, the iPod itself is amazing. However, the lack of decent accessories for this iPod, like cases, is troubling, but within the coming months, better accesories are sure to come onto the market.   A MUST BUY!!!

<Title>Great quality, but limited videos
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Although this should not have come as a great surprise to me, the 30 GB video iPod is great for storing tons of music and the quality of the videos it plays is fantastic - but only for the very few formats it will play.  If you plan on getting this because you already have a ton of movies in .mpeg, .avi, .wmv or other formats, beware that the iPod does NOT play these formats (while oddly enough iTunes plays them perfectly fine).  You must convert your videos into an "iPod friendly" format, but the only type of videos that will convert properly are .mov files.  .mpeg/mpg movies will convert, but all audio will be lost - you will only get the video.  On Apple's website, they list this as a common "problem" but offer no solution as to how to fix it.  So if you are buying this product simply to have maximum storage for songs, it is 5 star quality.  But if you are looking for a portable video player for videos you already own, 2 or 3 stars at best because of the compatability issues.

<Content>Great product.  Now I know why they are so popular.  I bought some Spongebob cartoons for a road trip to Disney world.  It kept the kids quiet the whole way.  I was able to hook it up to my LCD screen so they all could watch. Buying the episodes on itunes is cheaper than buying DVDs.  I put all my movies on it and filled it up so I wish I got the 60GB.

<Title>iPod video is number one
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ok, the ipod video is hands down the best mp3/video player on the market now. the video quality is great and the videos take up relatively a small amount of space. i can get a feature length movie to 700mbs w/jodix ipod converter or vidoera.  the sound quality is as good as it gets. since you get 30gbs of hard drive space, you should convert your songs to 192kbps or above(dont know if thats possible for itunes bought music that have the useless DRM, but it works on my cds). the bass is so much richer with 192. i recommend a different pair of headphones though. the ones bundled w/ipod are painful when you put them in. get one that have the rubber things that you put in your ear, not necessarily the noise canceling ones though. A case is a MUST HAVE. the thing will scratch up like crazy. protect your 300 dollar investment.  the closest competition is the creative zen vision:m. it has video playback and a 30gb hard drive at around the same price. people say its better because it has a radio, with voice and radio recording. come on people!! we're in the 21st century for those of you stuck in the 80s. who still uses their radio especially when they can get 30gbs of hi quality music and video??!!it boasts more battery life but i dont belive that. both  the ipod and the zen have 14 hrs of music, but the zen spontaneously has twice as much video playback time than ipod on a same size lcd screen?? that just doesnt make any sense to me. ipod is twice as thin as the creative zen vision:m and is 100x more popular!!

<Title>iPod - the truth
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are pro's and con's to every iPod, I will try to give an unbiased opinion, even though I like mine.    Con's first:  -Does scratch very easy -Video's need to be converted/compressed/transferred in a 'pain in the [...]' method, but once you have it down its okay. -Hard drive based(and this can arguably be a pro because it has much more space) -BECAUSE it is hard drive based, DO NOT GET THIS IPOD IF YOU PLAN TO JOG, OR BE MOVING AROUND MUCH WITH YOUR IPOD!!! HARDDRIVE BASED = spinning needle over a disc!   movement = SCRATCHING OF THE DISC AND POTENTIAL KILLING!  BUY A FLASH DRIVE BASED - such as the nano -Pricey, and accessories that are actually 'nessecities' aren't cheap either. -Comes only with USB cable/charger, no A/C adaptor! -Fairly small and difficult to hold for long periods of time(for me, I have big hands take this as a pro if you want). -Form's a "Link" with your unique copy of iTunes, which makes it unable to connect to another computer's iTunes to extract the music from the iPod (to prevent piracy) however this can be overruled with other software, just have to look for it. PRO'S  -30gb is a lot of room, most movies take up about 500-650 meg's a piece, thats nearly 50 movies if you don't have any songs on there! -Beautiful -Feel's pretty solid. -Standard headphone size jack. -EQ settings  -Nicely organized song's and folder's etc (if you have them labeled properly) -Sound quality is as good as the files you put on it!  Now some issues that people have with the iPod that I think are morons.  If you did any research you would know, HARDDRIVE BASED MP3 players are FRAGILE and not meant to be jogged with.  GO FOR A FLASH DRIVE BASED ONE.  Secondly, and lastly, the battery life.  I don't believe I've ever used my iPod (i have both an A/C and car adaptor) where I couldn't leave it plugged in, in fact I don't think I've ever killed the battery on my iPod.  Ever.  I accidently left it running once, 12 hours later still read 1/3 battery power, music blaring and all.  I DJ'ed my party with this beast, I love it and if you want an MP3 player + Video player,  I would suggest either this or the Vision M by Creative Labs, who also makes quality products. -Easy to use interface

<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have dozens of CDs that sit on the shelf because I am too lazy to rummage through them all when I want to listen to music.  The iPod makes it easy.  I am listening to stuff that I forgot I had.  It works good on the road too (if you have an AUX jack).  You can get a decent cord for about $15.  I didn't give 5 stars because I think close to $300 is steep; I assume these same players will be under $100 in a few years.

<Title>The only review you need to read... I think!
<Date>Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Alright... if you are reading this review chances are you are either really in love with the iPod and can't wait to get your hands on one, or, you are here to find out what all this fuss is about.  Either way, please read this review because it didn't come about lightly.  What I am about to tell you is my personal opinion, based on experience with the iPod and of course the associated tribulations.  I am a doctor so I am not a technology-guru so my review is from the point of view of a (very tech-savvy) but general user! Here are some thoughts you might be having:  1)  Should I get this or wait for Zune?  If you are one of those people who is up-to-date with tech news you probably have heard that Microsoft is about to come out with its own version of a music player called Zune.  So, you are probably thinking whether you should buy an iPod now or wait until November to buy a Zune.  I can't answer that question for you but I tell what I decided.  iPod has been around for almost five years now and believe it or not it is the industry standard now.  So even if Microsoft follows the footsteps of Sony, Creative and many other great companies to release a new player, well, there is NO guarantee that Zune will be any better than the current iPod competitors.  Besides, who wants a 1st generation of anything now-a-days!  With this iPod you know you are getting a proven product (with problems which I'll get to in a bit) and you know that at least you are not buying something that is going to be discontinued or abandoned by its manufacturer tomorrow (not implying that is what would happen with Zune but you never know...) ---- 2) iPod video or iPod nano?  This one is a bit tougher...  I am probably safe to assume that you currently have some kind of a portable music player (such as another mp3 player or even a cd player) that you use.  If you are just thinking of getting an iPod to blend in with the pack, well, save your money and do NOT buy the nano.  The iPod nano is no different than a Creative or SanDisk mp3 player (other than the fact that they will probably have more bells and whistles than the iPod nano.)  What I am getting at is that price of the nano (at $250) is clearly not justified because you really are just getting the same mp3 player.  And believe me, if you think it is just small and cool, check out a few other "tiny" music players on Amazon and you will see that they are dime-a-dozen.  Now, for an extra $30 you can get the iPod Video (the larger one) which will do much more than the nano.  With 30 GB of space (compared to 6 at best in the nano) you get heck of a lot more bang for your buck.  Besides lets not forget downloading cool TV shows and other video products that you would be able to play on your iPod video.  Also, there are rumors everywhere that apple is about to announce a new nano in August (7th) so maybe, you wanna wait and see if that amounts to anything before spending $250.  Also, if you are really crazy in love with the Nike-Apple cooperation and the new jogging iPod speedometer-thingy then yup, you should get yourself the nano because that kit only works with nano. --- 3)  What about the iPod itself?  God know that there are better players out there but then again we come back to it being so prevalent.  This is great news for you because you can find any accessory you could fathom for your iPod (on ebay).  So, you are covered that way but you definitely should be aware of the iPod's flaws.  First off, if you have heard that it easily scratches, BELIEVE IT!  I bought mine 5 days ago and I didn't take the plastic wrapping off until my case arrived.  But even in the best case (I'll tell you which one in a sec) it is extremely easy to scratch it.  If you are the type that puts their glasses down on the lenses side, then you will have one banged up iPod in a week!! This iPod is to be taken VERY well care of or else it is going to look awful in an instant.  As for the software and the hardware (sound) and everything else, it is of course excellent.  There is no problem in that sense. Just beware that it is very fragile and if you drop it, then well, you get the picture...  -- 4)  Accessories: What should/need I get?  There reason why I am going into this topic is because you should beware that the money you are about to spend can easily end up being $50-$100 more by the time you get the necessary add-ons.  The first thing you MUST get is a case.  Not a skin, but a hard case.  The BEST one out there is one being sold by apple itself too (I got mine on ebay for a little less) called the "Contour Design Showcase Video." It is truly the best case I have seen out there.  Also, get yourself an AV out wire that can hook your iPod to your TV.  Believe it or not is actually produces a great image on your TV.  The wire can be bought on ebay for less than a buck.  So, that is a great investment.  Also, get a cradle too so you don't have to keep bugging yourself with the included synch wire.  I would also STRONGLY recommend that you get a new set of headphones for a couple of reasons:  1)  The flagship white iPod Apple headphones are so distinct and obvious that EVERYONE will know you are listening to a $300 piece of electronics under you jacket.  So, don't use them in public because it makes you a BIG target.  Just google iPod theft and you'll see what I mean.  2)  Also, these headphones are truly awful.  It is really a shame because my small $10 Sony headphones are thousand times better.  So get yourself another cheap set of headphones too.  Overall, I would recommend this product.  The reason for the 4/5 stars is the problem with the unit getting scratched so easily.  Well, there are some pending suits against Apple for that so let's see if that gets us anywhere.  My biggest advice is to download the iTunes software from Apple.com first and play around with it a bit to learn about the iPod world more.  Chances are you have your own music (on CD's) and wanna transfer them to your beloved iPod.  That's good because buying music from iTunes is (in my opinion) not practical because the file has a thousand restrictions on it.  I am a HUGE fan of legal music because like every other hard-working honest American out there, I have no problem with paying for music.  But when I pay and still can't even use it fairly, then I'd rather buy the CD and truly OWN the tracks.    Good luck with your purchase!

<Title>30 GB is well-worth the money spent....
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first bought a Creative Zen: Vision M after reading the reviews and actually liked it a lot...until I started shopping for accessories for it. The big-chain electronics stores which sold the Zen did not even sell protective cases let alone adapters...I ended up taking back the Zen and bought the 30 GB iPod and I am very happy with it. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because the iPod lacks a nice feature that the Zen has: the ability to delete songs without hooking up to the computer. But why would I delete songs I put on my iPod of my own choosing anyway?    ....I love the fact that there are many accessories out there for the iPod. Apple has its competitors beat in this department. I bought a case very similiar to the expensive Vaja iVolution case...it totally encloses the iPod in a leather hard-shell case. I bought this case in Target. Plus I was able to shop around for a car charger (Monster brand- awesome!).   ...transferring songs to the iPod is a cinch although copy-right DVD's is a b---h...That is a challenge I'll master eventually; in the meantime I'll settle for music videos that iTunes has to offer...there are many of those to choose from. I am very satisfied with my new 30gb iPod overall...these babies are rated number one for a reason!

<Title>buyer beware
<Date>Mon Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought an ipod in feb. of 2006.  In july, it broke beyond use--the screen went.  I brought it in and was told that this had to be an accident and that it wasn't covered by warranty.  The thing is, I only carry it in my pocket, so I'm as gentle a user as can be.  This is a product that breaks while being used as designed--and costs too much in time and money for something that fragile.  I've spent hours loading music into itunes, but now I don't feel that i can afford to replace the player.  If you dance with it like they do in the commercials it'll break.

<Title>Wow!!!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the video iPod and frankly have found it to be one of the best new gadgets on the market.  Amazing picture quality and music quality is of course incredible and you can see the album cover of the record/cd the song was originally on.  You can also put literally hundreds of photographs on the unit - which is great if you have to travel a bunch and are away from the kids and family.  Only downside is that the downloadable videos on iTunes is somewhat limited and there are no full length movies.  However, that is likely to change as the demand for this excellent product continues.  Other caveats:  Don't buy one of the cheap plastic screen protectors "stickers" that are advertised on this and other sites.  It is literally impossible to get the thing on without having these annoying bubbles that pop up everywhere.  When you buy the iPod video, keep the sticker on it that comes with the unit and get yourself a good case with a plastic cover to further protect the screen.    I owned an iPod mini for about a year and really enjoyed it. This one surpassed my expectations.

<Title>QUESTION!
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Will someone please clear this up for me without exaggerating??? I'm planning on getting an iPod for my birthday(I haven't decided on where I'm getting it from yet though), but I don't want to get something that "breaks as soon as you get it out of the box" like people have been saying. Does it really need an armed national guard to keep it from scratching? I'll be getting a screen cover for it, but do I need to get a new case also- apart from the one included with the iPod? Does it scratch just by sitting in the case? Can you really break it by putting it in your pocket??? This will be my first iPod, so I'm pretty clueless on the durability. Then again, the same things were being said about the PSP when it first came out- "It breaks from a two foot drop", "It didn't work from the time I opened it"- none of these turned out to be true (know this from experience). So if anyone can answer these questions, it will be greatly appreciated.  PS- Does anyone know a reliable place where I can get the iPod from? Basically, as long as it's not broken or defective from the time I get it out of the box- I'll be happy.  Thanks!

<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my 30 gig iPOD for about 3 months now and I hate to admit it but I actually enjoy my wife's iRiver 256 MP3 player better than my iPOD. I can simply drag and drop folders(albums) of my favorite artists and albums from my MP3 server to my wife's mp3 player and they are sorted out just like they are on my server. The iPOD won't do this for you. Instead it relies on tag information about your songs. Any song that doesn't have this information gets put in the song directory and if you happen to love music like me, it can be quite frustrating scrolling like to locate the song that you want to hear. And trying to import homemade videos over to your iPOD? I've given up on that one. Trying to figure out why this wouldn't work almost made me throw the thing out the window! And this was after I paid for the new quicktime software that would allow for me to convert windows media files! Be careful because it can take away your technical self-esteem if you're not paying attention! Sorry Apple, but my next MP3 player will be a iRiver 20 gig (or 40 if they come out with one). But once you get it to work right, it definately is great!

<Title>3 and half stars :)
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ok guys. I've purchased this gadget from Amazon 4 weeks ago and now I would like to write something about it. First of all I am satisfied about the product concerning the alternatives. The biggest pluses are the capacity with the sleek design, big color screen, patented click-wheel, usb connectivity with all IBM based PCs, clear sound even at the low levels, album-art and lyrics storage via iTunes software.  The major drawbacks are these: After you start to use it you see that about 3 gigabytes are gone, so it is not actually 30 gigs but rather 27some. 2)Front cover is prone to scratches.. 3)Charge never goes over 10 hours if you skip songs and listen in high level of volume 4)Charge doesnot even close to 2 hours while video playback. 5)Forget using your video files that you have downloaded prior to your purchase. You should purchase all of them if you think quality playback is a must. I used a movie converter software which eventually ended up with a 1 second gap between the audio and the actual video playback. 6)Classical Apple policy applies. Means you have to pay lots of $$$ for buying any extra cable or accessories. 7)At least I hoped that Apple would pre-load the video file of Bono-U2 with compliments which was not the case -naive huh!- 8)Battery not-replacable by the user. That way I could have carried an extra battery on Atlantic flights. 9)Currently you can only read short txt files, only after copying the txt file under a certain folder. Might be helpful for shopping lists. It would be nice if Apple placed a pdf/doc reader. At least a word document reader. Maybe in the 6th generation. 10)Aha.. I forgot! It takes 8 seconds to start a video file after you execute. It also takes several seconds to execute the next mp3 song if you skip 2 or more songs. eg. I skip 3-4 songs at a time, and than it takes 6-10 seconds to execute the next song in your list.  Some remarks: During mp3/song playback, it also plays video files that you categorized in "Video Music". Since it consumes more battery power you can check the option to skip video music files using iTunes. But than this skipping process costs you 3-5 seconds.  To get rid of these bothersome skipping-delays, I used windows "Disk Defragmanter" after I placed many files and changed album-art and lyrics. During analysis, the hard drive seemed too much fragmanted. This operation is suggested to be helpful at some forums through the internet, but it was not the case for me. Please note that I have saved 2-to-8 pictures and half-to-1 page lyrics and some other trivia information into the song files using iTunes. Most of the pictures are 200*200 pixels but some are up to 800*600. These additions might be the cause of the problem (which of course should not be under normal conditions!).  Another remark is that Amazon does not let you back engraving. But concerning that you pay 9.25% tax in Tennessee, it costs about $35 more if I bought from Apple (Jan. 2006 prices).  Finally, I really know that this much price is not well deserved for something that is manufactured in China, not in the US; but the main reason is that the rivals suck and Apple knows its position in the competition very well. There is not much to say.. PS:ipod movie converter or iTunes PRO are about 30 bucks.

<Content>This is one of the best ipods yet! Some of my family members have various other ipods, such as the ipod nano and the ipod mini, all of which I have used, but to get the most out of your money, a video ipod is the best idea. It has a beautiful display and is actually very compact, without being ridiculously small like the nano. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because downloading videos from the music store (itunes) can take a long time, like 25-40 minutes per show. Also, I have had trouble downloading tv show seasons completely. But, aside from that, the ipod itself is the BEST!

<Content>All of the other review cover just about everything, exept one thing. People say their batery dosen't last as long as it says it will, but keep in mind it takes more power to see movies and pictures than it dose to listen to a song. So the batter life is acctually correct if you only listen to songs. A whole tv show (about 45 min) uses up about 1/2 of the battery. So keep that in mind, it is acctually the best battery I have ever had. It is defintly worth your money as long as you love to watch music video's and tv shows and stuff. The picture quality is amazing! It is one of the best inverstment I have ever made.

<Title>Great New Features...but Some "Caveat Emptor", Too
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The battery on my 3G finally turned in its notice. So I upgraded tothe 30gb iPod with video.  PROS:  - The video! The screen resolution is amazing. Coldplay's "Speed of Sound" video, with its amazing rainbows of colors, makes your iPod come alive.  - The iTunes Video library! A very worthy selection of videos are available for you to make your own. Christopher Walken dancing in "Weapon of Choice", Stone Temple Pilots' trippy "Days of the Week", Foo Fighter's "Learning to Fly", Alanis' "Everything"--great stuff.   - The memory! 30 gb is twice what I supported before. More than enough room (for now)!  - The podcasts! I've been a huge fan of Jack Horkheimer's "Star Gazer" program on PBS. Now I can watch these episodes as podcasts right from the palm of my hand.    CONS:  - Yes, the biggest is the battery. And not so much because the battery for video will last--yes--an hour or so, but because once again Apple is totally...TOTALLY... misleading prospective buyers. Since when did Apple get so crooked?? The specs state "up to 2 hours". Sure--maybe with the backlight off. But me, personally, I'd like to see what I'm watching. How do they think people can actually watch whole movies on this thing?? Do I smell "class action, part II" here?  - The lack of support for older perihperals. You won't find one of those interface ports on these. So toss away your former accessories.   - No firewire support. It's all now totally usb, baby. And the included white USB cable is about three feet long. You don't get much distance from the pc to the tabletop.   - No dock connector. Although if you have an old iPod dock you can still use it. Just pop out the old cable and plug in the new USB cable.   - No instruction manual. There's a .pdf file on the disk that you can drag and drop to your pc desktop, but no opportunities for bathroom reading here. And am I the only one who finds Adobe Acrobat a bit annoying?   - The screen scratches. I'm so paranoid about this that I've just left the cellophane sheet on (the one that that comes on the iPod when you first get it). I just peel it back and let it flap back down to eliminate bubbles.   There you have it...

<Title>Bought it with hesitation, but.....
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Mostly on a whim, I purchased the 30GB white video ipod. Amen to the tax return.  I started looking at the 2GB, but figured for $50 more I could get the 4GB. But then with the 4GB, I saw that for $50 more I could get 7 times the song storage and the ability to do video, so the 30GB won out.    Admittedly, I feared the ipod.  I thought iTunes would be a nightmare and that the ipod would break after an hour.  Fortunately, I was wrong.  When I loaded the iTunes CD into my computer, it allowed me to transfer all of my Windows music library into it, only about 100 songs.  It took a little fiddling to figure out how to get those songs into the ipod, but when I did they all worked and the ipod didn't reject any of them for format reasons.  Whew, I was beginning to think that maybe this ipod would be a good thing.   Then I thought, aha, I will try to buy an iTunes song, and something will happen then, something bad.  But it didn't.  I bought 1 song and it downloaded and it was all good.  Then I said, time to try buying a music video.  Again, to my amazement, it all worked.  The only problem was that I had dialup, and to download a 3+ minute video took almost an hour.  I don't see how I can download a LOST episode at that rate.    So, in all, I am happy with this ipod.  We bought a case right away and scratching hasn't been an issue.   The sound is good with the ear buds, although I use different headphones.  I have a Creative Muvo 256mb player also, and others have written that the Creative sounds better, but to me, they are comparable.  As for the Creative Muvo, the FM portion of that player died within 3 weeks of having it, as did all my controls except for play/pause/stop and volume.  Course it didn't cost $300, so I hope the ipod has a good future here.

<Title>Don't hate! Buy a video iPod instead!
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to be 'what is so special about the ipod?'. Well, with the purchase of my white, 30GB video ipod, I now know the answer. I'm more than thrilled with my ipod. First, it's great looking. Simple, elegant, timeless. Size for me is perfect. Not to big, but big enough to hold easily. It's got a good weight to it. The screen is a nice size with great viewing angles and colors. Easy to use-before buying, I was looking at the Creative Zen Vision M. I went to Best Buy to test them both out. I was able to figure out the ipod with no problem. The ZVM wasn't as easy. The user interface on the ipod is darn easy to use and understand. And now for features. Holy smokes. I'm doing things with my ipod I didn't think I would. I'll list them.  1. Music-yes, it's the obvious use of the ipod. But my entire collection of songs and other MP3 files (close to 2000) fit on here. No more redoing what's on my MP3 or burning CD's. I've got it all in one device!  2. Photos-I have 9800 digital pictures. And every single one of them are now stored in my ipod! I can now take my vacation pictures everywhere and show everyone! Plus, the color screen makes them look great, and the slideshow with it's fun transitions is cool.  3. Notes-I'm always jotting notes onto the 'notepad' feature on my PC. And now, I can take those .txt files from the notepad and put them on my ipod for viewing! Recipes, directions, list, reminders, etc. It's super nice to be able to keep such documents handy.  4. Podcasts-Now, these aren't exclusive to the ipod, but having video makes my world of podcast open. I can watch Tiki TV or the latest Edmund's New Car Test Drive. And most podcasts are free!  5. Video-As mentioned above, video for the podcasts is great. But I can also download popular tv shows. It sounds like overkill, but how about those waits on the bus, at the airport, in the doctor's office, etc. Or how about being able to watch a show in bed and never wake the other half up? The quality is great, even on a little screen.  6. Calendar-I can sync up my Outlook calendar so that I'll have my schedule with me at all times. How awesome is that? Plus you can set reminder alarms. All entrys happen on the computer, but I synch up everyday, so not a problem.  7. Contacts-You can also synch up your contacts list. So now I'll have my whole email and telephone list at my disposal.  8. Other fun stuff-4 games, world clocks, alarms, sleep timer, stopwatch.  9. iTunes-Now you don't have to have an ipod to use itunes. And I guess you don't need iTunes to use your ipod. But it will make life soooo much easier! Auto synching, buy, listen and manage everything within iTunes!   Overall, I overcame the anti-ipod feelings and I'm so glad I did. This really is a great little device that does more than you'll ever expect it to.

<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my 4th iPod (had the 1st gen, 3rd gen, and shuffle before), and Apple has a true winner with the video iPod.  I couldn't be happier!  I purchased this before taking a vacation to Europe, loaded it up with movies, tv shows, and podcasts; I made so many people jealous on the flight over.  Bought the Belkin battery pack so that it would keep a charge for many many hours while watching video.  I also have the camera connector, which allowed me to transfer my pictures everyday to the iPod and free up my memory card.  I listen to the iPod at work, in my car (avoid FM transmitters, go for a stereo with an aux port), wherever.  It's truly become a part of my life.  To the reviewer below, Ryan Mikel Farquhar:  Apple offers an excellent 1yr warranty that comes included with the price of your iPod.  Don't bash Apple because you don't know how to use it.  They will replace/repair your iPod if it really does not work.

<Title>How to deal with importing Audiobooks from CD, Great product!
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For some, an iPod is all about music. Primarily, I use my iPod to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. I either buy the audiobooks at the bookstore or borrow them from the public library, where they are often available on CD.  The problem is that a straightforward ripping operation from CD yields dozens of unorganized tracks in your iTunes library. On the iPod display, one can often see the uninformative title of 'Track 1' without knowing to which Disc it belongs. It's also distinctly possible that the iPod won't play the tracks in the correct order.   Here's the recipe (PC version) that I've come up with to effectively import audiobooks from CD to your iPod 1. Make sure that iTunes uses AAC format to import audio. AAC files can be made bookmarkable, while MP3 files cannot. Under the Edit menu, choose Preferences. Select the 'Advanced' tab, then the 'Importing' tab and choose 'AAC Encoder'. 2. Open iTunes and place the audiobook CD in the drive. The CD will then appear in iTunes. 3. If you are online, the automatic lookup service may provide the title information or you can manually select 'Get CD Track Names' under the Advanced menu. If nothing comes, then 'Select All' under the Edit menu and right click to 'Get Info'. Fill in the artist/author, album/book title and disc information. Choose 'Books & Spoken' as the Genre and under 'Compilation' select 'No' 4. Joining the tracks. Each CD usually has dozens of tracks on it which are rarely recognized by the automatic lookup service. Thus, joining the tracks from one disc into one track makes the content more manageable. Select all of the CD's tracks and choose 'Join CD Tracks' under the 'Advanced' menu. 5. Select all tracks and either drag them into the Library to start the importation or click the 'Import CD' button in the upper right hand corner. 6. After the importation finishes, click on Library, select the freshly imported track and right-click to 'Get Info'. You'll notice that the same title is in the fields, Name and Album. Under the Name field, add the disc number to the title (ie. title D1). If there are more than 9 discs, put an additional 0 (ie. 'D01') so that D10 doesn't confuse the playing order.  Make sure that the Album name is just the title. This way all of the disc tracks will be neatly categorized under the album name on your iPod. 7. Artwork is a nice touch, especially if you have a Video iPod. Usually, you can find and save the cover image from amazon.com or by googling the title image. After importing all of the audiobook discs, click on Library, select all the audiobook tracks and right-click to 'Get Info'. Select the 'Artwork' tab and add the saved cover image. You can alternatively drag the artwork from the webpage into the artwork box on the bottom left. 8. Sync your iPod and enjoy your book!

<Content>I love my iPod Video 5G and I hardly ever go anywhere without it. No more lugging around CD's, or a bulky CD player with iPod you have it all right there at your fingertips. I love it. You can download all sorts of things, not only music. You can put pictures, and videos too. Not only music videos but you can download your favorite tv show to watch on your iPod! It's beautifully designed, light and thin. With tons of room for everything you want to put on it. I'm a college student and it really helps to have something that doesn't take up much space in my backpack. Overall this is an amazing item and the best choice for mp3 players. I would buy this item again, definately.

<Title>A great product overall
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my 30 GB iPod since Christmas, and it's great. Everyone says this when they write a review, but it's great to carry around 1600 songs and 360 photos all in one little package. (I have SpongeBob SquarePants episode, also.)   As everyone knows, the thing scratches practically if you look at it the wrong way. When I first got the iPod, I knew this and got a case and a scratch remover because I was paranoid about it getting scratched. Fortunately, it's sustained minimal damage and the scratch remover gets out most of the scratches.   My biggest complaint is that a lot of the time, when I import songs from CDs, some of the tracks skip and I end up spending an eternity deleting them, re-importing them, and listening to them to make sure they don't still skip. I am yet to meet anyone else who has this problem. It's not that the CDs are scratched, because sometimes my old CDs are fine and brand new ones I just bought have songs that skip. The most annoying thing is that since the songs keep skipping, even after deleting and importing them over and over again, they still skip and I often find myself having to buy songs from iTunes that I already have. It's annoying beyond belief. What's worse is sometimes they make you buy the whole album. There is no way I'm paying $10 for an album when I only need one song from it. One I already have.  ...Otherwise, I have no other problems. The iPod itself is great; it's iTunes that annoys me. The battery life leaves something to be desired, but it's really not bad at all if you use the backlight sparingly.

<Content>My wife always loved my 1st Gen. iPod Mini. I would never let it go long enough for her to use it always taking it with me to work, the gym, and running.  So, after oggling my co-workers stylish Nano for a few weeks I bought her one for our anniversary. She loved it. I loved it. I wanted one.  Sold my Mini on that auction site.  I decided to get a 30GB Video... I figured the increased size and video capabilities would come in handy. WOW! I love this thing.  * lots of space * Video is very usable on the tiny screen. * Video outputs to my TV and looks great! * I can carry recent pictures of my kid! * con: seems slow to start up * con: comes MAC formatted... I didn't realize this until I had used my PowerBook to load it up. When I hooked it up to my PC (where all my music is) I had to format the thing... lost all my Video, Contacts, Calanders, and Pics... have to redo that. * MAJOR CON: NO belt clip suitable for running. Crappy selection of cases for sports use. * marginally heavier than my Mini, tucks nicely into the pocket on a FuelBelt... though I resent wearing a belt on short runs.  iPod + Nike accessory just came out. I don't think it's compatable, which stinks. I'm buying that gadget, too... for my wife :)

<Title>Great player --- Terrible batteries
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Having an iPod is wonderful. You get to have a substantial chunk of your music collection in a small portable device. Being able to play video is wonderful as well.   The problem is the battery and memory on these things fail all the time! The battery life is always diminishing. After a few months you'll start to notice the battery life losing a few hours and then maybe after a year it will be to the point where it crashes all the time. My current iPod has to be plugged into the dock or wall to function. It's annoying.   The good thing is that Apple is good with their warranty and you can send them in for a new battery. Or for a fee of like fifty dollars or so you can get the battery replaced after the warranty expires. Going through this is really annoying though.   In the end I hope Microsoft or Sony can come up with a good alternative. Yes, Apple is a hip company but I'm always in favor of good solid competition and options available in the market place as opposed to just settling on one company with brilliant marketing strategies.   That's my review.

<Title>Get an Ipod !!!!
<Date>Sun Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my ipod its a 30GB viedo white it holds a good amount of songs and viedos  and i have no promblems with it. Except i dont like how the battery runs out so fast , so if you are getting a new ipod i reccomend buying a car charger and a home plug charger because sometimes you arent near a computer and you need your ipod charged. so you can listen non-stop to your ipod. Oh and i reccomend a cover for the ipod, if you are like me you drop things sometimes ,when that happens ipod's back mirror is going to covered with scratches and it looks very bad so buy a plastic cover to protect it. Oh and if you arent a very patient i reccomend you to charge your ipod every night so during the day you dont have to wait for that thing to waste your time. oh and this is super IMPORTANT if you are planning to be in different houses you should always register it to the computer and copy all the songs on itunes or whereever to every computer so you dont lose any music , because if you have multiple accounts on the computers the program asks if you want to replace all the songs on that computer to go on your ipod and all the current songs on your ipod get deleted ( it happened to me)luckly i copyied all the songs to a file so when i got home i just put all the other songs back on and if you want the songs at another place just put them on a cd and just load the songs on your main computer, Oh and it helps to copy the songs because if some-how you get a virus on the computer it will delete ALL the music you have on itunes so if you copyed it it was saved to the computer so you can pull it back up but if you dont want to copy the songs you can always copy the songs to a cd. I saw at the apple website that you can personlize an back of a ipod for free although the shipping takes a while and the cost is alittle bigger than the one here but if you really want it personlized message on the back i would get it.

<Title>Review Worth Reading! Read This!
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, the ipod video has everything one could want in a portable mp3 player. It plays music, video, shows pictures, has games, contacts, calender, world clock, and a stopwatch. With 30gb, its alsmost impossible to fill it up so there are no worries about room remaining. And at only .4 inches thick its almost half as thick as its competitor, the Creative product, which is .7 inches thick. The main flaw, which will be found with anything that plays video, is ALL dvds are protected so they cant be burned onto ANY computer. One way around this is to use a program called M2 Convert, this program is illegal but I've heard from multiple friends that it works great. It bypasses the protective encoding, burns the DVD onto your computer, and converts it to MPEG-4 format so it is compatible with the iPod video. Just download the program, insert your DVD, and start the 3-hour process. Doing a google search on it should be helpful to find it. The legal way around this, and out of your wallet, is to buy from iTunes. TV shows are 1.99 as are music videos, movie trailers, ect. Compared to .99 for a 4 minute song, the deal doesnt seem so bad. If you get anything from this review BUY A CASE IMMEDIALTY, I read other reviews and learned that the easy way, because who wants a scratched up iPod. Ebay is a cheap place for cases, get one wih a plastic screen protecter, not a clear film because those dont work at all.I really enjoy my iPod, you will too!

<Title>iPod a poor portable image storage device
<Date>Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a newly professional photographer, I walked into an Apple Store to price iBooks to take on the road to upload images from my digital SLR. The sales reps pointed to the iPod as a low-priced alternative, with an optional USB adaptor for cameras. I'm not into iTunes, but it was slick because it's pocket-size - perfect when you're packing lots of photo gear or need to clear and reuse your camera memory in the wilderness. (A sales rep/photographer said her iPod reduced the number of memory cards she needed.) But it's been a disaster.  What the sales reps didn't reveal to this iPod ignoramous was that you also have carry a computer (USB 2, no less) on the road just to charge it (the only device I've ever seen that can't be charged by plugging into a wall outlet!) - not to mention even seeing what's on the iPod hard drive! It's not an alternative to a laptop at all; it's a very parasitic accessory. This makes it useless as a lightweight, self-contained image storage device that can carry 60GB of irreplaceable images home to my PowerMac. If I have to carry an iBook in my camera bag, what do I need the iPod for?   Because the only laptop I could pack after discovering the charging problem was USB 1, I now have a dead iPod and no way to store my pictures. Today I'll go out and buy something else for this trip and return the iPod when I get back.

It also has features like a calculater, games, etc. I really love its picture and video quality- It's better than my TV! This is a really great little device (it's not too big, either!) and makes a wonderful gift. I can't stop singing its praises! By the way, if you decide on getting one, I highly suggest buying a travel charger to go with it. That way, you don't have to bring along your laptop and the travel charger works just as well as the regular and is a whole lot cheaper.

<Title>Passable, but keep looking... this is not an iPod Video... it's an MP3 player with video playback
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There is a lot that this has the offer, and a lot that this lacks.  After 4 previous generations of iPods, they have yet to have a built in FM Tuner, Voice Recording, or FM Recording standard in every Creative Zen.  The battery life of iPods is still just mediocre, and the face scatches incredibly too easy.  All of these issues and concerns will be in the following review.  Screen - The screen does have a reasonable resolution, with a decent amount of colors, but the lack of viewing angles and desaturation make this not the BEST screen on the market, but surely one of the better ones.  Glare is surprisingly not as bad as I thought it would be, but I'd still get a warranty for those scratches.  Design - The most beautiful iPod yet.  I have to give it to Apple, they make beautiful merchandise.  Sleek, sophisticated, and now awesome with the new black color introduced from the Nano.  The click-wheel is still the most innovative design seen on an MP3 player, and the now much thinner design make it much more portable.  The downside of the smaller size is that it doesn't feel natural in your hand, and they could have rounded off the edges more to make it seem less jagged.  The glossy coated plastic on the front scratches just as the Nano, but if you have a protective case, it remains in its beautiful form factor.  Price - Reasonable price for the package.  Mid-ranged amongst the MP3s with video feature.  Commonly a misconception, this is not designed to be a video player.  Apple has stated this all along and is actually coming out with specified iPod Video with a much larger screen and hopefully supporting more video codecs.  Starting at $299.99 for the 30GB model, it is definately a great bargain.  The 60GB model is the sweet number in my opinion, especially for more of the videofiles rather than audiofiles.  Battery - Standard.  Nothing groundbreaking.  The video playback barely lasts a movie, so that's a problem they'll have to fix.  Maybe 2 to 3 hours tops on movies.  Features - Less codecs than some of the other MP3 players by Archos, Creative, and Cowan, but like I said, it's an MP3 player with video.  Some of DivX's codecs aren't featured, but like any movie file, you can convert through a serious of programs, or use iTunes and actually pay for movies.  iTunes does have a VERY large number of available movies and programs from NBC to MTV, and is continually growing.  Rumor has it that ESPN is next after featuring its new mobile ESPN at the Super Bowl.  Apple is very fickle however, making iTunes the only compatible program (there are some, but none as good as WMP or iTunes) and there are no subscription services compatible either.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a good MP3 player with video playback, spend $30 dollars more and get a Creative Zen Vision: M, if you're looking for an iPod Video, wait until April.

<Title>Best iPod yet, but scratches as easily as the Nano!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As of this writing, no reviews are from someone who actually HAS one of the new iPods (10/19). That is about to change....   My 40GB iPod's hard disk had been deteriorating for a while, until it stopped working altogether. That happened to be the day before the iPod video announcement (last Tuesday).   On to what you really want to know, and what you can't get from Apple's website, or reviews regurgitating technical specifications:   1) Can you actually enjoy watching video on a screen that small? What about the video quality?   In short, if you're holding the iPod as close to your face as you would hold an older iPod to really read what song is playing, the video quality is actually quite nice. The screen is noticeably bigger (the height is about the size of the old iPod width). If you're wondering how the quality comes out on an iPod screen (which is normally fairly pixelated), when you load a video it toggles into a mode much akin to when a computer plays a graphics intensive video game. It takes about 10 seconds for a feature-length film to load (i.e., between clicking play, and when it starts playing).   With regard to movies, the iPod doesn't support chapters. My guess is that people will eventually want movies distributed as folders, witch chapters being the individual files. This will allow chapter skipping. That said, once a movie loads, fast forwarding works very well.   I loaded a fairly graphics-intensive movie on there, at about the highest quality the iPod would allow. The actions scenes come out fine...about what you would expect for an MPGE4.   2) What the heck does this thing actually look like in your hand?   It is about the size of older iPods. It is thinner (a lot thinner, if, like me you are upgrading from a non-photo Gen4 40gb). The front is a flat screen, much like the iPod nano, but bigger. The clickwheel is a bit smaller than it was on older iPods, but bigger than that of a nano.   3) The screen   I have to say, the bigger screen is nice in and of itself. If you have longer track names (if you have live music, etc.) a lot more of the name will appear. This is a very nice subtlety since in oder to read a song title you don't need to wait......for....it....to.....scroll....   4) Is it worth it?   Jobs called this a regular iPod with "video capability." I'd say the video capabilities are a little better than that gives it credit for. I don't yet have a composite adapter, so I can't see how this comes out on a TV...   With regard to exporting video to TV, there ARE the following options:  TV Out (on/off)  Video Signal (NTSC/PAL)  Widescreen (on/off)   If your iPod is breaking, or is pretty old, I'd definitely upgrade. If you travel a lot or have downtime where you could hold the device pretty close to your face (train, airplane, etc.), I'd definitely get it. If you don't have much time to enjoy the video capabilities, then it probably isn't worth it.   5) Firewire   The tech specs didn't say anything about firewire, so I had been wondering whether it is supported. It actually is not supported at all. In fact, I tried connecting via my old firewire cable, and the iPod brought up a screen that said something like, "firewire is not supported. Please use the supplied USB cable."   6) The "case"   I saw that a case was included on the Apple website...basically the case, as you might suspect, is pretty bad. I got a 60GB model, and it barely squeezes into the case. That said, cases that support the new screen will likely be unavailable for 3 weeks or so (if what happened with the nano repeats itself), and so it is ncie to have SOMETHING to prevent you from scratching your new screen (which is now more important because it plays video).   Anyway, I hope this answers any questions you might have. I've tried to stick to differences between this beauty and the iPod photo.   If you're still on the fence, let me say this...go for it. It is really quite nice.

<Content>This latest ipod is the best one yet. Lets start of with looks. It has a big screen for better showing the ipod titles. i reccomend getting the white version and getting a colored skin. i did that with the blue skin and it looks great. the 30gb has alot alot of memory. it should be able to keep up with ur playlist, unless you have like 30,000 biblical songs. it is very skinny and is comfortable to hold and store. the video playback is very good. the quality of it is actually not bad. the iTunes store sells music videos and TV shows like Lost and Suite Life for only 2 dollars and they turn out really good. or you can put ur own, but you need to download software. podcasts are great and there free. it also has many other attachments, like photo-viewing, international clocks, stopwatch, text file applications and so much more! this is a very good mp3 player, and you won't be dissapointed if you buy it. trust me.

My 40GB iPod's hard disk had been deteriorating for a while, until it stopped working altogether. That happened to be the day before the iPod video announcement (last Tuesday).   On to what you really want to know, and what you can't get from Apple's website, or reviews regurgitating technical specifications:   1) Can you actually enjoy watching video on a screen that small? What about the video quality?   In short, if you're holding the iPod as close to your face as you would hold an older iPod to really read what song is playing, the video quality is actually quite nice. The screen is noticeably bigger (the height is about the size of the old iPod width). If you're wondering how the quality comes out on an iPod screen (which is normally fairly pixelated), when you load a video it toggles into a mode much akin to when a computer plays a graphics intensive video game. It takes about 10 seconds for a feature-length film to load (i.e., between clicking play, and when it starts playing).   With regard to movies, the iPod doesn't support chapters. My guess is that people will eventually want movies distributed as folders, witch chapters being the individual files. This will allow chapter skipping. That said, once a movie loads, fast forwarding works very well.   I loaded a fairly graphics-intensive movie on there, at about the highest quality the iPod would allow. The actions scenes come out fine...about what you would expect for an MPGE4.   2) What the heck does this thing actually look like in your hand?   It is about the size of older iPods. It is thinner (a lot thinner, if, like me you are upgrading from a non-photo Gen4 40gb). The front is a flat screen, much like the iPod nano, but bigger. The clickwheel is a bit smaller than it was on older iPods, but bigger than that of a nano.   3) The screen   I have to say, the bigger screen is nice in and of itself. If you have longer track names (if you have live music, etc.) a lot more of the name will appear. This is a very nice subtlety since in oder to read a song title you don't need to wait......for....it....to.....scroll....   4) Is it worth it?   Jobs called this a regular iPod with "video capability." I'd say the video capabilities are a little better than that gives it credit for. I don't yet have a composite adapter, so I can't see how this comes out on a TV...   With regard to exporting video to TV, there ARE the following options:  TV Out (on/off)  Video Signal (NTSC/PAL)  Widescreen (on/off)   If your iPod is breaking, or is pretty old, I'd definitely upgrade. If you travel a lot or have downtime where you could hold the device pretty close to your face (train, airplane, etc.), I'd definitely get it. If you don't have much time to enjoy the video capabilities, then it probably isn't worth it.   5) Firewire   The tech specs didn't say anything about firewire, so I had been wondering whether it is supported. It actually is not supported at all. In fact, I tried connecting via my old firewire cable, and the iPod brought up a screen that said something like, "firewire is not supported. Please use the supplied USB cable."   6) The "case"   I saw that a case was included on the Apple website...basically the case, as you might suspect, is pretty bad. I got a 60GB model, and it barely squeezes into the case. That said, cases that support the new screen will likely be unavailable for 3 weeks or so (if what happened with the nano repeats itself), and so it is ncie to have SOMETHING to prevent you from scratching your new screen (which is now more important because it plays video).   Anyway, I hope this answers any questions you might have. I've tried to stick to differences between this beauty and the iPod photo.   If you're still on the fence, let me say this...go for it. It is really quite nice.

<Content>I would have given this, my second ipod, 5 stars but for one troubling detail. The new ipods connect via usb and NOT firewire. This means if you have a mac older than 3 years (usb 1) your file transfers will be painfully slow. It took almost 5 hours to move my measly 13gb worth of files!!!!! For some reason Apple chose not to support firewire in this model. This makes my firewire cables obsolete. It's pretty annoying. Otherwise it's absolutely fabulous

It is so much better than a portable CD player, simply because I don't have to carry all of my CD's with me when I travel, and I can have more songs in one spot than I really know what to do with.

<Date>Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I HAVE HAD THREE IPODS ALREADY, I HAD 2 NANOS AND  THIS VIDEO WHICH IS HONESTLY THE BEST MP3 PLAYER I HAVE EVER OWNED, THE ONE THING THAT WAS HARD TO GET USED TO WAS THE MEMORY STORAGE DIFFERENCE FLASH TO HARD DRIVE, WHEN I FIRST USED MY VIDEO I WAS FRIGHTENED WHEN IT STARTED RUMBLING, I WAS LIKE " WTF???????" AND THEN I REALIZED OH YEA, HARD DRIVE!   IT HAS A NICE SCREEN TO, WHEN I COMPARED A NANO TO A VIDEO I WAS BLOWN AWAY,THEY ARE CLOSE IN "THINESS" THE SCREEN ON THE VIDEO IS ALMOST AS BIG AS THE NANO ITSELF AND DON'T EVEN TRY TO COMPARE THE NANO'S SCREEN TO THE VIDEO'S NO CONTEST.  TRY TO IMAGINE WATCHING VIDEOS ON THE NANO'S 1.5 INCH SCREEN, BUT I HAVE TO SAY I WILL MISS MY NANO, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS IM NOT LIMITED TO ONLY 1 IPOD!!!  I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE VIDEO AND HOW THE SCREEN IS LIKE 3 TIMES THE SIZE OF THE VIDEO'S CLICK WHEEL, I THOUGHT THEY JUST PULLED THE CLICK WHEEL OFF OF THE NANO.  THE 2.5 INCH SCREEN ON THE VIDEO IS AMAZING, THE VIDEO CAPABILITIES ARE BREATHTAKING!!  I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET THIS BECAUSE I LIKE MY ELECTRONICS THIN, RAZR,NANO, PS TWO, ETC. BUT THIS IS VERY VERY THIN, BUT IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER WHY THEY COULDN'T MAKE THIS FLASH TO? THAT WAY IT COULD BE "PENCIL THIN" LIKE THE NANO, OWELL IT'S STILL NICE, AND IF YOU WANT A GOOD CASE FOR THE 30GB OR 60GB VIDEO GET THE PACIFIC DESIGN CASE CARBON BLACK WITH A RED STRIPE, I HAD ONE FOR MY NANO AND NOW I HAVE ONE FOR MY VIDEO TOO!!  BUY ONE YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!  ANYWAY FOR MORE INFO READ THE OTHER REVIEWS OR JUST GO TO APPLE AND READ THAT STUFF.   ( i am on my fourth IPOD i had to send mine back and get a new one b/c my computer gave it a virus.)

<Content>I know Apple has their big industry and everything, so I guess that is why i purchased this product, trusting that if i had any problems, i could always go to the store. so far, this product has satisfied me. it doesn't run out of battery as quickly as i thought it would, but then i don't use it for more than 1 hour straight each time. although it says that whenever you plug it into your computer [the only way to charge it without buying a separate tool] it will update the news songs added to your computer onto the ipod, but it doesn't do so! that's the only thing bad about it. other than that, the ipod is easy to handle, and the videos are high quality (light has to be turned on).

The only problem is it's SO small that I would suggest you buy a protective case of some kind. The iPod is so delicate that I don't think it would take much to break it.  I bought the Rhino clear/aluminum case and it's great.  It's my best gadget to date.

<Date>Fri Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't believe I begged my mother to buy me a Nano the day RIGHT BEFORE THIS ONE CAME OUT!!!!!! I am really sad because my Nano's battery belongs in the garbage. Leaving the backlight off, my iPod lasted a close to exact 1 hour and 45 minutes when I was in the car on the way to Maine. Now Apple comes out with this iPod. This iPod may also not have the best battery life, but at least I can watch videos such as Spongebob, Lost, etc... I got the 4gb Nano for a fu***** $263 w/ tax. This iPod is only $52 more. The case for my Nano does not protect it well. You would expect a plastic case to hold it in the case and protect it. Well I guess I'm wrong. The cases for this iPod are much more quality, Agent 18, Speck... I bought the Contour iSee that I could barely get my Nano out at the beginning. When their site gave me instructions, the case opened perfectly, but the WHOLE SIDE OF THE CASE CRACKED. Now, today, 2/17, when I come back from my bowling league, my Nano died when it was half way charged before I went to school this morning. The Nano was a big waste of money, and I know have a dead, scratched up Nano. Now I will try to beg my mother for a new QUALITY iPod to watch videos and have more Quality cases to protect it...........

The replay of movies on this item is absolutely crystal clear and the sound, well you've heard the clarity of the music, do I need to say more. If you want a transportable item to take your music and videos with you, this is it, hands down! iTunes needs to come up with a way to work around firewalls though. The only drawback I've experienced so far is the inconvenience and unsafety of having to disable my firewall while downloading a video, but other then that it's great and the price is right there!

<Title>One of the best things I've bought this year
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I intially hated iPods.  A couple of my friends had the 4th gen 30gb and they were nice.  But still, I was like when will I use them.  I have a laptop for music and movies and I buy cds for my car.  Then I started seeing them pop up at work listening to music all day during work.  I work at a call center and they told me it blocks out the sound from everyone else and allows you to only hear the music and the customer, thus making your day more fun.  So I finally started to piece things together.  I have a big cd collection and I'm afraid of them getting scratched and not being able to play.  So one day I decided to travel to Wal-Mart and pick up the Black iPod Video 30gb.  Once I got it and figured out what i could do with it I was amazed I waited so long to get one.  The ease of use is really there.  Just use the clickwheel, find an artist, find a song, and then press play.  Even video's look amazing on that small screen.  I only watch them at work when it's really slow and I have enough time to actually see them.  Pros: My whole music collection on one item Awesome screen Sleek black design Durable Ease of use Many different accessories  Cons: Back part gets insane scratches on them.  Its not a big deal but still looks not too nice. The video function is very hard to figure out Between songs there is a 1sec or shorter lapse.  Not a huge deal, just annoying on songs that go right into the next one on albums.  I'll explain the video part more.  You'd think the ease of dropping songs into itunes would transfer to the video portion.  Not quite.  You have to have converted files for iPod to be able to mount them on your iPod.  iTunes only converts certain files.  And it also takes about 20 minutes for a small 1 minute file.  So I asked a friend and he found me a freeware converter called Videora.  Its free, easy to use, and takes a lot less time.  It also reads a lot of different files so theres not problems with unsupported files like through iTunes.  Other then that I am so happy with my purchase.  I think Apple has perfected the art of the mp3 player.  I would never buy any other product besides an iPod.  For the money you get a great warranty, an awesome device, and a lot of features the other ones dont have.

<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod Video a couple of weeks ago at the Apple Store in New York City on a vacation there (the Apple store in NYC is incredible by the way), and I am totally blown away by the iPod Video.  I had an EXTREMELY hard time with this DVD ripping software I downloaded of the internet to get DVD's onto my iPod, but once I got it figured out, I knew it was worth the wait.  The picture quality when you are watching a movie is amazing, its so incredible to have that good of picture on such a small screen.  Same goes for when you are looking at pictures you have stored on your iPod.  The image quality is amazing.  Of course, it still does what all iPods do, play your music.  And it does it better than ever, because while your listening to your song, you get to see the album art (the cover of the album from the song your listening too) while to song is playing.  Im hoping that iTunes will have movies to buy soon so that I dont have to go through the huge process I went through getting Nightmare Before Christmas on my iPod.  But other than that, the iPod Video is a great buy, its totally worth the 300 dollars.  I'd really reccomend getting one of those see thru screen protectors, they help a lot.  They dont take away the sleek size of your iPod, and you barely notice they are there, but they really really help protect it from scratches.

<Content>Great looks, almost optimal performance, user friendly. everything you could want in a Mp3 player. i have only had a few small issues when trying to play songs, all problems were fixed by turning it off for a few minutes and turning it back on. i would reccomend this for anybody who loves music but doesnt want to carry all their CD's around.

<Title>Good Product, weak software
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My son got prompted to update the IPod from ITunes..... when he did via his browser window, the application hung and corrupted his unit. When I called tech support on "my one time free" call. They explained that could happen with this rollout and suggested we should have saved the file locally and ran the update..... I told them your software should suggest that then!  Terrible.... weak software.... that's rolled out with bugs.  No wonder they have less than 5% of the computer market!  I'll never buy an Apple product again!

<Title>Horrid Item
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Do not buy one of these you will be wasting your money.  You will also be taking them back if you buy them.  I had mine for 10 days and within a few days i was unsatisfied the battery does not hold 20 hours of charge it holds more like 6-7.  Then on day 10 after my purchase the ipod wont turn on at all.  So all I can say is what a waste of 300 dollars.  Also like all these other reviews said they get scratched beyond recognition So save your money and stay clear maybe apple will get it right one of these days

<Title>Nice design but no trustable
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Ipiod video in December 2005. It is very well design and with an excellent ergonomic. However, soon I found out that many of the edit options have to be made by the Itunes and there is no facility to do anything from the Ipod itself. Another point that didn't help was the battery life and that must be charged through the PC unless you buy the Ipod Dock which is not cheap.  And finally some good day it stopped working well. It was not recognized by my PC anymore and the playing of files was taking too much, specially the videos. I had to return it but since I couldn't connected to my PC anymore, I had to send it with all my files including family photos.  After that nice experience I bought the Creative Zen multimedia player. It is not as "nice" as the Ipod but it included an AC charger (additional to PC charging), FM Radio, and Voice and Radio Recording among other things. The file managing is easier since it works as a portable disk (drag and drop) therefore you can share your files and get new files from other computers and edit, erase or add (record) without being connected to your PC, a simple thing Ipod didn't support. The software included a video convert feature to start having your video files in your device immediately, another feature over Ipod, I had to search like 3 hours in the web to get a software free of charge to bee able to convert my own videos (Quicktimes Pro $30! Forget it...) Anyway, maybe I don't have the coolest commercial mp3 player anymore, but I own a good device that gives me the facilities to really own my music experience.

<Title>iPod- a decent MP3 player, but not the best
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For Christmas, I recieved a Creative Zen Sleek 20GB.  For the short time I had it, I loved it.  However, 11 days after I got it, I broke from being dropped once.  So, I decided to return it and purchase an iPod.  What a big mistake that was.  WHATS GOOD ABOUT THE IPOD:  Storage- When I returned the Zenm I had about 8 gigs of music.  Now, I have about 13 gigs.  The iPod has plenty of space for my music and photos.  Video Playback- Though it isn't really necessary, it is nice to be able to store video on the iPod.  Too bad that the ipod doesn't last long enough to watch them.  Look- I have to admit it, the iPod is a very nice looking MP3 player, Its sleek and easy to use, and there aren't any unneeded buttons.     WHATS BAD ABOUT THE IPOD:  Included stuff: Headphones- Though the included headphones are nice because they are small and easy to store, the audio quality isn't great.  I really don't see why most people use the stock iPod headphones.  There are much better headphones avalible for a low price.   Case- This thing is complete garbadge. You invest $300 on an iPod, Apple should at leats supply a decent case.  I woulnd't mind using this included case, however, you cannot acess the click wheel or see the screen through the case.  It isn't a huge issue, but it is a bit annoying to have to take the iPod out of the case to see what songs are playing and to change songs.    The Battery- This is hand down the worst element of the iPod.  the box claims that the battery will last for 14 hours, but mine only last for about five hours at best. Playing videos kills the battery.  The one time where i watched a whole video, the battery was full when I started playing it, then, went to about 3/4 or the full charge, and approximatly 30 min later, the battery was empty.    Scratching-  the Ipod, though as nice as it looks, shouldn't leave its box without being put in a case of some sort.  The glossy plastic and screen are easily scratched, and this, the screen is distorted and the iPod loses its nice look  In all, the iPod is a decent MP3 player, but has many problems like the low-quality included accessories and terrible battery life.  there are better mp3 players, I do not reccomend the iPod.

<Title>Video iPod - Sweeeet!
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little gem is fantastic, it has performed flawlessly since I got it.  Battery life if my one and only complaint, you don't get anywhere near the life that Apple claims.  I bought a Griffin TuneJuice to solve that problem.  I'm not crazy about how iTunes updates content on the iPod, but I've learned to work around that.  It's hard to compare this device to anything else on the market because it has few if any competitors, but the only thing that would make it better would be the ability to buy or download DVD movies onto the iPod.  I purchased the Cucusoft DVD to iPod converter software, and it works very well.  I now have about 6 movies and several SNL classic skits and some Seinfeld episodes on the iPod.  I'm not sure how Apple is going to top this device.

<Content>The 30 gb ipod w/ video playback is awesome. I've had it for a while now and have had no problems. However, I recommend buying a case for it because I've heard from other reviews that the screen scratches very easily. Like I said though, I haven't had this problem. I have no regrets for buying this iPod other than the fact that it's a little pricey. Overall it was definetly worth it. Any parent looking to buy this for their kid should totally get it.

<Content>I bought this iPod because my mini didn't hold enough songs for me.  After buying this my life is complete!  The videos play well and the songs sound great.  It has locked up a few times, but came back really fast.  The black is kind of hard to keep clean, but I just dropped it really hard about an hour ago and it is still working just fine...I would recommend this to everyone, but if you have a cleaning disorder I suggest getting the white one!

<Content>At first when I was planning on purchasing an iPod, i wasn't sure if it was the right choice. Especially after some of the reviews. Now that I have it, I love it, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  The videos look really nice, especially the ones purchased from iTunes. I had a few videos from Google, and they looked a tad bit blurry, only because of the size. I was amazed at how great it looked.  It charged a lot faster than I thought. I charged it for less than 2 hours, right out of the box, and it said fully charged. I had heard from a few people that you have to charge it the first time for at least 4 hours. Being worried, I called the Technical Support, and they said it was okay. 5 minutes later, I was listening to music.  If planning on buying one, you should buy a case along with it. I've heard that it scratches really easy. The second I took it out of the box, it went into the case, and I have no scratches. [[I recomend the iSkin eVo3]]  Overall, the iPod is better than I expected. 5 stars all the way.

<Title>I finally caved and got an iPod...
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I enjoy my iPod a lot, but there are a few drawbacks you may want to know about:  1. You can't use it while it's connected to your computer and communicating with iTunes. You can't disconnect it either; you have to "eject" it first or else it can corrupt the hard drive.  2. The scroll wheel is overrated. I'm constantly getting to the item I want and then slipping past it before I can select it. Then, I go back and slip past it again.  3. You have to know what you're doing or buy software to convert videos for the iPod.  4. Once while away on a trip I got a bizarre error for no known reason where I could only access songs that were in playlists; the rest of my library seemed to not exist.   5. The backlight comes on any time you do anything, and you can't change that or lower the brightness. As a result, doing anything at all (i.e. scrolling through your list of songs) will severely reduce your battery life.  6. Making playlists "on the go" is very limited and they go away when you turn the device off. It has an option to "save" the playlist, but it's still nowhere to be found when I look for it later. You can't rearrange or remove items without starting over.  Aside from these things and the high price, it's great. The convenience of having my entire music collection with me wherever I go makes up for a lot. The included earphones are suprisingly good too; the clearest/fullest sound I've heard from earphones and they don't fall out of my ears like most do.

<Title>This iPod Is Wonderful For Me
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hello All,  I bought this iPod around 3 weeks ago and it is still going strong.   One thing that suprised me when I purchased it was that the screen was so good looking. Very bright.   iTunes is a little iffy. When loading songs you have to individually key in title, singer, and genra (sp). With another player I had you just type the artist into a box and it shows up in all of them.   Also it picks of fingerprints very easily. They come off okay when I rub at it with my eyeglass cleaning cloth but I really do need a case. The one that comes with it doesn't do much of anything.  Also the battry life seems short. so I will need a travel adapter so I don't have to charge off of the computer.   That's about it. Overall it is a really good roduct so far but only time shall tell.

<Title>Creative is much better
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes, the Apple iPod video is nice. It has video playback(of course), can hold your whole collection of CDs, and is in the higher archy of MP3 player technology. Even though the iPod video is good, it's not as good as the Creative Zen Vision: M.  The Vision: M has all the features the iPod has, but has a built-in FM radio. With the iPod, you have to buy a seperate device. Also, The Vision: M can record the radio.  That's a pretty cool feature if I do say so myself.  Finally, The Vision: M has twice the battery life for video. On the iPod, you can only play video for 2 hours. 2 HOURS!!!!! That's not even enough to finish a decent movie. All in all, the Creative Zen Vision: M is a much better buy. The consumer should do some research before they invest in an iPod when the Vision: M has more features and is the same price.

<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Witness the evolution of the revolution. First it played songs. Then photos. Then podcasts. Now iPod plays video, changing the way you experience your music and more. Again.  Better Yet Time for the world's best music player to take the stage for another encore. In 30 GB and 60 GB* models that hold up to 15,000** songs, full-color album art and up to 25,000 photos***, the new iPod makes the most of your music and more. Yeah, you've heard that tune before. Only now, you can watch it, too. With support for up to 150 hours**** of video and a 2.5-inch color display, the new iPod lets you take music videos and TV shows on the road.   More and Less The new iPod boasts up to 20 hours of battery life*****, five hours more than before. Plus, you get a bigger display and one more iPod color--sleek black. But here's the kicker: At under half an inch thin, the new 30 GB iPod takes up about 45 percent less room than the original iPod. Even the new 60 GB model is 10 percent thinner than the fourth-generation 20 GB iPod. More features in less space? Sounds like iPod.     The new iPod is thinner than ever before.   Hold Everything Now you can put all your music in your pocket and still have room for, well, practically everything else. Catch up on your reading with audiobooks. Browse your memories with photo slideshows, complete with music. Watch video podcasts, music videos and your favorite TV shows. Consult your calendar or look up an email address. Even check the time in another city or time your fastest lap. The new iPod keeps it all close at hand.   Spin Some Tunes The Apple Click Wheel gives you access to your entire music, photo and video library--from one thumb. Control volume and browse using the touch-sensitive surface. Play. Pause. Rewind and fast-forward. Rate your favorites. Create playlists on the go. Launch photo slideshows. The Click Wheel puts everything at your fingertips, so you can keep your eyes and ears on the music.   Sync, Look, and Listen Playing your iPod is only half the fun. Try filling it with downloads from the iTunes Music Store. Choose from over 2 million songs, 20,000 podcasts, 2,000 music videos or your favorite ABC and Disney television shows, download them to your Mac or PC and sync them to your iPod. Add an optional audio cable to play music from the iPod to your home stereo or use an optional S-video cable with iPod to play VJ on your TV. You can perform the same big-screen feat with iPod photo slideshows. Oh, and you can do it all from across the room using the optional Universal Dock and handy new Apple remote.   * 1 GB = 1 billion bytes; actual formatted capacity less. ** Song capacity is based on four minutes per song and 128-Kbps AAC encoding. ***Photo capacity is based on iPod-viewable photos transferred from iTunes. ****Video capacity is based on 4 minutes per H.264 750-Kbps video combined with 128-Kbps audio. *****Rechargeable batteries have a limited number of charge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced. Battery life and the number of charge cycles vary by use and settings. See www.apple.com/batteries for more information.   Product Description First, iPod put music in your pocket. Now it puts on a show. With room for up to 7,500 songs and up to 150 hours of video on a 2.5-inch QVGA color display, the new 30G iPod gives you the ultimate music experience sight and sound in a lighter, thinner design. Available in classic white and dramatic black. 90-day phone support. One-year limited warranty

<Content>When I ordered this beauty, I couldn't wait till it came in. I was so excited I already had a collection of videos to load onto it. Sure, the iPod is a great music player, but I wasn't expecting much from it's video capabilities. Boy, was I suprised when I played my first video on it. The image quality is crisp, and flawless. The screen may be a little small for  movies like Star Wars, but nothing beats a Green Day music video on that screen. Apple, once again, has created an amazing product. The only thing cooler than this little jewel is the arctic! So if your looking for a new MP3 player, get this. You'll love it, I'll guarantee that.

<Title>scratches and more scratches
<Date>Tue Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I can't live without my iPod. Having said that if you put it in your pocket or let air molecules pass by it, you will ruin the nice clear plastic face and be left with an iPod that looks like you took sandpaper to it. Honestly, I put it in my pocket as I walked from my car to my house and when I took it out it was ruined. My advice is to leave the clear plastic cover on it as long as you can. The protective leather cover helps, but after you remove it 2 or 3 times you can start seeing scratches on it. Apple needs to use a different material for the case because I have never seen anything scratch this easily. Actually, now that I think about it; it scratches about as easily as a DVD. Then again, Apple probably wants people to ruin their iPods after 2 weeks so they have to buy another one. I have 2 of them now. One looks like I went skate boarding on it (I went jogging with it in my pocket) and my newest one has a couple fine scratches on it. I keep it in the case all the time and I never touch the screen even to dust it off.

<Title>New To the Ipod
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first iPod, though not my first mp3 player. My Creative Zen was much more of a tough piece of material that I imagine will last and last. It's platform is capable of versatile file types and  music services. It's features are well thought out and useful.   HOWEVER This is not a Creative Review, this is an iPod review. Sound quaulity is fair, though not as good as Creative when connected to your stereo system. Day to day use as a portable player for private listening, this iPod gives a beautiful performance in terms of sound. What realy makes the iPod for me is the iTunes program which I have been using for years. iTunes was the first program, stable program, to maintain my music collection with. It certainly does not give you the nuts and bolts control that Creative does, but then it is that simplicity that I love about the interface. iTunes certainly makes owning an iPod a wonderful experience. As for the video quality, it is exceptional, however the inability to provide my own video file types, is not amusing. However, I wanted an MP3 player capable of holding my favorite tunes, and this does it. I don't like the proprietary connection which makes charging on the go - difficult. However, I now have the MP3 player I always wanted. One day I may go back to Creative, for now I am having a tentative love affair with iPod.   I hope this is helpful.

<Title>Very Entertaining
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read all the reviews, and at first it seem that the screen was so delicate that it probably wasn't worth it.  But, most complaints seem that having a sutible case would solve the problem; which I was going to get one any ways. Talking to people who had other IPODS they told me they realy like theirs.  So I gave it a try. Now that I have had it for about a month I can say, it's Great.  I spend a lot of time between appiontments so the video is worth it for me, but, might not be for everyone.  The down side is that in addition to the cost of the IPOD itself you spend more money for a decent case and an extra charger so that you aren't stuck to only using your computer, unless you already have a USB charging adaptor. If you do decide this is for you, get a good case where the screen is covered when it's not in uses and don't take off the protective film it comes with, I just sniped off the little tab that covered the slot for connecting and sliped it in the case. I use it almost every and enjoy it a lot. Hope this was some help.

<Title>Not sure what to think
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I do actually own the 30 gig video. Not so political about my electronics as to try and sway the opposition party one way or the other. There isn't too much to say about Ipod. It is what it is. Plays music. Not much else. Can't really watch video on it when you leave the house. The battery will crap out on you in about 2-3 hours at most. I am pretty displeased that it's even legal let alone considered ethical business practice to say 14 hours of battery life even with the disclaimer (up to). Keep in mind that this means no backlight or EQ. That's right. If the Ipod is completely lifeless it MIGHT play for up to 14 hours. Music only.  I think this is my only real gripe though. I get about 8 hours or so of music on a charge and that's about what I need for a day. Not sure what I'm going to do the next time I fly overseas for 14-18 hours but I'll figure that out then.  Wait. No. One more gripe. Itunes is just crap software. But that's just Apple for ya. Nothing they put out is for anyone that can possibly do anything for themselves. Like think.  Now, on to the good stuff.   It's not too big and holds alot of my music. It fits in my pocket and is with me all day everyday allowing me to listen to whatever I want whenever I want. Any other player could do the same thing. This one is nothing special.  That doesn't sound as good as I thought.

<Title>Fantastic little device--a couple of caveats
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First, let me say that I've owned 2 other mp3 players for on the go.  First was the Dell DJ, then the iAudio X5.  The Dell lacked in the sound quality department, while the X5 excelled, especially with all the options it has.  If you want to very much customize the way your music sounds, then stop reading.  If you don't care for said options and prefer to listen to your music naturally and would like to watch superb-quality video, then by all means, read on:  This isn't to say that the ipod doesn't have ways to customize the way your music sounds either.  It has about 15 EQ presets, but unfortunately that's what they remain: presets.  Myself, I don't use the EQ at all anyway, and with a good pair of earphones (click to see all my reviews to see an incredible pair for this machine) you'll be in sound paradise.  Itunes:  Perhaps the easiest way to manage your music as far as I'm concerned.  The program does everything FOR you, organizing your music collection on the ipod AND PC.  Simply great, I haven't seen any problems with it yet.  Interface:  Very, very simple, user-friendly UI.  Most people have used or at least seen an ipod at this point, so I don't need to go into the nitty-gritty here.  Everything is organized by id3 tag, meaning by artist, album, genre, you name it.  The only difference between this UI and other ipods is of course, the "videos" menu located in the main menu.  Video quality:  In a word, wow.  I've owned the iaudio X5 and the video on that was passable at best.  A tiny screen, 15 fps...it was lacking.  On the ipod however, you get twice as many frames on a much clearer, larger, and color-filled screen.  The animation is fluid, the sound quality in videos is superb, and no, watching videos and this particular relatively small screen does not hurt my eyes.  I've watched MANY a TV show on here and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Build quality:  Ok, here's one of the caveats that I mentioned.  I'm going to be frank:  You need to BABY this thing.  It scratches like it's been attacked by about 8 cats.  9.  9 cats.  However, if you can pluck down the 300 dollars to buy this puppy, would it not make sense to throw another 20 or so down on a decent case?  Please do yourself a favor and buy a case, as you will notice fine scratches on the back within minutes (Yes, minutes) of using it if you use the standard leather case.  Some may argue that it's a bad marketing move on Apple's part to build something so easy to scratch and not include a decent protective case, and I couldn't argue with said some.  Battery life: Second caveat.  Well, sort of.  If you're listening to music, as long as you don't constantly use the backlight, EQ, Sound Check, or skip songs, you'll get a good amount of battery life out of this thing.  I've never done an "official" measure of it, but I'd guess 12 hours at about 75% volume.  Video, however, saps the battery life like nothing else.  You might as well only leave 2 episodes of television of it at a time, or perhaps one movie, because that's all you're going to be able to watch before seeing a red battery icon.  I guess it's a sacrafice we make to embrace a thinner form factor.  And finally style:  This will be my shortest paragraph.  This thing looks, dare I say, sexy.  Sexy sexy sexy.  It's thin, flat, looks incredibly sleek...I don't know what else to say here.  Consider all before making your purchasing decision.  If you're not one to take good care of your investments, then it's probably a good idea you pass this up.  However, if you want to enjoy the perks of itunes, its music store, incredibly video and great sound quality, then by all means, get yourself this ipod!  P.S.  If you need a charger, might I recommend you search Amazon for a third party model and save yourself 20 dollars off the apple model!

<Title>Great unit, fast transfers, great quality, A+
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod (video) is a great device, allows me to get any of my music, watch video podcasts, and even with some of my own tweaking (such as using Videora), I can watch my own TV shows and DVDs on there too. And whoever says that the screen is "too small" has got to be kidding themselves, the screen is "just right" in size and features. Love Watching My Anime on the go. Sound is pumped through very nicely. Have downloaded some TV shows from iTunes as well and they turned out very well too. I would suggest getting a dock for easier syncing and maybe a backup Power Adapter if you will be using it anywhere other than beside your computer, but neither of these are required. DO Buy a case of SOME SORT or the shiny back will get scratched up very quickly. I would wish Apple would introduce more file playing options, but in the mean time, there is Videora and the file sizes are much smaller anyway. Even when playing video through the iPod to the TV using the S-Video plug on the Universial Dock, it looks really nice. I would say, if you are considering getting something to keep your music library on and you like iTunes (or wouldn't mind getting something like Anapod), the iPod Video is for you. The Creative Vision M is nice (But more expensive), but still prefer the simple transfer and interface and Mac compatibility of the iPod. In fact...the Halo Effect may be kicking in already...maybe an iMac/MacBook Pro/Mini in my future soon. And if you think you would like to get audio books, I would suggest considering the Audible offer to get some bucks off, it's nice having a discount off my iPod AND get audiobooks to listen to as well. Hope the "Real Video iPod" isn't on it's way too soon, wouldn't want to give up this great device so soon. Apple...Give us BLACK headphones with these BLACK iPods!

<Title>IPod Killer - Zen Vision M Is Way Better
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i'am one of those who seek the best product in its category even if i have to pay more. The ZEN VISION M is one of those best products in the MP3 field. when i first decided to buy an mp3 player, first of all like everybody and without thinking and comparing i bought the ipod nano. i was looking for a small mp3 player with a descent storage and of course it must be good looking. After, having the nano for two months, i got so bored. the nano can't hold anything else except music and photos that must be seen on 1.5 inch screen therefore you will need a loop if you want to view your pictures. i sold the nano to one of my friends and i got the san disk sansa e260, excuse me san disk but that thing is suck. tha material from which that thing was made can't compete with other mp3 player in the market. the e260 gives you that very cheap look although it costs me 220 USD. i returned tha sansa back to best buy and i decided to spend a little bit more and get something with a video (fully equipped) and a big screen. i started comparing between the 2 most rivals in the market, the ipod video and the ZEN Vision M. finally, i decided to buy the VISION M for the reasons below:   1-the vision M is equipped with an FM tuner with a perfect reception for 70% of the channels.   2-the vision M is equipped with an FM recorder so you can record your favorite radio show, song or game and listen to it later.   3-the vision M is equipped with an excellent voice recorder. i made a test for the voice recorder in Best Buy, i recorded my voice talking in the middle of a crowd and WOW i can still hear my voice clearly   4-the 2.5 inch LCD(high definition)screen is very clear and sharp that you can see your pictures very vivid plus, you have a zoom in feature. so i don't need a loop anymore!   5-the player is customizable. you can change the defalut backgrounds with any picture uploaded on your player. Plus, the player comes equipped with 6 different backgrounds and fonts.   6-the Vision M is not scratches and fingerprints magnet like the ipods.   7-the included software is very easy to use. i got used to itunes and when i used the software included i found it pretty much similar and i dealt with it like if i have been using it long time ago.   8-the player comes with a wall charger!! thank you so much creative for giving the player's buyer his rights. the ipod video doesn't come with a wall charger, you have to buy it seperately for around 30 USD, ipods are charged with the included USB cable which is ridiculous because i remember one time i was in a hotel and i couldn't listen to my ipod because the thing ran out of battery and i had no access to computers.   9-sound quality is pretty much the same, but the included speakers with the creative are prettier than the ipod.   10-the accessories for the Vision M started to show up in stores, DLO company made till now 2 different cases for it. plus, many different cases that you can find online especially on Amazon.com.   11-the Vision M has better battery life, lasts 1 - 1.5 hours more than the ipod video when playing videos and more hours when you play music   12-The vision M has one of the best features that ever came in an mp3 player before..you can search for your song alphabetically. plus, you can click on the vertical touch pad and a keyboard will apears on which type the name of your song using the touch pad and the player will look it up for you whereever this song exists. Isn't that excellen?   Conclusion: the vision M offers you all the Ipod Video features plus the list above. for the same price. you pay 300 USD for both!!!!  the Vision M from my opinion worth every penny sipmly because if you want to buy some accessories for the Ipod video to make it with the same features equipped in the Vision M you will have to spend at least 120 USD over the initial 300 USD to add the fm tuner and the voice recorder and you will never have zoom feature or customizable player.   Some Remarks:  -they say that the itunes is one of the pros of the ipods, i don't know why, this software can be downloaded for free even if you don't have an ipod!!!  -they say that the accessories is on of the pros of the ipods, i don't know who's going to buy all these cases and speakers offered in the market by everybody?  -they say that the ipods are easier to use. Feel this one and try it anywhere and you will find very easy to use and even easier.  i hope that my review can be helpful. thank you creative for making such an excellent product and saving the customers from this bad monopoly called iPods...   Regarding the accessories i placed an order for an awesome silicone case from DLO.com and i received it yesterday.. the case fits my vision M perfectly and i got the case on time wih no hassles.

<Title>there are better on the market
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When reviewing the ipod video i noticed that its features are nothing compared to other mp3 players on the market and if people would only shop smarter they would notice this. For example the creative vision m which is priced around the same has all the features of the ipod but has radio, longer battery life, and a better screen. Another thing i noticed is that in order to get movies and what not for the ipod u have to buy them, u cant just click and drop. Another downfall is the ease of scraching. And when it comes to its audio abilities the ipod doesnt offer many choices of formats for your audio, it doesnt even support wma format which is one of the most popular formats. so all in all i beg people not to just buy the ipod because its the only one u have seen and heard of but instead take my advice and shop around and i can promise u wont be disappointed if u do.

<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Please dont pay attention to the review titled "there are better on the market" they obviously have no idea what they are talking about! This iPod IS the best on the market. No other MP3 Player has the feature of having videos. Apple-Mac is leading the way in diverse entertainment, they are doing that with the iPod. Its memory space is HUGE, you wont need to worry about how much memory space you have left! The screens colors are amazing, they are better then televisions colors! You can do multiple things on it, from playing games to writing down important events on the calender, the iPod has it all. Im now getting the 60GB iPod Video for my dad on Christmas. But remember, iPods ARE the best!

<Title>The Video Ipod
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I go this ipod and it was great at first. I loved how much music I could store in it, the screen was impressive, i enjoyed watching music videos and tv shows on it and pictures. However, I ran into some problems. first, the battery died out fast in my opinion. Plus, it slipped out of my hand when i used it. it didn't fall very far but this small fall broke it. It looked fine on the outside but on the inside it broke. at least there is a 1 year warrenty which is a plus. I only had the ipod for 3 days and it already broke. they gave me a new one which is a plus for apple. this ipod shouldn't be used for exercising because the spinning hardware inside is VERY sensitive and it could break just from exercising or having it in the car. that is why I am going to return mine, because it probably won't last a day past the warrenty. its sooo sensitive and slippery. even with a case it could break. also, its hard to convert movies and put it on it. You have to have special ways to convert it etc. i want my ipod to last. i want an ipod to keep all my music in that actually won't break sooo easily.

<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This iPod is a long of bang for the buck.  It comes very quickly from Amazon, it is in a small box and well thought out.  Easy to use and setup.  It was already charged when I got it.  I love the larger video screen - even for music navigation it is great!  The sound from the factory headphones is lacking but that can be easily rectified by getting after-market headphones (Etymotic Research, Shure or Sennheiser).  If you get the BLACK iPod, make sure to get some sort of skin for it as it will scratch very easily.  There are thousands of protection devices for it.  GREAT PRODUCT, no wonder why APPLE is #1 for iPods.  It is more than marketing - this is a great product as well.

<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I gave it four stars because I'm disappointed with the battery-life after I fully charge it.  Besides that, it is an awesome gadget.  30 gigs means 3 - 4 thousand songs.  You can also store video, pictures and audio books.  The Itunes software is great for organizing your music.  This is very important and a lot of work.  You need to keep the music properly organized so that you can utilize IPOd's playback choices (by Artist, Album, Genre, etc.)

<Content>I know I still have a lot to learn about this and Ipods in general. But I got mine about 2 months ago. EVerything is still working fine. I suggest you do get a case when you purchase yours as it can scratch easy - but then again, what device doesn't scratch easily? The only thing I miss about my iRiver MP3 player was that it really did organise th music according to artists, where the iPod seems to use not just the main artists but also whoever else sung with him/her...I'll get used to it.  So yea, worth the money and if you take care of it, I'm sure it will give you many hours of joy as it has been doing for me.

Some things to note about the product:  - The personal video upload feature does not function with iTunes as claimed on the Apple website. Quicktime Pro would have to be bought separately.  - The battery dies down fairly soon when FM transmitters are attached. Not relevant to a review for the IPOD but most FM transmitters available in the market do not function properly either(have a lot of hiss).  Overall, the 30 GB is a good buy; more space and better utility

<Title>Super kewl- but quite fragile...
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased a 30gb iPod Vid. some time ago. To start off, I have to say it's great looking. The sound quality is amazing- I hook it up to my home theater system and it produces amazing sound quality and bass. The click wheel is super easy and is convenient for extended use- everything is right there. The quality of the graphics is very impressive- super bright and clear. With Videora iPod converter (free), you can download or rip DVD's and place ANY video file from ANY source by transcoding it.  Now the Cons: This product is delicate. It is in no way "extreme" or "sporty". Imagine you are buying a gem. This in fact is so delicate, that I would say that you might as well burn your $300.00 than buy one WITHOUT FIRST buying a cover or case. DO NOT USE THIS without buying a case please. I tell you this from experience. The 1st iPod video I bought was so scratched by the 3rd day, that you could no longer view your videos in acceptable quality. I ended up exchanging it some how (hard thing to do), and getting a new one. BUT I didnt dare to use it until I bought a case by the brand "zcover" (In my opinion, the best case out there- very usefull and protective). Basically, it's being fragile is the only problem I found to it. Another thing is that I would go with the white iPod, which seems to show finger prints and scratches much less than the black.  Overall, it really is worth it. IF you buy a cover with it. I use it at the gym, when I go out to run, in the car- everywhere. Its really light and given the fact that it has 30GB, i'd say it pretty small. In my opinion, there is no other MP3 out in the market right now that matches the iPod video.

<Title>A sound investment for anyone needing a new iPod. 
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Having spent over one year with my iPod mini, and being largely happy with it despite it's shortfalls in battery life and space, I decided to upgrade to the new fifth generation of iPod. The video option has no appeal for me, as I cannot imagine watching a TV show on the small screen, and there are few music videos that I would give more than one viewing to. As such, my review of this is based strictly on music playback performance on the 30 GB model.   Pros:  1)	Better battery life. This is a big deal for me, as I am always out and about, with music being an important part of everyday life. My mini could manage a maximum of 4 hours, and that's with minimal song skipping. The new iPod Video certainly performs much better. Without using the backlight, the high EQ setting, and skipping songs as I please, I have managed to get an average of 10 to 12 hours out of it.  2)	Larger capacity. I am a massive music fan, so I am pleased to have room for over 7,500 songs to have and enjoy while I'm on the go. 3)	Better screen. While it can be a little hard if you have the backlight turned off, I find the screen to be a vast improvement over the monochrome display screens on the older generations. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the blacks and browns are as sharp as you would expect from a computer screen. 4)	Sound quality remains strong. I have noticed little difference between the sound quality on my iPod mini and the iPod video, except that the latter has slightly less distortion when songs are played at high volume. 5)	Intuitive menu system. The menus are as easy to navigate as they are on the older generations, with slight improvements on the fonts and color scheme.  6)	Slimmer design. This helps to avoid the telltale bulge that the older, thicker iPods seemed to cause.  7)	It's eye-candy. Let's face it, iPods are becoming a fashion accessory. The black one in particular is attractive.   Cons:  1)	The only "extras" included are the USB 2.0 cable, the earphones, and on more recent models shipped, a slipcase that will keep the iPod free of scratches and smudges...for a short while (see below.) Others items, like the belt clip, the firewire cable, and the wall adapter are not included. 2)	The shiny plastic finish attracts and alarming amount of fingerprints, smudges, and scratches, especially on the black models. The semi-soft slipcase will only go so far in protecting the iPod, so a proper case is recommended.  3)	The "smart jack" has been removed! If you don't know the term, this is the small plug that existed next to the headphone jack on all older models. This means if you were using the remote control, iTrip, car kit, or other peripheral item, it will not work on this model. 4)	No Firewire support. The fifth generation no longer supports transferring songs via Firewire, however you can still use the cable to charge the iPod if you are using the wall plug adapter.  5)	There is an occasional delay you might encounter when skipping songs, as the iPod is processing a large amount of data at one time, and this lasts for about 3 seconds. I have heard other say that the menus sometimes freeze up, but I have never encountered this.  6)	The battery is apparently soldered onto the motherboard, so if you are considering doing a battery replacement yourself at some point, it may not be possible.  Considering the value in terms of price and wealth of space, the new iPod video has been a good investment. I am still in the honeymoon period with it, having only had it for about 2 months, but the performance has so far been excellent.

<Title>My point of view
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hope it helps. Here it goes. Pros: - (if you care about it) the looks are great - the sound quality (i'm really picky) - the ease of use (click wheel is king) - the video quality - the itunes works wonderfully Cons: - (like other reviewers mentioned before) it scratches easily (especially the back of it) (mine is holding out fine so far, due to extreme and almost insane care. Find a good case and be cool) - there remains the annoying gap between tracks. (I had a Sony Network Walkman Stick and it provided gapless audio playback). How hard is it to make it work? (And I mean it. Is there a technical issue here that cannot be overcome?) - the battery life is not bad but it diminishes a lot if you keep touching the device's buttons. I think it should be more and better advertised by Apple.  Overall, as nothing in life is absolutely perfect, I give it four stars. Four and a half, really.

<Title>Problems with ipod
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We bought an ipod video 30gb and the creative touch (40 gb) (recently). Also purchased the muvo and the toshiba gigabeat. The gigabeat died within a few days. The muvo is great for a flash player. But the ipod has some real problems.  The creative is better than the ipod for us because of file sharing and file backups. The ipod will attach to ONE COMPUTER ONLY and it KNOWS if you try to get it to work with another. This caused us a lot of grief when we switched computers. Then the new computer we attached it to died and getting the music back off of the ipod was a real pain. If you are able to even get the files back off the ipod (it doesn't like to go that direction, apparently) it still will lose a lot of the tag info in the music library. (Wanna type all that in by hand?) Plus, since Apple's music file format is proprietary, we can't share files from the ipod to other players. (Does not play well with others! :-)  The creative players do not have any of these problems. They will work on ANY new computer and accept imports of a variety of file formats. You can make as many backups of your music library on as many hard drives on as many computers as you like.  Another difference is the sound quality and volume output. Creative players drive headphones with higher impedances and also have superior sound. Also, creative players have EQ settings that actually work! They sound very different, but the ipod EQ settings pretty much all sound the same. Furthermore, the creative players have custom EQ settings available if you don't like the presets that come with the player.  The ipod is more attractive and a bit smaller than the creative, but such things don't concern me since I'm looking for the highest quality sound I can get. Unfortunately, few mp3 players on the market today are really audiophile quality, and the ones that are are only available in Korea. Apparently the US market is more concerned with "features" and "style".  There are a few problems with the creative software. It has some bugs but is easy to use. The ipod's software is also easy to use. Both interfaces are easy to use, but the creative touch can sometimes be too sensitive. It does have a sensitivity setting that helps a bit with that.  Both the ipod and creative would be much better if they had a line out instead of just the regular headphone jack. I would be happier also if the creative could handle lossless compression formats, too, but this is not a major concern.  What player a person buys really depends on their priorities. I have no need to watch videos on a portable player (Although creative has a video player, too). I'm looking for non-proprietary file formats and good sound quality. I've seen a lot of my friends with ipods suffer the consequences of having the single computer attachment problem and proprietary file format issues. That can be a very serious problem. I understand there are third party software programs out there that may help some of these issues, but it still is a very suboptimal situation to have to deal with.

<Title>Scratches WAY too easily.
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yeah. I got this thing hoping it would be like the bee's knees or something. And yeah it's pretty good, except it scratches way too easily. It's amazing how easy it gets scratched i dont even look at the screen that much. I try to keep it in its case. i usually do. That's actually how i navigate through it. I"ve memorized the sequence it goes through so that I don't have to take off the cover. And that's another thing. Whatever dummy invented the case this thing comes with is out of his mind. YOU CAN'T SEE THE SCREEN. IT'S LIKE A BURLAP SACK FOR PETE'S SAKE. GEEZ! How 'bout a plastic cover for cryin' out loud. Well anyway, besides the fact that it scratches too easily, it's a really good choice for an MP3. Parents, if you're reading this, get one for your kid. I've had several MP3 players but this one is the best by far. It has no lagging time switching from screen to screen, it has a stopwatch on it for when I'm running, it has a universal clock on it, and the video quality is AMAZING. Yes. This is a must have for any one looking for a portable music player. Infinity times better than any MP3. But don't get it unless you need either a lot of storage-that's why i wanted it-, or the video feature. If you don't need either of these, get an iPod nano. they're smaller and hold enough music for say... a ten year old girl. Except they're way overpriced, being that their only feature is that they're small! Yeah so this is a really good product. Bye! Oh, and if you're a parent and have more questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Email me at loudandproud@buckeyeexpress.com

<Title>A Must Have!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my iPod. It is perfect. It plays movies,photos, and music. All it needs is to play games and it'll be a PSP. It's so easy to get videos onto it. The easiest way I've found is to download videos from Google Video. Or you could pay on iTunes. I was using it everyday until my brothr dropped it into the toilet. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF! (: Luckily I brought the Bestbuy warranty and it's being serviced as I type. Can't wait to get it back. Apple just keeps comin out with better and better iPods. Maybe the next one will have a radio...

<Title>Beautiful, but not without flaws
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The video iPod is soo incredibly sleek and sexy. This player is absolutely beautiful. Which is why it was such a hard decision for me to return it for a better player. I'm mostly going to talk about the negatives here as many of you all know the positives from other reviews.  It's important to mention that I'm a very picky consumer when it comes to electronics, I want full control of everything. The iPod has had a few shortcomings for me. This is not to say that the iPod wouldn't be perfect for other people.  First, do you like being locked in Apple's world? The iPod more or less forces you to use iTunes. The reason you have to use iTunes is because every MP3 you transfer to your iPod needs to be renamed and categorized and stashed away in some hidden directories on the iPod. The iPod WILL NOT play MP3s that you simply copy to it's hard drive. This is why no other media player can work with the iPod. Personally, I find iTunes to be an ugly and somewhat clunky program. It doesn't give you control of your MP3s the way I like.  What does this also mean? This means that you can't get your MP3s back off your iPod without some 3rd party hacks that determine what the file names were. Sometimes iTunes will do it, but if you try it on a different computer iTunes will think you are trying to steal music and will deny you.  I like being in control of my MP3s!   Also, the iPod does not support WMA files, iTunes will let you convert them to AAC (format only supported by iTunes) but this just annoys me to no end as Apple decided not to support WMA on purpose. For video you must also convert all your videos to it's MPEG-4 specification.  You see the iPod does not play friendly with other formats and players. I find the fact that Apple always advertises how their products are always compatible with everything to be extremely ironic in this case. You see Apple Macintosh's have to be compatible with everything or else no-one would use them. However, in the case of iPod, Apple has an EXTREMELY popular product. They are using this popularity to force and lock  people into their world by refusing support for formats and players that almost every other MP3 player supports.  Now the battery. It's ok. I mean my lifestyle allows me to be able to plug it into my PC everyday. So for me this is fine. But I don't think it could last more then two days if I listen for 5 hours each day. Changing songs a lot and using the backlight reduces this time.  Finally the control. I find the volume wheel to be too sensitive. I like to be able to change tracks and raise and lower volume just by reaching my hand into my pocket. But the iPod does not make this nearly as easy as other players. There are no buttons you can really feel around for and if you want to change the volume you will probably have to take the iPod out of your pocket. There is also no searching feature on the iPod.  Ok, I've done a lot of bashing here. I think the iPod physically is a beautiful device and it saddens me a little that Apple could have so easily made it better by not succumbing to some serious anti-consumer friendly practices. I think it is outrageous that Apple does not allow iTunes' AAC format music to work with other software and other MP3 players. It's very ironic  that Apple would do something like this. Now you see that when Apple has something popular they aren't as much the good-guy.  They basically lock you into their world and keep you there. There is no excuse for Apple's monopolistic behavior. They would have had a great product anyway.  This may not really matter to a lot of people who will just go with Apple's flow. I mean, with the exception of what I mentioned above, the iPod plays music well and operates beautifully.   I'll say it again, I like to be in control.

<Title>A shoddy but expensive product without company support
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received a 40GB iPod for Christmas 2004.  Although I owned it more than a year, I did not used it much--mainly to listen to books on car trips--and it was not abused in any way.  It stopped working and I could not get it to work using any of the on-line support options so I went to the Apple store.  The "genius" told me that the hard drive was broken and that the most economical way to fix it would be to send it to one of two services that he recommended.  He said that repairs would probably run about $75.  While I thought it odd that the store would not provide economical repairs I took his advice.  I paid $30 to ship the iPod off (that cost included return shipping and a "diagnosis") and learned that the repair would cost nearly $200.  I did not waste my money on that.  I could buy a brand new iPod for that but why should I waste my money on that either?  I was stunned at the lack of support from Apple.  My hardly used but quite expensive product cannot be repaired without considerably greater expense.    This was a shoddy and expensive product.  I cannot imagine buying any other Apple product.

<Content>I really don't know were to start Scratches resistant, (WRONG) software problems, the cost of repairs, incompatibilities with every other Mp3. It seems every time I hook my fifth Generation up to my computer there's going to be something wrong, or needs to be up dated.  I really truly wanted to love it, it goes back to the saying don't judged a book by its cover.   You would think its great when truly its not.  If you don't believe me go a head and buy one and when you do, buy all the warranty's that come with it you will need at less two years so now your 300 or 400 $ turned into five or six good luck

<Title>Great form factor & audio
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I studied what to get for months.  I was concerned about the compatability with a PC.  One criteria I had was the ability to mount as a drive so I could copy and transport huge files.  Windows 2000 had some problems--but it did finally mount.  XP works fine.  But you do need to load iTunes since I tunes configures the iPod.  I don't like the idea of being locked into a manufacturer's software when I buy their hardware. But I gave in when I saw the form factor.  Just feels solid in the hand and thin.  You can run it with one hand easily.     You're not going to play .mp3s with this unit directly but iTunes makes that so transparent that I don't feel it's an issue at this time.  That's not to say you can't transport mp3s to your computer--ingest into iTunes library then update the iPod.   The third party options like a car charger seem to have no problem with the device. So, the alternative was one of the Creative products.  I was very close to doing this.  But somehow the aura, size, controls (there's a patent on the virtual wheel), third party availability of accessories, and not particular price advantage, I opted for the 30GB iPod.  If you get the 60GB version be warned that it is considerably thicker--not as 'cool'.  30 Gb is far and away enough unless you're doing video on an island somewhere and want to take all of it with you. A con (so far) is that I have figured out NO way to randomize a playlist in the iPod.  You can randomize all songs/albums but not playlists.  It may be there and I'm missing it.  So that's why it's a 4 instead of a 5.  And yes, front and back scratches easily so get some plastic coverings if you're sensitive about this sort of thing.

<Title>Screen scratches easily
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like the iPod, but the screen scratches with even the most innocuous contact.  I don't know how you go about cleaning the screen, but I'm sure some kind of special cloth is needed.  I had scratch on it hours after purchase from merely placing inside my jacket pocket (suit jacket).  Everything else is good, but it won't provide long-term enjoyment, because the screen will have scratches all over it after only a short time.  Bad.

<Content>Ive read all the reviews and ive heard everything bad about the battery, i talked to my aunt and grandpa and they said its not that bad, i would definatly take their opinion over yours. They have had it for a few months and no problems. I wi;ll definatly buy a case for it though. The video battery life w/ music is a long time, but the battery life with videos is 2-3 hours when full, but unless you are going on a very long car ride, you will watxch a movie and the ride will be over, no need for music then. If you want (highly reccomended) get the dock charger you can watch while you charge. This sounds like a great investment considering i love my DELL DJ. If you have a young kid i would advise a DELL DIGITAL JUKEBOX. They are harder to break and ive had mine for 4 years and the battery is perfect, it also lasts 17 hours. The only downside: it is not a color screen. The navigation is easier too. I rate my DJ "9.5 out of 10"

<Title>More Trouble Than the Thing is Worth So Far. 
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my 30-gb video iPod for Windows for two weeks and have yet to get it to work.  This little thing has great potential and I was so looking forward to enjoying it, but all I've seen is the file folder icon with the exclamation point that indicates the iPod needs to be formatted.  I couldn't get the iPod updater to run on my system without getting a variety of error messages.  I tried the "5 R's" about 17 times, ran a CHKDSK on my system and a couple of other things people had suggested before calling Apple Support.  I've read a lot of bad things about Apple Support, but the lady I spoke with was very nice and tried to help as best she could.  I tried formatting the iPod on my mother's box and actually got the iPod Updater software to run, but it still would not accept any songs and now it freezes up my entire system when I plug it in.  I'm going to call Apple back tonight and make arrangements to return the unit, but I fear that I've purchased a very expensive door stop (I got mine engraved and they don't do refunds on personalized merchandise).  They offered to replace the unit since it was DOA, but after all the trouble I've had over the past two weeks, if I never see one of these things again it'll be too soon.  Maybe a replacement unit will work...maybe not.  I'd advise you to save your money until they work the bugs out of this 5th Generation software.  There might be a patch out soon or another update. (Incidentally, my husband's 2gb Nano works just fine - he's got the older iPod software.  I told him NOT to upgrade!!)

<Title>I-tunes...apples bane.
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod Video is a decent MP3 player on the whole; it looks sleek and elegant, though on closer examination it may have some cheap shoddy furnishings, the display is crisp and clear and it does what you would expect it to. The problem starts with I-tunes.   The ipod is supposed to be the most revolutionary music player on the market, defining the norms of MP3 player design. I am not an apple user (apart from using the occasional mac at the college library...which is also quite a sucky experience) and this is the first apple product I have actually owned. I was expecting seamless software design where functionality would just flow and I was so so disappointed with what I got. I-tunes is apples bain, and for the life of me, I cannot understand why any one would use this software as their music player, unless they were forced to (as all ipod users are) and why people all over the internet are not bitching about this piece of sh-software. It lacks the most simple, obvious functions (like automatically scanning the primary music folder to update the library) that are available on free software like Winamp (which truly rocks), the interface design is not smooth and fluid, like you would expect from apple, but is cluttered, heavily redundant and plain n' simple, bad. Lastly, I-tunes is completely unstable and the Ipod + Itunes combo (made for each other, it seems) almost wrecked my computer, causing some kind of malfunction in my motherboard, and after an hour of struggling and resetting my bios, I got it back on its feet. It is pretty apparent that apple is all about the looks, and people are more than willing to sacrifice functionality, to use something that looks cool.

<Content>Quite an amazing little gadget that basically lives up to its popularity.  My beef is the almost total lack of documentation and instruction that comes with it.  It can do a lot, but figuring out how to use it can take a lot of time.  As I live in LA, I found out that Apple offers an ipod "101" course at one of its outlets.  It was very informative, but it came after a month of trial and error at home.  I think Apple could afford a few cents to provide a manual to get started.

<Content>I love my iPod and I don't know what I ever did without it!  I am writing this review in response to the review below by "2-stage."  He said he wasn't happy because he isn't able to shuffle songs within a playlist.  There is a way to do this.  Turn on your iPod, and on the main screen go to "Settings."  Then go to "Shuffle."  Right now, I'm guessing it says "Off."  Use the select button to change that to say "Songs."  Now, anytime you are within a playlist, or even if you select a specific album to listen to, it will shuffle the songs in that playlist or album.  And of course you can still shuffle ALL of the songs in your iPod by going to "Shuffle Songs" in the main menu.  I hope this helps!

<Content>This REVIEW is to help others with transfering MUSIC.  There are plenty of reviews (lengthy drawnout ones I might add) out there to help you decide if you want an IPOD. So, I'm going to skip on that.  Ok, I haven't had this thing long, but the first thing I did was buy "XPLAY 2" Software to transfer the music over from my SONY VIAO.  XPLAY 2 allows you full control over everything put in or out of the IPOD.  Its a slow tranfer but, once you have ur music library in there, ur good to go.  NO downloading ITUNES or worrying about MUSIC FILE types being compatible.  Leave the XPLAY icon on ur desktop, make sure ur IPOD is connected and click on the icon...you don't even touch the IPOD from there.

<Title>I was reading the bad reviews...
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...and I brought myself around to writing a quick review. Maybe I'll add more later. Some background first. This is my second mp3 player and my first iPod. My first mp3 player was a Creative Zen Xtra 40GB. With the iPod, I encode music in 128kbps mp3 and I listen with a pair of Sennheiser PX100 headphones (which I heartily recommend for any mp3 player owner). So, here it is, quick and dirty:  I'll do the bad first: 1. No FM Radio (this isn't so bad after all. I'll explain in "the good" section) 2. Scratches easily - I had an Agent 18 case that I stopped using because it scratched the iPod. The cloth case that comes with the iPod couldn't have served me better (I don't really need to look at the screen when I'm on the move, so the lack of a screen window is fine with me). More on this in "the good" section 3. Nothing other than iTunes works (but this isn't so bad. I'll explain later) 4. iTunes is slow 5. No voice recorder  Now: responses to "the bad" 1. I am perfectly willing to give up FM radio for being able to listen to podcasts, something one can't do with any other player. Also, iTunes allows very easy access to a multitude of online radios, one of which is radioio, a very good free service. 2. The scratching doesn't happen if one uses the included cloth case. Never grip from the front and back when removing the iPod from the case (so the case doesn't slide against the screen). ALSO: The ipod is not the only player whose screen scratches. My old player's screen had a very visible mesh of screen damage after only 2 DAYS of not being in its case. The problem with this was that the player was, in total, about 2 inches thick with the case on - a real juggernaut in the pocket. I agree that screen scratching is kind of ridiculous and shouldn't happen, but it happens universally, so consider that if you decide on another music player. In addition, my last player developed dust UNDER the screen. The iPod's screen has no external seams, so this cannot happen. 3. I really like iTunes, so this isn't bad. The alternative, Creative Media source, was abysmal. I used to encode mp3s using Windows Media Player (which I like) and then put them on the player using Creative Media Source. Ugh. Big hassle (Creative Media Source is horrid - it has to check every song present in the library and on the device before it starts moving songs, which can take about 5 minutes, then it begins to write songs onto the mp3 player). You could probably use Windows Media Player for both, though. I never looked into the device syncing with Windows Media Player. 4. Can't really refute this. iTunes is simple and easy, so it's faster to use, but it does take a year and a half to load (it's much faster on Apple machines, if you are a Mac owner). 5. I have a laptop.  Now: The Good 1. iPod is small 2. iPod sounds good - at least as good as my Creative. A tip for people who think the iPod has no base: either buy different headphones or put the little black foam things on the earbuds that come with it. Both options improve sound quality by leaps and bounds. The iPod earbuds are actually quite good-sounding with the foam things in. 3. iPod's hard drive is not constantly on. The player writes the currently queued music onto it's RAM, which holds about 15 minutes of mp3 at 128kbps. That means that the hard drive is only on every 15 minutes, so the needle that reads the hard drive doesn't bang as often into the disk. This was not the case with my old creative player, which meant that the hard drive was constantly being damaged when jarred while walking or whatever. 4. Pretty decent battery life. I don't know an exact time, but I only have to charge it once or twice a week, unless I watch a lot of video, which I don't. 5. Click wheel - the competition has caught up since then, but my last player had a little wheel on the side that you held up or down to scroll. It took about 30 seconds on average to access the song I wanted (which is kind of a while). I like the click wheel. It is simple and easy to use when blind (like when the iPod is in the case. 6. Very high quality screen. 1/4 the resolution of a television. 7. Syncs VERY WELL with iTunes  That's it for now. I'll update if anything happens to it. Unlike some, I haven't had much of a problem with iTunes and iPod not working. I have an IBM ThinkPad. I noticed that some programs that map drives and such have adverse effects on iTunes working (like OpenAFS). That may be OpenAFS though (I hear it's a difficult program to work right). Good luck in your decisions, shoppers. I hope this review helps

<Title>Great functionality, terrible durability
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 30 GB video Ipod when it first came out and I bought the protection plan from Best Buy and it was the best purchase of my life(not the Ipod but the protection plan). I'm now on my 4th unit and they usually last me about 4 months before they begin freezing up and the battery life is garbage! Usually I am without an MP3 player for weeks at a time because they are always fixing mine. I was told that if you jog with an Ipod DO NOT get a hard drive based player but go with the flash memory. Would have been nice to know before but the jog wheel is great and the design is awesome too. Probably wouldn't buy this product again

<Title>Best iPod so far and best MUSIC Player! (Not Video!)
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my first iPod in September which was the Nano. I loved how it was flash memory, but was tooooooo fragile, so it cracked. I now buy an iPod Video in January and it is the best music player! In my title, I stated that this is not the best video player. Although I did buy quite a few videos because of how clear and crisp it is, it only has 2 hours battery life on the 30gb model. It is scratch prone and attracts fingerprints. You may think this iPod coming with a case is a great thing, but it is horrible case! You must remove your iPod to change the song or watch a video. Since it is very snug, when you keep removing it, you will get scratches. I suggest the iSkin EVo3 although it attracts lint. It includes screen, clickwheel, and USB protection. Also, the sound quality is superb on the iPod. Barely any glitches in the sound. I do not like how the iPod Hard drive spins and gets warm while watching a video though. The iSkin includes small hole in the back of it to release warm air from the iPod. The headphones do not stay in my ears well with or without the black covers on. The USB 2.0 cable is the perfect size for me to connect to my HP laptop from my iPod. The games on the iPod are getting old and boring. Music Quiz is my favorite since it gives you a clip of a song and you have to guess it with five following choices. Wonderful features are included also such as an accurate world clock, hold switch, stop watch, etc etc. Hope this gives you an idea of the iPod!

<Title>Had 2 - Hard drived failed on both loading songs.
<Date>Sat Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted an iPod for years and finally bought one.  I had already downloaded iTunes and burned 1700 of my favorite songs onto my laptop in AAC format, so when I bought the iPod I was all ready to load songs.  Too bad the hard drive failed loading the songs.  OK.  Took to the Apple Genius who gave me a new one.  It died too.  Spent hours scanning the internet for fun tricks to try to get the stupid thing to work, but never could fix it.  Never actually listened to a song on the damn thing so who knows what it sounds like.   Apple did refund my money, but what do I do with the 1700 songs in AAC format?   I dread loading all those songs again!

<Title>wow best mp3 player out there.
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>well to start off this is my 4th mp3 player. my first ipod was the 4gb mini. it was nice but didnt have enough space. so i whent to the toshiba gigabeat (horrible). i finnaly got sick of my gigabeat and upgraded to the ipod video. on durability, the player feels sturdy enough. but the screen scratches really easy, even with the velvet case that comes with it. trust me you will never feel totally safe with a uncased ipod in your pocket. the black ipod does show scratches way more than the white. but if you have a case that wouldnt really matter. anyway the storage, i got the 30gb. and really thats all i need. i think that its a waste of money to get the 60gig. even with 10 episodes of south park i have 20gb left. the video quality is excelent considering the size of the screen. i compared the screen sizes of the creative zen vision M against the ipod, the ipod is much much bigger. yeah u may have read that the ipod is really complicated to convert to a version that it will see. yeah its true. but i dont really need a video player. its quite nice to have a few episodes of your favorite show with you. which u can buy on itunes. its awsome to have strong bad email as a podcast. ok to the music, the sound quality is just unbeatable. yes with the ablum art available its nice to give your music "life" pluse its nice to have a complete universe of accesories. so really the only problem to this player is the scratch prone screen. and remember this is a mp3 player first, the video is just a nice feature. and i highly recomend a case. i got the black iskin from the online apple store. the ipod is totally encased in this case so i really recomend this case.

<Title>How did I live without this?!?!?!
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I honestly don't know how I lived without my iPod!    I debated between the Nano and this one because I had heard that the video wasn't supposed to be very clear and I couldn't imagine that I would want more than 2 GB of songs.  I am so glad that I picked this one!  Unless it's in really bright light, the video is very crisp and I love watching T.V. shows that I missed while I am taking the train to work.  In addition to loading all of my CD's onto it, I have downloaded videos, songs and podcasts.  Although it's still only about 1/3 full, I obviously would have filled the nano right away.  There are only three things that I don't like: 1) Even though I keep it in a case, the screen somehow became scratched;  2) The headphones are a little too big for my ears and the foam covers fall off easily; and 3) Apple should provide the cord to allow you to charge it using a wall outlet.  Other than these minor issues, it is a fabulous product and I am very happy I took the leap!

<Title>Time for a rant
<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The reason I gave this item 1 star is because if you buy an ipod you have no choice but to buy a $30 case with it.  For a product selling at this rate, it is ludicrous for it to not include a GOOD (that works!) case or pouch to protect the item from damage. Let's face it, ipods are great, but they are very fragile.  When you click "add to cart" remember that it is going to be at least $30 more than the price says, unless you want a screen you can't see through due to scratches (which of course the warranty doesn't cover). And I'm talking from light use, e.g. in a sweatshirt pocket.

<Title>Almost a great product
<Date>Wed Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased mine from Amazon about a month ago. My biggest dissapontiment was its very very short battery life even when used only for music without video. You can literally see the battery charge bars disappering every 3rd song or so. This only gets worse when if you use video at all.  Some key features from the menu that I was expecting to be naturally there aren't there. It would have been nice to delete a podcasts and even music on the ipod itself after listening to it. Well, you can't do that. You would need to plug it into your PC and   fire up iTune to do this. This is an annoyance.  Oh, and I can't stand the headphones it came with. Extremely uncomfortable.

<Content>Very pleased with the i-pod but it doesn't correlate with my i-pod mini.  That is the dock is not fire wire, i-trip I used with the mini doesn't work. It's a whole different thing and new accessories are needed I had to buy the AV kit so I could show slides etc/ on the TV or feed to my sound system another $100. My i-Mac doesn't have USB 2.0 so linking is slower than with the firewire connection  to my mini. But I gained slide shows and video that I didn't have before so I am happy. Everone probably already knows about the lack of firewire connectivity by now, still not happy about that

<Title>Ipod Video, the Commercial Mp3 Player
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm not in anyways "Mp3 Savy", i just would like to give a basic review/sum up to us common music lovers, not a gadget fanatic knowing all these fancey terms.  Apples next generation of Ipods leads us into new territory finally...Video.Not revolutionary, but fantastic by all means.By now the prices have dropped on used models making it ideal for a music lover willing to pay for worth while extras. Im reviewing specifaclly the 30gb model, capable of holding around 7,500 songs(it can hold crisp pictures too!).If you ever owned an Ipod the layout will feel welcoming and somewhat new.The new menues are video-music video-movies and so fourth.The older menues got updates as well featuring an all new screen lock, resembling alittle vault, quite quirky.The games are not great, but they kill time.  For the actual music the quality is around average or alittle above, equalizers are your biggest assett this time around.The battery is a infamous issue by now.It drops very fast when flicking through menues.Many will tell you it lasts for many hours on end i've gotten mine to about 8-10 hours with some changing of menues.To make it sustain along healthy battery life one must avoid the constant extras and simply listen to the song.WIth out the backround light it's very hard to see outside in daylight(but it preserves the battery!).  Itunes the counterpart to the Ipod is great for the features, but the store is lacking.99 cents a song is alittle crazy.The deals are working against you not with you.(Buy classic Red Hot Chili Pepper albums over to gain a new song, is it worth it?)The music video section lacks biggies like Metallica and NIRVANA!(not to mention the good old classics,Led Zeppelin, THE BEATLES...Ac/Dc!)Also the video support isn't great at all, all i wanted was "saving Private Ryan" all they offer is children movies bassically(nothing wrong with that, but i don't know to many 3 year olds owning such an expensive piece of equipment)  All in all I managed to make due and have some great playlists and enjoyable songs on mine.Adding lyrics,comments,and syncing album covers is pretty neat too.I've got 1,087 items on mine since March and it's held up very well.The color is awsome and the wheel feature is stunning and the screen is big enough to see all the lettering,most of the time...Although the big screen leaves a big surface to have scratched and oh boy does this scracth easily.Spend thrity bucks to protect your investment.  With all the cons is it really worth it(and why did i still give it four stars?!)?In my honest opinion yes deffinetly.The few pros exceed the many cons and some will see that and others wont.Who knows there are probly way better MP3 players available but this does the job just fine(for now).

<Title>Too many restrictions!
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my iPod through my school district.  I am an elementary music teacher and use it with a Bose docking station.  I have downloaded all of my curriculum cd's (a lengthy process!) onto my iPod through my computer at school.  Problem is, when I take my iPod home in the evening and need to do some work with it at home, it's uncooperative.  Basically, since I loaded my CDs onto my school computer (not my home computer), I cannot burn and compile CDs on my home computer using my school material that I put onto my iPod.  (My school computer does not have a CD burner..making it neccessary to burn CDs at home.)  I purchased some music on iTunes from my school computer, but cannot load the music onto my home computer, despite the fact that I paid for it.  (Lesson learned!  Now I only purchase music from my home computer.)  While at a convention, I couldn't charge my iPod, since it doesn't come with an A/C adaptor.    It takes forever for both of my computers to recognize my iPod and sometimes plugging my iPod into my computer causes iTunes to freeze up.  It came with a very limited instruction manual...if you need to know anything, you have to go onto their huge website and search forever to find an answer to your problem.  The earphones are really big for my ears...they barely fit..and they hurt!  The screen is all scuffed up despite how careful I've tried to be.  My photos look great, but if I look too long at them, my battery is gone.  I love the Bose docking station and other accessories, but when I purchase an MP3 player of my own when school is out, I'm going to try another brand.  Just because everyone has an iPod doesn't make them the best choice!  I might feel differently if I was in high school and wanted to look like all my friends, but I'm past the "cool" stage now.  I need functionality, and a device that doesn't assume that I'm a music thief and will give me control over my OWN music that I PAID for!!  If I only worked from one computer, I think I would like it just fine.  But if you want to use more than one computer, it gets really confusing and frustrating to remember which computer has which songs on it.

<Content>B. Scott "gimpygoo1" - just an FYI... you can pick up anything purchased from iTunes from any computer. You just need to click on Purchased Items and then log in to your own iTunes account. Purchases can be downloaded on up to 5 different "authorized" computers.  I LOVE my Video iPod. I don't know how I ever lived without it.  No chatty DJs, no commercials, only the music I want to listen to, no music I don't like.  No more need to carry my CD collection in the car with me since I bought a TransPod.  Plays my tunes (static free) right through the radio.  When I come across songs that I don't think I'll want to hear over and over, I rate them with one star.  Then when I go back to iTunes, I delete them and make room for new songs.  Also, don't remove the plastic cover on your new iPod. Just cut off the tab at the bottom.  No scratches and it will save you from just buying that same cover later on.  And be sure to get the AppleCare Protection plan. It's worth it!

<Content>An excellent piece of equipment for those who like to work out with entertainment and travel a lot.  A great on the go high capacity storage unit as well.  Excellent graphics and sound make this a must have addition to a fast-paced life.  Easy to use software comes with this portable player.  The software makes it easy for you to index whatever information, music or videos you have on this unit.  The only complaint I have about the iPod is that when you have a lot of music or videos on it, it is hard to get to songs you've never heard before on the unit.  You have to scroll to find them.  If you are like me and just plug and play you'll tend to hear the same songs over and over again.  Having well over 2000 songs on mine, I still hear the same songs over and over again even with shuffle.  Other than now this is a great unit.

<Date>Sat May 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought My iPod about 3 weeks ago and I absolutly love it. Since I live in Japan and ride the train alot it is convienient to have a majority of my music library available at the click of a button.   the video capabilities are actually pretty good provided you have a  video that has been transfered into the format that is accepeted.   I would recommend buying a new set of headphones immediatly. Granite the set included with the player are good, they offer no noise cancelling capabilities, the frequency range is decent but to really experiance the sound quality provided I would recommend better ones.   The battery life is pretty good if you are just listening to music. If you are watching alot of video you have about 3hours worth of battery time. The arm moving inside of the hard disk sucks alot of juice as well. I would reccomend encoding your music into the acc format.  Other than the battery life this is a very good product and I would recommend this product to anyone.

<Title>Could Be One Of The Best Inventions Ever, But Room For Improvement [4.5 stars]
<Date>Sat May 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm pretty sure anyone who reads this review at least owns something by Apple. I bought this about 4 months ago and I say it is one of the best musical playback systems that I've ever used. The product being thinner than its previous ones (the 20GB for example) is easier to store in your pocket without looking like you have a huge chunk in your pocket.   Basically it is like most music systems. It has its play button, its skip and repeat button, and the menu button. Theres a button in the middle that is more like an enter button that you press that you want to make your selection. Also the wheel, the big round circle, you can adjust the volume or go to a certain point through a song. You can select you music choices by: song, artist, album, or just have the device randomly shuffle it.   Now with the new Ipod, you can also download videos (from I Tunes) to play. Also you can download audio books to listen to. Some of the extras (I don't use very much) are: games, the clock, stopwatch, notes, contacts, and a calendar if you want to use them. Another new feature with the new Ipods is the color screen. And if you download from I-Tunes you can see the CD cover on the Ipod also. If you decide to download from Apple I-Tunes, you can download most songs for $0.99 or you can download the whole CD which on average cost $9.99 per CD. If you have your own CDs, you can just rip them in your CD ROM drive into the program.  What comes in the box is the Ipod itself, some ear buds, the instruction booklet and the USB adapter that connects to the computer. When you want to transfer the music from your computer to your Ipod, just connect the it to your computer by the USB cord and [if you have it set] it will load the music automatically to your device. Just follow directions.  I have a few things that could have used improvement;  First when it is purchased, it could have came with an AC adapter which charges your battery. You can still charge your battery by connecting your Ipod to your computer by the USB cord, but it charges slower. Luckly I owned an older model and kept the plug.  Second is that sometimes the Ipod may freeze up and not work. If this happens, just press the enter (the button in the middle) and the play/pause button and it will reset iself.   Third, as I stated earlier is that I bought an older 20GB model around christmas/new years 2004, and around Jan 2006 the hard drive crashed, causing me to buy a newer model. I also have about 2 of my friends say that theirs crashed and had to buy a new one. I hope this isn't the average life expectancy of the device, because if it is, every year and a half, you will be having yours repaired or buying a new one. If you fear worst, but the lifetime warranty (I think its about $59, I'm not sure). If Amazon.com doesn't sell it, go to your local Apple store and buy it there.   Last is the I-Tunes program. It is a good program to store your music, but if you are like me and have tons of CD's and music, I recommend you get an external hard drive or get a second one installed, to put all your music there. Another thing when purchasing CD's is that the program sometimes doesn't have all the tracks on the CD. It'll say partial album. (A good example: Look up all the A Tribe Called Quest's Albums) So it will be missing about 1 or 2 tracks from the CD. To some people, that may not be an issue because they may download songs individually, but if you want the full album, that may irritate you. Other downloads of CD it may say "By Song Only" which means you cannot download the CD all together for $9.99, but you have to download each song for $0.99, which may be a problem. Example: You have a 20 track CD. You could download the whole CD for $9.99 or you can download each track seprately for $0.99 which means you will pay $19.80, not good for your music budjet.   Other than those small flaws, the Ipod is a music device that would be good to your collection. One thing I recommend you also buy is a case, because if you are clumsy and drop the device, it could sustain damage and cause it not to work. It is a good device though. When you buy it, just follow the directions and you will learn how to do [more advanced] things with the Ipod. The spotlight reviewers go into more detail with more of the features (I haven't tried podcasting yet), so you could get more info from them. Other than that it is a good invention by Apple...and more to come.  If you do have one or decide to purchase it, and have any questions or troubleshooting, just go to the website www.apple.com/itunes, they maybe able to answer some questions. If all else fails, just go to your local Apple store.

<Title>My first iPod, and very happy with it!
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this iPod right before having shoulder surgery (I'm typing one-handed as we speak). I got it for the following uses while in the hospital: 1) Listen to music (can be done while awake or zonked on painkillers) 2) Watch comedy videos (laughter is the best medicine) and other video material purchased from the iTunes music store  Song playback is great, as one would expect. I've used in my car (via cassette adapter), at work, and in the hospital/at home (all via Sennheiser headphones). Music reproduction sounds equally good for songs bought on the iTMS (128 kbps AAC encoding) and songs I ripped from CD's I own (192 kbps AAC).  Video playback is quite good, but not perfect. I downloaded the free pilot episode of "Conviction", and the darker scenes were hard to make out clearly when viewed in a brightly lit room. Not impossible, and not bad quality, it's just hard to make out that kind of contrast on a small screen under those conditions. NOTE: This may be due to my having installed an invisibleSHIELD screen protector, as the plastic laminate is somewhat glossy and could exaggerate these kinds of problems.  I also noticed that all of the Comedy Central standup shows I purchased had noticeable audio dropouts after each of the commercial break marks, and these would last for several seconds. I had not noticed the same problem with the "Conviction" pilot, so this may have been more of a failing in the encoding of those videos than a problem with the iPod.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase!

<Title>Its just OK
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new 30GB iPod Video is just ok, I got rid of my mini for this and I wish I didnt.  To get video on you have to download diffrent programs to hack apples software because theres dosn't work right.  The battery life is very poor, you will get about 6 to 7 hours of life just listen to music, and if you use video its under 2 hours. In my opinion that is horrible.  The mini could go like 16 hours and be allright.

The screen scratches way too easy and its ridiculous how you have to get video files onto it. Spend the extra bucks on a case saves you alot of trouble later. Overall a good product...so far.

<Title>A very good product, negative criticisms are mislead
<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One of the largest criticisms for the iPod (not i-pod, iPOD, or Ipod) is that it has a very short battery life. This is not true, but it is due to user error. The manual specifically says to charge the iPod completely in its first use, and then let the battery completely drain. This allows the battery to work at its full capacity and give it the full 14 hours of music playback that it's supposed to have.  Many people complain about the price of the iPod. However, when you look at what's inside you'll find that it is quite reasonably priced. If you bought all the components separately, this is how much they would be:  30 GB 1.5-inch hard drive                                                                               ~$100 Chip enabling video playback, photo viewing, music playback and basic OS    ~$100 High definition 2.5 inch LCD screen                                                                ~$30 Battery with microprocessor                                                                            ~$30  Grand total                                                                                                     ~$260      This price does not include workmenship, engineering, packaging and profit.  Another criticism for the iPod is that the screen can be scratched very easily. This is true, but it is because Apple designed it like that so it allows the picture to be very clear and non-obscured. This is why you should buy a case. Although this is an inconvenience, it is well worth it.   Another criticism for the iPod is that it is difficult to put movies on. Those people who complain about how hard it is to put movies on an iPod are completely wrong. First of all, ripping a DVD is not hard at all so those who intend to do illegal stuff and can't are getting angry as a result of their incompetence. Secondly, iTunes is designed so that 1. People buy the movies from them, and 2. to comply with copyright laws, so that's  why its impossible to get free movies directly through iTunes.

<Title>Ipod Review
<Date>Mon Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Best Pro - Very nice looks, smooth sailing Worst Con - Battery Life  Let me start off by saying this is the best-looking ipod yet. The click wheel is smooth, the screen bright and vibrant, and the ipod itself gives off an essence of innovation. The sound is clear, and watching movies is less strenuous than it seems. BUT, the battery life is terrible. The Apple site boasts of 20 hours of battery life: this is not even close to the real amount, which leads me to believe that that is the number if you keep it on without playing music or video. This is pretty much the only complaint i have (besides itunes, but im not going to go into that), but it is also the reason why im only giving it 2 stars. I'm pretty sure I get maybe 3 hours of music, and i havent watched too much video to tell yet for that. Converting your video files isnt as bad as it seems, there are a lot of decent converters out there. Lastly, i dont know about the external durability of the ipod, as i bought a skin and it seems to be working pretty well. The only people who get scratches on their ipod are people who sit on them, spill something on them, etc.

<Content>my computer is too old. My iMac simply does not have enough memory left to download anything at all, from iTunes to cds. Its system would be overtaxed and it would take way, way, way to long to put anything on the iPod. So I will have to get a new computer as soon as finances allow; then I'll re-order an iPod. The Amazon representative with whom we spoke was very helpful about making a return. For that I was grateful. Chances are, when I've upgraded, I will again place an order with Amazon.

<Title>Great, great, and simply great!
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a 30GB black iPod and so far, I am nothing less than impressed.  I bought this iPod to upgrade from my old, yet suprisingly more reliable, 20GB monochrome iPod and here are the upsides:  Video: Everybody's talking about the new video feature. It's absolutely great and it has nice quality, but it eats up your battery power like nothing you've seen before and the iPod has very specific restrictions on what type of videos it can play, which is annoying if you don't know how to get the software. I watch mainly TV shows on it and after like 2 or 3 30minute episodes, my iPod's battery went from a full green (which means good) to a barely there red (which, obviously, means it's close to turning off on me). If you are on a trip and this happens to you and you are unfortunately caught without a charger but you still want to hear just one more song (not see one more video), I suggest that you IMMEDIATELY turn off the backlight, because the backlight eats up power as well. And an interesting thing I found, is that you can watch videos without a backlight...Which leads to my next section,  Backlight: The backlight is possibly the brightest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. I honestly believe that staring into it can't be good for you, but it is a nice feature. It really needs levels of brightness because if you turn off the backlight completely, you are going to have to show it to another source of light because reading the screen becomes near impossible to read, unlike with my old iPod in which I could read the screen with ease.  Portability/Scratches: This iPod is thinner and more portable than the previous 20GB iPod, but it is more delicate and feels more "wider", even though I've been told otherwise. This iPod is unbeliably easy to ruin aesthetically (sp?). If you breath on the silver back, expect to find a dozen little tiny scratches when you try to wipe it off. I highly advise that purchasers of an iPod buy a case (either metal or rubber) or a LCD screen protector and when the iPod comes, take it out of the box and put it on ASAP. You don't have to buy an LCD screen protector, though. You can just be cheap and keep the plastic cover on the front of the iPod on the iPod and not take it off. That's what I'm currently doing, LOL.  Headphones: A lot of people complain about the headphones. I personally don't really have any qualms about it. It fits snuggly in my ear, but it would be nice to listen to U2's Vertigo at maximum volume without other people being able to hear it. And the headphones included with the iPod tend to falter when listening to loud music, producing a painful static sound.  Color function: I think I speak for most 20GB monochrome to 30GB video upgraders that the colors on the iPod are some of the coolest things I've ever seen. It's great being able to see album artwork while listening to your favorite song. And if you added lyrics to it, you could read along as well as listening to the song you might be playing. It would be even cooler if they had a mini artwork box with the lyrics, but other than that, I'm okay.  In conclusion, despite its qualms, I believe the iPod is possibly the best mp3 player I've been fortunate enough to have. But I also believe that despite its greatness, it's in your best interest to purchase an iPod apple care plan agreement and then when that expires, buy another protection plan, either from Apple or from an independent insurer!!! You will kick yourself when you wake up one morning finding that dreaded exclaimation mark is on your iPod and your limited year warranty just expired like a week ago.  Best luck, A Proud Member of the iPod Generation

<Content>I bought my ipod a few weeks ago.  It is so sleek and easily fits into you pocket for if you go jogging, walking or traveling.  So far I have only used up 10 GB with all the music that we have collected.  We travel alot being in the military so this way we do not have to take all the cd's with us, we can just take the ipod.  It also records some, about 30 minutes worth, of your favorite shows and plays games. The sound on it is great too for such a small recorder.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good Ipod.

<Title>Great, with some problems!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu May 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First off, let me say that I have never owned an Apple Ipod before I received this 30 GB white video. Of course, Amazon's service was very satisfying, I received the Ipod in four days and it was great.  Now I am not an Apple hater, I like all of the systems but I have to say that I was highly disappointed with this item, with the exception of the first three weeks. I had just taken the Ipod out of my computer from charging to leave my house. When looking at the artists, I noticed that only about half of the artists that I had on my Ipod were being shown, I ignored it. Pretty soon when I played a song, no information from the song showed up, not the song title, album, artist, or the little picture. I called Apple and one of their people put me through a few steps and told me when I was done, everything should be okay, after I was done with what I was told to do, my computer did not even respond to the Ipod. I called Amazon and was sent a replacement using one day mail (very good service, loved it). I received the new Ipod and tried to turn it on, THE REPLACEMENT DID NOT WORK, I got this little exclamation point and the Ipod did not turn on, even after hours of charging, as I was suggested to do. I was not happy receiving a replacement for a defective $300 Ipod that turned out to be defective also. Called Amazon again and was told that they would refund me fully and I could order another one if I wished, at that point, with the quality of the Ipod, returning it and getting my money back sounded good. I then found out that the Apple Store will replace any defective Ipods, I took it there and they ran tests on the replacement and gave me a new Ipod (more quality service). This Ipod appears to be working.  The good- The sound of the Ipod is so clear, it is not even funny, I could shake it as hard as I could and it would still come out perfect. The videos, great, they come in just as clear as the music. The battery seems to be working well, I have not tested it but can tell I am getting 10 hours at the very least on a full charge. Overall, if this Ipod keeps working, I do not think that I will ever leave my Ipod behind, whether it is a 30 second walk to the bathroom or seven hour day at high school, it's great to have.   The bad- Beside what I said in the paragraph above with the replacement, there is not a lot of bad. It would be nice to be able to plug Ipod into the wall (adapter costs extra) but it is not to much of a hassle. I heard that the Ipod scratches easy, I did not take a chance, bought cases right away, the Ipod I had for three weeks, not a scratch on it, I would recommend Amazon's product Speck Products 30 GB iPod Video See-Thru Hard Case 3-Pack (Clear, Black, Red) for case protection.  Service from Apple Store and Amazon was superb.

<Content>WOW!! I upgraded from a 4GB iPod Mini. This is an awesome mp3 player, I have multiple DVD's on it, a ton of podcasts, a lot of TV shows, 1,000 songs and it still has barely even a third of the memory used up. It great!   I love useing it on road trips, yes the screen is small but the qaulity is great and it is better than nothing. The plastic on it does scratch easily though so I would recomend getting a case for it, but use the one they give you with the iPod until you can buy a nicer one. I have never been a big fan of the ear buds, but thats not that big of a deal I just use different headphones.   Slide show on this thing is wonderful, expecially when you hook it up to a TV to do a presentation. You can choose what you want the transitions to be and what bachround music you want!  I definately recomend this, its just another great product that Apple has put out.

<Title>iPod - The Phantom Menace
<Date>Wed May 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You walk into you're favorite electronics store in the world: Best Buy.  After you look at the latest models of HDTV's, DVD players, and surround sound systems for hours on end, you come across those objects that seemingly everyone around you owns -the iPod.  The iPod name in today's society have become synonymous to the MP3 player due to its supreme domination in the MP3 player market shares (the Apple market share of all MP3 players is currently about 80%.).  Its prosperity and popularity has never been better, and it has definitely earned the respect as the marketing monster.  As you are looking on the MP3 player shelf, you notice for the first time that there are other brands competing with Apple.  Why have these brands been minimized in comparison to the iPod?  The curtain of iPod popularity has successfully hidden these products from buyers.  Most players and accessories available at stores are, in fact, Apple; you may see a Creative product or two.  The reason for the iPod success is obvious.  Apple was the first to introduce the MP3 player to the world in 2001, and they immediately took advantage of it.  Do you remember the nonstop commercials of the dancing silhouettes with iPods always running?  I'm sure you've seen the billboards along the road, or maybe you've even seen the iPod trains (go Google it for yourself).  Apple has spent bazillions in advertisements and, as a result, successfully formed a national, actually worldwide, culture of iPods.  A friend of mine asked me the other day, "So when are you getting an iPod?"  I told him I didn't know I had to get an iPod MP3 player.  Because you are a music lover, you want the best MP3 player there is, whether it is the best buy for money or for quality.  You are intrigued by these mysterious brands and decide to research them.  You decide that you want a hard-disk player that can hold your astonishing collection of music (and possibly video).  Now that you have your search criteria, you compare and contrast the different brands of players.  As of today, the iRiver H10 model has the best buy per GB.  For new as low as $180, you will have 20GB of memory plus features like the voice recorder, FM-tuner, and text file displaying.  Is it too good to be true?  Apparently not.  One of the recent models -Creative Zen Vision: M-has the potential of being a true "iPod killer."  In the red corner, we have the Vision: M with the same screen size of the iPod video but  **comes in many more colors ** has better sound quality **has a better screen (proof: http://www.everythingusb.com/creative_zen_vision:m_30gb.html) **and includes the features which the iPod lacks:     *FM-tuner    *availability of multiple music stores    *deletion of music during operation    *an adapter (unlike the iPod which you must find a computer to plug into)    *includes support for the important and widely used music formats    *and most importantly a battery life 2X the iPod Video.    The Vision: M with all its yummy goodness may be purchased at a lower price than its competitor, though most post them at the same price.  In the blue corner, we have the iPod Video with: **half inch thickness (in comparison to the Vision: M with .7") **a supposedly sleeker design **and lyric display.  They both share the same capacity (unless you're a total freak with way too many songs for your own good and need an iPod Video 60GB) and have a voice recorder.  In essence, Apple has blinded the world of other MP3 players.  If these two great players-iRiver H10 and Creative Zen Vision: M-were advertised as much as the iPod, people would discover which one is worth the money.  It's only logical that iPod is not as good as these players.  Do your research; don't get an iPod; and spend your money wisely.

<Title>Taking your music (and video!) to a new level
<Date>Wed May 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the first iPod I've ever owned, having never really given the new technology a chance to replace my affection for CDs.  When I finally relented and bought this product, I immediately began to wonder how I ever lived without it.  I have over 400 CDs, and took the time (and it did take a lot of time) to put the stuff I wanted from each of them.  The result is that I have my entire music collection at my fingertips at all times, and have not used even 20% of the memory.  The obvious great feature (in terms of music, at least) of the 30 GB iPod is the ease at which you can listen to any or all of your favorite music.  One very nice, sometimes overlooked, aspect of the iPod is the shuffle feature.  With over 1500 songs on my iPod, I can hit the shuffle button and I instantly have the equivalent of my own radio station, with the added advantages of having NO songs I don't like and having zero commercials.  The shuffle does not seem to be completely random (I tend to get several songs from the same artists in a relatively short period of time), but that is a minor problem.    Given the iPod's thin design and portability, you can take it wherever you go.  I've got a car adapter for it, a home speaker system, and of course the headphones.  Because of that it's literally replaced every other sound system (radios, CD players, etc) I own.  As a huge fan of music I've been amazed at how much my music experience has been enriched by this product.   Of course I've only highlighted a small part of the iPod.  I plan on loading pictures onto it soon, and you can download video as well.  It's even got a few games.  In short, this is quite possibly the best entertainment investment I've made in quite a while.

<Content>IPods are Rip-offs   The iPod's not the only music player you can get, It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met. If they just knew what the other players had in store for them, They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen.  The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites, But why not get a better player with more gigabytes? Sandisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices, Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.  The Sandisk Sansa E100 has many, many things, An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings. Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not! The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.  The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal, It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal. Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player, For less than the Nano...are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer.      There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space, It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place. FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy, The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.  The Creative Zen Vision: M is better than the Ipod Video, Better screen, more features, and better value make it glow. The fact that the Vision: M is thicker doesn't really matter, The features are what make the Vision: M unimportantly fatter.  So you see, my friends, the iPod is a waste of precious time, The fact that Apple cheats you out is basically a crime. They make their iPods fragile just to make them really "cool", Anyone who buys one is just a ridiculous crazy fool.   Facts  1.	Ipods are MP3 players. It seems like people want to separate iPods from other MP3 players. Can iPods play MP3's? If so, it's an MP3 player. 2.	The Creative Zen Vision: M is pretty much the same thing as the iPod with video, but the Zen has much, much more. It has an FM tuner (FM recording), voice recorder, better screen (262,144 colors as opposed to 65,000-very big difference),

<Title>Great product for your money
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my ipod last October and I'm really glad I did.  It was my first ipod, let alone mp3 player.  This gadget is a must have if you want music, movies, and photos in one sleek device.  I reccommend getting the white one if you don't want scratches to be as noticeable.  That is one of the problems I have: it scratches pretty easily, the screen especially.  However, the screen is large enough for movie viewing with excellent picture quality.    Another problem is that you have to buy a wall charger separately.  The box comes with a USB charger and some cheap headphones that don't deliver great sound.  At first, they did, but after a few months I had to turn the volume way up just to hear a song normally.  Also, they hurt your ears after a while.  My advice: buy some other headphones!     If your old ipod is kind of worn and not functioning like it used to and you want a gadget that can hold your movies, I recommend getting a video ipod.  It is well worth the money!!!

<Content>Video is very clear. itunes software is mediocre and since the iPOD works off of that, there are limitations based on that. Player works well.   Ear buds are not that comfortable and removable covering falls off easily. Screen and unit scratches easily, so you end up covering the beautiful black (or white) case with a 'skin' covering which is less attractive, but more durable. Technology could still be improved-- but it is amazing the memory and relatively quick access to so much music, talk, video, etc.

<Title>wow
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So i had an ipod mini.  I ran out of room on it because i'm really into all kinds of music and i need a lot of space. So i bought this ipod.  I guess i got lucky.  Everybody complains about battery life, but i say it's really long.  I went on a school trip last week, an hour there and hour back two days in a row.  That's four hours, plus listeing too it on my speakers, watching videos, and taking car rides to the mall and movies, my ipod stayed charged for about 13 hours in 3 days.  That's what they said, and that's what i got.  I'm very pleased with this ipod and the videos come out very clear

<Content>I really am enjoying my iPod however I bought it mainly for working out at the gym. After about 30 minutes of jogging it freezes which I find really annoying. If you want something for working out I suggest you get the nano or shuffle...but it is great for everything else. The photos come out crystal clear. I am having trouble getting my home video on it but I am sure it has something to do with me. As a whole I really am enjoying it.

<Title>Disgusted
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm onto my fourth replacement iPod because the battery doesn't last half the time stated in other reviews.  Each and every time I play music, not videos and using Apple's file format, the battery lasts less than seven hours.  While I enjoy the idea of having a lot of music accessible in my office, the reality of short battery life leaves much to be desired.  If you should get the iPod, then by all means get the extended service contract because you're gonna need it!

<Title>Battery Life
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One of the reasons why I have purchased the iPod was the 15 hours battery life advertised by Apple. I have followed all the instructions to the letter with regard to charging the iPod, but the maximum battery life I get from it is between 8 to 9 hours which is very disappointing. I often travel long haul across the Atlantic and my flight takes a total of 19 hours. I use my iPod to listen to music on the plane and I am already thinking of buying a Battery Pack, which means an additional $60.00, not to mention the $ 40.00 for the power adapter, $39.00 for the universal dock and the $20.00 for the A/V cable which in my opinion should have been included in the original package. My recommendations are if you can wait a little bit more dont buy this iPod and instead wait for the 6G iPod which might have better battery life and better Video integration.

<Title>I love it, but there are some quirks!!! (3 1/2 star)
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my ipod a couple of weeks ago and I love it, but there are some things you must know before you buy it....You have to put ALOT of money into it. 1st you buy the ipod for at least $400, then you buy the charger for $30. After this you have to buy a card, (or someone can give you a giftcard)this ranges from $15-$50 at most stores. This ipod has at least 5000 memory space for songs.(This means you will spend at least $5000 or more because you can delete songs ,but it wont give you back credit.) You pay at least .99 cents a song or $1.99 for most movies/videos. They don't tell you this but they charge you tax for everything, so if you buy a $30 card you will probley get 27 maby 28 songs or less if you buy videos.The charger and battery on the ipod wear out after so many charges and you have to buy a new charger. When the battery wears out you can run a simple test (instructions on apple.com) to see how long your ipod is running. If it is less than desirable ,you can send it to the manufacture with the test results ,and they will send you back a new one for $60. The new one does not have your songs on it so you must save them on your computer if you want to keep them(if you don't you have to re-buy them).Basiclly it's preatty much a money pit,but a good money pit, because it is kind of worth it. P.S. On some ipods (like mine) the battery does not last as long as it should (4 hrs instead of 14).I bought mine and it lasted only 3 1/2 hrs, I returned it and my new one is doing the same thing. It may just be me,but they do address this problem on the website.

<Title>I'm sticking with my sony MD
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Everyone was saying that I was locked in the stone ages because I refused to lose my sony md and get an ipod. I finally purchased one and returned it within a week.  It just isn't as versitile as my sony MD.   The battery life is horrid, it doesn't even have a built in charger for the battery.  Can't record live or from any source for that matter.  Good thing that I stocked up on blank 1GB MDs because it doesn't look like I can find them anywhere anymore.   Maybe when the ipod comes with a little more features (I can watch full length movies on my moto cell phone) and a better price (it is a money sink hole as someone else mentioned) maybe, just maybe I'll leave the flintstones and join the rest of the jetsons.

I also got a FM transmitter now I can use it in my car, my music system.....  Only problem I have is when I convert music videos using I-Tunes it somehow loses the audio.

<Title>Could have been so much better...
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I had iPod envy for years, and finally got one for Christmas three months ago. It's the 30 GB black video iPod that is still produced by Apple as of this writing.  My impressions after three months are that it's neat, but very over-rated.  Yes.  It plays music.  A lot of music.  That's good.  But the earbuds are bad.  They keep falling out of my ears, and they let in too much ambient noise.  I had to hunt around for earplug-style ear phones that actually fit inside the ear canal.  Got Koss Sparkplugs.  I can significantly lower the volume of the iPod because I don't need to drown out the surrounding noise to hear my music.  Much better for my hearing and for my listening enjoyment.  Apple could have included similar ear plug style ear phones for no extra cost to them, but they chose to go with their "cool" white earbuds instead.  The front panel (and to a lesser extent the back panel)is HORRIBLE.  Apple is very concerned about how things look.  They don't seem to care about how they work.  The iPod's front panel reminds me of the perfectly round mouse they had on the first iMac.  Looked cool, but wasn't functional.  Now they have a flush front panel on their newest iPods.  Looks cool, but it would be a lot easier to operate if your fingers could actually FEEL where the buttons are.  Having all the controls flush with the panel means that you have to pull the iPod up to your face before you can push any buttons.  Forget about a vision impaired person using this.  Speaking of the front panel, it scratches and scuffs far too easily.  I have used pagers, cell phones, Blackberrys, etc. for years.  They all seem to have found that slightly textured hard plastic stands up well to  simple wear and tear.  Not Apple.  They looked around for the softest, most easily scratched clear plastic they could find. I am very careful with my iPod.  I keep it in my pocket with nothing else that it might rub on, but after just three months, the face of it is all scuffed up.  That's unforgivable.  If Apple is going to make something that is intended to be portable, it should be able to withstand simply rubbing up against the ear phone cords in my pocket without getting scratched or scuffed.  If the screen was recessed by a millimeter, it would be protected more.  That's how wristwatches have been made for ages.  It's not rocket science.  Basically, all my problems with this iPod boil down to Apple spending more time on how the thing looks at the expense of how it works.  That's just stupid. This thing holds tons of songs, and plays videos!  It had the potential to be awesome, but Apple just threw it all away by trying to make it look cool.

<Content>My husband brought me th 60 GB IPod for Christmas.  I really loved it.  I had to buy the Nike earbuds because the other ones kept coming out of my ears and I have to buy the car charger.  I was going real good, but then it stop working.  When I took it back to the store, they said it looked like someone openned it and to fix it would cost 259.00.  I thought that was crazy.  I have not bought a replacement yet and I am not happy.  I do not recommend a product that is costs this much that needs so many extras that you can not get support for.  It is truely over rated.

<Title>Good Ipod.
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to say, this thing really impressed me. I had a lot of doubts and worries about it as I have strict guidelines for electronics, but those are all gone now.   The Good:   - Assuming you encode your movies correctly, video playback is awesome. The quality all depends on the movies you have. I have a lot of HDTV 24 episodes and they look just like they do on my computer monitor. IF YOU ENCODE INCORRECTLY THEY WILL NOT PERFORM WELL.   - Sound is gorgeous. Even with those earbuds (which any real audiophile should replace anyway), the music sounds great. There are also about 25 presets in the EQ you can choose from like Electronic, Dance, Classical, and so on. Depending on the properties of your music, the Ipod can go pretty loud and still remain distortion-free. Again, this depends on YOUR music files and NOT the Ipod.   - Screen. I think it could be a bit bigger, but it does the job well. Mine is scratch free as I left the protective film it ships with on and just put a silicone case over top of that. The plastic is a bit scratched up, but the screen underneath is fine. Common sense would tell anyone to leave that protective film ON the device and not to pick at it or it will come off.   - Options. There are a lot of things that can be manipulated and changed. Menus, back-light, clicker, etc. There are also a few games like Music Quiz, where it plays a few seconds of one of your songs and you have to choose the right one out of 5 or so choices. And, there is a diagnostic menu to test the performance of your Ipod in all areas. Really cool.   - Battery Life. I put this in the good since it performs as I would expect. Who is the moron that actually mentioned 75 hours of battery life? During video playback, the most you will get is 2.5 hours of battery life. Let me say that again for those who don't comprehend well. YOU GET 2.5 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE DURING VIDEO PLAYBACK. The more you use the back-light while listening to music, the less battery life you will have. 75 hours applies to never touching the thing and just letting it go through your music. Even then, I doubt you will get 75 hours.   Also, you MUST follow the instructions when first charging it. Portable batteries are VERY sensitive to charge cycles. If you don't charge it like you should, your battery is gonna suck. It is HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT let the battery life decrease past half. There are a number of cycles for each battery and the objective is to avoid ever using an entire cycle.     The Bad:   - This is a hard drive based MP3 player so every so often it takes about a second longer to skip to the next track. If this bothers you, you need a Flash memory MP3 player.   - Battery life again. Expectations aren't everything. The next model really needs an upgraded battery. Charging this thing constantly if you watch movies is a real pain. It could be so much better and I feel that Apple really cut corners with the battery.   - Scratches. It does happen if you are stupid enough to walk around without a case. THE IPOD NEEDS A CASE. Any portable gadget needs a case. Technology has been around long enough for people to know this. There is no excuse.   - Having to encode movies. Why can't Itunes do that? This was another bad choice for Apple unless they are catering to geeks only, which is fine by me. Seriously, if you are not that computer savy then this is not the video player for you. You need to have an understanding of audio/video compression to get the most out of this player.   Apple doesn't even have a program to encode muxed files, which a lot of internet content are. I highly recommend everyone to 'acquire' Nero Digital from Nero 6. It is the best converter out there at the moment that negates any synch problems. ImToo and Videora are completely useless and make very poor files.   - No wireless. Right now, wireless headphones for the Ipod Video are practically non-existent. Logitech seems to be trying to alleviate that, but their headphones are currently riddled with manufacturer defects and don't even support the Video. Let's move it along Apple. We need wireless.   - Earbuds. For the first few months, they are fantastic. But, eventually they seem to adopt vibration problems and hearing a rattle in my right ear is REALLY annoying.   All in all, it is the best MP3 player on the market right now. Period. There just isn't enough support for it from Apple or anyone else. Vehicles are just now coming Ipod ready and that is limited to certain models. Where is our support? Apple? Anyone?

<Title>iPod  - Pleased, But Somewhat Annoyed
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I've ever had. I received it as a gift and have had a great time downloading my entire music collection onto this portable device. Overall, I can say that I am pleased with my iPod. The pictures look sharp and the sound quality is good.   What I am not happy about, however, is the short battery life, as many of the other reviewers have mentioned. I also do not like the fact that I must charge my iPod through a computer. There should be a dual charging method through a traditional wall outlet. I do not always have a computer with me, but could always find a wall outlet. This is even more irritating given the short battery life. Other than that, though, I am pleased. I have no experience with other MP3 players and therefore cannot compare the features and quality with the iPod, but with Apple's enormous market share in digital music players and the vast amount of accessories available for iPods, it really is not a bad choice. That must have been what my dad was thinking when he bought one for me two weeks ago, and I appreciate his generosity.

<Title>iPod video, Pro's ,Cons
<Date>Mon May 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 30 gigabyte iPod video, you've heard of it and wished about it. Well you've come to the right place for it.  Right off the bat,you should know the iPod doesn't hold as much stuff as you think it does.It says it has 30 gigabytes of storage space.Wrong. It acaully has only 27.8 gigabytes of storage space. You might think that you can hold 7,500 songs, well one gigabyte doesn't = 250 songs , it equals 240 songs preferably 4 minutes long each, which means that you could acaully hold only 6,672 songs that are 4 minutes long.Or 1042.5 4 minute long videos.  The battery life isn't as long as exspected, Apple claims it does 14 hours, however, that is wiht the backlight turned off conpletely, nto even the 2 second setting, the backlight takes up a lot of battery life, but without the backlight you can't see athing on the screen. Also you can't play videos for 2 hours on your iPod. Videos kill your battery life. If I were you I would get an extertal battert such as the iCel201.  Those are the cons side of the ipod, the pros can be quite nice, if your a frequent travler, you can see the times in other countrues and bookmark them to see them again. if you had an old iPod, it can be nice to look at the album art of the song you are listening to.The screen quality of the iPod is acaully quite nice, just don't get it scratched up, get a case for it right away. Overall this ipod is a ncie deal, but it depends what you will be using it for, if you have a litle music collection, buy the nano.

Since I have the ipod black it is much more noticeable than the ipod white. Maybe i should of gotten a protector case the day i bought it.

<Content>I recently took a new job and my commute doubled.  While regular radio was ok in small doses, doubled, it's intolerable... play some music!  Enter the iPod, thanks to Santa Claus... it has saved my sanity.  Pro: -Great battery life -Many listening options: shuffle, by artist, etc. -Reasonable size -Many accessories by Apple and 3rd party -Great with Bose noise cancelling headphones!!! -Holds tons of music, all of my 200 CDs with tons of room to spare -Playlist feature lets me play lullabyes for putting our infant son to sleep, keep my wife happy by playing things we both like, or shortening my commute with Punk and Hardcore! -iTunes software is pretty easy to use and has some innnovative features -Buy one song at a time... buy music that you normally wouldn't because you only like a few songs -Download portions of your CDs, jettison the songs you hate... you'll be listening to stuff you've forgotten you have  Cons: -The wheel control is hard to get used to... scrolling one item up or down is somewhat tricky -Searching the iTunes database is not as good as it could be, somewhat hard to find a few songs that I am looking for... the advanced search is weak. -If my unit got too hot, it wouldn't shut off.  I had to let it run out of power. My wife also had a unit that would not shut off (hot or cold) and Apple replaced (not repaired) it.  I lost my iPod, so I cannot say if the power off problem was serious... however, I have bought a replacement.  I can't be without it!  The pod works well especially on a plane and commuting if you have an FM transmitter (remember that 3rd party stuff I mentioned?).  My entire family now owns them and it's awesome to listen to music I haven't in ages.

<Title>nothing new to report, honestly
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>there really isn't anything significantly new about this generation of the iPod after you look past the physical appearance of the product. sure, it's slimmer and has a bigger screen right off the bat, but if you're a veteran iPod user, don't be too disappinted if you realize that the iPod itself is nothing new in functionality. It is still the same great music player it always has been and the onslaught of the iPod appeal definitely lends to this fact. there are a few new things such as a built in stop watch, a screen lock, oh, and of course, video playback.  but honestly, the video playback feature is only cool for the first few days and then you realize that it's just not very practical for viewing movies/videos.  apple should have an option to change the brightness of the screen (to save battery life). and one of my biggest gripes is that apple removed the function to manually turn on the backlight by holding the MENU button like in previous iPod models. I think this in particular was a step back. I want it to return!!  but don't get me wrong, the iPod is a fantastic music player. totally recommended along with the purchase of an Agent 18 clear hard case.

<Content>The iPod is very good looking, UNTIL you start using it. I used mine for TWO days and then noticed large scratches in the screen (try the search scratches + ipod on google). You'll have to invest in a screen protector to be able to use it (about 50$) (that somehow destroy the idea about great design). That said I know of no protective devices which are able to remain free of scratches (just bought one for 50$ (agent 18) - after one week again a lot of scratches - tried to replace it at apple-store, but not possible). The second problem: no power adaptor for ordinary recharging (have to buy it for something like 40$). Third problem: no remote controlling. AGAIN you have to PAY for this and that's about 50$ more. Last problem: short battery life (and you normally have to let apple replace a used battery). EXPECT TO PAY AT LEAST 150$ MORE AFTER YOU HAVE BOUGHT IT (SERIOUSLY)!!!

<Content>I recieved this new iPod video(5 generation iPod) as a christmas gift.  This had to be the best gift that I recieved this year :)  Well this iPod works great! works like a charm... the video quality on this nice toy is great!  the only downside to it is that it gets a little annoying watching it through a small screen all the time.  I got the 30gb version so it holds up to 7,500(thats if all of the songs are converted with AAC format).  I don't think I can ever fill this baby up with 7,500 songs so the 30gb version is almost perfect for me :-)  The second downside to this toy is the battery life...  It only can play up to 14 hours of continuous MUSIC playback and it can only play up to 2 hours VIDEO playback :-( it would be great if it had longer video playback!  But other then that I love this new iPod Video!

<Title>So far, so good, but
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I finally entered the 21st century and got myself an iPod.  My main purpose for the iPod is to use it when I workout.  For that purpose, I have found it to be just wonderful.  I have loaded 1000+ songs on it so far, and have only used about 6 Gig.  The sound seems to be pretty good, however, I find the earbuds uncomfortable.  They just bother my ears, so I have ordered a pair of headphones and I hope they help.  The complaint I have with iPod is that Apple service is TERRIBLE.  Their policy the worst I have ever heard of.  The first day I had the iPod, I attempted to set it up.  On the screen there was a big flashing circle/line that said "do not disconnect".  Supposedly, "my iPod" was to show up on iTunes (I HAD downloaded the software correctly), but due to some weird glitch, it didn't work.  Since I was a new user, I wasn't sure what to do, so I called Apple service.  This is where my complaint comes in.  You are allowed ONE call to Apple during your warranty, after which time you will be charged JUST TO TALK TO A SERVICE PERSON. They offered to sell me an extended warranty for $60!!  It is my personal policy never to buy these.  I think it's a way companies have of boosting the price of their merchandise. This is a new low...to have a company NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT at least during the initial warranty period. I have never heard of such SHODDY customer service!!!!  Doesn't Apple take pride in their product?  After all, this is supposedly the industry standard state-of-the-art mp3 player.  Why don't they at least allow people to call (or at least have some kind of online live chat service) for the first 30 days?  Preferably someone should be able to call in AT ANY TIME during the warranty period.  I have had another minor problem twice now... and the web site has been no help.  I am living with the minor problem, but I shouldn't have to.  This item is brand new, yet since I've already called in one time, I am out of luck. This is unacceptable, Apple.  I hope someone else comes out with a better mp3 player within the next 3 years or so.  If this doesn't change, I don't see myself buying another.

<Title>This Is My 3rd Model of IPod and it's Definately the Best...
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned a Mini and a Shuffle. Although I really liked the Mini for it's price and the shuffle for it's size, this baby takes the cake. I was convinced by my son (13) and husband to spring for this video-player model and I'm glad I did. Why? Not only does it store many, many more songs, it also holds all of our digital pictures. You don't hear about that often, but with a touch of your computer button you can transfer ALL of your images onto this little baby. I even took it to a family reunion and could browse through our trip to NYC with ease. The video capability is amazing. My son has downloaded things from his fave sites and I think we may even try to get "Lost". What a great thing for a trip! The screen is crisp and clear and the sound is wonderful.  I think the battery life could be longer but it's easy to charge at the computer or in your car using a Monster Car Cable. (it will also charge with a docking station).  My only other "bug" I have with all iPods (except the shuffle) is that there is no "off" button. I know it shuts off by itself, but I'd really like to be able to make sure it's really off.  Yes, you should get a protector for the screen. Ours came with a sleeve (no window) to use when you are storing it.  Save up for this 30GB...it's worth the money!

<Title>Love and hate relationship
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Plusses +It plays video: Nice screen resolution, you can put pretty much any DVD or video on it and can watch it lager. It handles it great. In addition, it can access the internet in order to get "podcastes."  +Games: Good plus, it has a handful of nifty simple games that can help pass an hour or two waiting at the airport. +Memory: You could put your entire music album, a movie and other stuff like that and never be worried about filling it up.  Battery: Its battery is good, but not great. I got 8 hours out of it the first few days, but a few weeks in it runs about half that on a normal basis.  Minuses -iTunes: You have to have a good computer to back this device up. Without it, your iPod will not be half the device it could be. Everything on your iPod HAS to be backed up on your computer as well, and you cannot use it to transfer music from a different computer to yours. iTunes wipes your iPod clean whenever you connect it to a new computer. -Recharge: The recharge ONLY works if you have iTunes installed on your computer and your iPod is not in a mass storage mode. I would advise that if you are making an investment in an iPod, to toss in a bit more and get a wall recharge. -No Radio: This thing can sit up and bark if you want it to, however, an FM radio has not been built in. You must buy a special attachment for this. The reasoning for this is because Apple wants you to use their online services (offered through iTunes) for all your needs. -"Easy" Button: iTunes tries to handle everything for you. (which is good if you don't mind the computer deciding for you.) However, if you need control, it simply isn't there. This is just personal, but if you are like me, you need this thing to do more than just a hand full of options the programmers thought you would be interested in using.   My advice: While this IS a good device, it is pricy. I would advise you do your homework. If you aren't going to use the video feature, I would definitely advise looking into saving some money and checking out some other brand of MP3 player.

<Title>Cool Factor is a 10
<Date>Mon Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 30Gb IPOD is a wonder to behold.  I have had it for about 3 months now and have barely begun to tap its storage capacity.  EVERY song I own is in this thing and available with just a couple of clicks!  I have songs, videos, video podcasts and pictures on here.  The storage capabilities are fantastic.  The only thing is that while it stores so much data that battery lacks in sustained energy.  The battery is what keeps this from being a 5 star product.  If you download a TV show like I did (The Office)a 22 minute show drains the battery like nothing you've seen.  However the picture on such a small screen is awesome.  The ability to create playlists is a nice feature, I have one thats about 40 songs of music I like to listen to while I'm lifting weights.  And it has a shuffle feature so it's a different order each time. The IPOD is cool to look at but don't use outside or at the gym until you have a case.  The one supplied is just a cover and you can't use the IPOD when it's on.  The front is a glass cover that shows EVERY little scratch and the back is a highly polished silver that shows EVERY scratch so get a good case and protect this amazing piece of technology.  If they ever get a really kickass battery for this the sky's the limit but it is just out of this world that something this small can hold so much info, sound so good and look so cool all at the same time.

<Date>Mon Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have the iPod for four months now. It is a great thing to have, especially when you're a music maniac. I recommend buying one.  The only downfall, hence 4 stars, is the battery life. Much much shorter from advertised 14 or whatever hours Jobs claimed back in December. Also it scratches quite bad. I bought a protective case and never removed the protective film from my iPod. I recommend that you do that too. Case scratches as well, but that is another story.

<Title>High Tech Nightmare
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Ipod as a gift for a friend. He wanted to download audio books from Itunes. The product appeared to work fine right out of the box. Here's the catch. You must recharge the Ipod through a usb port on a computer that remains on for the entire recharge period. Not all usb ports work as Apple points out in the troubleshooting guide. If your usb port doesn't recharge the device you must purchase a wall outlet charger. My usb did not charge the device. It was completely dead after a few hours of connection with my pc. I could see that this was the gift that would "keep on taking" so I returned it to Amazon.     If you still can't resist the remarkable marketing of this device, here's some advice. The outside coating is high gloss. If you purchase the device in black you will note it appears filthy the second you touch it. I'm guessing this is one of the reasons Apple pushes the white color so heavily.

<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like my iPod. It has amazing features and the sound quality is very nice. My iPod screen is cracked a little, but it still works fine. The battery life sucks and the screen scratches easy, but I got a good case and a travel charger. But c'mon Apple I paid $300.23 and I don't get a case or a wall charger. You guys used to do that (at least the charger) when the iPod wasn't all that popular. Now you guys are making a whole lot of money, and we can't get a freakin charger or a decent case, instead we get that white crappy cloth thing. Anyway the iPod is a good device. I rather Creative Labs Mp3 players.

<Title>Great iPod but battery life is bad.
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my new 30 gb iPod video but I got it in black and every time you touch it you put another fingerprint on it. The shiny silver back scratches easily. Mine is scratched a little bit but not too bad. I ordered a case through Amazon the same day I ordered my iPod, one week and 4 days ago, and it is still not here so I have to keep it in the thin case the iPod came with. It has worked so far but the time my iPod gets scrathed is when I have to take it out of the case to get to the clickwheel and see the screen. The iPod has a beautiful screen that you can see pictures, videos, and album artwork on. Other features are contact book, notes, an alarm clock, and a world clock. The iPod works and looks great. I love all the features and the capability to watch videos and movies. The only bad thing is the battery life. It sucks! If I just play music the battery goes down a quarter let alone watching a video. Other than that it is great.

<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you are a commuter on the L-train, it works like a charm. If you are a suburban dad raking leaves cutting the grass etc., not so great. The iPod is made for a cushy ride in a coat pocket or briefcase.  Clipped to a belt (even in a tough case)the controls are too sensitive.  It's hard to change anything on the fly (volume, album, etc).  I wish it had an artist-album list like Windows player and Creative does.  The backlight needs a dimmer, not just one level of brightness. Battery, enough has been said about that already.  Love the shuffle.  Sound is great, but you must buy new headphones or earbuds.  Video is a novelty.  Do not buy an iPod just for that.

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I would have given the iPod a 0 but it won't let me. I bought my iPod a little over a year ago and it has broken twice(bad hard drive both times). If you buy an iPod I suggest you get it with an extended warranty. I would however recommend not buying an iPod at all, find another brand mp3 player it will be less expensive and probably not break as often. Oh yeah, to top it off, all of the accesories for the iPod are a rip off.   UPDATE... Well it finally happened. My third and final ipod broke two weeks ago. That's 3 broken ipods in 2 years. Keep in mind that I was very careful with all three of them. So they didn't break from abuse. I have recently purchased a 30gig Zune. I will never buy another apple product after the horrible experience I've had with the ipod.

<Title>*UPDATE!!!!* is a new gaming ipod coming out?
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this is actually Kenny "alex"(I already wrote a review, and it was one of the first written).  But if poeple are thinking about buying an iPod, you might want to reconsider waiting, since the new iPod-accroding to an article in EGM, will be released later this year.  This new iPod so far is gettting an all new feature: games!  tHE GAMES will be stored on the hard drive(it better be big), and you can download the games from iTunes.  THey range from exclusives, PC ports, and gameboy games.  The games are played on the system, which is better in design. For starters, it looks more square, has a bigger screen(yes!!!!!!!  I love viewing picutres on mine!!!) and it was four buttongs that resemble the click wheel's buttons, which will be used for operation and playing games.  On the left is a directional pad surrounded by a clich wheel.  Yep, it's a full functioning ipod, and does everything that the older iPod did.  Expect to see some updates on things such as notes and features(the contacts was added a photo square to go along with the people).  Since the device has not been revealed, not much is known, but expect to see something mind blowing.  However though, this may not work out.  The system has no analog sticks or anything, not even 5 buttoins so far, si it may not even stand a chance against the DS(it might go the way of the Gizmondo).  And the games may not be worth it, and the design  dosen't really look as sexy or as portable as the rival, the Sony PSP.  And also, keep int mind this was from EGM, who might be playing some stupid April Fool's joke(but maybe).  It's too early to make a call on waiting, but if you are interested, hold off buying the Video.  If it isn't a joke, than you might want to wait.  IF it is real, we will have more at the E3 this May.  DOn't buy this iPod if you are interested!!!!(no, i am not getting one right away).

<Title>Great gadget!  
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We bought two - we are both happy!  Great companion to have when you have down time traveling, shopping, doing yard work!  We read the other reviews that suggested buying a case, which I HIGHLY recommend.  We bought two different cases one hard plastic and one soft plastic, both protect very well, as long as you have shields for the video screen and click wheel.  Protection is vital.  We both upgraded our earbuds as well.  Earbuds don't really fit all ears.  The music storage capacity is great and the sound quality is amazing.  My only real objection is all the money you end up spending on "extras" like cases, travel chargers, radio adaptors, better earphones.  Overall very happy with our iPods!

<Title>Terrific to use on the road, on a plane just about anywhere...
<Date>Thu Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this as a birthday gift from my spouse and boy did she do a great job of choosing gifts. First the positives--I have the 30GB version and have found the transfer time from windows to be insignficant, sound quality is terrific and the slim design a nice plus. The touch toggle screen is pretty good for breezing through to the next song. It was fairly easy to convert over my windows media files to itunes. I'd suggest choosing add folder as you'll be able to add a whole album. If you want to add just one or two songs then select add file and you're menu will allow you select from songs for each album you've uploaded to your computer.   The video image quality is extremely good as well although, obiviously, I would recommend against watching anything in extreme widescreen as the screen is designed closer to an old style Tv aspect ratio. That's not a negative just keep it in mind if you download something that appears in an oblong aspect ratio (2.35:1 for example). "Battlestar Galatica" looks great on the ipod though. The head phones provide great playback and, honestly, I didn't notice any compression issues with any of the music I listened to with the headset. The set also comes with a software disc that configures itunes for your computer. It's got a relatively easy interface which isn't a surprise given that it was developed by Apple. However, I would suggest going to the itunes site and downloading some of the manuels, printing them out and keeping them around when you first start using the system.   I also want to give Apple kudos for their excellent customer service. I had two problems neither one of which was caused by the itunes/ipod software but, because of their timing, it appeared that it might be related. It turned out that my video driver was corrupted (and had been as there had been some signs I had missed previously). They walked me through how to correct the two problems without missing a beat. The customer service guy I dealt with afterwards sent me an email with helpful links that he thought I could use after our discussion. All around a satisfactory experience dealing with Apple in that regard.   The negatives are few but something that you should be aware of prior to purchasing the ipod. All you receive with this is the headpones and the adaptor cable for your computer. If you want a plug for the wall to recharge it or one for the car it doesn't come with either one. Nor does it come with a car adaptor for listening to music in the car. I had to purchase that separetly. Apple and the companies that license from them need to work on this feature as the car adaptor while good broadcast to empty FM space. Unfortunately, I found that the sound was a bit flat without much depth -- in other words it sounds like analog FM radio without the compression. This is one area that I would suggest that Apple work on developing. The Transdoc Micro also features a bit of bleed through in the form of static that can be heard when you pump up the volume;it's not a major problem but it can be annoying. The Transdoc Micro (which you have to buy separately)also has a plug for cassette adaptors and also as a line out which is, I'm assuming, for recording from radio if you want to do so.  While the batter might not last 16 hours for video playback I don't think that is a big issue (at least for me). I wouldn't have expected that and compared to a portable DVD player with a battery pack the amount of time it lasted exceeded my expectations. As to audio playback time I can't really make a comment as I didn't use it without recharging for 10 hours but it appeared to be sufficient for my needs.   All around I'm very happy with this gift. Apple has done a great job of packaging and putting together this device. Could it use improvements? Sure what device couldn't use improvements but it's light, compact and has terrific sound/video when watching it and listening to the headset.

<Title>5th Generation iPod is here!!!!
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>On to what you really want to know, and what you can't get from Apple's website, or reviews regurgitating technical specifications:   1) Can you actually enjoy watching video on a screen that small? What about the video quality?   In short, if you're holding the iPod as close to your face as you would hold an older iPod to really read what song is playing, the video quality is actually quite nice. The screen is noticeably bigger (the height is about the size of the old iPod width). If you're wondering how the quality comes out on an iPod screen (which is normally fairly pixelated), when you load a video it toggles into a mode much akin to when a computer plays a graphics intensive video game. It takes about 10 seconds for a feature-length film to load (i.e., between clicking play, and when it starts playing).   With regard to movies, the iPod doesn't support chapters. My guess is that people will eventually want movies distributed as folders, witch chapters being the individual files. This will allow chapter skipping. That said, once a movie loads, fast forwarding works very well.   I loaded a fairly graphics-intensive movie on there, at about the highest quality the iPod would allow. The actions scenes come out fine...about what you would expect for an MPGE4.   2) What the heck does this thing actually look like in your hand?   It is about the size of older iPods. It is thinner (a lot thinner, if, like me you are upgrading from a non-photo Gen4 40gb). The front is a flat screen, much like the iPod nano, but bigger. The clickwheel is a bit smaller than it was on older iPods, but bigger than that of a nano.   3) The screen   I have to say, the bigger screen is nice in and of itself. If you have longer track names (if you have live music, etc.) a lot more of the name will appear. This is a very nice subtlety since in oder to read a song title you don't need to wait......for....it....to.....scroll....   4) Is it worth it?   Jobs called this a regular iPod with "video capability." I'd say the video capabilities are a little better than that gives it credit for. I don't yet have a composite adapter, so I can't see how this comes out on a TV...   With regard to exporting video to TV, there ARE the following options:  TV Out (on/off)  Video Signal (NTSC/PAL)  Widescreen (on/off)   If your iPod is breaking, or is pretty old, I'd definitely upgrade. If you travel a lot or have downtime where you could hold the device pretty close to your face (train, airplane, etc.), I'd definitely get it. If you don't have much time to enjoy the video capabilities, then it probably isn't worth it.   5) Firewire   The tech specs didn't say anything about firewire, so I had been wondering whether it is supported. It actually is not supported at all. In fact, I tried connecting via my old firewire cable, and the iPod brought up a screen that said something like, "firewire is not supported. Please use the supplied USB cable."   6) The "case"   I saw that a case was included on the Apple website...basically the case, as you might suspect, is pretty bad. I got a 60GB model, and it barely squeezes into the case. That said, cases that support the new screen will likely be unavailable for 3 weeks or so (if what happened with the nano repeats itself), and so it is ncie to have SOMETHING to prevent you from scratching your new screen (which is now more important because it plays video).   Anyway, I hope this answers any questions you might have. I've tried to stick to differences between this beauty and the iPod photo.   If you're still on the fence, let me say this...go for it. It is really quite nice.

<Title>Screen Self Destructs
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We bought the 30GB video iPod last Christmas (05) and on day 100 (10 days out of warrenty)  the screen spontaneously cracked from the inside, without being dropped or mishandled.  It literally went into the pocket OK and came out a few minutes later broken!  Again, there was nothing that should have caused it to break!  And, there is no exterior damage or scratching whatever.  From reading posts at Apple and elsewhere, it is very common with this model.  Beware!    We took it to the local Apple store in Tampa and fortunately in our case it was declared caused by an internal "thermal" problem that cracked the inside glass layer. The tell-tale sign were large "ink spot" looking marks on the screen, being only cracked inside--the outer plastic layer was perfect, and absolutely not external damage evident.  Got a new iPod.  Apple didn't quibble about being a little past the 90 days...and now we have 180 days from the orginal purchase.  A great prduct but two stars because of the self-destructive nature of the video iPod's (like the Nano before) screen.

<Content>Well, this is my second ipod (my first was the first generation ipod 3 years ago) and I must say that I love this one even more! It's able to hold 7500 songs (currently mine has 1300 already on it and I'm still ripping songs to my computer) and it's beautiful. The simple white is stunning and it simply works! I tried one of those OTHER mp3 players (an iriver) and was NOT impressed! The ipod is simply the epitome of what an mp3 player should aspire to be!  As for the case that comes with it-it works for what it is supposed to be. If you want something all stylish, then buy your own! Buy this ipod and love it for yourself!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>A great item with flaws I can't overcome.
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As an MP3 player, this is by far the best in the market.  Apple is innovative and just develops the best software that works with the Ipod.  I just can't get over the fact that the screen scratches so easily.  I love my Ipod, but it just breaks my heart every time I use it and see that the screen is riddled with scratches.  Perhaps, I'm being a bit OCD, but how would you feel if you picture perfect HD TV but that is all scratched up.  It's just heartbreaking.... knowing you spent at lot of money on it.  I wished Apple had made their screen much more scratch resistant or atleast had given a screen protector.  I'm all also pissed that Apple does not provive an AC adapter.  For a 300 dollar item it should have an AC adapter.  I had to purchase one from Apple and it cost 30 dollars.  I guess it's just good business sense.... but I'm sure am pissed.  Would have bought an Apple notebook but realized, just as I do with my Ipod, I would probably spend a ton on accessories from Apple.

<Title>Not so great
<Date>Mon Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well first of all the first one I bought died in about 5 hours.  I got it replaced, only to have the next one die after 2 weeks.  Is there a quality problem?  A few major reasons I will never buy one again: -Very slow response time when switching songs. -Sound quality medium to POOR. -Video gets choppy at times. -BATTERY LIFE grew significantly worse every time I charged it. The day before it broke it only ran for 4 hours with a full charge! Please note: it said roughly 75 hours on the manual. Owch! -Scratches VERY easily.  What is it made of tin foil? I can't beleive they would actually sell these things made of this material. -Screen scratches VERY easily.  Not much else to say about it, after a week of normal I was highly disappointed.  My advice, save yourself the trouble!!!

<Title>Beyond Expectations
<Date>Mon Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this iPod in combination with a membership to audible.com, and for the most part this product has significantly exceeded my expectations.  Pros: (1) iTunes makes it a breeze to keep all my photos and music in sync with the iPod -- no more *thinking* about what to select for download -- I have four years of digital photos (almost 2000) and ~1500 music tracks, and have still used only 1/4 of the 30 GB disk space. (2) The video output is surprisingly good quality.   I use the S-Video output on the (extra cost) iPod dock to display pictures and music videos on my 42" HDTV plasma display and they look pretty darned good.   Obviously not HD quality, but they definitely don't look like 320x240 pics expanded to TV (480i) size, either. (3) Surprisingly, the video connection set was fairly reasonably priced (includes A/C power supply, video output cable (Stereo audio + Composite video), and dock (extra headphone jack, connector for iPod USB cable, S-video output).  Cons: (1) The video output is only available for photos and videos -- there appears to be no way to mirror the unit's built-in display to the video out. (2) Maybe that does not matter, because the (extra cost) remote control only allows access to a very small number of functions: play, pause, volume up/down.   You cannot access the iPod menus using the remote control, which makes it significantly less convenient as a component of your home entertainment center. (3) It would be nice if iPod supported Bluetooth connections (for downloads and/or headphones), though the need to plug the unit in to recharge makes some sort of physical connection necessary regularly anyway. (4) Apple's famous non-replaceable batteries. (5) Plan on spending a fair amount of money on accessories (docks, video cables, A/C adapters, cases for belt or armband attachment, etc....).  Summary: Combining all my digital photos, all my music, all my music videos, all my audio books, all my home videos, and (via 3rd-party software) a selection of music videos converted from DVDs) makes this an amazingly useful media appliance.  I have to give it five stars even with its minor shortcomings....

<Title>Nice little gadget!
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to say, this thing really impressed me.  I had a lot of doubts and worries about it as I have strict guidelines for electronics, but those are all gone now.   The Good:  - Assuming you encode your movies correctly, video playback is awesome.  The quality all depends on the movies you have.  I have a lot of HDTV 24 episodes and they look just like they do on my computer monitor.  IF YOU ENCODE INCORRECTLY THEY WILL NOT PERFORM WELL.  -  Sound is gorgeous.  Even with those earbuds (which any real audiophile should replace anyway), the music sounds great.  There are also about 25 presets in the EQ you can choose from like Electronic, Dance, Classical, and so on.  Depending on the properties of your music, the Ipod can go pretty loud and still remain distortion-free.  Again, this depends on YOUR music files and NOT the Ipod.  - Screen.  I think it could be a bit bigger, but it does the job well.  Mine is scratch free as I left the protective film it ships with on and just put a silicone case over top of that.  The plastic is a bit scratched up, but the screen underneath is fine.  Common sense would tell anyone to leave that protective film ON the device and not to pick at it or it will come off.  - Options.  There are a lot of things that can be manipulated and changed.  Menus, back-light, clicker, etc.  There are also a few games like Music Quiz, where it plays a few seconds of one of your songs and you have to choose the right one out of 5 or so choices.  And, there is a diagnostic menu to test the performance of your Ipod in all areas.  Really cool.  - Battery Life.  I put this in the good since it performs as I would expect.  Who is the moron that actually mentioned 75 hours of battery life?  During video playback, the most you will get is 2.5 hours of battery life.  Let me say that again for those who don't comprehend well.  YOU GET 2.5 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE DURING VIDEO PLAYBACK.  The more you use the back-light while listening to music, the less battery life you will have.  75 hours applies to never touching the thing and just letting it go through your music.  Even then, I doubt you will get 75 hours.    Also, you MUST follow the instructions when first charging it.  Portable batteries are VERY sensitive to charge cycles.  If you don't charge it like you should, your battery is gonna suck.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT let the battery life decrease past half.  There are a number of cycles for each battery and the objective is to avoid ever using an entire cycle.    The Bad:  - This is a hard drive based MP3 player so every so often it takes about a second longer to skip to the next track.  If this bothers you, you need a Flash memory MP3 player.    - Battery life again.  Expectations aren't everything.  The next model really needs an upgraded battery.  Charging this thing constantly if you watch movies is a real pain.  It could be so much better and I feel that Apple really cut corners with the battery.  - Scratches.  It does happen if you are stupid enough to walk around without a case.  THE IPOD NEEDS A CASE.  Any portable gadget needs a case.  Technology has been around long enough for people to know this.  There is no excuse.  - Having to encode movies.  Why can't Itunes do that?  This was another bad choice for Apple unless they are catering to geeks only, which is fine by me.  Seriously, if you are not that computer savy then this is not the video player for you.  You need to have an understanding of audio/video compression to get the most out of this player.    Apple doesn't even have a program to encode muxed files, which a lot of internet content are.  I highly recommend everyone to 'acquire' Nero Digital from Nero 6.  It is the best converter out there at the moment that negates any synch problems.  ImToo and Videora are completely useless and make very poor files.    - No wireless.  Right now, wireless headphones for the Ipod Video are practically non-existent.  Logitech seems to be trying to alleviate that, but their headphones are currently riddled with manufacturer defects and don't even support the Video.  Let's move it along Apple.  We need wireless.  - Earbuds.  For the first few months, they are fantastic.  But, eventually they seem to adopt vibration problems and hearing a rattle in my right ear is REALLY annoying.    All in all, it is the best MP3 player on the market right now.  Period.  There just isn't enough support for it from Apple or anyone else.  Vehicles are just now coming Ipod ready and that is limited to certain models.  Where is our support?  Apple?  Anyone?

<Title>I love it!  Black is cool!
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So easy to use and no more CD's to buy and carry around. I'm hooked! Need a cover, though, because it scratches easily even with extreme care. Wished I could use other cheaper web sites (ie Yahoo, Napster) to buy and download songs, too.

<Title>ALMOST PERFECT - MY SOLUTION FOR THE TWO HOUR BATTERY LIFE
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For Christmas Santa bought me a Video iPod. My only complaint with it was the 2 hour video battery life. Just recently I picked up the Battery Geek GeekPod 100 battery pack and this thing has been a lifesaver for me. As far as audio run time goes with this battery, i'm getting approximately 100+ hours of additional audio run time per charge. As far as video run time goes with it, i'm getting approximately 12 hours of additional video run time per charge. The way this external ipod battery pack works is when I plug it into my iPod it recharges my internal iPod battery while simultaniously powering my iPod the same way as if my iPod was docked. I hope this helps.
