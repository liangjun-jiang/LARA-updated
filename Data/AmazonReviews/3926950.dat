<Title>Beware
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my second mp3 player; I had an inexpensive Creative that was easy to use and nicely designed but it stopped working after about six months.  I figured I'd try a Sony.  I should have done my homework first.  This unit is flimsy, the design is awkward.  You have to use Sony's Sonic Stage to transfer files and it takes forever. Not compatable with itunes.  I'm not a tech person but from what I can gather, it's really for playing Atrac files, not mp3.  I tried to convert my mp3 files to Atrac using Sonic Stage but this only worked 50% of the time - (maybe I was doing something wrong but I invested about 3 hours and still couldn't get half my files to play.)   This is just a white elephant.  Make sure you know what you're buying before you get this.

<Title>The Bean works great for more casual users.
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player mostly for the gym. I got a Bean because it was half the price of an ipod, and was super small and light and could be held naturally while running. I mostly just transfer CDs to it, and it takes less than a minute to tranfer the whole CD. I've had no problems downloading single songs from Sony Connect, either. The sound quality is fine, and the battery lasts a really long time. One of the most convenient features is that you can plug the Bean directly into your computer, with no cords to worry about. Overall, it's met my needs perfectly.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this player as a Christmas present from my girlfriend and was immediately impressed by the size and unique design.  Despite some of the more negative reviews posted here, I have to say that I think that this is fine player for the size and price.  I had no need for an iPod-like device since I really only use an MP3 player at the gym.    Yes, the software that it comes with is a bit bloated and clunky, however there is a simpler program that can be downloaded directly from Sony's website that does not require the use of SonicStage at all.  The program allows you to simply drag-and-drop your music files right into a window that in turn quickly converts them for use on this player.  I still, however, use SonicStage just because it lets me customize the organization of files on the player itself a little better.  Yes, it's not the greatest software but I personally don't think that it's worth rating this player lowly over.  As far as sound quality goes, the headphones that come with the device leave a bit to be desired but do you really buy an MP3 player because of the headphones it comes with?  I doubt it.  The sound quality on my own set of earphones is spectacular (even when I choose to convert my files to 103kbps ATRAC3 format to squeeze a little extra time out of the 512MB of storage).    The shape and size is perfectly ergonomic and fits in my hand quite comfortably.  The layout of the jog switch and the design of the hold/unlock switch (which also serves as a cover to an internal, spring-loaded USB dongle) makes it easy to adjust volume and track position while running.  I don't use iTunes so it's not an issue for me.  Personally, I am not a fan of the iPod or iTunes or anything produced by Apple.  Not because I'm a PC vs. Mac guy, but that I'm very disgusted with Apple's marketing tactics and lack of customer appreciation (namely their having the gall to continue selling an overpriced MP3 player with known defects [i.e. the power interruption/sync interruption fatal flaw]), but I digress.  The main drawbacks I find with this unit (and that prevent me from giving it 5 stars) are the following:  1. No belt-clip style carrying cases currently available.  The only carrying case for this device is an armband case sold directly through SonyStyle.com exclusively.  I personally am not a fan of armband cases.  I have chosen to use a generic micro-pager RipOffs case to clip on my shorts while at the gym.    2. SonicStage software is clunky but once you get the hang of it it's certainly not worth glossing over this sweet player.  Actually, that's all I can think of for now.  Hope this helps.

<Title>Hopeless
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought for great price and radio worked well.  Then product quit turning on.  Even if it isn't broken, you must install large software package to your computer.  Took forever to import my songs onto special software and convert to ATRAC.  Software is unstable with enhanced CDs.

<Title>Great player!!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently was given this mp3 player this christmas and so far it has worked beyond my expectations. The player is small and lightweight so it fits in my pocket and I dont eaven feel that it is there. The music playback is great and the radio is clear. When I first charged the battery I was amazed at how fast it took to charge(less than an hour). The earbuds are ok but who buys a mp3 player for the ear buds. The built in USB connector is a great thing to have because you dont need to mess with usb cables when you want to place music on it. The display is a bright Organic Electroluminescence display and is great for viewing in low light. The sonic stage softwhere takes a little while to get used to but is workable. Overall this player is perfect for anyone in need of a compact, lightweight mp3 player.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and it has been a wonderful experience.  I was really hesitant to buy one, but my husband bought it for me for Christmas.  The connect store is user friendly and the bean itself is convenient.  I have had no trouble whether running or just sitting around the house.  Love it!

<Title>Spiffy Little Bean!
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, I got it for Christmas.  This thing is so cool!  I put stock away after the store where I work closes a couple nights a week so it's great to just stick it in my pocket and put it on shuffle and I don't have to touch it the rest of the night!  Comes with a coupon for 5 free downloads at connect music store, at least mine did. (Remember to register your device with the store or else you can't put the songs you've downloaded onto your player!).  I'm online everynight so while I'm chatting with friends I'm always going through my CD's putting songs on it!  Songs don't skip, the battery lasts really long and then if it's plugged into the computer while you're loading songs onto it, it's charging anyways!  I love it!!  the only one thing I don't like, and it's just cuz I'm weird like this, is that I can't seem to find a way to alphabetize the songs on the player itself...I just do it myself when I'm putting songs on it...although there is probably a way to do it I just can't figure it out!  :P

<Title>Nice for the price
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The only drawbacks to this player are a rather user-unfriendly display that takes some getting used to and a slightly flimsy feel. In spite of that, the fact that it has a display makes it much nicer than the Shuffle at only a slightly higher price. You can manipulate which album/group/artist you listen to and that's a very nice feature. The fact that it "feels" flimsy is just a personal take and I have no way of knowing how much abuse it can stand. That said, I do take extra care not to find out. I'm impressed with its capacity since the 512mb seems to have more than twice the song storage as my daughter's Shuffle with the same memory. I'm unimpressed with Sony's music store, but most of my music comes from my own CDs, so this is a minor critique. I plan to buy the armband so I don't have to carry it in my hand, but even that is no big problem since it's small and light. Overall, it's a good player to use while running, which is my only requirement -- although I've changed to sports headphones rather than the supplied ear buds.

<Title>Iffy at best
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This item is very flimsy.  I bought two of these. One for each of my older teenage sons.  I did not realize at the time that I bought them that A) The only way to charge them was plugged into a computer, and B) there was NO carrying case available for them.  They have had them for three weeks now and already one has fallen from a coat pocket to the floor.  A waist height drop should not destroy modern  electronics, but this one is now destroyed.  In addition, it does not truly play MP3's.  You MUST use their software to put music on the player.  You also must register the player in order to use the player on more than one computer.  I have several computers networked at my house, and SONY does not need all my personal info.  So, in order to go from one computer to the next, the player must be wiped before reloading music on it.  On a positive note, before it was dropped, the sound quality was good.  That is the only good thing I can say about it.  If they would market it with a belt carrying case, or an armband case, it might be worth the risk of carrying around.  However, as a stand alone, it is a little too expensive to risk falling out of your pocket.

<Title>mediocre player at best
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this player as a gift.  Sony requires me to install the Sonic Forge software in order to use the music player.  My mp3 files were transferred OK, but some of them do not play on the music player.  No explainations were issued, except a "no play" message.  No mp4 files support either, which means music downloaded from Apple music store are not playable.
