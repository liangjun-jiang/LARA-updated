<Content>I was looking for a small MP3 player that had FM radio and a built-in mic and this fulfilled all three of my requirements.    Minus points are: it doesn't have USB 2.0 transfer, which is a shame as it takes quite a while to fill up the 512MB as a result!  Also, the buttons can be hard to press if you have large fingers.    These points aside, the sound quality is superb, recording audio (using its builtin mic) results in crystal clear recordings and the display gives you all the info you could want.  It also acts as a flash drive, which can be handy.  Firmware updates come out as required and the company seems to be pretty responsive to bug reports, as I've noticed from their forum.  All in all, I'm very pleased with the unit.  It loses one star for the minus points above.  
<Overall>4
