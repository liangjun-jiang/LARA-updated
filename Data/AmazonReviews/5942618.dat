<Title>Do Not Purchase this frustrating MP3
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We purchased this for our daughter Christmas 2006.  It plays OK when you finally get the songs downloaded to the device.  This takes forever though.  It constantly locks up and stops.  It is not our computer because we have no problems putting songs on our sons RCA MP3.  Find another player.  This one is very frustrating.  Not sure if they have upgraded/improved it.  I am very sorry we purchased this.  It was a waste of money and we have purchased a different MP3 for Christmas this year, 2007.
