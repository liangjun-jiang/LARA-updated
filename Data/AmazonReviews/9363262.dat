<Title>Not as good as the 2nd generation
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The wide body styling is awkward and the smaller click wheel is harder to manuever. I have the 2nd generation and like it much better. I love the tall thin slick styling on it. The only plus with the 3rd gen is more gigs for your money, but bottom line it's styling holds it back. I'll be returning.

<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is actually my first I-pod, so I thought it was perfect to try, especially if you don't want to spend alot of money on something that you might not like...But I have to say that I actually like it, especially with the added feature (Video) and the music advantages. Even though its a small gadget the video is great, at first it's kind of difficult to watch movies/tv shows, but if you stare at the screen for a couple of minutes, you forget how tiny it is. I have to say that I was impressed with the battery life also, I can play like 50 songs, watch 2 tv shows (42 min a piece), and watch movies (over an hour and a half each)...very impressive. With that said I am going to advance to the 80GB I-pod Classic with Video (very soon).

<Title>ELECTRONICALLY CHALLENGED
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Even though I'm a "senior citizen," I have craved an iPod for quite some time.  When the new 4 GB Nano recently became available, I decided to take the plunge.  For Amazon's part, the transaction couldn't have been smoother.  In fact, the iPod arrived much sooner than Amazon predicted.  No problem there.  However, for me -- someone who'd never even handled a music player -- initially I found the Nano confusing to use.  The directions that come with the device are minimal, at best, and you must go online for the complete user's manual (over 75 pages).  Also, it was a bit challenging when it came to learning how to download music, videos and other media into the Nano.  Now, after a few weeks, I'm glad to say that using the iPod has become "old hat" for me.  It's a great little "toy" at an affordable price.

<Title>Love it.
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I never owned an ipod before until last year when someone gave me a shuffle for a present. I use it primarily for listening to podcasts and audio books.  When the new ipod nano came out I knew I had to have one.   After using it for a few days, I thought about upgrading to an ipod with a larger screen, but decided against it until some of the inevitable kinks are worked out and prices decline (hopefully). I mean, it's a big jump going from $150 to $250 for the next size screen.  The main complaint I have is that the scrolling goes so fast that you sometimes miss the menu you want. It will just take some getting used to. Also, if you want to play an audio book on slow, it has a funny sound. For the price Apple charges, a little pouch should be included to protect the unit. It would be a lot more useful than an Apple sticker!  As I wait (and I WILL get an ipod in the future with a larger screen), I'm so enjoying this little thing of beauty, to which I've added family pix and video. Sure the screen is small, but the resolution and detail are quite amazing.   I'm very pleased and excited about my purchase. btw, I'd give it a 4.5 star but there isn't the option.

<Title>I love my little nano
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is the third MP3 player I've owned, and the first iPod.  It took some deciding to figure out which model I would buy.  I knew I wasn't going to be watching movies or TV episodes on a screen measuring a few square centimeters, so I didn't need 80 gigabytes or whatever of storage.  I also knew from past experience that my music player was going to get banged around, so I wanted a flash drive that wouldn't skip or jam.  That ruled out the full-size iPods.  I was torn between the 4 GB and the 8 GB iPod nano.  I went for the 4 GB, and I'm satisfied with my choice, though now I can see that the 8 GB would have been pretty sweet too. Pros & cons:  In favor of the 4 GB nano, I can say that all I want to carry around in my pocket are the highlights of my music collection -- the stuff I'll actually listen to when I'm commuting or working out.  And that's substantially less than 10 GB of music.  In favor of the 8 GB nano, you need half a gig of storage for the iPod software, so the 4 GB is really more like 3.5 GB.  So the 8 GB model would have given me more flexibility.  About the iPod nano generally: It's delightfully small & lightweight, it's easy to use, it has a high-quality screen despite its size, and the sound output seems good. However, the included earbuds are total crap -- they may be useful for strangling an attacking chihuahua, but that's about it.  Music lovers will want to replace them with something more substantial (I went for portable Sennheisers and they're great).  Also on the negative side, I don't find the iTunes interface very congenial.  I used to use MusicMatch and I found it far easier.  With MusicMatch, the user was in control.  With iTunes, it's Apple all the way.  But none of these negatives outweighs the fact that the iPod nano is an excellent little music machine.

<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This iPod is everything I expected a more.  4GB of storage might not be enough for some but is is plenty for storing music.  Perhaps for a lot of video material or many CD albums it would not be.  It is easy to use and is great in cataloging music into easy to find categories.  It "syncs" beautifully with iTunes on my iMac.  Battery life is good.  I can think of no problems with this device.

<Title>I admit it, it's as good as everyone says...
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I resisted getting an ipod for many years - I've owned four or five different brands of PC-oriented mp3 players (creative, sandisk, rio, etc.) over the years and I suspected that the ipod-lovers were exaggerating the hype. I gave in and got the Nano 3g because, well, I'm not sure -- I guess I wondered whether it was really that good. And it turns out, yeah, it is. Not even including the ability to watch videos, which is really fun, even though the screen is small (now I want a Touch!), the ipod interface, especially including the usability of Itunes, is far superior to any other player I've used.  Another reason I was hanging back was because I had a large collection of recordings in the wma format, which the ipod didn't use to be able to play. I'm not sure when they added this codec, but now Itunes can convert wma files to mp3. It works smoothly and quickly, so that objection goes by the wayside too. I also loved the idea of using my Nano as a rudimentary PDA. Apple claims you can access Outlook calendar, address book, and notes on it. This is only partly true. Calendar conversion is iffy (many complaints about this on the Apple forums!), although it has worked -- more than half the time -- for me. Notes doesn't work at all, although there's a menu item for it on the iPod itself. My address book has worked fine. I tried a 3rd-party software (Ipodsync) to improve this functionality, but it didn't work well enough to justify buying. So I'm only halfway sold on that, but I must admit that the ipod is after all primarily a media player, and on that criterion it's been fun to use and totally satisfying. I hear audiophiles complain about the sound quality, but for me it's been totally acceptable.  Summary: Advantages:  Easy and fun to use, especially for downloading podcasts and video using Itunes Disadvantages: Excessively sensitive click wheel compared to other iPod models I've tried Problems with PDA functions

<Content>I'm 63 and thought it would be great to have an iPod.  This item is easy to use.  Downloading the iTunes software (free) helps you organize your iPod with the music you love to hear.  The ear phones were not comfortable for me since I wear a hearing aide.  So I purchased a Voss headphone.  I use my iPod around the house and at the office.  I know iPod have been around for years but suddentely thought it's about time to try one out.  The price was right and the shipping was free.  Can't bear that.

<Title>MAC USERS!!! Read This First!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I hated to rate this product ONE STAR because I'm sure it is a sweet little unit as many of the reviews do say. What you Mac Users need to know is that you CANNOT USE 3RD GENERATION IPODS on Mac OSX 3.9 or below. In fact, you must have OSX 4.8 or later.   This information is not prominent at all on the product description. I even called the technical help for selecting a product or accessories and I was told that all I needed was a computer, itunes and this Ipod to be all set up. After ordering and receiving this beautifully designed mp3 player I discovered that I could not use it as my "ancient" G3 machine cannot (at least easily) be upgraded to system 4.8. So after several phone calls to customer service and the hassle of sending it all back and waiting for refunds, I ordered an older 2nd generation ipod which has yet to arrive at this writing.   Amazon should put this information about system requirements more prominent or top of the list on the product page instead of "buried" in other links on the page.   I must say that Amazon's customer service is top notch! The people I talked to were very helpful, understanding and professional. I give them 5 stars under the circumstances. I expect this matter to be resolved to my complete satisfaction.   It just seems like this whole issue could have been avoided by making the product information on system requirements more prominent. I'm sure that I'm not the first nor the last customer to purchase this Ipod only to have to return it as I did. I just hope this and other reviews will catch their eye and they can avoid what I and others have gone through.

<Title>Nice pod
<Date>Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first iPod. So I can't compare it to previous versions like some reviewers so successfully have done. But it has a crisp, bright video playback that I find especially kind to my eyes. It also sports a very thin all-metal body.   One thing I really appreciate is the excellent battery life. So many players, and other electronics, don't offer good battery life. This unit also has built-in games and an advanced user interface. I don't use the games much. But it's sort of nice to have them.  I find the body a bit wide for my liking. I also think the scroll wheel is slightly smaller than I'd like. I was also a bit disappointed with the audio. When I played it in the car, I noticed some static and distortion. I didn't have that with my former player.  I use mine mostly for mp3s. I like the fact that it holds a ton of them so I'm not constantly having to reload like I did with my Creative Zen.  I also find that the price is reasonable. All in all, I think it's a good device and, if it fits your needs, you should consider buying it. I personally think it may be better suited to those who use it more for video than audio, however. On the other hand, most people may not even notice that the audio is not quite up to par.   I would have given five stars if the audio was a bit better.

<Content>This was iPod's chance to build in an FM tuner (with perhaps an antenna extension wire to plug into the earphone jack into which headphones could be plugged or not as the listener wished).  But they didn't add this tuner, and therefore all the nice little iPod speakers that recharge the iPod while the "remote" FM tuner is plugged in are useless.  I'll wait for the next generation of iPods and then, hopefully there will be an FM tuner inside!

However, disappoint abounds with the service (or lack there of) of my POST order questions.  With this purchase I was to recieve 5 free mp3 downloads from Amazon.  After many tries, I finally emailed Amazon and questioned if I needed a code or a special site to take advantange of this offer.  I assumed, incorrectly, that a representative would research my order and simply send me the information in question-especially as I am a long time Amazon customer.  Imagine my surprise when my reply instructed me to call Amazon to further research this.   Although disappointed in having to go this route....I called and was unsuccessfull reaching a person.  At this point I gave up and went to itunes.  I think that if you are to make an offer, you need to respond to people who want to take advantage of it.  This is not the customer service I am used to from Amazon.

<Content>The Ipod Nano 4GB is a very good product.  Although 4GB falls a little short for video, it's just perfect for my daughter.  I do think however there's alot to improve on the iTunes interface.  Uploading additional music is always a hassle.   It would be alot easier if it worked like a flash memory, where we could just add and delete songs whenever desired.  It's also a hassle to get certain types of video uploaded and to syncronize from different user accounts, even if on the same PC.

<Title>The nano is great!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 4 GB iPod nano is wonderful.  I looked at online reviews and talked to a lot of people and overwhelmingly the iPods were the favorite.  I have really enjoyed mine and am excited to get even more music loaded.  I have found the nano very easy to use.  The only down side would be how fragile it looks and feels but have not actually found it to be fragile.  The new nano is so small and I have taken it everywhere with no problems.

Now you can listen to your favorite music and view your favorite photos at the same time-And that's only the beginning.  It has so many other features- can watch T.V. programs, movies etc. I'm so glad I got this.  The technology is awesome!

<Title>How to reset if your IPOD Nano 3rg gen lock up
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>How to reset if your IPOD Nano 3rg gen lock up. I had my nano 3rd gen plug in the sync cable and happen to reboot my PC.  My PC surprisingly try to do a boot level checkdisk (before Vista/Window kick in).  I wonder what disk it trying to check since it never try to do that before, so I told it to skip the disk check. It turn out that Vista/Window think my nano is a hard disk.  It did something because for next couple hours I could not get the Nano to show up in itune. I did make a "blunk blunk" sound when I plug and unplug the cable, indicating that at driver level the system does recognize but the Nano gone into a "COMMA" when vista/window try to access/checkdisk it as a hard drive. Vista's Manages drive does show it come in and out as Ipod, but Itune and nano just stay in a non responsive comma.  After trying everything for couple hour, I tried the reboot sequence: Press and hold the Menu and the "Center buttons" for at least 10 seconds, and the Apple logo appear and the nano is back in business.  Therefore do no reboot with Nano 3rg gen plugged in and when it goes in into a "COMMA" reboot it with the "Menu&Center" combo punch.  Buy Apple Stock, no one can make a product this thin and sexy.  It's like buying Windows 3.1 back in 1991.  You'll make 20x your money in 5 years.

<Content>This is my first i Pod, and its great, for the price you just can't go wrong, first up the screen is bigger, nice interface, pretty decent extras, although i don't use them much and 4G of memory. This version is excellent for the person with minimal video needs. However if you're looking for good video functionality i would strongly recommend the 8G or an i Pod classic, since i started downloading podcasts, I'm in need of more space. All in all an excellent product.

<Title>Yes, a music player can be too small
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The nano is thin and pretty, and picture quality is amazing, but the device feels too insubstantial.  It's so thin and lightweight that it frequently falls from my pocket, and there are no sleeves available yet.  Also, the selection wheel is inconsistent - at times, it is so sensitive that it will rocket up the volume or advance to the next song at the slightest touch, and at other times it has to be carefully manipulated to get it to do what you want it to do.  I also prefer the set-up that puts the headphone jack at the top - with the jack at the bottom, the device can only be slipped upside down into a shirt or pants pocket.  I wish Apple had made some of the traditional iPods available at smaller sizes (with corresponding price reduction).  I liked the feel of my old iPod photo in my hand but don't care to shell out that much money again for a device that only lasts a couple of years.

<Title>Superb Upgrade From A Wonderful Gen 2
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I became smitten by the ergonomics and design of the 2nd gen Nano. When the 3rd gen came about, the addition of video capability called to me. I have passed my gen 2 to my wife. The video of the 3 gen is truly impressive. I'd never expect to be comforable watching a full two hour film on such as small screen, yet the sharpness, brightness and clarity of the Nano screen making watching even that long a film a pleasure! I am very impressed with the Nano,as you can see.   I added the V-Moda Bass Freq headphones for under $35 and the resulting sound reproduction is just superb.

<Title>Best for me purchase this year
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this because I ride the bus to work now and needed a distraction from the noise. Now I don't know how I did without it. I love that fact that you can not only download music, but movies,TV shows, and videos as well.  I will say though, if you want to download TV shows or  movies and pics that it would be better if you get the 60GB or 80GB nano as I only have about 300 songs on my 4GB and am running low on space.  If I added my shows on, I would not be able to have much more music. The sound quality is outstanding. Don't know why I waited so long to get one.

<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first iPod, so I'm a total novice. Seems to be fairly easy to use. I bought it to use on my Gold Wing motorcycle. I am able to plug the auxillary jack from the bike into the earphone jack on the iPod and play it through the bikes sound system. I can control the volume with the bike's volumn control, but everything else must be done on the iPod. I just put it on random, play all songs, repeat all, and let it go. The one thing that I do not like is the "click wheel", way to twitchy for me, that is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. I download my own CD's into itunes then download to the iPod. It seems very user friendly, it's one of those if I can do it anyone can kind of things. I'm sure there are other MP3 players that are just as good. I think I would let price and features be my guide.

<Content>I ordered this Apple 4GB iPod for a Christmas gift for a family member.  When it hadn't arrived in ten days, I called Amazon and they said it was probably lost in the Christmas shipping load.  They sent another one out, overnight, at no charge.  On Christmas Eve an ipod was delivered to my home.  It was the original order.  Then, on Christmas Day, another box was left on the doorstep.  It was the replacement.  I was amazed and pleased.  I called Amazon the next week and made arrangements to send the replacement back.  I have never had such courtesy and speed in receiving something from the internet.  I will continue to shop at Amazon because if someone slips up, they will take care of it. Thanks Amazon......the ipod was well received by the recipient.

<Title>No support for military or other Americans abroad
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you support the military and foreign services workers abroad please consider this. I am an American who was assigned for work to Africa last year. I bought my ipod and set it up as if I lived in the States as that's my home. I just got re-assigned to Germany. When I tried to use the Ipod on a new PC I found out that Apple will not let me into my account because they can tell I'm in Germany and it's their policy to only let you use your account in the country you live. I therefore have lost the ability to access my Ipod and copy the tunes from it back into itunes. I contacted a friend in the military in Afghanistan and he reports the same for the soldiers stationed there. Apple will not support them either. From the itunes support desk... "Unfortunately if you are unable to access your iTunes Store accounts I will be unable to assist you, as per the Terms of Service agreement, due to the fact that you are outside of the intended geographical area."

<Title>Another - I Love It
<Date>Mon Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I resisted for years buying an MP3 player, especially the I-Pod, because it seemed expensive and there were problems with the original versions. Broke down and got one after a co-worker whose opinion I trust gave the new nano-3G a good grade. I love it. It was so easy to set up and get running on my Windows XP AMD PC. I had already installed and used I-Tunes so it was up to date. I just plugged it in and go; the ease of setup is amazing. I am going to download the complete manual and get into it, but the startup guide that came with it was enough to get me going and listening to music in a few minutes. I also downloaded the new 1.1 level of software and let it install that, no problem. The sound quality is not awesome but very good. If there is one rub that I have the controls are a bit erratic, but hopefully that is just a learning curve issue, and so far not enough of a distraction to lessen my opinion (for what it is worth) of a very fine product.

<Title>iPOD Nano vs. iPhone
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have both the iPod Nano and the iphone.   First, here is my review of the iPod Nano.  The pictures don't do justice to this tiny technological marvel. It is very thin (thickness of 2 quarters) and less than a quarter size of my average sized hand. If you are looking for a smallest MP3 player with a screen, I would look no further than than Nano.  It not only plays music well, but it plays videos reasonably well on its high definition screen. You can watch an entire movie on this device. How cool is that?  Couple of pointers: 1)Because ipod showcases the album covers and others bits of information about each song, each AAC track takes little more space on its flash drive. Only about 3.6GB of 4GB are usuable for music/video storage (the rest is used primarily by the OS). This is only sufficient for about 1000-1500 (depending on the bits) songs and a few videos. If you have more than 1000 songs in your iTunes, I suggest purchasing the 8GB version.  2)The Operating System of this device does crash occassionally. You can reboot the device by simultaneously pressing on the middle button and the menu button for about 5 seconds (you will need this info so save this review =) ).  3)Contrary to a popular belief, the sound quality is primarily determined by the quality of the headphones and not the MP3 player. The iPod headphones are of the bare minimum quality (but far superior to those used in Sony Walkmans of the 1980s). If you are an audiophile and have some extra money, I recommend getting a good earphone from Shure (E310, E410, E510).    iPod Nano vs iPhone  1)Sound quality: the sound quality of both devices are identifical. iPhone, however, has an annoying non-standard earphone plug-in which requires an adapter for the third party earphones.   2)User Interface: iPhone has possibly the greatest user interface created by Man. It is not only functional but fun to use. Flipping through the albums in the iPhone's ipod is one of most beautiful GUIs ever developed. The Nano has a typical iPod user interface that use the iPod buttons to navigate through music.   3)Battery Life: Nano has the edge here. iPhone, although posessing a reasonably good battery life, is a natural battery hog. The prime reason is its beautiful touch screen. It is basically a small computer. Listening to music while having the cell phone turned will drain the iphone's battery in about 3.5-4 hours. The Nano will last about 6.5 hours.   4)Functionality: iPhone clearly has the edge, even its the music player is more usable. iPhone has a cell phone, web browser (EDGE and WiFi), IPOD, camera, eMail, and a calendar. The Nano is principally a music player. iPhone's IPOD user interface, however, far trumps Nano's touchwheel.   5)Size: Nano is about 1/8 size of the iPhone (by weight and volume). iPhone isn't bulky, but Nano is a very small device.  6)Price/Benefit ratio: the 8GB Nano costs $200 and 8GB iphone costs $400. iPhone, however, offers more than twice the features.If you already have a phone you love, then Nano might be the better choice. Plus, iPhone is a surprising poor choice of text messaging, especially if you compare it against the phones with QWERTY buttons (not just GUI). So if you are one of those folks who send/receive over 100 messages a day, you might be better off with a QWERTY phone.  7)Coolness factor: iPhone is the coolest device on the planet. Too bad every geek with some cash has one. =)    8)Portability: If you want a MP3 player that you can carry in your pants without having it drag your pants down about 1/4 inch, then I recommend the Nano. But if you already carry a cell phone, it is probably causing your pockets to be bulky anyway.   9)Accessibility: iPhone is only supported on the AT&T/Cingular network. If you are already on an another plan, you may want to stick with your plan until the contract expires and get the Nano in the interim. The next generation iPhone probably will be relased around June of 2008. That version is almost certainly going to be more feature ridden.

<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the new 3rd generation iPod nano after my old iPod mini's battery completely crashed and I thought I was in for an upgrade (instead of replacing the battery for $70). After seeing the 2nd generation iPod nano's small screen, I was pleased that this versions screen size was made much larger. I actually like the more squarish feel and look to this music player. One big plus is the screen, which is absolutely gorgeous. Not pixilated at all. The Cover Flow feature was also a nice added bonus. One of the only problems I have with this iPod is that the back is not aluminum like the front. It is a reflective finish, so you can stare at yourself if you want! But it can get marks on it. I would like a complete aluminum body, but other than that, this mp3 makes for a great player!

<Title>Great Screen, Perfect Pocket Size, Problems in 1 WEEK!
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, I used to own the old iPod shuffle and it had so many problems, I decided to purchase Creative and SanDisk. Well, I saw the new Nano in the store and the screen quality blew me away...beautiful. I was looking for a pocket player that was small, light, thin and could play beautiful videos. Well the new Nano delivers in all those areas and worked lovely. So I dropped the $149 and bought it. Of course, you need iTunes and that took some time and of course it would not detect any of my own items to download, so in 1 hour I blew $50 buying items in my iLibrary. If that wasn't bad enough, a game I bought did not download, Apple still charged me, won't refund the credit, and says it is on my computer, so I'm still searching. Next, I wanted a photo viewer with more options like zooming, etc, which this player does not accommodate. Also I dislike the headphone plug on the bottom which makes the unit difficult to prop up to watch videos. Even with all those features, I loved my little baby until 5 days after I purchased the unit which prompted me to write this article. I was watching a show, after the show I went to play a video and nothing happened. Basically all my downloads would not access, not even the built-in games. Then I synched the unit and it froze solid, I was at a friend's computer, so I couldn't even use my iPod with the computer - not authorized. Luckily the hard reboot did solve the problem and the system is running again, but after a few days of use this already shows me to avoid the Apple and trust my instinct to avoid their products.  For the cost of a major mp3 player, I would expect a system that is more reliable. This month, I will purchase the Microsoft Zune and the new Creative, so I'll let you know in comparison.  COST: *** VIDEO: ***** MUSIC: **** PHOTO: *** SUPPORT: ** PROBLEMS: **  Average: 3 stars  Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving.  John Dae

I own a small plant nursery and often have dirty, wet hands, so I definitely needed a cover.   Now I have a cover that clips onto a belt, and am able to listen to the radio programming I cannot receive here in our rural area.   In other words, it's perfect and just what I wanted.

<Title>Very Pleased with the 3rd Gen Nano
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been wanting to own an ipod for a year and a half, and I finally got a 3rd generation Nano this Christmas.  The reasons that I wanted this product: 1. to consolidate all my music collection on one device, 2. portability, 3. to play my music in cars.  I accomplished all of my expectations on this product.  In order to play my ipod in my car, I also purchased a FM transmitter from Kensington.  It also charges my ipod as it plays, so it's really convenient.  Both products are working very well so far.  I never owned Apple products before.  Ipod Nano I own is very intuitive, and easy to use.  I use Microsoft PC, but had no problem downloading, and using itunes, which you need to have in your computer to import your CD collections and what not.  I'm thinking of getting a docking device for ipods to play it indoors.  My dilemma is that I already have so many music playing devices at home and work.  If I get rid of my 6-CD disc changer player, and replace it with my ipod and its playing device, it would save a lot of space, but I just don't want to donate my CD player to a thrift shop or something.  But I don't think I could sell my used CD player when many people are turning to some sort of MP3 player like myself.  I also have a cassette player, but I don't know what to do with it.(It's in a perfect working condition.)  Another concern is how to carry my ipod and transmitter, when the summer comes.  It's cold now, so I just put my ipod and FM transmitter in my jacket's pocket.  A winter jacket is pretty bulky, so it also serves as a protective case for delicate ipod.  But when it gets warmer, and I start to wear t-shirts and shorts, those two items are too bulky to shove it in my shorts' pockets.(Not to mention my already bulky wallet!)  Is that mean I have to carry a purse like a girl?  Probably I will use one of those pouch that you can wear around your waist.  But that too is kind of annoying.  Anyone with suggestions?

The biggest drawback is that the earphones don't shut out ambient noise, such as would occur when one is in a gym. So far I've simply been turning the volume up, which is not good for the ears. However, I'm in the process of acquiring noise-reduction earphones which many have raved about.

<Title>Very nice, has some quirks
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this as a gift and I love it. It has beautiful screen quality and I've found myself using the video function in so many situations! Riding the bus, waiting in line, at the gym--I'm constantly glad that I have it. The music quality is great and it's also got this sweet little feature where you can put the lyrics of your songs onto the ipod and access them when the song is playing! I think that is just cool. I like having the ability to put my photos on there and play games and all the other little gizmos that come on this.  I would definitely say that it has some quirks, though, that can be annoying at times. Sometimes, the click wheel won't respond to my touch so I just circle around and around and around trying to get it to do something. This usually stops after a few seconds--it sort of feels like there's a delay in the ipod's "thought" process and it needs to catch up when you change screens. I've had to reset it once (pressing the play/pause button and center button at the same time) because it completely stopped responding and all my videos were showing up as scrambled pixels of light. Once I reset it, though, it was fine and I had all my information still on there. The only weird thing I haven't figured out how to fix is that all of my "James Taylor" songs were replaced with my "Journey" songs. It still says it's James Taylor, but it's not. When I go into Itunes, the music is correct, but it's messed up on the ipod.   Overall, I love this little thing! It's so fun and so useful in situations I never even imagined! It's got a couple of quirks, but most technology does (remembering having to blow on the Ninentdo games back in the day to get them to work?). It's still pretty awesome. I'd suggest to get a silicone jacket though--it's easy to get it all smudgy and fingerprinty on the back since it's so shiny.

<Content>Bought it for my son. Awesome little player. Great sound and loud! Screen is drop-dead gorgeous. Although small, images are sharp and clear and video can be enjoyed despite the size. The photo album is well organized and the slide show is pretty cool.  The new menu system is nice as well.  My son loves the cover flow view, even if it isn't the most pratical way to browse music.  My only gripe with the player is the placement of the headphone jack next to the USB jack. It's a little awkward inserting and removing the USB cable with the headphones plugged in.  Other than that, I have no complaints with this player.

<Title>Fun to listen to but not easy to use
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted one of these stupid little players for months and held off on buying one. Little did I know, that due to Apple's insane marketing strategy where they upgrade software and hardware every two weeks it seems, I missed the boat on the 2nd generation Nano by a month or two. I would have much rather had the bigger unit with less space and more color choices. While color choice may seem anal and ridiculous, if it's available, people will want something in a funky color. I don't need outrageous amounts of space for music and think it's dumb that you essentially have to pay extra for more color choices. But alas, I chose the silver Nano, because I don't need that extra space and don't have money to burn.   That said,  I am a devout Mac fan and have used their computers for years. However, my loyalty is waning fast with this product. I was disappointed to learn that I couldn't even use it without extensive software upgrades not only with OS X but with iTunes. Once that was accomplished, I could finally use this machine. I was also disappointed to find that a) there were only very basic instructions included in the slim, ridiculously eco-friendly packaging; and b) another software upgrade would be needed just to read the more lengthy PDF instructions from the website, 78+ pages worth. Apple's products used to be so intuitive that you rarely needed to delve further into instruction manuals; it just basically did what you wanted to and made more sense. Now that I'm trying to add/delete music it continues to include tunes I don't want, and puts music in other places even though I've got folders.   Bottom line: the premise of organized music on the go is nice, if you can get it to work. Better have a hefty dose of patience when using this product.

So far, I have only used it for music, podcasts, and photos (no movies or tv yet), and I have no complaints at all.  Everyone I know is impressed by the design, which was a factor that lured me into buying it.  I keep mine in a protective case (from icase) and have no worries about damaging it in my everyday routine.  The 4G of space doesn't bother me since it's my very first iPod.  I've read complaints about the "small" wheel, but I don't have any problem with it at all.  I love it!

This is a great gift under $150 for that special someone or your kids.

<Title>My first iPod, not to mention first MP3 portable device. 
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well like I said, this is my first iPod, not to mention portable MP3 player, I was still stuck to buying regular CD's or ripping them to MP3 format. Well I got the bug being I am sick of having to switch out CD's in the car or for that fact anywhere else. Plus you get to enjoy the songs you want to listen to.   On to the iPod itself. Have to say I am very surprised at all the cool features this little thing packs in. From the brillant screen to the touch scroll wheel and the fact you can play movies, TV shows, DL photos and all the music you want, well for the space you have, lol! I love it! Just have the 4gb and is plenty for me for now anyway. Plus I don't have a lot of extra money when you have 3 daughters ranging from 5 months to 11 years old.   The iTunes site is great as well. I am no computer geek and I will use the line "If I can do it, anyone can." Purchasing music was a breeze, but be careful at first as I purchased about 20 dollars worth of music and video and only the 99 cent songs have went on my paypal. The albums have not showed up as yet, which I don't understand. So will wait till my statement to purchase more music from there. Still is fun looking and listening to 30 second clips. I have a list for when my purchases go through more smoothly. Also when you put your CD in there to import, it is a breeze! Just be on iTunes and insert disc and asks you if you want to submit it to your iTunes Library and blam it is on and starts to DL right away. Then go to music and take the songs out you don't want and sync it and viola, is that easy.   Battery life: Is absoutley wonderful! Charges fast and holds it for a long time. I haven't had it long, but very surprised with how well this holds a charge.   Things I don't like, which are not that big of a deal. Getting used to the touch sensitive wheel, which I love, is just hard to get used to shuffeling through the cover albums and what not. I am sure it is a timely thing to get used to. Also the back is not metal finished like the front is, basically looks like a mirror made of chrome. So it smudges very easily. Also not big on where the headphone jack is located not to mention I tried 2 other headphones and the cord pratically falls out. I have ordered a pair of Koss XTRPro over the head headphones and hope that those work, if not I am gonna be mad with these earbuds that come with it. They sound OK, but my ears are not ment for the little earbuds to be submerged in it, lol!   Overall one of my better purchases of the last year. Like I said, still waiting on the headphones and my cord for playing it in the car, but I am sure It will suffice. My advice is to get one and enjoy! I still don't know why it took me so long to commit to the MP3 craze.

<Content>I like this new nano , I am glad I didn't buy the older version. So far pretty cool. It almost like having an ipod but with only drawback is less space, to be honest it suits my needs fine. You could fit 2000 songs on it if you wanted to but you would have to lower the sounds quality. I see one thousand songs as being plenty cause after awhile the same songs get lame. I know the ipod holds way more ,but if your like me and you it occasionally it good. I use it mostly for trips. I like the new video feature .So far really happy with it. I like it cause it not big and bulky. Buy it and be happy

<Content>I bought the iPod Nano G3 for a present for my son. He was very excited. That is--until he tried to synch it with iTunes on his computer.  New iPods REQUIRE a version of iTunes that NO LONGER SUPPORTS WINDOWS 2000!  Maybe in Silicon Valley, everyone is wealthy enough that the kids have new computers running Vista or Leopard. In my little corner of the real world, my kids inherited our older computers--running Win 2K.  So we had to return the iPod. . .

<Title>Great iPod my first one!!!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before I got this iPod I owned a Sansa Sandisk 1 GB with color screen no video capbittaly now comparing that MP3 player to this iPod its not even close in quaility. One thing they both share in common is that they are both flash based memory meaning unlike with the iPod classic not-so-old iPod videos have a hard drive based memory so they can tend to get frozen more often. The new nanos are all flash based. This plus is so easy all you do plug it in to your windows or mac computer it shows up on your iTunes(note:you need iTunes 7.4 or later for nano to work doesnt come with software CD so you have to download it off apple website easy!) Then all you do is simplly really quickly install it and then your ready to go. All you do is drag your music, photos, videos, and movies/tv shows, and games(note you need to download newer versions of older games) then your ready to go. When you first take it out of the package it includes acttulay 3.63 GB rather than 4 GB because their are 3 games on it that take up that space but still it all adds up. It is very easy to use charge everything(hint with windows you need a windows XP and or a windows vista with updated itunes) You may be saying how can someone watch a movie or a TV episode on how tiny the screen is well the screen is about that same size as one the iPod video plus the picture quaillty is better and more brighter plus on the iPod you can addjust how bright the screen is. And now you can add contacts from your computer on to your iPod so no more forgetting peoples phone numbers because you can simply go to their phone number if its on their and be done with it. Plus since the menu screen half of it is artwork the artwork on this just switches off to the artwork on your iPod(if you have any) People may complain how small the click wheel is but hey on the 1st and 2nd generation iPods the click wheels were like the same size. One thing is the 4 GB model only comes in silver while the 8 GB model comes in the colors, Mint Green, Turqoise, Silver, and black(note on the black 8 GB the click wheel is black as well)Also the new iPods  DO NOT PLAY WAV I REAPEAT DO NOT WHEN YOU GO TO A SONG IN WAV IT DOSENT PLAY but that dosent matter really at all for me. Plus the cover flow on this i think is cool but i think on a later model they should add the visualizer that would be cool. The sound is great its all in all a great iPod/MP3 player for someone starting out on a huge music collection or has music on his or her computer but wants something to put it on their you go your looking at it all in all its a great iPod for a first time buyer and makes a great Christmas present for someone who just owns the shuffle and wants this one perfect for anyone with music,games, or video on their computer.

<Content>I bought the new Nano for my 9 yr old son after he begged and begged for one to listen to music on the hour long bus ride to School and back everyday.  I was very skeptical about making the purchase-a) that is would be too difficult for him to manage and b) that he would lose it.  I was shocked to discover he is a whiz with it.  I actually have no problem navigating and downloading music for him-  I choose what goes on it for him.  He loves it and takes extremely good care of it.  I am very pleased with the ease of use as well.  I will by another one later on for myself or my husband...

<Title>Nice product, but
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The nano is a very nice improvement over my first generation iPod (which had a terrible battery; never lasted more than two hours per charge).  I'd rate it a 5 for design and utility, except for my shopping experience.  The 4GB nano comes in any color you'd like, as long as you like silver.  What would it have cost Apple to offer more colors?  Very little, if anything.  But, like many manufacturers, offering color options only at a higher price point is a not very subtle way of pushing you to open your wallet wider.  The 4 GB is entirely adequate for my use in jogging; I never watch video with it.

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Normally, I love Apple products.  I've been a huge fan since I bought one of the original iPods almost five years ago.  I bought this iPod because my other one had seen better days.  Plus, I wanted to try out the Nike+ features available for these latest generations.  Unfortunately, this iPod didn't come with iTunes (and I am unable to access their site to download the latest version).  If a piece of hardware is going to require software the company should package the software.  iTunes wouldn't take a lot of space on the iPod and Apple wouldn't inconvenience their customers.  I hate to give the product 1-star, but Apple has left me with a useless product until I get home next month.  Thanks for nothing.

I would recommend it for running, listening, and the iTunes library.  I'm sure I'll discover more ways to use the iPod in the future, but for now it does exactly what I want it to.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was due to the sensitive volume and navigation tools.  It would be better for me if the iPod didn't require such a sensitive touch.

<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Don't get an iPod if your main computer is Windows - mine didn't work when I got it, couldn't charge it, see it in My Computer, iTunes doesn't see it -we just get an error message reporting a malfunctioning USB device.  Apple's tech support page says to fully charge the iPod before trying it on Windows. Great thanks for the catch 22 Apple, you don't ship the iPod with a charger - the only way to charge it is via the computer!!!  So now we have to buy a 3rd party charger to get it to work - which is even harder because Apple used different connectors on various iPods (what the heck is wrong with using standard USB ports, Apple???) so our local Apple store (SimplyMac = OxyMoron) sold us the wrong charger and doesn't have one for our 4GB video nano.  There are plenty of small video players out there that do work well with Windows - it's insane that Apple's iPod doesn't even work with Apple's iTunes while our old Creative mp3 player works with iTunes and other applications.  I would avoid this product unless you only use a Mac (we have two but wanted a device that would work with our Windows machines as well:-(.

<Title>Caveat Emptor...
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ordered this item because it appeared to be such a great deal, and I was able to get one-day delivery to boot, just in time for Xmas!  Yeah, some deal...when the box arrived, all it contained was the nano player...no headphones, no Itunes software, no charger...nothing but the player.  Foolish me, I suppose, for assuming all these items would be included.  I guess it's true what they say about "don't assume" and being made to be an a_ _ of. I immediately returned the item the next day, and to date (1/20/08) am still waiting for Amazon to refund my credit card account!  Caveat Emptor, for sure!!!

<Content>This is a small, lightweight, easy to use music device.  It is not the best choice for those who watch a lot of videos/movies/TV shows.  But for the occasional video, it's more than adequate.  ITunes is super easy to use and this device is perfect for travel, exercise, etc...

<Title>Great gift for my wife
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My wife has mentioned several times about wanting some type of portable music player and I had looked at several makes and models. I spoke to my son about the Apple 4 GB I-POD Nano because he has an older version and he was pleased with his unit. I ordered one for my wife and she fell in love with it and is very happy with it. I had one chance to operate it and listen to it and I am impressed. I have not had a chance to use it since I can't get it away from her. It was one of the best gifts I have ever given to her. I am the king of the castle now. Now I have to order one for myself.

Although I didn't get a chance to use it (he was so thrilled he wouldn't let anyone else touch it!), he assures me it's everything he ever dreamed an iPod could be...and more!

<Title>Clear, compact and cute!  Suits my granddaughter to a T!
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son has the 8GB model in black, but I saw this one and thought my granddaughter, Krystal, might like it better ... because it's cuter and more "girly." She's not your typical girly-girl because she's athletic and studious, too, but she does enjoy her music.  When I presented it to Krystal I found that I'd made the right choice! Her eyes lit up ... which always makes the "giver" happy.  She loves it, carrying it everywhere she goes ... from the sports field to the mall to college.  She likes the fact she can rock to 24-hours of music, or view two movies back to back when she wants to chill out.  Besides all that, it holds up to 7,000 photos and it's clear, compact and cute!   No wonder the Apple iPod nano is the world's most popular music player.  Oh, one more thing: I took another reviewer's advice and purchased a cover ... just in case.   Go for it! I recommend it highly!  Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2007

<Title>Could be better
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my iPod almost 2 months ago, and I loved it. One of this iPod's problems is that it fell only once and with the skin on, and the paint was brushed away, leaving a small hole on my iPod. So I think that this could be improved. Another one is the fact that everytime that I start listening to a song, the picture does not appear and I have to try again so that it would show up. This iPod is too small too, and it is slightly uncomfortable. On the other hand, the cover flow is very useful, and the picture-menu screen is very entertaining, besides the fact that I can sync podcasts and videos to my iPod. Something that really bugged me (this is more about apple than the iPod itself) is that i have to actually buy the videos that I have to sync to my iPod. I can't just try and sync it (I've tried), because the sound won't work, or the video won't even sync correctly or it will damage your iPod (though if you restart it, it will work well), but by damaging the iPod I don't mean that it wont work, i mean that everything will get blurry and the images wont work.   Everything else about the ipod is fine to me.

<Content>Was so excited to get it, but then it starting pausing every time the headphone jack twisted in the socket. It didn't help that the plug was on the bottom of the unit so gravity played a part in the pausing as well. Bummer...good video, but not up to Apple's usual quality design.  Got an Archos 605 PMP and really like it for a replacement...especially not being locked into itunes. Nice large bright screen, too.

<Title>ipod for my husband

<Content>I was very pleased with the quick shipping of this product. Amazon always does a great job. My husband travels a lot, and always seems to get stuck in airports for hours at a time. He has a 2GB MP3 player, but he wanted something bigger to hold a ton of music, so he doesn't have to hear the same song in one day. I bought the ipod to solve this problem. It's easy to use, plus with it's slim, design he can put it anywhere without being in the way. I was very pleased with the bonus we got through Amazon for buying it at that particular time. We received 5 bonus downloads of music for free! Amazon made shopping for Christmas this year so easy and hassle free. Thanks.

<Title>Better than expected
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading some of the horror stories of the Nano, I was not sure if it would be worth the risk.  I bought one anyway since my old Rio MP3 player broke. Let me start with my computer.  I already had the most recent version of i-Tunes installed and running fine on a WinXP system.  This was the biggest problem I read in other reviews, so maybe I got lucky on this one. I plugged in the Nano, it detected it right away, found an update that was rather long (55 megs) which took over 15 minutes on my slow DSL connection.  No problems installing the update and I was syncing it in no time.  The sound is good.  I like the "lock" feature so you don't change the settings while it is in your pocket.  I didn't use the included ear plugs because I have another set that loops over my ears and stays in position better. Only time will tell if it lasts, but so far so good.

<Content>I have two sons, 11 and 9, and their taste in music does not always match mine (Crazy Frog doing the theme from Beverly Hills Cop anyone?), so getting them their own player WITH HEADPHONES is a must.  My older son already had one of the older model nanos, and this year Santa Claus brought this for my younger son.  It has been a huge hit.  Enough memory to hold a good number of songs (I have loaded at least a couple hundred already and there is still plenty of room, video capability, pre-installed games and a large enough size to keep from getting lost in the mess of soccer socks and fast food bags on the floor of the car (which was a problem with the previous nano--and FORGET the shuffle.  And, if you care about style, it has the same good-looking design and ease of use that consumers have come to expect from Apple.

<Title>iPod Nano 3rd Gen. Video 
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great mp3 player first off its so simple to use i mean all you do for iTunes is drag songs to the iPod its that easy. Heres some info about the new iPod. First off you need iTunes 7.4 or later for this iPod to work on your computer and for windows you need XP or Vista. Then their are two ways in which you can get your music one you can download songs from the iTunes store which if you want to fill your iPod up with 4 gigs of music would be very hard with just buying songs for a dollar each because it would be incredibly expensive(that is unless you download movies then you will fill it up quick) or the more useful solution is that you could rip your CD'S because this is free and you can rip the CD"s in even higher format than the iTunes store provides. So then you go out to the store and get this cool iPod and now you don't know what to do with it. First update your iTunes if you haven't already done that and then once you do that if you only have downloaded songs off the store than if you want rip your CDS or if you just want a few songs and maybe a TV episode this is very simple to do, First install your iPod to the computer this was very simple to do than you can choose wether or not to have your iPod sync automaticly or what i prefer having it sync mannually. Then the iPod will show up under devices in iTunes so than all you simply to do is drag the songs/videos onto your iPod. Than what you have to do with ejecting it is that you have to press eject if you don't than it can damage your iPod. But what about the other cool features that come with it too like, Games, Notes, Calander, Contacts etc. Well this is easy to do with games warning if you have old versions of the games you have to RE DOWNLOAD them so if you spent a lot of money on games your out of luck because you have to re download them! But the iPod already comes with good games. To sync contacts this is very easy all you do is make the contacts on your computer(MACINTOSH) and then if you go to contacts on iPod info on iTunes you then just click on sync and there you go no more forgetting anyones phone number anymore. For notes its harder to sync and it took me a while to figure it out but what you do is you go to finder(hint im saying mac examples because i use mac with it) anyways you go to finder and the iPod should appear so you then click on it and then you will see notes on their well you first have to drag a document to the iPod than you have to then drag the document into the notes folder and their you then have it on your ipod. For calenders i haven't used that yet so i dont know. Also for photos you simply sync them from iPhoto on iTunes. The iPod really comes with 3.63 GB because the games take up over 70 MB!!! Hint this iPod does not play WAV!! does not i repeat dosent, i'm pretty sure also that this thing only plays MP3 and MP4 because i dont think and other music formats would work so if they are in another format you have to convert them to MP3, i know only MP4 works with video on this iPod any other video format does not work but all movies/music from the iTunes store is all in MP3 and MP4. One thing that is kind of confusing is after the iPod is playing for like 2 minutes it goes in playback mode that shows the clock and battery life but the battery life is almost always lower(sometimes its right) so it can be confusing when you have to charge it or not being that since its a lithium ion battery you have to be careful on how much you charge because eventually the battery will start to wear out. But also the screen quaility is just amazing ecspecially for movies i know i've heard it before at how tiny the screen is for movies well its not that much smaller than the iPod Video Screen!!! Also sometimes after you eject it from the computer it stalls a little bit after but then goes to menu but if it stalls for like more than 5 minutes heres what you do whenever your iPod is frozen. Press down on the menu and center button at the same time and then your iPod will re boot and it dosent delete songs or anything!!! all in all this is a great iPod good for anyone who wants something to use on the go!!! Also since this is flash memory you can delte songs and unlike with hard drives you cant and plus this dosent skip like hard drive based mp3 players because this is flash memory and it dosent skip a GREAT GREAT DEAL!!!! EXCELENT!!! good job apple!!!

<Title>Best christmas present this year
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the Ipod for christmas, and though i had played with it a little in the apple store a few weeks ago, i was still suprised about little things i didnt notice in the store.  I was pleased about the cover flow, the sound and video quality is amazing quality.  I do recommend buying new headphones as the ones that come with the player are a little uncomfortable and fall out on occasion.    The only complaints i have is while watching the tv show episode it let me download for free, i noticed it was kind of hard to see when the camera was zoomed out because the screen is so small....but hey, it is an ipod.  The other complaint i have is while playing the really cool vortex game it comes with, because the track wheel is so thin, my finger would get off it without me noticing, but again, i think thats something you would get used to after a while. So even though i had those two complaints, the first one i think is ok because its perfect to watch a movie or shows say on a flight without taking up your whole tray with your laptop, and the second you will most likely get used to it, so i still gave it 5 stars.  I also had no problem putting music on my ipod, and registering it took a few tries but i assume thats because everyone was trying to register their apple stuff at the same time, and it worked later in the day. Oh by the way, a movie is approx 1.4gig so unless you fill up your ipod with music, you can always put one movie on there at a time.

<Title>Apple needs to be more compatible
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I gave my daughter the iPod nano.  What Apple doesn't tell you is you have to have the newest operating system on your Apple Computer. That means you have to have Mac OS X v10.4.8. You can't use it if you have Panther OS X 10.3.9. So you have to spend an additional $129 for a new operating system! Making the total for an iPod $129 more! We have Windows Vista computers too, and have ITunes installed on them.  Apple does not have the correct Vista software to be compatible.  I had to go to Microsoft and download an old XP file in order for the IPod to work on our PC Vista computer.  This took a long time, and my daughter was not happy most of Christmas until I could figure it out.  When you spend that kind of money, is it too much to expect it to work.  I, like most people, I am sure, are not computer savy, and what I had to do to get this to work is ridiculous.

<Title>Beware of IPOD Software
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Once you have Music, Books photos, etc loaded on IPOD it is very well organized, But getting it on to the device seems to present a less than intuitive mechanism for going from source to device.  Conclusion: Device very nice but software needs better advice had to try more than thrice to pput things on the Device.

<Content>I bought this iPod as a last minute birthday gift for my daughter & it arrived quickly & she loves it! She had no problem downloading her music & transferring her old music from her old MP3 player.  It holds plenty of songs. The only thing that I didn't know is that you need to buy an adapter to recharge it.  It may have mentioned it in the despription, but I missed it.  She plugs it into the computer for now & we'll pick up the adapter later.  Love the iPod & will probably get one for my son for his birthday too.

<Title>Nanoissues
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Love the Nano -- upgrade from iPod Gen3 -- compact, nice features! 4GB is a little small, particularly if you are a podcast person -- kind of a shuffle on steroids with a vid screen. The savings will be realized when I lose the thing in a couple of months.  One big issue (not Nano-specific) is that iTunes has yet to create a 64-bit version for Vista users. It functions, but work-arounds are required for some file transfers and burning.

<Title>iPod Nano wins you over with GREAT sound
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received an iPod Nano like this one from my wife about three months ago.  It was not originally purchased for me for music but for audio books.  However, I love classical and operatic music and loaded all of my Sarah Brightman DVDs and CDs on it.  I couldn't believe the iPod compressed all of the DVDs so much.  My thought: with that much compression there is no way these are going to be worth listening to or watching.  Here and now I admit that I was wrong.  I carry the iPod with me everywhere and when I get a few minutes I can listen to some of the most inspiring music wherever I am.  This is an absolute stress buster for me.  I could be in a waiting room or an office listening on my tiny little "record player" and I often begin to conduct the orchestra, waving my hands and arms up and down as if conducting because it sounds like I am right there at the concert or performance.  I get a big smile on my face and tension just fades away.  Skip the Psychiatrist and buy an Ipod Nano, it's a whole lot cheaper and you get to take it home and keep it.  Since receiving the iPod Nano I bought one for my wife and then she "had to have" an iPhone.  We've got 'em all now and each one is a wonder of invention and some of the most incredible technology as it now exists.  Treat yourself and you will feel as if it was one of the best decisions you ever made.  Bob

<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great choice for users who might not have alot of music or videos to store on their ipod. Its only 4GB which is like probably 1,000 songs or a little bit more and over 100 hrs of video. I mean, its good, but I own the ipod Touch and i love that, i just got this for my girlfriend and she doesn't listen to no damn 16GB worth of music so i got her this. Im not cheap, but it doesn make sense though. Why get a 16GB ipod, especially a touch and don't really use it to the fullest.But she loves is and i figure you would too if you don't need higher storage (GB).

<Content>Purchased this iPod for my wife as a Christmas gift.  Was very surprised by the size and the quality of the product.  It didn't look like a piece of molded plastic junk like most of the others that I looked at.  But then again, it wasn't cheap. It came packaged in a nice plastic box that gave it a nice "gift" look.  The ear buds that were included were pretty decent for a "give me" item.  The sound was clear and crisp.  (Actually I stole them from her to use with my cheapy player) Very happy with the product.  I also purchased a high end set of ear phones for use with the iPod and my wife swears that she hears "new" sounds from her downloaded songs.   Felt that it was worth every penny.. Good product Apple.

Do these actually stay in anyones ears?? if I am talking to some one with them in the eventually fall out or if I am chewing a piece of gum.

After spending a decent portion of my Saturday morning downloading and installing iTunes and learning how to sync the music, I can say that I am pleased with the functionality of the application.   The sound sounds clear and there is good volume levels. The most suprising feature for me was how great the video looks!! iTunes also has a great collection of material to download, and I particulary like the FREE podcasts. All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, great price and fun product

<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like the new iPod nano; the new shorter design, new colors and some new "feachers" (please ignore the spelling, that is not one my stronger areas.).   What I REALLY ticked me off though, was that you couldn't sync with another library. We have two computers and my dad synced HIS iPod on his computer (this was before i had mine, so i used his too. i put songs and such on there too. we also like the same basic music, so there was no problem there) there was no problem untill i got mine. To "name" the iPod mine, i had to start it up on a different computer. BUT i still wanted the songs on my father's computer, and the ones on his iPod, i had already purchased a few songs on iTunes and uploaded them onto my new iPod on a different library) BUT iTunes said i could only use ONE iTunes library, so i had to delete ALL the songs OFF my iPod and sync with my dad's library and REPERCHASE the songs on my FATHER'S computer.  so, unless you're a "techno-weenie" i doubt you can sync to libraries. (stupid apple...)  other than that, this is actually a great product.

<Title>Many Problems
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I recently purchased the 3rd Generation 4G Nano's for my kids for Christmas, and had so much trouble syncing the units to my current version of Itunes, it told me I had to update to the current version. I did, and still had recognition issues. I did the soft reset and finally it was recognized. I synced all my songs to each unit and was happy, until I had to charge the batteries. The units will not charge, via USB cable, or wall charger. Have been searching the forums for suggestions on fixing the problems, but to no avail. Looks like my only option left is to return the units for refund. Good luck to those who will purchase these items. As for myself, I am done with Ipod!!

<Title>Wonderful product, but problem with initial setup - resolved
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a wonderful little product! I bought it for my 10-year old daughter. We have the original IPOD, but she wanted a newer, hipper, and smaller version. I thought this version would be too small, but it really great. Since she is already setup with Itunes, she did not have to do much to move to this newer, cuter, and smaller version. The music sounds very clear and robust. The picture is brilliant and crisp. I did encounter a very frustrating problem when I first went to set up the IPOD  Nano (3rd gen) with Itunes. I received a message saying I would need to upgrade to the 7.5 version. I downloaded this version, then received a message saying I need to register the product. After downloading the license, I did not see an option on the screen that would allow me to continue in the process. After much research and frustration, I found a chat instructing me to do the following:  1) Go to Control Panel 2) Select Display Properties  3) Go to Settings 4) Change the Screen Resolution to "1024 x 768" or something close 5) Once you have done this you should be able to see the entire registration screen - and, thus, able to finish the setup  Thereafter, everything worked just fine - so far.  I would definitely buy this product again.

I'm pretty happy with the 4g's but in retrospect, maybe I would have bought the 8g's just b/c I can keep more on it all the time. But it's great! I can see movies, view photos and of course hear my favorite music and podcasts.  It's not that complicated to start using at all.  The battery seems to go on forever. Overall, I'm very pleased and would suggest if you are looking into buying one to do it.  It's great.

<Title>Impressed....until I tried to set it up
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was very impressed with the size of the nano, about the size of a credit card.  I have also been impressed with the resolution on the screen, very clear.  I am not at all impressed with how difficult it has been to set up.  I have one of the earlier iPods, so I already had iTunes installed on my PC.  When I tried to upgrade I got all kinds of error messages and ended up needing to uninstall and re-install iTunes.  The next problem is that I cannot get the updater to work properly to update the iPod software.  I have tried with both iPods and the computer indicates it is updating the iPod, but it just runs and runs like that for hours with no real action being taken.  It now does this on both the old and new.  My other complaint with the nano is that to add a few songs to the iPod is a time consuming task.  It seems faster to sync the iPod completely.  All in all we will enjoy having the music in tiny portable player, but some serious work needs to be put in to the software aspect.

<Title>Ipod Nano won't work with OS 10.3.9
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before you drop the $149 for this little gem, you should know that it won't operate on OS X 10.3.9.  The new Nano's require OS X 10.4.8.  I have called Apple Technical Support and then confirmed this requirement.  In order to use the new Nano's, you will have to drop another $120 to upgrade.

<Title>Completely and totally, Awsome.
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>By far, the best iPod I have had the chance to use. I would have saved to get the 8GB, but I'm cheap. Unfortunately, there aren't any cases available as of this writing. And thats the big let down. Already I have a few small scratches, and thats not good in my book. Anyway, I love how the nano can finnaly play video. At first, I thought it wouldn't be easy watching an episode of Heroes or LOST on a 2 inch screen, but then I watched it. AWSOME. Unfortunately, most of the shows have widescreen, making the already small screen even smaller, though I hear you can change the aspect ratio. Anyway, best iPod ever, at least until the iPod Touch comes out. Bonus points for it getting people to talk to me.

<Title>Great music, good quality but...
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have gone through two Apple iPod nanos before this one. The sound quality of this latest Nano is better than the previous ones. The screen color is wonderful and the "Cover Flow" feature is one of my favorites. Not to mention that it now has video too and I must say that the quiality of the video is exceptional!  All is well EXCEPT for the design. The material used is shiny and somewhat slippery so I always have the fear that I will drop it. It's square-ish design fits awkwardly on my hands and it's so small that it too feels awkward when I am scrolling through my music collection.  Bottomline, when it comes to sound quality and added features (Video & Cover flow), this new generation Nano is unbeatable. As for the design and comfort, I'd still go for the second generation Nano. So 4 stars!!!

<Title>Wonderful tiny device, very impressed with Apple
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I must say, it has taken me all this time to finally succumb to owning an Ipod. When these new little gems came out, I just couldn't resist it. I think it's the best MP3 player I've ever owned, and I've owned quite a few. I'm very impressed with Apple overall, and can see why these are so popular. I love the design and the amazingly brilliant screen. The cover flow is a really cool feature and I'm really happy I can get a flash Ipod with pretty much the same features as a hard drive Ipod (classic). The best feature for me is the shuffle mode. I usually like to put my music on random and this player lets you access the shuffle mode easily and change it easily. I also like the 3 games that are included. Two of them are really fun, but I'm not as big a fan of the solitaire knockoff, but that's just me. I've never been as much a fan of hard drive MP3 players since mine always seemed to freeze and they are more delicate due to the moving parts, so I wasn't really interested in getting a Classic even though you get more GB for your $.  This 4GB Nano is perfect for me since I really don't need much more space than that and I feel I'm not throwing money away. I couldn't see myself ever filling up 80GB of space if I got a Classic, especially not in time for when (inevitably) the next version of the Ipod comes out that I will probably want!  I have another MP3 player that I use for my car that is a little bigger and hard drive based, so this is my travel player to use when I'm out and about or exercising. The size is perfect, and I actually prefer the more square design to the long design of the previous Nano. It holds just enough files and keeps me from putting too much music on it that I don't really want to listen to after a while. I've put about 3GB of music on and left the other 1GB for photos, videos, etc. I doubt I'll ever watch movies on it since it's kind of a small screen (and the PSP is much better for that) but I have added some music videos and maybe will add some TV shows.  Like another reviewer said, it would be nice if these were offered in other colors too, but it's not that big a deal to me and definitely not enough to stop me from buying it. Silver is a good neutral color, so I'm happy with it.  Anyway, I think this is a great deal for $149 and really is worth every penny!

<Title>Apple still impresses me.
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned a 2nd generation iPod Nano for about a little over a year now, bought it back when the 1-gigs cost about the same as this new 4-gig with video. I loved the little thing; it was highly portable, flash-drive based, and sounded rather well given its and its headphone's size. The only aspect that disappointed me was its battery life, as many other past-gen iPod users might know of.  The new iPod Nanos with video still has the same characteristics as their predecessors, if not better. It's still flash-drive based and it's still highly portable. The sound it produces is just as good, if not, better. We are promised a 24-hour battery life, and though I haven't owned it long enough to test this implication, it seems to be doing great so far (the previous Nano I had was supposed to last 8 hours, but I got about 5 to 6 even when it was new).  It's a nice upgrade considering the one I had didn't have video (obviously), could only hold 1gig, had a battery life of only 8 hours, and not quite as small. So why only 4 stars?? Included with the iPod in the package is only a USB plug, a dock clip, and earbud headphones. Where's the pouch to protect it a little?? But no matter, it just takes a little creativity.

<Title>Apple improves the Nano and delivers an enjoyable player
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple's new nano is designed to improve upon past models and add some functionality. The improved video, smaller thinner body and updated firmware are enough to make it stand out. The slightly lower price tag is also sure to help sell more units.   I think most buyers will opt to get the 8GB, considering it is only $50 more than the 4GB and actually makes the video function more usable.  Regardless, the new nano is an improvement in any size.  The Looks   Some people will prefer the older nano's longer body with the larger click wheel. Apple shortened the body to limit breaks due to the former generation flexing in people's pockets and bags. The longer nano was prone to bend (and sometimes break) when people put them in their pocket and sat down.   Another change motivated by durability is the metal face. The old clear composite face was a magnet for smudges and scratches. The new metal face holds up nicer. Be warned though; it can chip and scratch, so get a cover.  This unit is also thinner, so even in a cover it will still be thinner than most other players. BIG ++++!  Apple does lose some points for the smaller click-wheel being awkward. It's a trade-off.   The Sound   Sound quality is not significantly improved from previous models. The slight improvements touted in Apple's marketing are exagerated. However, let's be fair to Apple here. Most MP3 players have only moderate fidelity sound.   Almost no MP3 players are actually designed for audiophiles / musicians / sound engineers; i.e., the people who could tell the difference between good sound and great sound. The sound is ok; just don't expect it to sound like a Bose wave radio.  Remember also that MP3 is a compression technology that does experience quality loss. Particularly, with a lower bitrate your MP3 files will lose more and more of the sound integrity from the original recording. Combine that with the fact many people rip from CDs that are not digitally mastered, and you would get inferior sound quality with any device.   Features   Other than the changes in the body design, not many new features are noteworthy with this device.   There are some changes in the components and software that do make the screen brighter and allow you to do more things, including watch videos and play more games. Some complain there isn't enough memory for video. It's a nice extra even if these nanos don't have tremendous memory.   The flash memory in this device could have been a higher speed. However, the main advantages of the flash player are still here: less risk of hardware failure associated with a hard disk drive player (better for running or working out).   The device does seem to have a slighly shorter battery life than advertised. Perhaps there is a trade-off with the shorter form factor. Users are still likely to get a full day's use from a charge.   Apple's software is still a weakness with very limited direct control over your device library and few file options. Most users have limited needs and will not notice. Apple hits the minimum compatibility needs of most of the market.   Coverflow is little more than a gimmick. It's still buggy.  Covers tend to blank out if you scroll quickly. Cover art has been downloaded with previous software versions and with other players.  The ability to scroll covers is not really a breakthough.   Keep in mind that the iPod actually still has less features than most competitive devices. It doesn't have a radio tuner, voice recorder, bluetooth, WMA support, etc. But what it does it does well.   Overall this device is an improvement. Apple really wins with sleek design and a wealth of accessories. This unit is no different. While it is not perfect, none of the competition is good enough to de-throne it any time soon.

<Title>WARNING: Read this before you purchase
<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased an iPod Nano. I eagerly attached it to my computer and was informed that my prior version of iTunes was incapable. So, I downloaded the lastest version. However, when I re-attached the Nano, iTunes stated that it could not properly connect to the Nano and that I would have to restore the Nano's programming. So, I hit the "Restore" button - only to be told that iTunes could not restore the Nano due to an error, which it labelled as "1418".   In other words, iTunes cannot read my Nano though it came new straight out of the box and, despite an alleged capacity to restore the Nano's programming, it cannot resolve the problem and, therefore, ignores the Nano. Hence, the Nano is of no use.    So, I went to the Apple Support page, however, that page provided no obvious manner of directly contacting Apple suppport staff or of sending an email. After several minutes of entering various searches, I found a prior question by a customer regarding "error 1418" to which Apple had given suggestions to remedy the 1418 error - however, none of the suggestions worked!  I have been searching on Google, hoping someone other than Apple is more forthcoming with suggestions. It has not been successful so far. In fact, the only thing I learned is that the "1418" error is very common, that Apple is aware of it, and is doing little to assist its customers. Apparently, profits are more important than providing a product which actually works. So, here I sit with a shiny little Nano which costs $150 and for that substantial sum it does nothing but reflect light whenever I move it about.  I cannot tell you the aggravation this causes, particularly when I realized that Apple is well aware that this might happen and has not revised it programming or, otherwise, taken steps to conveniently tell customers how to resolve the issue. In truth, I am beginning to believe that I may never resolve the issue and, from what I can glean, Apple does not consider itself beholden to its customers since it believes there is no defect in their product but somehow a defect in Microsoft's Windows programming.   If you don't think this might happen to you or believe I am exaggerating, please see www.1418hell.com. While it may not happen to you, it happens often enough to question the risk v. reward.

<Title>A major upgrade and well worth it!
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I knew that I was going to upgrade my old nano sooner or later and decided to get this on the first day that my local store carried it. I am very impressed with the improvements. I really thought that the original nano was too perfect to improve but Apple has done it again. The screen is beautiful. I won't be watching any movies on it as I am not a movie viewer but the screen is great for the new coverflow feature where you can scoll through the album covers of everything on your nano. There are lots of new extras such as improved clocks, a stopwatch, better search (you can search by first letter now), etc. The extra 2 gig of memory is very welcome and holds all of the music that I have. Battery life seems to be a bit better than the old nano and it definitely recharges faster. Here's my tip to preserve the screen and back from scratches: get a piece of clear packing tape (the kind you seal boxes with) and carefully cover the screen and back (NOT the scroll wheel). If you do this correctly, there will be no air bubbles and your screen will never scratch. Much cheaper than any cover on the market. I am definitely happy with my purchase.

<Title>Burned by Apple
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have learned my lesson.  Last month I purchased a 4G Ipod Nano for $179.  This was the 2nd generation with no video.  Now a new version is out that is $149 and has video.  I don't think I will buy Apple products again.  I'm tired of getting burned and amazed that Apple does not offer any sort of help in situations like this.
