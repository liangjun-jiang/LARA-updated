<Content>I bought this product so as to work on choreography with my students so that they could hear the music without headphones.  The music does not play loud.  It is VERY hard to try and get music onto the mp3 player.  It took me HOURS to figure out how to download music to it and drag and drop sometimes works...sometimes doesn't.  You can't find the music once it is on the player.  When you are able to download music, it cuts off and doesn't download the whole song.  Radio does not work.   The other reason I bought this is for recording because it said it worked good for recording speaches and more.  Well, IF you can figure out HOW to record and manage to get something on there, it plays back all garbled.   The player shuts off constantly without warning.  The USB cord does not work (I had to use another one). This is a terrible product with multiple problems and the company who is selling it on here offers a refund but does not follow through.  I can't even get an email to them.  They answered one but my reply to that bounced back.  They want to exchange.  Why would I exchange for a new one of these when it is not user friendly????  Don't buy this product.  You will regret it.
