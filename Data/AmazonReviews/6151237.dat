<Title>Product Defective & Ordered Replacement (To be continued)
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Product came out of the box defective.  Static on playback due to some problem with the audio output connection.  At first, other than the static that could be adjusted away, it performed fine.  However, just a  week after purchase, the second problem came during downloading Rhasody Channels.  When downloading the channels, the unit froze.  I disconnected from the computer, and rebooted, and it seemed fine.  After that, it never turned on again without a fatal error message, and was inoperable.  I am in the process of returning and replacing, and will see if the replacement works properly.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XRQ2Q6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6603354-7637252">ibiza Rhapsody H1A030BK 30 GB Wi-Fi/MP3 Player by Haier (Black)</a>
