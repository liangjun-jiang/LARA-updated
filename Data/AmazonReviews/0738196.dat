<Title>Good buy

<Content>My first digital music player, so I am biased. :) But, I like everything about it. Sound quality is very good. Tends to be bigger in size than an Ipod. The buttons are slightly hard. The user interface/experience is good.  The thing that I like the most about it is that it plays FM radio, has an autoscanner for FM and its easy to switch between FM stations. Can play through precharged battery or directly through the AC mains (There is an adaptor included for conversion to DC). Doesn't look as cool as an ipod, but for $99, its a great buy.

<Content>Nice player to use.This is my first mp3 player. The feature i liked the most is the online FM recording. Voice recorder is also very good. I am satisfied overall with this one. I am little suspicious about the joystick kind of control they have given on it to operate. Its little hard and if not used carefully may spoil it. There is a wired remote also provided.We can do all the operations using that too.

<Title>MuVo 2 SQ 5GB Digital Media Player REVIEW

<Content>I have found the player to be excellent. I've had no problems with it and it has worked flawlessly so far.  My only complaint would be with the user documentation.  I felt that it didn't do a very good job of explaining the different features, and there were some things that didn't apply to my model but seemed to be for another one.  That's the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.
