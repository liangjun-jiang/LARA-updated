<Title>Not bad for the price
<Date>Wed Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had this for a week and here is what I've found so far:  Pros: 1. Very portable and light. 2. Long battery life. 3. No drivers/software needed (tried on Win 2000 and XP). 4. Reads ID3 (only displays song name on the screen though). 5. Has a voice recorder and it can record from the FM tuner - very cool.  Cons: 1. When the backlight is lit there is a buzzing noise. [Edit: After firmware update the noise disappeared] 2. The screen is very short, but I guess thats the price for portability. 3. Instead of only showing/scrolling songname only they could have shown Artist - Album - Songname. 4. Twice it just paused in the middle of the song (May have been bad mp3 file).

<Title>Very good workout mp3 player with quality accessories
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I wanted an mp3 player for working out and running. I am one of those guys who reads everything they can about something before buying one. What I read about mp3 players was a bit worrisome: countless reports that mp3 players break or have minor problems. So I picked up a Memorex Biomorph (I liked the size and features) along with an extended warranty beyond the 3 month product warranty, and sure enough, with light use, the product died with lots of strange nonsense on the lcd screen after 4 months. (I "reset" the device per technical support troubleshooting, but it didn't help.) I went through the hassle of returning it and getting reimbursed, minus the 40 dollar extended warranty cost. And I set out to read all the reviews I could before buying another mp3 player. I read the most positive reviews and least complaints with the Creative MUVO series.   My requirements: Driverless flash drive [I use it to transfer files between my laptop and desktop, and I want the convenience of being able to plug it into any of my friends' computers, Mac or PC, and share files/music], arm band for working out, FM radio, small and light [so a AAA battery model, not AA], and 1 year warranty (this is no longer negotiable). Microphone recording a plus, but not a requirement.   The Muvo series fit the bill. I wanted a flash memory player, not a small harddrive, because for me it's mainly a workout device, not a home for all my music. I came close to buying the Muvo Slim, because I loved the idea of a lithium ion battery charging by USB, and I think it looks very cool, but the leather cover has no place for a belt clip, and it lacks an arm band entirely, and so I went for the Muvo N200 ("micro").   So far the unit has really impressed me. The Memorex came with a bulky, cheap nylon arm strap that was the size of a belt, and even on its smallest setting, was huge. The Muvo Micro, by contrast, has an excellent arm strap, suitable for a variety of sizes, made from a nice smoky-grey slightly stretchy material. It has a well-sewn extra place to secure the Muvo, too, which they could have skipped, since you could attach the Muvo anywhere, so it is a nice touch. The Memorex used a very cheap thin faux-leather case for the Biomorph, while the Muvo really surprised me by having a case that is not merely a cover to prevent scratches, but is a thick frost-white rubber sleeve that the Muvo slips into. It's pretty cool: clearly if you drop it, and it lands on one of the three corners protected by the sleeve, it will be well protected (it might even bounce). In addition, unlike a vinyl cover, this leaves all of the buttons easily accessible: i.e. it's not like a ski mask with holes for the buttons (this was a pain on the Memorex, as the vinyl kept slipping over the buttons). The buttons are well laid out, too. Even after four months, I always had to think for a second or two to remember which buttons were for what on the Memorex. The Muvo makes more sense. For example, the volume up and down buttons are by themselves (not next to other buttons), and they border the lcd screen. The volume up botton is on the side where the bar increases with the volume, and the volume down button is on the side where the bar begins: so it's easy to make second nature. The play/pause button is also by itself somewhere else, so you don't accidentally hit that. Overall, a very good layout.   The lcd screen is small, but it's sharp, and you can adjust the brightness, contrast, etc. As others have said, there is an audible buzz on the headphones while the backlight is on, but that lasts about two seconds, and it doesn't bother me.   The menus make a lot of sense. One very nice feature is the ability to make the screen appear upside/down. This way YOU can choose how you want to wear the player while working out, and then if the screen appears upside down, just flip it. It's those little things that I was happy Creative thought of.   Another thing: I was quite surprised that the Memorex didn't get very loud. I usually had the volume on maximum. The Muvo, by contrast, is much louder, so I can have control of the volume back, keeping it around 2/3rds, and then adjusting depending on mood, surrounding noise, etc.   The earbuds which came with the Memorex were painful and were garbage, but the Creative earbuds are actually pretty good. I did have problems keeping the right earbud in my ear while running, so I'll probably go back to my pair of padded over-the-ear headphones which I prefer. But I was still pleased with the quality of the Creative earbuds: e.g. they don't hurt.   The USB 2.0 cable that comes with the Muvo is a small-standard USB cable, which means that it's the same cable my digital camera uses, as well as many other devices. This means you can replace it at any store should you lose it and, more practically, it means I can just share the cable I use for the digital camera, thus cutting down on clutter.   I haven't tried some of the advanced features, such as on-the-fly recording of any analog source through the input cable. I also plan on trying some rechargeable batteries.  When I do, I'll revise the review.   One final recommendation: I do recommend you consider the size of an mp3 player before buying one for working out. I saw a picture of a Sandisk I was considering, and it looked small, but when I saw it in person, it was huge compared to the Micro.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am very impressed with the MuVo N200.  I received it as a gift for my birthday and it has functioned very well for me.  My only qualm is that some of the tracks that I tried ripping from my CDs did not reproduce exactly and skipped in the middle or end of tracks.  I was told that this was the software and that could be updated from the Creative website for a fee.  Other than that, a very good product.  The microphone and FM tuner are cool features.

<Title>Creative MuVo n200
<Date>Sat Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ups: - Incredibly small (excellent for going to the gym with, or just carrying in your pocket) - Massive storage - Sleek design (and it's shiny! A big plus if you're easily amused like me) - FM tuner and line in (cables included) can be recorded directly to device's memory - Microphone (a nice little feature for recording professor's lectures or anything else you may want to record) - Can also be used as a portable storage device - Music files can be easily organized into folders which can be easily scrolled/skipped/selected on the device's cool blue back lit LCD display and ingenious scrolling wheel - No need to install anything on your computer if you're using XP (and 2000 I hear), simple "drag and drop" interface - Screen can be flipped upside down for left-handed users - Has an equalizer that you can either customize or choose from the one of the 4 presets - Surprisingly good sound, even with the included ear-buds - Short of maybe an ipod (which, might I mention, has no line-in recording, no 15 hour battery life (which is super cheap to replace, unlike the $100 ipod battery), no built in fm tuner, no microphone, and is no where near as small or light as this thing) the best mp3 player out there you can buy.   Downs: - When the backlight is on, there is this really annoying buzzing sound - Songs within a folder cannot be "jumped" to, you have to scroll through the entire list (a price you pay for the player's portability and thus lack of buttons) - The battery cover has this shoddy little plastic nub that holds it in place...I'm constantly afraid of breaking it - This model (512mb model) will be obsolete in a short while (go figure....) because creative is releasing a 1GB version soon (will cost you about 200 bucks), but if you're like me, and can't wait, go ahead and buy this sucker, you wont be disappointed - When you record things using the microphone (I use it to record my o-chem and molecular bio. Lectures sitting about 10-12 feet away from my professors) you have to turn the volume up to max to hear anything during play back (or you can do what I do, transfer it to your computer and use it to amplify the sound). - The ear-buds keep falling out when I'm running - A little pricy, I think closer to 90-100 would have been a fairer price (if u strongly think this too, wait about a month or so, the prices on these things are always dropping) - If you get a dark color (I have the black), be prepared to constantly find your fingerprints all over the plastic case (white looks nice too ;-)) - It comes in a package that is impossible to open, some kind of super-metal/plastic-alloy-crap that you have to use titanium scissors to open (maybe I'm just mad because I cut myself while opening it...but hey, the loss of blood was justified)  On a scale of 1 to 10 - 9.6

<Title>Durable Product, Good Value
<Date>Sun Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this MP3 player for almost 2 years now and it is still going strong. It has worked-out with me and kept me company a lot.  The battery life is good (1 AAA battery lasts long enough for me not to feel like I'm being ripped-off paying for batteries). If you compress the mp3 files (on option provided on this player), then it can hold a couple hundred songs.   The sound is great, and the set-up and process of adding new music is easy.   The only problem is that the player has "frozen" 2 or 3 times on me in the past 2 years. To unfreeze it requires that you go to the Creative website and reinstall the software. It's slightly annoying, but since the problem is fixable without spending any extra money and because it only takes small amount of time, I won't complain.

<Title>512 is more than what you can ask for
<Date>Sat Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>it was between this and the mini Yepp player.  no matter how small the other one was the final decision came from having 512 ram.  the player is quite intuitive but switching from player to radio can be a hassle.  i have fairly ok eyes and i don't mind the small screen but it does take certain attention to switch between and i can't do it while driving.  the design itself is pretty good.  comes with a arm strap and a rubber case with a plastic clip that firmly locks onto the strap.  i keep mine in the rubber case cuz serves as a protective item and actually it's easier to grab/use it.  the size of the player is small enough to still hide in my hands even with the rubber case.

<Title>AWESOME player for the money
<Date>Sat Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>One of the best player I ever got.  and I went through alot of other mp3 players before: - ipod mini - muvo2 4 gb - ireiver ifp-190t (256 meg) - creative nomad.  etc..  along with all the other stuff, Pros and Cons that other people didnt' mention before: PRO:  - USB cable is standard size (so u can use cable from anyone, instead of paying up the A$$ for expensive proprietory cables) - mp3 encoding and Voice recording is pretty good quality and small size - line-in mp3 encoding offer 96k, 128k, and 160k quality - FM radio has good reception and have have intuitive autoscanning and preset setup - Encodes files are in mp3 format and voice recording is in WAV format. so no need to convert it or load a proprietory program to convert it (that was pis me off about the i-river 190 player) - no software needed.  just plug in and it shows up as a removable drive   CONS: - The Left/Right Rocker is kinda not that that easy to use. I wish they would have swap the Rocker and Volume control buttons. as I use "next/previous track" buttons more - for some reason afew of my songs would miss the first 3-4 seconds of the song. those songs sounded fine in my other players - the wrapper that it comes in be careful when opening, it can cut you :P - when recording from FM radio the record quality is not mp3 quality but WAV like voice recording (but better quality) - the little "bump" near the back for a lanyard is useless because it's too small for any of my lanyard  -  No Playlist feature. it plays from the folders.  not that much of a problem if u have few songs but when u get to 1 gig versions it's a pain to move from song to song since u can't jump.

<Title>Good price and Good Sound but mediocre otherwise
<Date>Tue Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this player because of all the good reviews and it had a built in FM radio, line in recording and it had a drag and drop feature for copying files.  When I got the player I was immediately disappointed because the player though very light was made of very cheap plastic.  Also, the buttons does not seem very sturdy.  The MP3 sound quality is good but the FM radio reception is very poor.  I previously had a Nomad II, which had a much better reception.  The line in recording is very useful but it is of very poor quality and so it is not really worth it.  It is much better to use a computer to encode the MP3 songs.  I am definitely returning mine and my hunt for another player continues.

<Content>This is great i bought this 3 months and i saw all the reviews on this Web and i was scared about buying this for my son. So i took a risk and bought him the 512mb one. He was so Happy because he liked the ipod but told me that it was pricey.And he put about (100-120) songs on it and the radio is great too. the voice mic. Is great for my son Because he can't remember what i tell him so i record it on his mp3 so he would remember.And the in-line recording is great when our comp. goes out or somthing happens he wont half to wait until the comp. starts working so i think it is a great mp3.So everyone should buy this if you want to have a cheap 512mb and not a non-cheap ipod. I give this a 5 star.

<Title>It was great, but...
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this player as a gift in April.  It was fantastic until the beginning of December, when it wouldn't turn on.  After trying to turn it on about ten times it finally worked, but never again.  Now it doesn't come on at all.  I sent and e-mail to the company for advice.  They recommended some procedures that didn't help. Now they say that it needs to be returned to them for service, at a minimum of a $25 fee for labor, plus postage.  I think that this type of product should last for more than 8 or 9 months and if it doesn't the company should fix it for free.  The guarantee is for one year, but labor is only covered for 3 months.   I'm not sure that it is worth spending the $25 when models with more memory are now available at lower prices than was spent on this.  Now I will look for a different brand.

<Content>I could shoot myself for purchasing another MuVo Micro as an Xmas gift for my daughter. Yes I have purchased two in the past year and both have failed. The first one died after 10 months of use and the second unit (gift to daughter) failed within 2-weeks after she received it. I really love these little players and their relatively ease of use including their compatibility with Windows Media Player, but both will not turn on and play back. Creative support has emailed me with instructions to re-install the firmware. I have attempted this, but the unit first needs to turn on to set the player in recovery mode. Getting through to telephone support is almost impossible (as expected).

<Title>Great recorder and player for the price!
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item for the following reasons:   1.  Price.  $75 for 512MB is awesome   2.  Mp3 Recording capability ... NICE feature for price!   3.  USB drive connectivity  On the above 3 items, I have not been disappointed.   I am a music director for a church, and I often need to give recordings to my choir members for independent practice.   With this little gem, I can just hook it up the the "line out" on my new Clavinova keyboard, setup recording on the MuVo, and hit play on the clavinova.  It records a 160kps MP3 at great quality.   As if that isn't convenient enough, I can just hook it up to my PC when I get home, copy the encoded Mp3 to a Burn list, and make a CD for my choir members.  No intermidiate software needed!  I can also just copy the Mp3 to a website for them to download immediately, since it encodes to standard Mp3 format.  For those serious techies out there, Linux recognizes this device out of the box (Fedora Core 4) as a thumb drive.   I have a Linux media PC running my HDTV, so I can use that PC to import the audio without any difficulties.  Nice!  There are many accounts of the product failing after a few months, but I can't comment on that yet.   I've only been using it for a few weeks.  For $75 and given the awesome recording feature that I was looking for, it's worth the risk in my opinion.  ADDITION 2/13/2006:   I did recently have some problems with the software on the player, but installing the latest bios / drivers available at Creative's website corrected the problem perfectly.   Works even better than when I originally purchased it.

<Content>First, you should know that this MP3 player is not the same color as it looks in the pictures. It is a darker hot pink color. After having this player for about 6 months, I think that I can safely say that this is a great MP3 player. It's lightweight, small, stylish, affordable, easy to use, and it comes with everything you need. It came with a clear rubber case with a belt clip and an arm band. My only complaint is that the white earbuds that came with the player are much too big to fit into my ears, but that problem is easily fixable. This player has a blue LCD light and the screen orientation can be flipped. There are plenty of equalizer settings including a custom setting. This player has an FM radio (unlike iPods!). The software is easy to use and you can customize the order in which your favorite songs play. I have only had one problem with this player but all I had to do was an upgrade from the website(check the Creative website for FAQs on how to do this). One day I was listening to some music when the player suddenly started buzzing. After this, every time I would turn on the player I would have to go through my folders to pick a song and then push play (it's supposed to start playing where you left off). A simple upgrade fixed all of this and the player works better than ever! Another benefit of this player is that it only takes 1 triple A battery and the battery life is great. I can use generic batteries (4 for $1) and they last forever. I never have to worry about charging up the player and it's very easy to find a battery rather than finding a computer or an outlet to charge the player.

<Title>Love this gorgeous gadget
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this gadget. It was smaller and lighter than I thought it would be. It does more than I expected...I'm now able to transfer my cassettes into MP3. The sound quality is excellent. I loved the armband feature as well. Transferring music is incredibly easy...just drag and drop.  I have two small quibbles with it though... 1. the line-in connection is too short...it should be at least another 6-12 inches long.  2. The covers have begun coming off the headphones which seem a little cheap compared to the quality of the device itself.  It's for these two reasons that I haven't given it 5 stars. But when I go to replace this product...it will be Creative again.

<Title>The best player under $70
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After many researches even in Cnet.com, I've got one Muvo micro 512Mb. This player is really good. A lot of functions: FM receiver, can be used like a pen drive and it is also a voice recorder. The  LCD display could be bigger and the earbuds better but it's a fair    player for this price.

<Title>Good for what it's worth.
<Date>Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is probably one of the smallest MP3 players out there and for that reason it serves it purpose. However, the sound processing is a bit to low to my opinion, it's usually very hard and it tends to blend details wich make most music sound a bit murky. This can ofcourse be improved by better headphones but those included are, well, a bit of a crap to be honest. Even with better headphones the audio clarity isn't quite as good as in e.g. the iPod (wich also has crappy headphones) but then again, MP3 is not the best format to enjoy detailed music anyway. Music should be experienced with quality amplifacation driven by decent speakersystem.

<Title>Great Features
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As with most other reviewers I thoroughly enjoy the player. Its rugged, dependeble, good on batteries, easy to carry around, and sounds excellent. I wanted to mention some additional features of the player.  1. Can encode mp3s! Unfortunately it can only go up to 160 kbps but for a player this small in size this is just amazing. I believe it comes with the special cable to do it (though I don't remember, its been a few months since I bought mine).  2. Includes the ability to set a custom equalizer. This in itself in my opionion can make or break any mp3 player as this allows you to use it with virtually any headphones/stereo/car stereo and make up for the weaknesses of any sound system (weather they be in the highs, mids, or lows). You can also set it to your personal tasts. No number of preset EQ settings will ever compare to being able to customize your own Equalizer.  3. Can record audio fairly well. Unfortunately it can only record in wave which is unfortunate, especially since it can encode mp3s. The sensetivity is good enough to hear almost anything in a room if you play it back with the volume all the way up. I think it would work fairly well for recording a lecture in class.  4. Can record radio! Unfortunately it can only record in wave, and further you can't equalize the playback like you can mp3s, or WMA files, but its still a useful feature. If you don't have any music to bring out of town, just set the player recording the radio ahead of time for a few hours. You can skip through the commercials with the scroll wheel.  5. Has a backlight which comes in very useful at night. You can turn it off, or set the length that it remains on after a button is pressed. Great customizability to maximuze battery life.  6. Can play back any mp3s or WMAs. At first I was anxious about how it would handle variable bit rate mp3s, or high bit rate mp3s (324 kbps), but it plays them all just fine. Great for download music, then just dragging it to your mp3 player with no hassle converting files.  7. FM Radio. Thats already mentioned above though. Unfortunately no AM radio reception capability which would be nice to have at times.  8. No software requirements. The player acts like a drive when you plug it in through the USB port, so all you need to do is drag and drop files.  9. Takes a beating. I left mine by accident in my motorcycle sattle bag just clanking around on the bottom. It got all scratched up, and got pretty hot too. It just keeps ticking just fine. I accidently left it plugged into my computer for a couple of hours too and it got pretty warm. It is unphased.  10. Can delete files without having to plug the player into a computer. I'm not sure if all players have this capability.  Theres a few others, but this just about covers it. The ear buds suck, so plan on buying a decent pair of headphones. On the positive side, this allows you to get exactly the headphones you want. Depending on the headphones you use, sometimes you can hear a high pitched noise when the backlight comes on. Its not noticeable at all with my panasonic headphones though, nor when its connected to my car stereo.

<Title>Great player, it's light, works well, has great battery life
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the player I ended up getting after doing a lot of research.   I figured that 512mb was enough, and although 1gb would be nice, it wasn't worth the additionall cost.  I wanted a player that had a radio in case I got sick of what was loaded into the player.  The radio has great reception, but you seem to have to hold it away from your body for weaker stations to come in.  It comes with a little rubbery case that has the belt clip on it if you want to clip it to something (like the included armband or your belt).  It also has a spot to attach a neclace on the player itself.  See my "customer pictures" at the link at the top of the page if you're curious what everything that comes with it looks like.  One of the things about all these mp3 players is that unless you go to a store, it's hard to tell what they look like from the one angle they show you.  It's very light (about 1oz WITH the battery inside, 1.5 oz with battery and little rubbery case).  I got rechargeable batteries for mine and I've been using it for about 3 weeks, 3 hours per week and it's still going with more than half the battery power showing on the battery indicator.  It is easy to navigate the music on the player too.  You can skip through tracks or go up a level to skip through folders if you have your music organized in folders.  The player remembers where you were even if you switch to listen to the radio for a while and then go back to mp3 (especially nice for books on tape/cd).  This seemed to me to be the best flash based player.  The only other contender was the Sandisk one, but this has one feature that the Sandisk doesn't have; input so you can record from your stereo or an external microphone.  It's easy to use, sounds great.  Also, although Creative doesn't list it as Mac compatible, it is.  If you plug it into a mac, the player shows up on the desktop as a drive and you can drag mp3 files onto it and they copy to the player perfectly.  The only complaint I have is the same one that everyone does, when you push the buttons the backlight comes on for a few seconds and during the time the light is on there is a buzz.  Not a big deal, but has to be said.  Here are the features that drove me to buy this: &lt;ul> &lt;li>Plays mp3 of course &lt;li>Small and light &lt;li>FM tuner &lt;li>record from FM tuner, built in mic or line input &lt;li>takes one AAA battery (light, easy to find, cheap rechargeables avail) &lt;li>came with a belt clip &lt;li>has a display screen (unlike the flash based ipod)

<Title>No more cassette tapes!
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the MuVo N200 for one thing: to digitally record hours of radio.  It's the best-priced gadget I've found for the task.  No, it doesn't have an AM tuner, but it has line-in.  Now I can collect and archive various radio broadcasts without the time limits or analog conversions of cassette tapes.  The memory will hold 12+ hours of 96-bit MP3 recordings, and the battery is said to last about that long, so I could record all night if I needed to.

<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It was working great...except for the buzz when the backlight was on, until the next day when the thing wouldnt turn on.  I dont know if its just me who has bad luck with creative stuff, but I had trouble with my last creative muvo too and had to send it back for repair multiple times.  I ended up buying the sony nw-e75 which has less memory and fewer functions, but I know Sony is reliable.  Plus, the sony has much much better sound quality, in my opinion.  I guess if you're looking for a mediocre mp3 player with lots of interesting functions for a good price this one's perfect, but I for one wouldnt trust it to work for a very long time.

<Title>My favorite out of 7 mp3 players
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The 512 MB MuVo N200 is my 7th mp3 player of a fleet which includes 3 pre-iPod devices, an iPod 2nd generation, a Mini iPod, and the new Dell DJ. I really love the Mini and the Dell DJ, but the MuVo N200 approaches perfection. It is small, but not too small (to get lost). It works flawlessly with audible.com (my #1 use) unlike the iPod which continually shut down and started the book over-and-over. I use the MuVo while running or working out. I have nothing negative to say about this device. I can't even reproduce the buzzing noise others have noted when the backlighting is turned on. And speaking of lights, the bright lights of the marketing blitz for the iPod shuffle could cast this device into the shadows. Don't be fooled by massive marketing and fawning reviews - you can have it all - small size AND a screen (and an FM radio, digital recorder, and accessories). And did I mention real buttons? (Can anyone imagine virtual buttons on clothing or a Click Wheel for a zipper? Give me the real thing.)

<Title>Great Player in every way!
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Look no more, this player is the best!  Like many others, I sifted through mounds of research and found this player to be the best option.    First for those like me who wanted a player with playlist options, let me clarify what this player does.  While it does not support "playlists," by using the included (and very straighforward) software that comes with the player, you can create separate folders and load these separate folders onto the player, thus having separate lists (ie I have a "FAST" folder for workouts, a "SLOW" folder for mellow listening, as well as several folders each with an entire album on it).  So in a way this player does have playlist capability--you choose the folder you want to listen to and play it.  You just have to use the included software to organize your tunes into these folders, which is a snap.  The main difference compared to playlists is that you can't sort the songs in the order you like them, the only options are alphabetical or you can suffle them by selecting the shuffle option in play mode.  For me this folder system answers the playlist issue just fine, and that was a priority for an MP3 player for me.    In every other way, this player is awesome.  Sound is great.  Included headphones sound great, but as others have noted, they are a tad large for the ears.  Minor flaw for an otherwise superior player.  The battery life is really strong.  Add that to the fact that the battery is an easy-to-replace AAA and that makes the battery issue so much easier and cheaper when compared to more costly custom batteries.  The buzzing sound people have mentioned when the LCD screen on the player is lit, is so faint, and so brief and not recognizable when listening to music at a normal level that it's not even worth mentioning.  The size of this player is truly astounding, even more amazing when you consider all it does.    My only complaint . . . I love this player so much that I'm afraid I'm going to fill it faster than I thought.  My advice, stick with this player, but go for the 1G.

<Title>Good all around MP3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So far so good is about the best way to sum up my experience with this mp3 player.  It is easy to use from both a listening standpoint and software standpoint.  The little USB cable is pretty much a universal type cable (also used by my Sony camera) and makes loading and unloading a snap.   The only complaint I have at this point is that when the backlight is on there is a faint buzz until the light goes off.  However, I took care of this by simply turning the back light off.   Probably the best feature I have found so far is that when I download an audio book and listen for a while I can change to other folders without losing my place in the original audio book.  I can swap back and forth between books without losing my place in either.  However, I should note that this has only been the case with items I download from audible.com.  When listening to podcasts I can pause and turn the player off and return to the same spot, but I cannot swap files without losing my place. The FM radio works surprisingly well considering the size of the player (very tiny).  Also, the player is extremely light and the armband that comes with the player is a nice touch.   Like I said, I like this player very much and only have a small complaint about the backlight noise, but I fixed that by turning the backlight off.

<Title>very pleased
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall, I'm very happy with the player, but I'm mad at myself.  I purchased at $120 a couple of weeks ago, and now it's down to $95 after rebate!  At that price, I believe this player is a no brainer.    The player has a play/pause button that serves as an on/off button by holding it down for a few seconds.  There are also dedicated volume buttons.  The lcd displays play mode, battery life, track title, and time elapsed.  Most functions are controled with a single "wheel" button.  Depress it to bring up the menu and the rock back and forth to navigate.    The menu features "skip folder," "play mode," "eq," "delete," "settings," "music," "recorded tracks," "microphone," "fm radio," "mp3 encoding," and "lock."    If you group your songs into folders, you can easily skip back and forth between groups of songs.  Supported play modes include A-B, repeat all, repeat folder, repeat track, play track once, shuffle repeat, shuffle once,  shuffle folder, and normal.  The equalizer has presets and a customizable 5 band.  Recorded tracks lets you hear the tracks recorded from the microphone.  The microphone is pretty lousy, so don't count on it for lectures, interviews, etc.  FM radio is solid with features like scanning, presets, etc.  MP3 encoding is a real gem for recording old record collections to MP3 at 96, 128, or 160 kbps.    The sound on the player is great now.  When I first got the player, I had some issues with clicking noises, etc., but the firmware update cleared up every issue I had.  I am pleased that Creative stands by its products.  The included headphones aren't bad, but upgrade to another pair to really enjoy the sound of this player.  I recommend the Sony MDR-G74SL headphones for a good price/performance ratio.    I never installed the software for the player, but the player shows up as a removeable drive in Windows XP.  I plugged the player into my laptop and was able to drag and drop 495MB of music in 5 minutes.  Very painless.  You can also sync the player with WMP 10, but why bother?  PROS: - Tiny player - Surprisingly good interface - Great sound  - Can achieve high (painful) volumes if desired - MP3 encoding is a great feature - Very simple drag and drop music transfer  CONS: - Yes, the backlight causes buzzing (just turn it off!) - So-so headphones - Battery door cover is somewhat fragile (probably not for kids) - Microphone is basically a toy

<Title>Cutest & Tiniest  music and audiobook player 
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Extremely cute, tiny, and light -1.4 oz with battery.  Paid extra to buy the PINK. Very happy with it and use to to listen to audiobooks from Audible.com, music, especially while working out, FM radio for news and music, and recording my thoughts.  Its best feature is that it is VERY light & small - I wear it as a necklace and do not even notice it.   Classical music sounds just BEAUTIFUL using a Sony MDR-NC20 full-sized headphone. But this headphone is MUCH larger and heavier than the TINY muvo!  Included earbuds increase volume and pumps up base at the expense of upper note clarity.  A good tradeoff for workout music. You will want to use better headphones for fine music. FM reception is pretty good. FM Autoscan recognized 25 stations and is easy to use.  Recording sound quality was great as long as I held the mic right up to my lips. FM radio and voice recording menus are far away from music playing menus and takes several clicks.  The single A battery lasts about 3 days of continuous playing.  	 Listening to Audible.com books - Sound quality is great.  Even format 2 sounds rich and clear - no more scratching sounds. Great in car with cassette adapter. Comparable to full-sized iPod in sound.  Volume goes way down, so will not disturb companion in bed.  Hold scroll wheel right/left to fast forwarding and reverse.  An entire book can be scrolled pretty quickly, so getting around is easy.  Screen easy to read & makes MuVo much better than iPod Shuffle. Skipping chapters takes few more steps.  From book, pressing down once on scroll wheel shows "skip section" icon. Pressing the wheel again shows 1 of X sections in your current book. Flick the wheel right or left to changes sections. Bookmarks are not supported.  But the device remembers where you have stopped on each of the books.  Included software is very, very easy to use for ripping CDs and transfering songs to the MuVo. One button downloads song information (from the internet? the CD itself?). Somehow it recognized my Latin music and Promo CDs that were not recognized by MusicMatch and Microsoft's Mediaplayer. Trasfered to MuVo using Windows Explorer.  MuVo icon shows up as a device. I set up separate folder for "body pump," "cool down," and "classical."  Muvo can shuffle within each folder or across folders.  Normal mode plays in the order of transfer. A-B plays in alphabetical order.    I tested the audio-in to mp3 128 bitrate encoding using CD on my computer. Heard some scratches, volume is much lower, quality is lower than straight ripping from CD at 128 bitrate. Songs do not have titles automatically recognized.  It's a convenient way to encode music from cassettes or LPs to mp3, but  CDs are better off being directly ripped. Was looking foward to this feature to transfer all of my cassette tapes to mp3 but I'm not sure of the quality. Needs further testing. (FYI - I got good quality mp3 recordings by playing the cassette on my hi-fi system (cassette deck, excellent speakers) with volume turned up and recording it to a laptop using a Yamaha pro-level mic and Mediaplayer.)

[...]  now it works like it did when i first got it. hopefully the unit will continue to function for more than a month...

Great when friends are wondering "What song is that?"  3.  NO DRIVERS NECESSARY.  A BIG plus in my book because I can easily transfer files from the player over to my friends notebook  4.

<Content>I bought this one for gym use. First tried an RCA Lyra RD1072, but had to return that one because the sound was terrible.  This unit sounds *much* better than the Lyra.  The other reviews cover features/size. I'll just add my particulars... *first time I connected to my PC, the unit locked-up and I had to pull the battery out to get it to reset. Since other reviews mentioned doing the firmware upgrade to fix some problems, I did that (easy) and haven't had a problem since. *I think the supplied phones sound fine and the EQ capability allows you to shape the sound to what you want. *Some reviews comment on the large earbuds and how they hurt their ears. Huh? I don't know how something that basically rests in your ear and is not forced in could hurt. Maybe it is a volume issue ;) They are plenty comfortable for me. *For running or working out, the case is fine and you have the options of clipping onto your belt/waistband, armstrap, or, it is small enough to slip in a pocket  Considering I only paid $10 more for this than the Lyra model I got, and this has the radio feature, folder recognition, custom EQ, etc. this is just a superior buy.  The Lyra had an expansion slot for memory, but this is not a must for a unit to take to the gym - the built-in 512Meg on the N200 is more than enough for that purpose. Plus, the Lyra didn't recognize folders which makes it very painful to move through lots of songs to get to one you want.

<Title>Creative did a Great Job with this!
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my second flash MP3 player and this little device really rocks!  I like the fact that there are no cards to deal with as the mb storage is all integrated in this tiny thing.  The sound is really good; it has an equalizer with a custom setting so that you can set how you like it.  The FM radio is ok, I haven't used it much though.  I did have some trouble putting music on it as it refused to take more than 110 music files, this was resolved when I created a new file and was able to put an additional 130 songs in it (wma).  Overall, I like the whole package, tiny, but packs a punch.  I don't use the earbuds as I prefer traditional headphones.  A great buy for less than $120.

<Content>This MP3 is awesome... until a few months of ownership. Then it will start to turn itself off after every tracvk or when skipping tracks... THEN you find out that there is a firmware update for your player, but there is a file you need off the installation disc.. that DOESNT have the file! THEN you contact customer support, who three times replying help you in achieving NOTHING! They send you the same message all three times which are just the same instructions as on the website, I dont even think they READ the emails! And to call them is at international rate!!!! DONT buy ANYTHING from CREATIVE! Especially not this rubbish item!

<Content>I loved my player for the first 5 months, now it is totally useless.  Started on a downhill slide about one month ago.  Skipped tracks, powered down on it's own if playing MP3 (radio is fine) and now despite several battery replacements it won't turn on.  This makes is difficult to download the firmware upgrade.  Sure.. it is small, light, and price friendly at first but now I feel totally cheated.

<Title>Firmware Update can solve problems
<Date>Mon Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I hope this posting can help N200 owners.  Bought this product 8 months ago. After 2 months, some display items on the LCD became missing. I didn't care as I rarely read the LCD. I only use shuffle mode. From 3 weeks ago, it turned off automatically every time after playing a couple of songs. It always started from the same point of a particular song when I turned it on.  How can I tolerate this?  I was aware of many firmware updates in Creative Labs' web site. Just like many users, I didn't want to do it as the player was still working. There are always risks doing firmware update as it is a way of no return.  But if I can't fix the problems this time, I have to throw it away.  Visiting their web site, I found there is a Firmware Upgrade 1.15.01 but it emphasizes "You must install Creative MuVo driver version 1.03.00.250 before installing this upgrade".  Where to find "1.03.00.250"??? Nowhere!!  On the same web page, there is a driver "1.07.00.250". I thought it should cover the old "1.03.00.250". So I downloaded and installed it, then continued to install firmware "1.15.01".  I got a "the device must be put in recovery mode" message and the firmware wasn't updated.  I checked the user guide and couldn't find any clue about the recovery mode.  I was about to surrender.  I once again checked the detailed notes of the firmware upgrade.  It says "Press and hold the Play button while connecting your player to your computer's USB port. Continue to hold the Play button for about ten seconds after connecting your player to your computer. Release the Play button when the Find New Hardware dialog box appears on the screen."  I followed this procedure. It works!! All the abnormalities have disappeared now. Note: The N200 doesn't need battery when it is connected to PC for firmware update or MP3 file transfer. The power is provided through the USB.  For prospective buyers: Stay away from N200 if you don't understand what I am talking about.  Not everyone knows how to update firmware. I like the MuVo design but the firmware was porous.  Creative has moved to "Zen Nano".

<Title>Strong recommend! Lots of fun!
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this little player! I use it almost everyday in the car listening to music or podcasts, using a cassette player adapter. I like how it uses AAA standard size batteries, rather than a built in battery I would have to recharge. Great for on the road, walking the dog, etc. I bought different headphones, though, because the included one kept popping out of my ears. It fits right in the palm of my hand - I was pleasantly surprised by how small it is. I had a problem with it not turning on, but that disappeared with a firmware update. I liked it so much I'm buying similar devices for Christmas presents. The only drawback is that you have to connect to computers using a cable. The models I'm buying for Christmas gifts are the TX version, which have a built-in USB hook-up - no cable required.

<Title>Firmware upgrade fixed my broken Muvo Micro N200
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After operating just fine for 8 months, it decided to shut itself down one day. After trying to turn it back on, even with new batteries, it would turn itself off after 3 seconds. I could connect it to my computer and transfer files, but I could not play any music. After searching the web for a solution, I stumbled across something that pointed me to the Creative website to install a new firmware upgrade. Then I also saw another Amazon customer suggest the same thing. Upgrading the firmware completely fixed the player. Although the steps are a little bit convoluted, stumbling through the Creative knowledge base's instructions did eventually fix the player. The N200 was once lost, but now am found.

<Title>PRODUCT PROBLEMS - READ THIS
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just like alot of the reviews posted for this product, I also had several problems with my player.  I had the product for about a month before the LCD screen began to bug out. Little black lines would runs across the screen.  Then, about a day after that, the screen went dead. I was able to hear the music, but unable to see anything.  Music would play, but I was unable to skip tracks. I had to shut the systerm down and then restart it.  I have yet to install the firmware, but will be doing it shortly.  Honestly, I know its expensive, but maybe try shelling out more money for an apple Ipod. . . .  If not, buy this product, but realize the hazards that come along with it.

<Content>This  is a very cute mp3 player that is easy to use and it's a great price.  However, I just wanted everyone to know that after having it for a few months it is completely broken. The volume controls won't work, and when I turn it on, it starts playing in the middle of one of the songs and after that song is over, it won't play anything else.  Plus, it won't shut off unless I take the battery out!

<Title>Worked great, then didn't work so great, Works great again
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like many of the previous reviewers I spent a lot of time researching MP3 players.  I wanted something that was small, had respectable sound quality, used AA/AAA battery(s), and used mature technology to limit malfunctions.  I chose the Creative product after reading many glowing reviews on this website as well as cnet.com.  I purchased the player about 8 months ago, and have been very pleased with it.  Good radio reception, good sound quality (except when the back light is on, but a few seconds of buzz is nothing to get worked up about), very small, impressive battery life (18 hours typically with 850mAh NiMH AAA) and intuitive controls really made me a believer in the product.  That is until about two weeks ago when the player began to malfunction.  I am not sure what transpired but the unit began to act up.  The radio function no longer worked, intermittently the unit would not play, and then it would not turn off (without removing the battery).  After two to three battery removals the unit would begin to limp along.      I spent some time on Creative's website researching, and I found that a firmware update was the only recourse.  It worked.  All problems were resolved, and the unit actually some improved functionality (higher volume levels, more intuitive control menu structure).  So my suggestion to anyone who has been having trouble with their unit(s) (muvo, zen, etc.) try updating the firmware.    I again am very happy with the player and glad I purchased it.  However, I am giving the unit (4) stars instead of (5), simply because of the lack of information on Creative's website for troubleshooting, and the fact that a consumer should not have to update/deal with something as complex as firmware.

<Title>After 8 months
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this N200 for about 8 months now and thought I share a few good and bad things.  The Good: I like the fact that it is very small and the battery life it pretty good.  However, recently I have noticed some things that I am displased with. The Bad: 1.  If left in the car where the temperature is 40 degree or cooler it doesn't play until it warms up.  2.  Recently it stopped playing MP3 format.  After formatting it as suggested it would play but when I turn it off and back on it stops playing.  The screen would show that it is playing but the timer doesn't change.  So now it only plays Audible format and that's the only reason why I'm still keeping it.  3.  The battery cover doesn't snap in anymore so the only thing holding it is the player's soft plastic case that it came with 4.  I wish I could change the setting to see the remaining time of what is being played.

<Content>I love this little player. It's the best one I have ever had. My only beef with it is that the voice recorder won't work and the belt clip is not wide enough to fit the belts that I wear. I don't really care about the recorder as I use the one on my cell phone, and it stays on my belt even though it's not wide enough to clip all the way around it. I'm thinking about getting another one just to put Podcast on.

Enclosed software package easier to use for file transfers than Microsoft Media. 5.  Surprisingly high quality ear buds. 6.  Unlike some MP3's, can play at a pretty high volume. 7.  Enclosed USB cable an unexpected plus! 8.  Fast transfer speed. 9.  Enclosed arm strap and holder clip work great.  Negatives: 1.  Enclosed manual doesn't tell you much about how all the menu options work. 2.  No slot for external memory card.  All in all an extremely handy device--you get quite a bit for your money!

<Title>It's tiny, bi-lingual language display, sounds great!
<Date>Thu Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just received my Creative 512 MB MuVo N200 package yesterday.  Opened it up, checked out the contents and made sure everything was there.  Surprisingly, the package included one fresh battery.  This was great since I had just bought some rechargeables that were still charging.    Out of a habit with all software, I went to Creative's website to find all updates.  I'm glad that the instruction book wasn't a thick one, it just came with a Quick Start guide.  I think they have the official instruction book on their website for you to download or on the CD.  I just didn't want to spend the time to look for it.  I put the cover on the MP3 player, which nicely fits together.  I plugged the USB cable that came with it to my computer and the MP3 player.  Automatically, the computer detected the MuVo as a removeable drive.  I went through my MP3 files, dragging and dropping, and picked the ones I wanted to listen to at the time.    My collection of MP3s are mainly 192kbps, nothing lower than 128kbps and probably a dozen songs recorded at 256kbps.  So, I was able to store approximately... oh I forget right now, definitely more than 60 songs but I doubt more than 100 songs stored.  I do remember not being able to store anymore at approximately 450-460MB... take into consideration of system files and that the file system is formatted with FAT (not the most efficient available).    It's amazing how many language you can choose from, I have tons of songs that are non-English.  I guess most MP3 players support multiple languages though... I don't see how this could NOT be an option for other MP3 players.    After downloading all the songs I wanted and could fit on the player, I went to the gym to work out.  The armband worked great, the sound quality was very good and accessing the buttons was convenient.    The setting has a neat function:  I switch from FM radio to music files every-now-and-then.  The player remembers the last function you access.  So if I am listening to FM radio and decide to avoid the commercial, I press the button and immediately presented with the MUSIC feature.  Vice versa.  I do not even need to look at what I'm pressing the button for... totally awesome.  The volume is very decent, I set it at halfway across the bar to reach a loud volume.    I did not believe in any MP3 players before, until recently, when I decided that I should get one while I worked out at the gym and bike ride.  Now I might not leave home without it.    Oh, I haven't used the recorder or mic... not sure if I am interested in that stuff, at least not right now.  I am interested in the "encoding" feature that MuVo offers.  I can convert CD music directly with my MuVo from what I understand.  Not sure if that will be efficient because it takes only a few seconds to convert a song on my computer.    Off subject:  I saw one of those 40GB IPODS at the gym... super thin looking and very nice!    This is definitely a keeper!

<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, so I'll admit it. I considered the ipod shuffle. But once I got past the snazzy ads and the allure, I realized that the ipod shuffle has no lcd screen, and is completely lacking in features.  That's when I found this little thing. I've had it a few days now, and I must say, I'm glad I looked at all my options. For the price, it's simply outstanding. The included features, like the microphone and the fm tuner, are a great addition. Here are a few pros and cons:  PROS: -size...this thing is tiny.  -cost...look around amazon. You'll see what I mean. -comes in a variety of colors -includes a nice assortment of accessories, including a frosted rubber case and an armband for running or working out -fm tuner and micophone are a nice touch. -the line-in recording is great....and the best part?...you can record directly off the radio.  CONS: -fm tuner is a little sketchy. It doesn't pick up stations real well.....but if i wanted a good fm tuner, I'd have bought a radio. -size...it's so small I'm afraid I'll lose it. -included headphones are great....if you have circus ears....but I've come to anticipate using different headphones anyway, so this was no big deal for me. -lcd is a little small.....but I'm more concerned with listening to music, rather than reading the display. -microphone isn't exactly high quality. But, once again, if I wanted a good mic, I'd have bought a digital recorder.  Note* When I first started using it, there was a faint buzzing sound whenever the backlight was on. Oddly, though, after about an hour of use, the buzzing stopped. Go figure.  Overall, this is a great player for those who don't need to store 20 gigs worth of music. Come to think of it, i don't actually know anyone who needs that much space anyway.

<Title>Logical controls
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Creative MuVo Micro N200 is what you want if you're interested in an MP3 player with logical controls.  (I tried the MuVo Sport and ended up giving it to a friend one of the reasons being that the controls were difficult to use and weren't particularly logical.)  I don't down load off the Internet so the MP3 capability wasn't important.  But I did want to record CDs to play while working out.  The software for uploading (or is it downloading?)CDs is also fairly logical.  Since I have only first generation USB on my laptop it takes a bit of time to make the transfer but it can be dealt with.  The sound is excellent and the battery life is better than expected.  I'm fairly sure that the iPod is a better player I'm not sure how.  It must be better though as it costs twice as much.

<Title>kudos, Creative... very nice small gadget!
<Date>Sat Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I read many reviews before I settle on this one... a few things I was looking for:  1. small size 2. AAA battery (I dislike the idea of buying $99/year Apple proprietary lithium batteries, and the very nice iAudio U2) 3. 512M+ storage, and priced reasonably 4. flash memory (I don't trust microdrives for workouts, and have no interest in multi-GB of space) 5. plenty of features (FM tuning, recording, mic/line-in recording, EQ, etc.) 6. good audio quality (high SNR, the cheap Sandisk failed to get a good review on that, though they have impressive upload speed) 7. shows up as a usb mass storage device (iRiver 700+ series are ruled out by this, I don't understand why they have to do this... due to DRM copyrights?  if you are like me, who hate to put crappy useless software on your Windows and have a Linux box, this is a must) 8. solid build and convenient controls 9. multi-lingual (Chinese/Japanese/Korean and many more)  So this Creative device stood up pretty well to the 9 criteria I had in mind... true, it doesn't have a one-piece anodized Al shell like iPod, but it does have a rather polished and scratch resistant surface, so I am not too concerned about that, though some of you might.    I just got this player this morning, so I haven't tested out all functions yet... but the controls are nice (though it takes a few clicks to get to some items, but it's more or less the case for players with minimized bottons) and intuitive (no manuals required at all, simple).  I upgraded the firmware right away (has to be done under Windows), fast and easy.  A few other minor things I like, good translucent rubber carrier (you don't have to take it out at any time), comes with armband, line-in and usb cable.  To be fair, I will list a few things I personally think needs to be improved (and that's why I gave it a 4 star rating):  1. limited recording format and quality choices (sometimes wav only, etc... compared to even the old iriver I bought for my gf before, it falls short here)  2. the oem earbuds are mediocre, look kind of cool, but sounded flat to my ears.  I don't have great ears, but I can tell my sennhaiser hd457 headphone sounds much better, even my $15 sennhaiser mx500 earbuds are better, so I swapped those on... anyway, many online reviews gave good words to creative sound quality, but i have a feeling that my gf's iriver 190 sounded slightly better with similar earpieces... well hell, I have no objective proofs, and with sennhaiser 457 it sounds more than good enough for me (imagine the Sandisk ones with poor evaluation on audio quality... and they are a lot bulkier too)  3. output power is slightly too low, enough loud though, and enough to power low impedance headphones.  4. THIS IS BAD, the hiss that occurs when you press control buttons, and in fact it's due to the BACKLIGHT!  right now, I am switching off the backlights... but in darkness, you will have to use it i guess.  and i think it's a circuit design issue... a hardware interference, no hope to fix in firmwares I believe.  but, it's not the end of the world, I can live with a 3 second 10-20dB hiss whenever the light is up :)  Overall speaking, it's great, and I am satisfied.  Well, I have never posted a review that long before... but I wasn't able to find many detailed and useful reviews on MP3 players while I was looking around... so I hope this can be of help to some of you.

<Title>from a slightly different perspective...
<Date>Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Disclaimer:  I'm a Mac user.  I own a 40GB iPod and I'm perfectly happy with it... it has a wonderful interface that, IMHO, has not been touched by anything else out there.  Why, then, did I buy the MuVo Micro N200?  Well, I'm a musician.  My band has been looking for an easy way to record our practices, and every so often- always when I least expect it- a melody will come to me that I'll want to remember but if I don't have a recorder handy, I'll inevitably forget it after a few minutes.  Plus I'm a computer programmer / web developer, so I always like having some storage on me.  The N200 looks awesome on paper.  It has a stereo line input with direct to mp3 encoding- great! I can plug in a Sony stereo mic that I own, stick it in the middle of our practice space, and record all our practices.  It takes voice memos.  And it functions as a portable storage device.  Its mp3 playing and FM radio capabilities, to me, are just nice perks.  I just got the N200 last night and, while it does everything as advertised, there are a few quirks about it that I hadn't read about anywhere that may have changed my opinion before I had bought it.  First of all, everyone has talked about the buzzing caused by the backlight.  It is indeed there and it is so annoying that I've turned the backlight off entirely.  Someone mentioned that the firmware update would fix it, but Creative only has a firmware updater for Windows OSes.  So Mac users- if you plan on updating the firmware for your N200, make sure you have a friend with a PC.  I have a PC at work so I was able to install the latest firmware update (1.12.01) but that did NOT fix the backlight buzzing problem.  Bah.  As for the recording capabilities... voice memos work great, although you do have to navigate through the menu system to get to the voice memo part-- it would be nice if there was a dedicated button for this feature.  I haven't been able to test the line-in capabilities much, however, because for whatever reason Creative opted to put a mini headphone jack-- I believe it's 2.5mm, as opposed to the standard headphone 3.5mm-- for its line-in jack.  (The headphone jack is the standard 3.5mm one.)  They supply you with a 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable but, well, that's not really what I wanted.  I'm going to have to pick up an adapter to plug my external mic in.  The direct-to-mp3 recording sounds great but maxes out at 160 kbps... definitely good enough for band practice and maybe some live bootlegs, but audiophiles will most likely want to look elsewhere.  And when you're recording there are no level meters, so be very careful about overloading or your recording will be ruined.  Also, while the iPod Shuffle and a few other of the flash based mp3 players have a built-in USB jack, the N200 uses one of those really small USB jacks that you're likely to find on a digital camera.  I believe it's called a 4-pin type B USB jack, but I may be wrong.  This means that if I want to lug files from one computer to another, I have to bring the 3' cable with me too.  I'm looking for a smaller replacement cable or ideally a little dongle to directly connect the N200 to a USB port.  I'm going to keep my N200 as it does provide a wealth of features I need and it was very reasonably priced... even if it doesn't have the polished Apple interface I'm used to.  For reference, if you happen to be a VW / Audi owner, it's only slightly bigger than a VW / Audi key.  I have my N200 on my keychain and plan on taking it with me wherever I go.  If you want just an mp3 player for workouts, I'd say get an iPod shuffle.  But this thing's got a bunch of features at a size and price point that is pretty good.  I know I'm probably not the target demographic for this product, and I didn't come here to bash Creative- I just wanted to let people know about some of the lesser-discussed features of the N200.  Hope this helps.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player purchase. I listened to all the postive reviews on Amazon before deciding on the right player for me. I must say you guys were right. What an awesome little device. I have used the FM radio, excellent reception, even channels I can't normally get in the building I work in. I have used the voice recorder, really cool! The software is kind of difficult at first but I figured it out enough to get music into my player. I am using my own wrap around headphones though, because I like those better when I'm working out. Sound is great. I took it to work to show everyone and now all my co-workers want one too. The only problem I had was choosing a color! Great buy!

<Title>TWO died in three weeks.
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased one for myself, one for my husband for Father's Day. They started out GREAT, easy to use, great sound quality, long battery life.  Within two weeks, his stopped running. He thought it was the belt clip rubbing on it, but no. He tried several different batteries, that wasn't the problem. Then MINE started to die. Again, not the batteries. Whenever I turn it on, it lights up, acts like it's about to start playing something, then turns itself off. One, maybe. But both of them? I don't trust this product anymore.

<Title>Good value, some cons
<Date>Sun Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player has a lot of pros. It's light, has plently of features, FM radio, good battery life, great for travel or workout and arguably it's the best value for that price.   But some things are just annoying. One is headphones. They are just bad. Too bulky, bad quality. It needs a USB cable. You can't just plug it in and download songs. Not a big deal for me since I always download songs from the same computer anyway. Also, this thing is quite fragile. My 6 year old daughter broke the phone connector in a couple days.  I had to get it replaced, but I still ordered the same model because I believe if you handle it gently and get some decent phones, this is a great player.

<Date>Sun Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Stopped working? Freezing? Not turning on? TRY THIS TO FIX IT!!  Had this for 3 weeks, then stopped working. Returned it and replacement also stopped working after 2 weeks.  It either turned off while playing a song, turn itself off after a couple seconds, or wouldn't turn on at all.  Perplexed, I looked in the amazon reviews, and a couple reviews suggested updating the FIRMWARE. I did this, and now it WORKS PERFECTLY AGAIN!!  Here's how to update your firmware. 1)go to http://us.creative.com/support/downloads/ and pick the correct mp3 device (mp3-->muvo-->micro), then pick your Operating System, and then Firmware.  2)there's two firmware upgrades. I only upgraded the older firmware (1.12.01 from Feb 24, 2005)--Creative MuVo Micro N200 Audible Firmware Upgrade 1.12.01. I didn't upgrade the 1.15.01  3)if this doesn't fix it, you can search the forums http://forums.creative.com/creativelabs/board?board.id=dap   thanks!

<Date>Tue Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had another Creative mp3 player (MuVo Nomad 64MB) but that one was small in storage. I ordered this one and I just love it. All the information is available in the cd that comes with the player and I never had any problems so far. I'm using it almost daily, have it for about four weeks and all my friends are so impressed with the sound of it. You need a small mp3 player that you wish not to spend too much money, please get the Creative muVo N200 and you'll be very happy indeed.  Need to mention here, I was checking the prices of this player on different others sites, inluding the Creative one and I found that Amazon was way to cheaper tham the other places.

<Title>Item is worthless
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my player four about 4 months as a gift. i thought it was the greatest little gadget i owned. But two weeks ago it started acting up. At first, it would shut off by itself. Then it began making this annoying noise and not playing the music. The music would probably come on (if it felt like it) if i kept shutting it on and off several times. now it does not come on at all. absolutely no power- and no it isn't the battery. the item was great while it lasted (which wasn't very long) but it was not worth it.

<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking for a small, lightweight, mp3 player that did not use a microdrive but rather had flash memory.  After reviewing several players, I decided on the Muvo.  I couldn't be happier.  It is TINY, light, and has ample sound for working out or running.  For the money I don't think you can beat it and it isn't proprietary like the iPud!  Just wish I would have spent the extra $20 for the 1Gig model.  Poor decision on my part.

<Title>Sweet...close to perfect.
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Those of us paying tuition really don't usually have money to throw around at non-essentials, like an expensive hard drive based mp3 player that houses our entire music collection. As cool as that would be, we're talking about shelling out (at the very least, for a used model) between $200 & $300. So what can we do? Consider the Creative MuVo Mircro N200...starting at just $65. And it does so much more than just play your music.  Think about a USB flash drive that will not only allow you to carry your assignments and important documents around with you, but will also play any mp3 or wma song stored on it. In addition, listen to FM radio, record from the radio, and store hours of lectures and voice using the built in mic. Oh yeah, you'll do all that for under $70. The 256 MB (approx. 18 hours of voice recording time or 4.5 hours of music) model sells at Amazon.Com for $65. If you have the extra cash, upgrade to the 512 MB or 1GB model. This reviewer bought the 512 MB version at Amazon.Com for $109 only to discover the 1GB model at the highly rated B & H Photo Video online store (bhphotovideo.com) for $104.95 a few days later. Yes, I'm kicking myself.  Here's the nitty gritty.  Aesthetics/Usability: Beautiful device. It's stylish, yet inconspicuous. Only three buttons and a rocker switch make it incredibly easy to use disconnected from your computer, and the fact that it requires no special software to load files makes it as simple as using a traditional USB flash drive. 5/5 stars in that department.  Features: This device is jam packed. Along with what has been previously mentioned, this Mp3 player can also record from any other audio source via a line in jack directly to mp3 format. This opens up the possibility of using an external microphone for voice recordings, etc. Four onboard EQ presets (Rock, Jazz, Classical, and Pop) as well as the ability to create custom 5 band EQ configurations give fantastic sound quality. Unfortunately, there is no way to adjust the recording quality when using the built in mic, which only allows for mediocre recordings. 4.75/5 stars  Technical Specs: The entire unit is virtually weightless at 0.8 ounces and is only 2.6 inches by 1.3 inches, with depth of only one half inch. This thing will go anywhere you want it to. When the backlight is engaged, there is faint but slightly noticeable sound that can be distracting. Creative says this can be corrected via a firmware update available at creative.com. Battery life is at least 15 hours on one AAA size battery. 4.75/5 stars  Included Accessories: An armband, stereo headphones, optional music management software, one AAA battery, a line in cable, a USB cable, and a very cool molded rubber carrying case with a belt clip are all included in the box. This is pretty much an unparalleled accessory package. 5/5 stars  Final Rating: After taking into account aesthetics, usability, features, technical specifications, and the accessories included with the product, it has been given a final average rating of 4.88 out of 5 stars. Excellent.

<Title>Best on the Market for this Segment!
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For a flash player, you could not pick anything better. Others here give great reviews so I will be brief. I have bought 4-5 flash players and this is by far the best by a long shot!  I love being able to upload files from any computer without  software and being able to rip files from anyone else's mp3 player.   FM works great in the city and country and the recorder is above average. It works much better with a Radio shcakc microphone.   The on and only drawback I can find is that there is no expandable  memory. That said WMA files are now packing more in less space and their research team announce a new folding method that should decrease a fulls size file by 1/2 of todays standard. That means a 512 is now 712 and by next year it should be a 1.5Gb all because Windows Media files have progressed.   I have bought one for me and loved it. I bought 3 more for the wife and birthdays for family. Grandmas could make this thing work! Namaste!

<Title>design flaws, poor service, good sound & features
<Date>Fri Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have the 1gb version of this unit, and I think it is a really great mp3 player. I am completely pleased with the sound and functions.  The problem I have with it is shoddy engineering, and, poor customer service.  CONSTRUCTION My player fell about 1 foot on to a wood floor. The batter cover shattered. It was not so far a drop to be broken, plus the cord helped slow the drop.   Upon inspection you will see that the tang on the battery cover is VERY flimsy, and WILL break just with normal use, in time.   I got a replacement and have been VERY careful with it, even opening the thing seems to threaten the tang to break. The over is also made from low-grad plastic that will easily break.  SERVICE I currently live in Singapore, where Creative is based. I bought the player from a local big-name electronics chain.  When I inquired about how to go about getting a replacement cover, Creative refused to send it to me direct or even to the place I bought it. And of course although the unit was only 2 weeks old, I had to pay for the new cover.  SO...I had to take half a day off work, go to their service center which is way across the island, and wait over an hour, JUST TO PICK UP A NEW BATTERY COVER.  MORONIC CUSTOMER SERIVCE After the ordeal, I mentioned my experience to them in the interest of providing useful customer feedback, and hopefully, better product design going forward. I am in the Customer Service business and know how valuable this is to companies. The replies I got back were moronic at best, and typically Singaporean (i.e. not acknowledging fault, finding excuses around that) at worst.   (If anyone wants to see that correspondence, which took over 4 emails to get nowhere, contact me and I will send it to you)  I simply tried to tell them that the design was damage-prone, and that the means of getting a replacement was not very customer-focused, whereas their competitor's is. They did not seem to care.  I have no idea what to expect if something else goes wrong with the thing.  MORAL If you're ok to eventually face the same experiences, it's a great unit. If not, buy an iPod, I know I will next time. And yes I know about that battery issue.

<Date>Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: very light and small, great for active use like running, armband stays on really well, cool color (orange)  Cons: Earbuds are almost completely useless.  They're not ergonomic at all, so they don't fit the ear well.  Even sitting with them on doesn't work well.  I think they're too big and generic.  I had to use my old earphones.  The software took some time to figure out and there is no place in the directions that tell you what a lot of the symbols on the screen mean.  I gave this 3 stars because the earbuds are an important component to the system.  If you can't hear the music well, then you've lost a huge portion of the value.

I have an orange one. +It's very durable. I've dropped it so many times and it still works properly +I love the LED light +Low price  -No playlist. It's hard to scroll through all the songs. You get used to it after a while, though. -It scratches very easily and the case doesn't fit on that well -The earphones hurt your ears. It's better if you take the gray cover off -The earphones are horrible quality. They give good sound, but mine lasted only about 2 months. The wiring is so delicate. They've broken in 2 different place and I didn't swing them around or anything -It sometimes doesn't fill up completely. I checked it and it was 80% and still told me I couldn't add anymore songss -I hate how it can't store that many songs -If I bang it lightly on the table or something, it'll just shut down and when I turn it back on, it is on the song I listened to the time before I turned it on and bumped it.  It's a great buy if you don't want to put much music on it or want something compact, but if you're a huge music fan, I don't recommend this.

The FM recorder is probably my favorite thing! You can record any songs you hear on the radio! Its holding togethor great and i usuallt keep it in the plastic case that came with it. My only gripe is wonderin what idiot designed the battery cover? if you keep it in the case and are careful its not a problem but the battery cover is really flimsy.

<Content>I have been using a NEX2 CF card player for the last several years.  It is simplistic and bulky, so I choose the muvo for its size and features.   pros:   -very small, even smaller than I thought from the photos online -very lightweight -useful included software for folder management and converting your files back and forth from mp3 to wma and you select the bitrate.  for those of you still using mp3 on your player, like i was, WMA makes files much smaller and the software included in this player has a setting you can select so that all files are converted to WMA before being loaded on the muvo.  very useful. -can create, name, rename, delete folders with ease -I think the sound quality is great -I got the firmware update immediately(which was very easy)there is no static when the backlight is on. -fm radio works great. -the armband and protective case are quality and work great  cons: -I wish it had a sleep function -

<Title>very solid litte player
<Date>Mon May 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Alright, look...I don't go the gym.  I do not jog.  I do not have a small collection of music or just a few favorite songs.  I'm an all-out music head, with thousands of songs on my computer and thousands more on vinyl and tape and small heads made of wax.    So then, why did I choose a 512 MB flash player?  1. Reliablility.  I can chuck this thing at one of my iPod-owning friends and not damage it, yet the minute their clunky white internal hard drive machine hits my skull they're screwed.    2. Freedom. I don't listen to 10,000 songs at a time.  most I've ever pulled off is someting around 800, and even then it sounds messy, what with all the different styles and keys and noises on top of each other, it's just a big schism. With this, I can throw on a few albums I'm digging at the moment and keep a base of about 30 of my general favorites and be happy. Get tired of the album or song, I just come home and delets it and throw a new one on with Windows Explorer.  Easy.  3. Cost.  Though for $100+ it is not proportionately a good value compared to an iPod at $300, it's still cheaper, and if you wait for the price to drop more, you'll probably be able to score this for $90 in a few months.  Despite the lack of value, it still is cheap.   You can actually group songs the way you like them on here.  Just rip the files on with Windows Media Player or the included software (which isn't THAT bad) as WMAs (so you can fit more).  Then find the folder on your computer and go in and number each song: 01, 02, 03...10, 11, etc. (don't just put the first songs as "1", then you'll be hearing songs 1 and 10 next to each other). This numbering may seem like a pain, but so is scrolling through every song just to find "Ziggy Stardust" or whatever other song you can think of that starts with a Z.  After you have all your tunes numbered up in the album order or the way you like them, go up one step and copy/send the entire folder to the MuVo.  Then you can enjoy song after song of sequential linear enjoyment.  Some bad things-the earbuds are, in fact, larger than the average human skull. However, these can be replaced or you can let them sit in your ears and get used to it.  I'm on the second option now since I spent most of my remaining funds on my MuVo.  Also, the little knobby for the belt clip scratches the back of the player when removing it from its rubber case.  Oh dear.  Besides those two little drawbacks, this is a fine machine.  It's tiny, pretty cheap, has the more or less solid reliability of a flash player, and comes in many colors to entertaainf you for decades on end.  No, music freaks, you don't need some big, expensive, fragile monster MP3 player...just some cash and some patience for one of these.

<Title>Great Product, and they honored the instant rebate
<Date>Tue May 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I expected this device to fall apart after reading the reviews here, but I've had it for several months, and so far so good. Just a few things to add to the comprehensive reviews already written.   - If you're just buying something to grab downloads from your pc, I think the N200 is a winner in every way. Use media player and playlists to sync.  - Yes, there's a LINE-IN jack, but it's smaller than the standard 1/8" miniplug. So, if you're planning on doing more recording than downloading, you might want to go with minidisc or a different mp3 unit. (The N200 does come with a 1/8"-to-tiny cable, so you can record from another portable to the N200. But, if you want to record from a full-sized deck, you'll need some adapters).  - I often let it run (on FM or mp3) all night long, and while this depletes the battery very quickly, the device has been sturdy enough to survive me rolling over it and sleeping on top of it, as well as dropping it off the side of the bed.  - Recording from FM: You cannot just push a record button, because there isn't one. If you're listening to FM and you suddenly want to record, you're going to miss some audio while you scroll to a selection called "FM recording." Still, this unit is very convenient for on-the-go taping.  - Don't bother to use the microphone. Poor quality sound.  - Unlike Lexar, Creative actually honored the listed rebate. I received my $20 rebate check well within the promised time period.

<Title>really cool little gadget
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have no previous experience with MP3 players, but I didn't like bringing a cd player and a stack of cds when I take plane or car trips.  I wasn't willing to spend the big bucks for one either.  So I did some research, asked my tech guy at work, and pretty much everything I read or heard about this player was positive.  I've had it for less than a week now, and it's great. It's easy to use, and really, really tiny.  The sound is great.  I read reviews saying there's a buzz when the backlight is on, but I can't hear it.  I have about 100 songs stored on it, and I think there's room for about 100 more.  The scroll bar took a bit to get the hang of, but I have it figured out now.  It's just crazy that anything so little has so many features.  If my ears were sensitive enough for me to care, I could customize the equalizer.  It's even possible to change it from a right to a left-handed operation.  I'm very glad I bought this.

<Content>I won't ever buy a creative MP3 player again.  I had a MuVo NX for just over a year and then it stopped working.  I figured it had to something to do with the fact that it was made of two parts and I had dropped it a few times so I tried again, I bought the MuVo N200.  Well after 2 months it's stopped working.  I hit the power button, the LCD lights up a little but nothing else.  The computer will not even recognize it when I plug it into the USB port any longer.  Sound and operation was great till it just up and quit.  Next time I buy an MP3 player I'm going to try to find one that is not disposable.

It is completely out of the way at the gym which is what I intended, but I have large hands, and it is a little (no pun intended) awkward for me to handle. The way the play lists are alphabetized is a little bit of a pain too. Seeing as how this is my first mP3 player though, I don't have much to complain about. This thing kicks butt. I play it at work through a set of desktop speakers and it goes for 8 hours. The battery life is awesome too. Unlike an iPod, which, once the battery dies completely, is useless, this runs on one AAA battery and lasts for a full 15 hours. Overall this player is really great. And the accessories you get with it are awesome. Most others you have to buy an armband or slipcover seperately.

<Title>terrible earbuds
<Date>Wed Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The player is great and a good value--but the earbuds are AWFUL.  Too big and not shaped at all for comfort.  They hurt and don't stay in.  I bought this to use while walking and running and have to buy another set of headphones or earbuds.  I am disappointed in the ones included with this set--I have seen better ones come with cheap brands.

<Title>6 month review
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well half a year, about time things should start breaking.  Well the MuVo N200 was a great little MP3 player when I first got it.  My only complaint was that the stock ear buds didn't work that well, and they were a little big. So I got new Sennheiser ear buds to use on my regular jog.  So 6 months roll by and now the player isn't so perfect anymore.  I guess I have been a little rough on it. I mean I go jogging with it every other day so I suppose some of my strides might have jolted it a little in the wrong direction.  Other than that I really haven't done anything odd to it besides put in rechargable batteries instead of standard alkaline.   I'll give you a run down of what still works fine. *Turn's on, pauses, and plays, I'd be kind of mad if it didn't *Screen & Backlight still work well *Navigation knob thing, still works just like it has always *Dedicated Volume buttons yea these definitly work. *Navigation system still the same as always *USB connection still registers with the computer *Radio still sounds good *Voice recorder it really wasn't that great to start out with but it's pretty much the same. *It's still portable, it's not like it grew an arm and a leg. *Sound quality still great!  Now then let's move on to what doesn't work so well anymore: *Battery door hatch thing.  It really doesn't snap back into place anymore.  I keep it in place with a small piece of black duct tape (good stuff). No big deal. *Battery Life went down the pooper for some reason, I have no idea. I'm not sure if it's completely turning off anymore, so that might be why my batteries suddenly only last a couple hours before dying.  Alkaline batteries don't fare too much better, so it's not from the rechargable batteries decaying. *On/Play/Stop Button um yea, I'm not sure if it's the button or something inside the player but when I turn it off by holding the "On" button the player freezes, it eventually turns off though after like at least 15 minutes (I accually haven't taken the time to time it, however.) Usually I just loosen the duct tape on the battery door and pop the battery out to turn my N200 off.  The other day I decided to let the automatic shut-off thing turn the thing off and it didn't do it like it used to, like when I turned it on it didn't start at the song which I stopped at, which was wierd. *Some dust got under the faceplate of the LCD no big deal, none were big enough got in to obstruct by view of the LCD. *Makes a buzzing noise when the backlight is on. No big deal, you can bearly notice it when music is playing. *When you drop it (from a hieght of like 6 inches or more), it turns off. Not a big deal, but just an FYI.  Besides those problems which I have thoroughly described this MP3 player is fine.   Also it may be of note that the new Creative MuVo Nano Plus is the N200 with a new name.  I think the same problems will apply.  I can only wonder what the next 6 months will bring.

<Title>breaks easily... but can be put back together in a snap

<Content>1.   ok... so im sure kids (and teens) handle mp3 players a little bit rougher than adults, but eventually every mp3 player will be dropped. being kids we tend to drop ours a little be more often. the first coupld times i dropped it nothing happened, but creative has a feature that if the mp3 player falls at to fast of a speed it will auto shut off to protect the electronics. a handy feature. but after a while of accidental drops the top area by the battery pack started splitting   and a little super glue put it back together and working (if you know you may be a little klutzie with this object USE THE CASE AT ALL TIMES... unfortunatly mine ripped. i wish creative made the cases so you could buy new ones as needed.) but a few more drops including one onto linolium split my mp3 player totaly in half the two parts of the shell both sets of buttons the usb cover and electronic insides al came apart.i taped it and it still works. so i guess the outside of the mp3 player may not be so harty, but the inside stands up even to the most klutzie of teens. if you dont like the rubber case the micro comes with i suggest getting some other sort of case, my fix was an ipod case that wasnt form fitting, these can be purchased at amazon, target, walmart and many electronic stores. juat get a case  2.  you NEED to get better head phones. they stink. period. the ound is terrible, they hurt, and the tangle instantly. not to mention the ripping of the rubber outside. my fix was ipod head phones. but almost anything will be better.
