<Title>Saves your spot!

<Content>Better than I expected.  If you want a dream jukebox, get something more expensive, but I use this for a classroom audiobook player.  It is simple for kids to operate, supports folders (in case you have one folder for each ripped CD), and keeps your spot when you turn it off. Drag and drop files from your desktop.  It does not have a shuffle or hold for people listening to music on the go.  While playing, a little red light blinks on and off at a slow tempo.  Might be annoying to some, but not a big deal to me.

<Title>Wonderful

<Content>I currently have two of these in my house.  My young daughters boh have one.  We had previously tried the whole portable cd player thing especially after they marketed them with Dora and Mickey and the like.  Well that was just too complicated for them and the cds were always getting scratched and they always needed the fingerprints cleaned off of them.  Anyhow...I bought a mp3 player for a trip I was going on and after that experience I was hooked.  When the one of my girls cd player actually broke and she needed a new one I decided to talk to my husband about mp3 players.  We bought this one for less then replacing her cd player with a princess or mickey cd player and there is none of the hassle.  My girls are fairly young and I bought one for both of them.  They can operate them, they are easier for them to hold and carry around with them, easy for trips and hold all the music they had on cd when I bought it for them.  I love these and am now thinking of picking one up for my little sister.

<Content>Loading songs onto the player was hit and miss.  After using my player for two weeks, it developed a short of sorts, where turning it on and off was time-consuming.  Also, what I thought was a short in my earphones turned out to be a problem with the player.  Now, it won't load songs at all.  I gotta check the warranty on this thing.
