<Title>pretty good mp3 player...but it doesnt last too long
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i've had this mp3 player for about 2 years now and it's been pretty good. Well it was for about a year anyway. After that the buttons pretty much stopped working. At first, it was just one and then gradually they all stopped working. It really sucks because this is a good mp3 player and it holds all my music but now i cant use it because the buttons dont work. Besides the buttons not working, it also doesnt hold a charge for very long. It lasts for about 4 hours until it dies. If you want a mp3 player that lasts long and is durable then you should probably keep looking because this definitly doesnt. But it was good while it lasted =/

<Title>One of the worst MP3 players ever made
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm a big techno-geek, but this is been one of the most awkward, horrible experiences I've had trying to get this device to do the simplist things. The application to get your MP3s on this is not user friendly, not intuitive. It's like it's strived to be so different from the ipod that it took out all of the good and left the bad. The player doesn't even register half the time with my computer. It takes a good half hour of messing around with the device and the settings to get it to work. I plug in the Ipod and it takes maybe 30 seconds. 1 minute tops.  Save your money. Save your aggravation. Get something, anything else.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Thu Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent player for those of you who dont like to use itunes. The hard drive went out on my first player, so i had to get a replacement, but the replacement works fine. The sound quality is better than my old ipod mini, the battery lasts longer than my ipod mini, and it plays wma. Also it works great with windows media player and my yahoo subscription, which is a big plus for me.

<Title>Who needs an iPod.....
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Really happy with the Zen Micro.  I am using it with Napster To Go and have am thrilled.  The playback sound is great (with smart volume on) and it looks cool.    A few gripes: - As a previous reviewer stated, the battery life was short at first, but after a couple full discharges - I'm getting at least 10 hours of music per charge. - The touchpad is WAY TOO SENSITIVE!  I have to lock it when I do not want to use the controls (and its on low sensitivity). - No accessories.  I can't find a holster/clip for this thing for use when exercising.  You'd think there would be tons out there....go figure. - Creative Media software is marginal. - it's the same toilet-white as an iPod on the sides and back.  All things being equal, I'd buy it again.

<Title>Zen MP3 player sounds great
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm new to MP3 players so I'm still working out how to transfer and arrage the files.  I say "files" rather than music because I'm more interested in recorded books and podcasts than music. Music does sound GREAT using the earphones that came with it - and the books sound great, too, but it's still a trial and error process getting all tracks of all discs of a book in order.  That will take a little more practice on my part.  The touchpad also took a little getting used to, but I was able to master it in a day or two. I was not happy when I realized that the only way provided to charge it was by hooking it up to the computer USB port.  That means you have to take your computer on the road with you.  No wall outlet or auto adapter was provided. All in all I'm pleased with this purchase - and I suspect I'll like it better after I've had some time to figure out how to arrange the files or playlists.

<Title>Best Value in the Land of Un-iPOD
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro is near perfect.    I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.    I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.  It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.  It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.  It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.    All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.  So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.  The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.    It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... charm.  When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.    It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!  Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.    My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.  It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.  over and over again.  But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.  I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   The accesories that come with the player are great.  White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.  Also all the required cables and what not.  To me, currently at $218, this player is a best in class.  It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.    Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.    Pick your favorite color and buy it.

<Title>good so far
<Date>Sat Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for a little more than 4 hrs and from what i can see so far, it has alot of great things about it. At first i was like i dont know if i can get used to the touch pad and i eventually did. I plugged it in and after a fairly long install and a restart, i started loading songs onto it using the nice media organizer program. For the people that want to know how big it is, it fits very nicely into a standard pack of altoids. Or dimensions 3in. x 2in. x 3/4in. sorry metric people. One thing i must mention is the great sound quality. Before this player, i bought the Samsung blue square looking one, 512mb and i was not impressed so far as sound and navagation. Speaking of navigation, the buttons are layed out very nice. I dont use the drop down menu button very much. The menus all are easy to navigate. The radio is decent, and the recorder is O.K. also.   PROS  +STYLE +TOUCH PAD +AUDIO +GOOD EARBUDS +REMOVABLE BATTERY +MORE SPACE THAN IPODMINI +FITS EASILY IN HAND +ENTERTAINING BLUE GLOW  CONS -SOFTWARE COULD BE BETTER -HARD DRIVE BASED (POTENTIAL PROBLEMS?)  All in all, if you are looking for a good player, but dont want a mini then get the ZEN MICRO

<Title>IPOD Killer
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is awesome. I have nothing bad to say about it. The software is extremely easy to use. The only problem I have is trying to navigate the menu in the car (which I shouldn't be doing anyway) and really isn't the players fault I guess. One other thing is it only has a 3 bar battery monitor so when one bar is left you could have 10 mins or up to 8 hrs. Other than that though it is perfect. After using my brother's IPOD for a month prior to getting this, the Micro is preferable in many ways (most important to me is ease of use and it is considerably smaller).

<Title>Average mp3 player and don't buy to use with Napster to go!
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Do not use with Napster to go!!!! The firmware upgrade needed to be compatible with napster to go is only in beta form and last I checked has not been updated by Creative Labs (what's up with that!?!) It makes the zen micro freeze up in the middle of songs for no reason, it loses lincenses needed to play songs you have downloaded (and even purchased), then it freezes completly and the reset button and removing the battery do nothing. After that it is just an expensive and pretty paper weight.      Other then that if you keep the firmware it came with it's a pretty cool mp3 player. It's small, visually atractive, has a FM tuner, and ok sound qaulity. However, it's not very loud at it's highest volume.      I've read a lot about the sound qaulity being so great, but I disagree. It's not bad sound qaulity, it's not good either. Just average and acceptable. And better headphones only minimally help the sound qaulity, but I don't think many people will pay more for their headphones or earbuds then they paid for their mp3 player (but you should because they are worth it!!)If you want sound qaulity go for an Iriver h320 or a Cowon X5 or experiment for yourself.      Also, if this review darkened your dream of using the zen micro with napster to go, don't worry, the Iriver H320 is compatible (and superior!)     Oh and one last thing, you can not customize the equallizer settings, they are all preset, which sucks!    Well I hope that this has been a helpful review.

<Title>.....AWESOME PRODUCT.....
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>NOTE: this review is for the 5gb player. I wrote this lengthy review for that model, and it didn't show up and I can't re-submit it now. DARN thing! All the specs should be the same though.  I've been behind the times using the same portable CD player for the last 6 or 7 years... so this was really a BIG step up for me. Hopefully this review will be helpful if you have never owned an mp3 player before.... I have no idea how this compares to the ipod, but here is a list of the lesser known features of the zen micro:  PROS  +++ It tells you the number of tracks, albums & playlists uploaded. Total Mb & Mb remaining. +++ FM radio. +++ Removable battery & micro hard disc. +++ If you're halfway through a song (or paused) & you shut it down (or it shuts down after being inactive for a while, IT RESUMES WHERE IT LEFT OFF in the middle of a song when your turn it back on again!! :-) +++ You can change the idle shutdown time, backlight time, contrast, touchpad sensitivity, language (there are 15 languages installed!!) +++ sleep timer +++ You can personalise (configure) menus, much like with mobile phones. +++ PLAY MODES: normal, repeat track, repeat all, shuffle, shuffle repeat & track once. +++ You can find songs by albums, artists, genre, playlist +++ DJ menu: album of the day, random play all, most popular & rarely heard tracks. +++ There are 10 bookmarks, which I have absolutely no idea how to use, but it must be put onto this list anyway. ;-) +++ 12/24hr time, alarm, calendar, date (several date formats and you can even choose between the following separators: space, dot, dash, slash) +++ Variable microphone sensitivity. +++ Organiser; tasks + contact lists. (synchronised with creative sync manager) +++ Smart volume + Equaliser (numerous modes: Off, custom, acoustic, classical, disco, jazz, new age, pop, rock, or vocal) +++ master reset.    :-0 +++ track name, title & artist on LCD display.+ battery indication, and various other on-screen icons while a song is playing, such as EQ & repeat modes. +++ Gives the length of a song as a bar graph so you can tell the progress of the song... +++ A lot of stuff in the box: remote control, belt clip & cradle, pouch, usb cable, charger, earphones, software (easy enough to figure out)..... +++ Last but not least: a cool blue glow + white backlit screen!!! +++ There ISN'T a one second delay between playing each song. +++ My zen micro hasn't crashed on me yet (and I have been sucessful in crashing every computer product known to man, eg: my Ericsson T39m phone several times!)  CONS: --- The touch pad can be annoying sometimes. So you either have to hold it by the edges when playing a song or put it on hold mode, otherwise your palm will set off a whole bunch of menus.  It's okay when you're using it though.   --- You can't hear any music while fast-forwarding through a song. I am used to being able to go by ear while doing this, but you can't do that with this thing. Maybe a future firmware upgrade will fix this issue? Please??! Creative???!!  --- I walked all around sydney and couldn't find this in *ANY* shop. So I had to buy it online. All the photos of the zen on the 'net are front on.... and I didn't realise until I opened the box that the back & sides of the zen micro were coloured WHITE!!! ARRRRGHHHH! I hate white! Aaaahhh well, I suppose I'll get used to it soon enough.  --- I find the lowest volume setting isn't all that low. I can still hear songs well in a fairly quiet room during the daytime. At 3:00am I think this might be just a tad louder than I would have liked. [This is with panasonic earbuds though]  --- You have to first aportion (partition) the HDD to be used as an extrenal flash drive. Available sizes are: 128, 256, 512Mb, 1, 2Gb. You should be able to just use whatever is available. This isn't a big problem though.  --- Earbuds are too thick for my ears. Wearing them is like stuffing a peanut lengthwise in your ear. It pulls your earlobes out.  --- There is practically zero information (on how to use the menus) in the instruction manual.

<Title>Nice is an understatement
<Date>Sun May 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the 4GB version of this  player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.   The Look & Feel:  I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing. The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). It feels tiny in the hand without it. The stand that comes with it is very usefult to prop it up on the desk. The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot. The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.  The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   Reliability & Build   I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. The hardcase they give with it must work well.  It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.   Sound   I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.   Utility  Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book. The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.   Software  The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it does the job well. Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.   There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.  Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.

<Title>Why I Decided to Buy A Zen Micro Instead of An iPOD
<Date>Wed May 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using the Zen Micro 6GB for about 3 weeks now. I spent some time before the purchase with a ZM and an equivalent iPOD. I chose the ZM for a number of reasons. Both are fine players, but here is what sent me to the ZM.  Design ZM is sturdy, with an easy to read screen. Similar case volume to IP but thicker and shorter so feels more compact. I can nearly hide ZM inside my fist. (I have big hands). Case is very smooth. Replaceable battery is a huge advantage over IP. But, design is not as MOMA artsy as IP.  Battery Life The first few charge/discharge cycles with the ZM were short, about 4-6  hours. But after that I started getting 10 hours at full volume, 12 at normal human volumes. Seems the battery likes to be conditioned a little. Do a couple of full charge and then fully discharge before recharging cycles.  Audio Quality Playing compressed music on audiophile systems is a waste. So I used Sennhesier PX100s (which I think sound much better than the Senn PX200's - but that's another review), OEM Toyota Car Audio and Tivoli Model One Radio. Although I restricted the ZM to only 128kbps WMA, to my ears, the ZM was noticeably better, with greater presence, better dynamic range and more accurate transients. This was true whether direct link via miniplug, cassette adaptor (SONY adaptor -lower noise) or FM broadcast (Belkin Tunecast II - lower noise better signal more options). Some of the quality difference may have been the different encoding schemes used by IP and ZM rather than the players themselves.  Capacity Virtually identical. I have nearly 50 hours of 128kbps WMA music and the ZM is only half full. ADVICE - Like all hard drives, both IP and ZM minidrives need some free space to perform housekeeping and other duties. I don't recommend filling either an IP or ZM drive to 100% capacity.  Accessories. IP wins hands down in number and variety of accessories. Colored covers, bags, pouches, plastic overlays, lights and more. For me, if it doesn't improve the playing experience, I'm not interested. Anything beyond that is a fashion issue. (Think $2000 car with $5,000 worth of trim, wheels and chrome.) You may have other priorities. At a minimum, get a good car charger, wall charger and remote. Both IP and ZM have excellent products available. However, I prefer the standard USB power/PC interface of ZM over the unique IP connections because I've been trapped in proprietary connectors and formats too many times before.  Music Download Although the iTunes site had a great selection of music, I didn't like iTunes for Windows client or being essentially locked into the iTunes site. I liked the ability to use lots of places to download music for ZM. Creative Organizer software was usable for me without reading the instructions.  Controls Had no problem with the touchpad controls on ZM even at medium sensitivity. But my notebook PC uses a touchpad and I'm very comfortable with a control interface that does not provide tactile feedback. IP wheel gives you that feedback. ZM alternative response is their wired remote which provides tactile feedback in a more traditional way.  Suggested ZM Product Improvements (Are you listening Creative?)  1) Silicone Cases - I use BoxWave Flexiskin because it makes the case less slippery and allows me to cover the white back of the case with a color. (My ZM is Black on Black). 2) Hard Cases - Look at the sweet Altoids hacks people have created. The demand is there. 3) Wireless remote - Who needs more wires in their life? 4) A Dock - The interfaces are all on the top, so invert the unit in the dock. A simple firmware mod would allow the screen to invert when docked. Dock is much better than loose wires on the counter. 5) Electronic Manuals as Adobe documents are okay, but format them for 8.5x11 paper so we can print them out if we wish. Leaving them formatted as 7x4 because the summary instructions are like that is wasteful.  I'm very happy with the product and feel I made the right choice for me. Your experience and opinion may vary. Enjoy!!

<Title>Sad Day
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was looking forward to this product so much!! But, I was let down...a lot.  It looked great when I got it out of the box, and sounded beautiful for the full 15 minutes it worked.  I turned it off, and then couldn't get it to turn on again--ever. I called the company and asked them about it, they were nice, but couldn't solve the problem so they told me to send it back in--which meant it would be at least another 2 weeks before I could get the replacement.  I opted to return it instead and get my money back.  I'm now looking at the Iriver, but I may buy another Zen Micro, but this time I'll be buying it at a store so if it dies on me again, I won't have to wait 2 weeks for a new one.

<Title>Bang for your buck.
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When trying to decide what new mp3 player to purchase, I was very torn between the Ipod Mini and the Zen Micro. In the end it came down to one thing: bang for your buck. In order for Mac to reduce the price of the 5 gig Mini to about $199, they stopped including a charger in the package. The Mini will still charge while hooked up to your PC, but if you plan on going anywhere for a day or two and will not have access to your computer, you're out of luck. Now you can shell out the extra $40 bucks for a charger, or you can use the $40 to purchase the Zen Micro (as in, there is less than a $40 difference in price, the Zen being more expensive.), which not only includes a charger, but an extra gig of space (about 200 songs) for a total of 6 gigs of space, a hard case to protect from the inevitable butter-fingers moments, and two attatchments for the hard case which enable the Zen to either clip to a belt or stand upright on a flat surface, such as a desk or table. The Zen also comes with software that makes it exceptionally easy to add or remove music from your player and/or your PC music library. The software also manages your entire music library, allowing you to burn and copy cd's, create playlists for use on your pc, etc. And, finally, the Zen comes in a greater variety of colors than does the Mini, which is an added bonus. So, which sounds like the better buy to you?

<Title>Great alternative to iPod for WMA collections
<Date>Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was close to getting an iPod based on it's market presence.  But on further research went for this unit instead, mainly because I've ripped a lot of music into WMA format on my PC and preferred not to have to redo that.  I am VERY pleased with this unit:  The setup is a piece of cake Software is very good Sound quality is excellent It's tiny and light. The controls on the unit are intuitive and easy to use. Cool looking - blue glowing buttons.  I would have liked it to come with a belt clip or some sort of holder -- I'll have to get that as an accessory.  I'm not sure there's anything that jumps out as being superior to an iPod (a little more disk for the money, but not much difference).    But if you have a wma collection, this is a no brainer.

<Content>this is the worst product you can ever buy.  I recently purchased it and when i opened it i was like ok nice styling. i then read the directions and realized that the people who wrote it had no clue what they were talking about.  They say that you charge it and load songs {if tht even works for you} by using 2 different cables.  Only one comes this just shows u the incompetence of the manufacturer. Even after this i plug it into my computer and try to load songs with the included software. I was sure that it was fully pluged into my computer in the usb port and it said something along hte lines of "player not read please plug player into computer"  This mp3 player has caused me more frustration than anything else the only this i can say is buy an ipod this company is horrible dont even try to deal with them

<Content>Wow, I am often resistant to try new technology.  I mean I had a several CD Players, computers, DVD players that play CDs...what did I need with a MP3 player?  Well, I did and I finally took the plunge.  I wanted one with plenty of memory.  This was does.  6 Gig.  Sheesh, I think my first computer barely had that!  It's so small, fits in your palm.  Easy to use touch controls, with slide control to scan the play lists.  Quick touch volume adjustment.  Easy to install and use.  Out of the box you are charging in a minute.  It charged quick.  Less than three hours.  The charge is still going on 9 hours now -- they say 12.  Very readers display.  Mine was white and red (which I ordered) but they come in black, blue, white, silver and purple.  This is loaded with so many features that I will still be experimenting with everything for days.  The software is a quick load.  Once it's done, you plug in the player, and it opens the controls.  I just did a Select All and dragged it to the Zen playlists and it downloaded them all very quick.  Absolutely, love all the features, up to 3000 songs, the ease, the richness of the music.  Worth every penny!

<Title>Flawless
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own this player, my uncle bought it as a present for my aunt. I recently got a first hand look at this simply amazing product.   +Design+ The Creative Zen Micro 6 GB is very well designed. The buttons are large and easy to push, also, they are very simple to use. The front is very attractive, with the bright, blue hue light that lights up on the side. The back is awesome, it has a little design similar to a riple in the water that says "zen."   +Listening to music+ The Creative Zen Micro actually makes music fun to listen to. The simple menu is very easy to use, it seperates songs by anyway you want.   +Battery+ After the iPod scare that the batteries are not replacable, that made me like this player even more. The battery life is over 12 hours, very excellent. Simply connect the recharger cable and it will begin to recharge. The battery is totally removable, but it falls of a little too easy.   +Other functions+ This mp3 player also doubles as a personal organizer. It has a calender, memo pad, and contact list. Awesome.  +FM Tuner+ The FM tuner on this baby is great. It is crystal clear.   +Over all+ This is a great investment. It has about 2500 song capacity, organizer, FM tuner, great lighting, and very fun. One way this player can be improved is: that it can have a color screen so that you can view pictures and videos you make on your digital camera.   This player is simply undescrible. So great.  I am getting the 5 GB for my birthday. I can't wait!  Last Word: Creative, you really did good on this one!

<Content>I recently purchased the Creative Zen Micro 6 GB MP3 player and have filled it up already (in two weeks)! What a great unit this is! The sound is incredible, playback is easy (I use for the gym, on my motorcycle, on my lawn tractor, in my car through the cassette adapter, on my weekly airplane flights with a noise canceling headphone), I love it! Did take some time for big fingers to get used to the touch screen, but now I breeze through. I would recommend this unit for anyone looking at the I-POD or in my case, retiring a Sony MD player! Great buy!
