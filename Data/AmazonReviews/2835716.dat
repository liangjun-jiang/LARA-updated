<Title>I love it!
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased this item. It's my first mp3 player and I am extremly happy with it. It's small and the design is sleek. It looks nice. The ear buds are ok. It also comes with a chain so you can wear it around your neck. It did not come with any jukebox software so I used windows media player whch is very easy to use which is a good thing because the mp3 player itself is difficult to use. To scroll through the menu options you somtimes have to keep the menu button depressed while pressing another button. It's not easy to do because the buttons are so small. The manual does not help. It's very confusing. I was able to figure out how to play the music on my own after around 2 hrs of playing around with the controls. The voice recording is easy to use. The sound is good. The wma files sound great. I haven't tried any other form yet. The radio sounds good. I recoreded from the radio and it also sounded good. The player offers plenty of space for my needs. I would recommend this player to people who have the patience to learn how to use it. I would have given the player 4 stars if it weren't so difficult to learn how to  use.

<Title>Save Your Money

<Content>The instruction manual that comes with this VIBE player is worthless. I've written tecnical support twice and the reply always starts out "using the VIBE is really quite simple"...if it were "quite simple,"  I wouldn't have written to ask for help. I've had a techno-savy friends try to get this player to work with no luck. We can get the vocie recorder and radio to work without a problem but I can only get 2 out of 6 music files to play. I wish I had saved the money I spent on this and applied it to a more user friendly player

<Title>Grandsons liked these
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased these for two of my grandsons.  The supplier delivered these very quickly.  I was surprised how fast they arrived.  My grandsons didn't have any of their music at our home, so couldn't download their songs.. But they had the radio playing by Christmas morning.  they both seemed very happy.  I only wish that they had come in different colors.  That way the boys can't fight over whose is whose.
