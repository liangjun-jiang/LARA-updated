<Content>A great little "does-everything" player. Does so many things well.  - MP3 player, with ID3 and lyrics support, three equalizer settings including a custom user setting - FM-Radio with 20 station memory (this thing does automatic station searches, or set the frequency manually)  - Records broadcast FM Stations  - Records Voice with its built-in microphone - Photo Viewer and Video Playback - It is also a 2GB Flash Drive  If you carefully read the instructions, and set-up the directories on your Truly player, the way they suggest - then, when you download a particular artist, it will end-up in the correct directory according to its ID3 info!  The sound quality is excellent. The earphones that come with the unit are OK. Battery life is very impressive and re-charge time is fairly fast.  Having a bright, clear video screen makes finding your way around the menu system very easy. Still photos look great, but movie clips are a bit jerky.  This unit comes with a transfer/charging cable (mini-USB to USB), a pair of earbuds and a nice soft draw-string pouch to keep it all together. The plastic case of the player has a nice feel to it. Lots of colors available.  The instructions mention reading e-books on this device. Since the LCD screen is just about one inch wide, I didn't try that feature.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. This is probably the best player, with all there features, for only $70. There is also a 1GB version which sells for about $49 (same player, less memory).

<Content>the pros;  so tiny! 2Gig fits plenty of music. endless random mode. the bass on WOW SRS mode is awesome. very sensitive microphone. awesome battery life, over 15 hours continuous play. screen is brigth and sharp for its tiny size.  the cons;  button placement is very awkward and takes some getting used to. next song selection is the down button. does not remember last song played when powered off. does not have option for voice recording bit rate. does not support playlists. random play is for single folder at a time only. tmusic software is very unintuitive and looks like a software from a different "fruit based" manufacturer. ID tag is somewhat unreliable.  more detail.  Voice recorder.   the voice recorder,battery endurance,and its concealable size is perfect for super spy fun albeit the record feature is not an automatic button press like in other MP3 recorders and the low bit rate make it suitable for voice only, the trade off is that the recording can be over 17 hours long depending on storage space.   EQ  the EQ selections are varied but the winner is the SRS option that creates rich bass on headphones  Volume  the volume is somewhat low compared to other players. unoticeable on headphones but evident when connected to a car stereo, still very playable and undistorted sound.  Tmusic  the software included with the player is not very convenient, this player is best operated with window media player  Folder management. like many other flash mp3 players. song folder creation is somewhat problematic. the best option is to drop songs into manually created folder playlists.  Instruction manual.  the instruction manual is in translated Chinese and can make no sense at times.  ID tags  Id tag support is random at best. most of the time, only the song name is displayed.  
<Overall>4
