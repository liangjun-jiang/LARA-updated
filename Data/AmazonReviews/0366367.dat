<Title>Value priced MP3 player
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Not too many budget priced players come with a full color screen so I decided to take a chance. Overall not bad. Coby's higher end players may be worth a look.  PRO: Full color 1.5" screen with intuitive menus. Decent sound quality - kinda thin with little bass, but good treble. Drag and drop files from PC.  CON: Flimsy plastic construction. Buttons click when pressed. USB 1.1 a little slow these days.

<Content>I could not get this "player" to turn off! Nor could I set up playlists. The pictures I loaded were distorted and the presets for the FM function, guess what,they didn't work either. I returned it. Sadly it cost me return postage, but Amazon did refund my credit card in a timely manner. I would not consider a product from Coby again. I instead purchased a Sansa as the Christmas gift for my husband and it works very well. This product does not deserve a star....trash can yes...star no! Too bad there is no ZERO.

<Title>Good Choice for a First-Time MP3-er

<Content>My daughter had been asking me to get her an MP3 player for I don't know how many months.  She can be a little irresponsible so I was not going to drop half my paycheck on one just to have her lose it, so I put her off.  Then she needed one--preferable with its own speakers--for a presentation.  I decided to try this Coby brand because we've had other Coby products that were good quality.  This MP3 player not only performed well for her presentation, but it's so easy to use and she and her friends enjoy the convenience of the built-in speakers.  Don't expect them to sound like you're in a concert hall; be reasonable about your expectations and you won't be disappointed.  I think it's just fine for a pre-teen, first-time MP3 player user.  The only issue she's had with it is the folder system.  This player performs without error if you don't put the .wma files into folders.  In other words, don't sync your music.  Use Windows Explorer and copy/paste the music from your hard drive to the MP3 directly onto its storage area.  Every time we have music in folders, it cannot find the files when it's set on shuffle; it will say there are no music files.  This issue is very minute and not enough for me to say it's not a good product.  It suits her needs.

<Title>Looks Good, But could sound better
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player as a "last-minute" christmas stocking stuffer last year. I guess I bought it for the looks.  I was a sucker for the colour screen and the seemingly easy navigation button.  This player is charged via USB.  Whilst some persons may see this as a con, I see this as a pro because I have another mp3 player that uses AA batteries that get sucked dry within minutes of continuous play.  Furthermore, the charge on this coby lasts fairly long.  The drag and drop feature for transferring files to and from the player is efficient and organizing media files into different folders is great, however I hated the fact that when I am ready to play back my music files within a folder, they are played back in alphabetical order instead of the order I copied them.  If there is a way around this, I haven't figured it out as yet.  I hated the fact that the navigation button did not have a standard function.  It had a different function depending on the screen you are in and can be pretty frustrating. In one screen the left button meant go back one screen whilst in another screen it had absolutely no function at all.  In another screen the right button meant go back one screen. It was pretty frustrating trying to figure out how to turn off the unit in a screen other than the MAIN or startup screen.  Turning it on and off was the biggest headache.  The easiset function was the voice recorder.  I liked the one click recording from the side button however this doesn't allow you to continue recording. One click starts and one click ends.  Any other recording option would have to be executed from within the Record Screen.    I also liked the equalizer being accessible from the click of the side button.    The headphones that came with this device is sturdy but hard on the ears.  The ear pieces are a pain!!  But ofcourse this can be substituted with your favourite headphones.  Another nice feature was the LOCK button which prevented the unit from either turning on or off by "itself" or engaging in other functions inadvertently.  I mainly use the music screen.  Dont ever use the video, e-book, photos or FM tuner and the other screens.  But with all the functions that this player has, it would have been great if it was easier to use and the sound was better.  It sounded a bit "tinny" at times without the headphones but with auxillary devices it sounds decent.  I use it with a FM receiver in my car and sometimes with my home stereo.   I say it is still a pretty decent mp3 player for the price.
