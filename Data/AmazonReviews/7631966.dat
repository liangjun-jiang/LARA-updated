<Title>THE BEST MP3 PLAYER EVER!
<Date>Sun Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I just bought this D-link MP3 player. My friend had one of those cheap ones that didn't always work. Then I showed mine and he went out to buy one. I think this is the greatest ever. It is very powerful. And was very easy to use. The buttons are large so it is easy. I would really reccomend this!

<Title>Great player for a low price!

<Content>The D-Link DMP-100 is a good mp3 player for the price. Voice recording is very useful and sound quality is great! The only downside is the 32 megs of onboard memory. I suggest buying another 32 mb or a 64 mb SmartMedia chip with it. Also goes by the name Pine d'music SM-320v. Great product!

<Title>Great player, a few problems
<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2000
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player cheap.  It's a great deal.  It has a voice recorder, good quality, large buttons, the EQ adjustment.  There are only a few downsides to it.<p>1. The parallel port connection.  The downloads are a bit slow - maybe about 15 seconds for a normal song.  Plus, you may have your printer hooked up to the parallel port. 2. On my songs, the lengths of the songs show up completely wrong.  Some songs are reported to be &quot;00:00&quot; long, some are about &quot;15 minutes long.&quot;  But the playback is correct. 3. They need a backlight for the LCD display.<p>     Overall, the player is great and cheaper than most.  If you're not too picky, go ahead and get it.  You won't regret it.

<Title>Great MP3 Player, Great Price

<Content>I bought mine for an outstanding price. If I could change one thing about it, it would be the display. I wish it were backlit for night time use. Other than that, this MP3 player rocks. I especially like the voice recording feature.

<Title>GREAT MP3 Player, just short on memory
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>When I first bought the device, I couldn't figure out how to download songs into the player. I spent 30 minutes on hold with the customer service dept. before they explained how to set the parallel port to "ECP MODE". <p>After that, downloads were not a problem. I was a bit disspointed that 32mb's translates to about 8 songs (max.) But the sound quality is TERRIFIC. One of the nicer features is the built-in equalizer. <p>When I bought my new computer with Windows Me, I encountered major conflicts with the D-link software. Their customer service suggested I download the D'music software that was tailored for Windows Me. For some strange reason, I could only download music with the D'music software once, before my DELL computer had conflicts with their software. Despite all the trouble I've gone through with this little device, I give it FOUR STARS because D-Link's website now features downloadable software for all platforms (i.e. Windows Me, 2000 etc...) I download a fresh set of songs into my mp3 player daily now. <p>But if you're thinking about buying an MP3 player, buy one with MORE built in memory - although the cost may be 50-60 dollars more than this one, you should consider the cost of a compact flash card - 32mb... Wouldn't it be easier to just have it built in? The choice is yours!

<Title>Sounds okay...but it's design needs work
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>While the sound quality coming out of the devise is okay...the devise its self (...).<p>First, The battery cover on the back, is only held shut by a little plastic tab, easily broken with moderate use.<p>Second, There is no USB support for this product. The only way to transfer music is via a slow serial connection.<p>Third, While it takes only two batteries, it ought to take more. This thing is a major battery drainer, I can only get 3-4 hours of one charge.<p>Fourth, No backlight LCD screen. Makes it somewhat hard to see what song is selected in the dark.<p>Fifth, Only 32mb of space on the player, and while you can get more space with smartmedia cards, a 64mb smart media card costs almost as much as the mp3 player its self.<p>I would not recommend this player to anyone, unless you are sort of pressed on money. But there are other mp3 players under 200 dollars that are a lot better quality and have more features.

<Title>Not a very good product
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>We've had this player for about a year and it has begun to short out. We really didn't use it that often, the only reason we got this one was it was offered with a rebate which put it (at a good price) at the time.  Should have waited and done more research.
