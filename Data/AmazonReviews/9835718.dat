<Title>Great MP3 Player, Great Price
<Date>Wed Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I ordered this little guy last week with a 512 MB JumpDrive Sport. I like this because I have about 6 hours of music and this is the only player with choices. I used to have 2 choices - an Ipod (Major Overkill) or a 128 player that will only hold 1/4 of my music. I had to cut the bitrate back on my music to 160 kbps, but I haven't seen (I mean herd) a difference. If ifill up my card, i can buy another. The earbuds are also great. They have good sound. Thanks Lexar! Great Idea!

<Title>Cheap but flaky and lacks key features
<Date>Thu Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>An MP3 player that uses a USB drive for storage is a great idea. Unfortunately this player is just something Lexar through together to sell some extra JumpDrives with no attempt at creating a quality player. It's flaky and lacks some really basic things that should have been there.  I was looking for a low cost, high capacity, flash based MP3 player. What I got was...  Pro: * Cheap - 1GB player for about $90. * Large capacity * Convenient - Copy some files to the JumpDrive and away you go.  Con: * It's flaky. It won't read the tags from about a third of my MP3s. It locks up about once a day, often with an ear-splitting shriek that has me ripping off my earphones. I have to pop out the batteries to reset it. * No hook, loop, etc for carrying. It's your hand, your pocket, or nothing. This is really basic and it's incredibly lame that it's missing. I'm using a small cellphone beltcase. * Doesn't remember the last song played. I can put in 1GB of music but I have to start listening from the first song every time it gets turned off. Again, really basic and how did they manage to leave this out? * Navigation system sucks. If it was quick and easy to navigate then the first song thing wouldn't be so bad. It's neither quick nor easy. * When set to random, cause how else are you gonna get to the last song when you have to start at the beginning every time, clicking FF to go to the next song goes to the NEXT song. I.E. it goes from song 20 to song 21. If it's set to random then FF should randomly jump to a new song. Basic, yet Lexar did it wrong. * The display should show the artist and the track title which it should get from the tags. It should not show JOE SAT->3.WMA. Again, basic stuff that Lexar did wrong.  Other Comments: * I saw other comments about the drive being loose when put in the player. It does have some wiggle that they should have worked out but the drive doesn't come out easily so it's not a big deal, for now.  Overall: * If you're going to swap a bunch of low capacity drives then this player might be okay. If you're going to put in one high capacity drive don't buy this player.

<Title>Great player for the price
<Date>Sat Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Love the player mainly because of it's versatility and cost.  What hasn't been said about it already?  Here are a few notes of mine:  1) I bought the JumpGear MP3 knowing it supports only MP3 and WMA formats.  As an iTunes user, I was disappointed that the only mp3 player on the market that plays mp4 (AAC) files is the iPod at more than 6 times the cost of this one.  :(  I got the impression from the Lexar website that the JumpGear MP3 has flashable firmware so hopefully they will provide support for the mp4 format in the future.    2) At least one reviewer noted that the on-screen display showed the file name and not the song name and artist name from the ID3 tags.  I quickly discovered that the JumpGear MP3 player does not recognize ID3 tags later than v1.1.  With iTunes I just have to right click a song and "Convert ID3 Tag" which is a pain but worth it to view track info on the player.  edit:  when navigating through the songs and folders the screen shows the filename.  When the song starts playing it shows the song title and artist from the ID3 tag, from all versions.  My mistake.  :0  3) At least one reviewer noted a disappointment with the EQ settings and that there wasn't much bass.  I have never been a fan of earbud headphones because, first of all, they are never comfortable for me, and second, they just don't provide much bass.  I unplugged the headphones and ran a line out directly to my stereo (through a 20-year old receiver and bookshelf speakers) and the bass was overwhelming, I adjusted the EQ to a setting with less bass.  My deduction is that the earbud headphones provide inadequate bass and the player itelf is excellent.

<Title>Good, but it needs a few key improvements
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Good:  It sounds good, even with the ear buds (which are surprisingly comfortable).  It seems solid enough, something that is hard to judge by pictures and reviews.  But I suppose the best feature is that it turns your thumb drive into storage for an MP3 player.  It does this just as expected, and with the ridiculously good deal I got on a 1G thumb drive, cheaper than just about any other player with half the capacity.  The bad: navigation is awkward.  There seems to be no quick/easy way to go from navigating the menu to adjusting volume, or from navigating one menu &#34;folder&#34; to another.  Also finding a specific file is complicated by the almost DOS-like abbreviation of the files - for example, a file called Favorite Band - track 01 would look something like this on the screen while navigating: &#60;-FAVORI-&#62;01.MP3-&#62;  During playback, the full tag is displayed.  This is a nice afterthought, but it seems that they missed the point.  It is really missing an &#34;up&#34; button for navigating the options and directories.  Waiting for a selection to time out, go back to its default state is going to annoy just about anyone used to a hierarchical file system.  Adding on an option to display only folders containing supported file types would go a long way toward making it a cleaner interface.  Really getting down to picking nits:  there is no &#34;off&#34; button.  Also, the buttons are not aligned in what must be the industry-standard, by now: Rew-play-FF or something like it.  It seems almost arrogant to do it any other way, but Lexar did it like this: (top to bottom) play/pause, Rew, FF.  And now that I think of it, there is no stop button, which could have doubled as an Off.  Not being able to pick up on the last file played is an annoyance.  This is probably tied to the missing off button (no way to differentiate between a passive and active power-down)   The overall result is that you can enjoy the hybrid features of the MP3/storage device with this setup, but it requires a little more work than expected.  I am not sure how this compares to an MP3 player that could double as storage - I think deciding how important having non-music file storage is to you will get you halfway to deciding if you will like this player.  I am happy with this one, although I am disappointed by how much better it could have been.  I expect that some third party company will take a different approach and be far more successful - rather than being an add-on to their line of thumb drives, they will add support for other file types (Ogg and FLAC, if anyone is listening) and manufacturer's thumb drives, make navigation easier, and sell gajillions of them.  So if you already have a Jumpdrive sport, and patience to make this work for your needs, you have a winner.  If you would like to have a simple MP3 player/storage device, this would again suit your needs, but it may involve compromise.

<Title>Good and Bad
<Date>Wed Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Good:  It uses a jump drive. You don't need any software to load the files - just windows explorer.  Great on battery life. I'm getting 15 or so hours on two rechargeable AAA.  The Bad:  I use it primarily for listening to audio books. For the first little while I couldn't figure out the order it would play files (it was skipping all over the place). Finally, I learned that it plays the files in the order to which they were written to the jump drive (you can set up a folder structure on the jump drive which the player recognizes - nice). Meaning, that using windows explorer, you have to copy the files over one at a time (windows explorer will copy the first file you've selected, then the last file, then the ones in between (or something like that). So, once I figured out that little trick, I was all set.  There are a lot of "features" in the menu system I cannot make work. There is something called a "bookmark" but I can't determine what it does.

<Title>Not Mac compatible
<Date>Sun Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Jump Gear 512 MB for three days, and it's already stopped working. The LCD window is lit up, but I can't FF or REW, and the volume doesn't work. I tried logging onto Lexar's chat support, but was kept on hold for 20 minutes and I quit out. There's several things I don't get about this (Lexar's instructions don't help much). First of all, when I drag and drop MP3 files from iTunes to the Jump Drive, I end up with a  .M4A extension, instead of MP3. Not sure if that matters. I'm interfacing with an iMac running OSX 10.3, and am unable to find an app to help manage my files. Also, I can't play more than one song in a row: after each song, I have to select a new tune and press play. Except now the player doesn't work at all.  I hope I can return this thing.  UPDATE: I finally got through to Lexar. The JumpGear is not Mac Compatible, I was told, and you cannot drag and drop MP3s from iTunes. "Our marketing dept. needs to be made aware of this fact," I was told.  UPDATE to UPDATE: Received an email from Lexar customer support today. Now they tell me I can drag and drop iTunes generated MP3s, but that the unit I just purchased is defective and needs to be returned to Lexar. These people are clearly clueless about their Mac customers. Unless you are PC based, stay away from this product!

<Title>This is a lotta bang for the buck
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Controls worked well. Easy to set up. A little tough to sort files...hints: 1) build folders (albums or playlists), then its easier to select in the MP3; 2) name songs something that only uses 8 letters (days of DOS!); and 3) BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT BONKING THE HEADPHONE PLUG WHEN PHONES ARE PLUGGED IN!!!! I cratered mine by dropping it on the plug. The little internal plug broke off and now I gots to buy a new one...which I will because this thing is so cool for the bucks. Much cheaper to replace than an Ipod!  This is a good buy (unless my other one breaks too!!). By the way, the jump drive is something you need for your data anyway, so you are half way there if you buy the jump drive for data then slip some (lots) of MP3s or WMA's onto it!!!

<Title>Easy and convinient...converts my jump drive into mp3 player
<Date>Fri Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It is a pretty good deal for converting my jump drive into a mp3 player for a low cost. It is easy and convinient to use. So far, I only have it for a few days but I like it so far. The only cons is that is is made of plastic that looks like it is pretty fragile. The menu control is also limited and the play list is set by the sequence you put in the songs. But overall can't complain.

<Content>I thought I was getting a great deal considering I didn't have to pay gor the 1G jump drive(work provided). The first player I got broke within 2 weeks. The earphone jack completey fell into the player. So amazon gets me another out right away and now it's not reading the jump drive correctley. I'm gonna try to reformat it but it looks like I could be sending it back again. The company needs to do a better job with this.

<Title>Junk
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Though this player's stats look good on paper, and the concept is a great one, do not buy it. I recieved one for Christmas last year, and the headphone jack fell INTO the player after a few months. Lexar sent me a replacement, which did not even work to begin with. They sent me another one, the headphone jack broke on that one too. After this they refused to give me a refund, but replaced it with their newest model mp3 player, the LDP-600. I am waiting to see if their are any defects, but this is a much nicer player. In closing, stay away from the Jumpgear, I loved it while it worked, but it is far to poorly manufactured to warrant any price.

<Title>Average MP3 player with some major annoyances
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Lexar jumpgear MP3 player for a very good price with a 128mb jump drive (about $20).  Despite the incredible price I must say that there are some major annoying features that make it only about average when it comes to MP3 players. I also purchased an Irock ezmp3 for about the same price and that player did have some advantages over this one (although it does not have an LCD).  *** The postitive points of the Lexar Jumpgear MP3 include: ***  - A nice blue backlit display that displays the song title and other information (the Irock only has 2 LED's and NO display)  - A decent (though basic) navigation system for finding songs (the Irock does not have this)  - Sound settings for equalizer (although none of them provided much bass... even if you switch to other headphones or speakers).  The Irock has no equalizer settings although the sound quality is comparable in both units.  - The jump drive can be used independently so in case the player ever fails at least you still have the USB drive.  The Irock has an SD card slot but it ALSO has 128mb of INTERNAL memory.  - the volume control is nice and easy to use with on screen representation.  - It will play MP3's and WMA's (although you have to download a patch from the Lexar site for it to play WMA files).  The Irock only plays MP3s   *** The drawbacks of this unit include: ***  - very frustrating jog wheel control that doesn't always respond to input.  What is the point of the jog wheel if it only works about 60% of the time?  - Minimal amount of buttons and no real way to tell what you are pressing without looking or memorizing the layout. The Irock's buttons and layout is much simpler and much easier to use.  - The player does not remember the last song played so if you have a lot of songs it is very frustrating to have to go through and find the point where you left off.  The bookmark feature is useless unless you want it to remember a specific point in a song only while you are listening to that particular song.  (The irock at least remembers the last song played although it has no naviagation or bookmark system)  - There is NO strap, clip, or any way to carry the unit without an extra case.  This is VERY frustrating because one of the big uses for an MP3 player is to be able to listen to music while performing other tasks.  Also the design of the player is not great to hold because the plastic seems delicate and is shiny so it will get fingerprints and smudges quite easily.  (The Irock case seems more durable and it has an integrated neckstrap)  - It seems like it will not hold up with much abuse.  The Irock model seems bulletproof in comparison to this Lexar.  - Sound quality from the headphones is only average. A lot of users said this has excellent sound but if  you have used any other players you will know that it is only average (about the same as the Irock).  - The battery cover is not hinged on the Lexar so there is a chance you might lose it.    Overall the Lexar is not a bad MP3 player but it does have its annoying traits.  If you are looking for a cheap and durable player that is easy to carry then the Irock Ezmp3 would be a better (albeit plain looking) choice.  If you are looking for (or already have) a jumpdrive then the Lexar Jumpgear is a decent buy.

<Title>I was confused by some earlier reviews...
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>but I think this product is great.  I've been on several 6 mile jogs with it, jostled it around, sweated all over it, and it still works like a charm.  And so far its played every MP3 I've feed it.  Battery life is better than other players used by some of my buddies.  If it does get dropped and broken.  Its only $35 to get back in business, as long as the Jumpdrive doesn't get damaged.  I like that concept.    I use some of my drive space for data transfer as well, the user interface allows me to "surf" to whatever folder has the MP3s I want to listen to at the time.

<Title>Good value, but a few limitations
<Date>Sun Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  Its a good value for the money.  I didn't use the ear buds that came with the unit, preferring my sports style mini headphones.  The unit has excellent frequency response.  The display is very basic - showing the title and some basic information only.  The unit works only with USB drives that fit in its small slot - and not all USB devices will, though you can use a USB extenstion cord for this purpose though that's a pain.  Its nice that it will find the MP3 or WMA songs on a USB drive that also has data files (i.e. Word docs, PowerPoint shows, etc.), so you can have data and songs on the same drive.  For its purpose, which is a basic good-sounding player with minimal features, it works great.  If you drop it, it doesn't break easily (I have done this several times).  It gets about one day out of a set of batteries.    As an "El Cheapo Delight" MP3 player, knowing these limitations, its a good value.

<Content>I have to say for the most part, I enjoy this mp3.  It's easy to use and has decent sound. Compared to other mp3 player, it's very inexpensive.    The negatives are:  You can't create playlists and the player does not always play the songs in the order you load them.  The volume is too soft on some songs and can never get really loud. You must use a lexar drive, it won't recognize other brands.

<Title>In This Price Range, It has No Peer
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Lexar Jumpgear for about a year. I sounds surprisingly good considering the price. As for durability, again, I've had mine for a year. Advantages of this unit are...  If you already have a Lexar jumpdrive sport, you can get a MP3 player for under $40.  No annoying DRM crapola to prevent you from listening to your music  Doesn't require some dubious proprietary interface in order to transfer music files from your computer.  Isn't limited to any particular operating system. You can drag and drop files from whichever file manager you use. You can even do it at the command line (shell) if that is your wont.  It is very good for exercising and such. Since it's a flash drive, you don't have to worry about jostling it around. Also, it's only $40, so you don't have to be paranoid about it.  You can easily switch 1 gigabyte jumpdrives, assuming you have more than one, and have a different music catalogs for different occasions or different people sharing the same player.

<Title>JumpGear MP3 Digital Music Player - great as long as it doesn't break
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased one of these for my teenage daughter in December 2004.  It has been just the ticket for her.  I particularly like the fact that space is not a limitation -- just purchase additional jumpdrive sport drives that can be swapped in and the capacity of the player becomes limitless.  $35 to turn flash drives into a decent MP3 player is an excellent value. She also likes the shape of the device (she much prefers it to the iPod credit card shape).   And now for my one complaint -- we have now had two of these things bite the dust, both in exactly the same way.  The headphone jack is not very sturdy.  Around June 2005, the jack basically "fell" into the player so there was no way to make a connection with the headphones.  We investigated opening the player up to see if we could manage some kind of repair, but had no luck.  We were disappointed, but we were otherwise very happy with the player (and I had just purchased a new 1G drive for her!), so I just went ahead and ordered another one player to replace it.  Then in early December 2005, exactly the same thing happened with the replacement player.  So now I'm out $70 and she's got lots of tunes loaded up with no way to listen to them.  What started out as a terrific $35 value is starting to get pretty expensive.  Right now I'm weighing whether it is worthwhile to invest $35 every six months to keep her in wearable music....  (Of course, I went through similar problems with the CD players that rarely had lifespans exceeding 6 months, so perhaps I should just keep quiet and order a 3rd Jumpgear MP3 player).

I plugged in the USB Drive and it worked right away in my computer.  I figured I would give the mp3 player a day to dry out.  I plugged in the drive the next day and it came up with no problem.  This happend over 3 months ago and still going strong!  For those of you who have had problems, you should be aware that the player comes with a 2 year warranty!

<Content>What a nice idea -- and I *do* like my JumpDrive USB memory. But the JumpDrive Sport I ordered had problems right out of the box.

For the few minutes that it worked the music sounded pretty good.
