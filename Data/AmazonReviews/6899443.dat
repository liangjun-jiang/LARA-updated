<Title>great mp3 player, but needs more memory
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 players sound is great!! Its simple to use with w. media player. The only bad thing i can say about it is that it only holds 30-40 songs. I would suggest that you buy the one with bigger memory, spend the extra 20-30$ and get the bigger one. Thats all you need to know.

<Title>MP3 Player Works Great
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The MacVision MP3 player,model MA833A is smaller than most candy bars, but works great.  The 128 mb version will store over 8 hours of audio and in a pinch can be used to transfer computer data files as well.  The stereo sound is good and the user can easily switch from one recorded file to another.  It's a terriffic value for the price.

<Title>Good For Kids
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this MP3 Player for my Middle Schooler, and I was very pleased with the price and quality.  It holds enough music, and it's not so expensive that if he loses it that I'll be beside myself with frustration.  The two real problems I have are that the headphones broke within two weeks; and we still have no idea how to turn the thing off. (There's an auto shut-off that you can set for 5 minutes of inactivity or something like that, but you can't just manually push an "off" button.)   Outside of that, it's stylish and small.  Uploading the music is very easy...just copy and paste.  I'm thinking it has to be in MP3 format.   The player doesn't recognize .wma or other file extensions.  The setup CD comes with some kind of convert feature, but from what I can tell, it doesn't convert anything into MP3 format.    All in all, I would recommend this product for parents who have some knowledge of MP3 devices and don't wish to break the bank buying a one for kids.

<Title>Cool!
<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This only uses 119 MB out of the 128 MB to store files. That is the only set back that this device has. It has great sound, neat quality, easy menues and loading files into it is as easy as drag and drop. If you're listening to a song and change to another one, it'll fade the sound out, pretty cool! A single AAA battery will give you plenty of time to listen to your music plus, it can also be used to carry any kind of files. Pretty useful! I recommend this 100%

<Title>It's okay for the price
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got this for my 6 year old daughter so she could listen to her favorite music without lugging around a bunch of CD's.  It's cheap enough that it wont be the end of the world if she breaks it.  So far it works just fine.  Be forewarned that this mp3 player will not play copyright protected files.  The vast majority of popular music that you can download off the web (for a fee) is copyright protected.  This means I can easily put songs from my daughter's CD's on the player, but I wont be able to use any music I purchase online.

<Title>Perfect kids first player! Great Christmas gift.
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old, it was the first mp3 in the house. After a little research I found this to have all the features a kid could need at the best price.   Because of the price I was a little worried about the quality, but I am extremely satisfied. This was so easy to use and set up, even as a first-timer I had no problems. It is very durable, my kid loves it and at under $30.00 you don't have to worry too much about them losing it.  I am so impressed that I am buying these players as Christmas gifts for family members. My six year old is even getting one. This player is easier for her to use then her cd player. Also it is cheaper than wasting money on cd's that ruin quickly, The batteries also last longer than in a cd player.  This is the perfect gift for the kids in your life, at the perfect price.

<Title>VERY poorly documented
<Date>Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The manual included with this device is completely useless. Go to the manufacturer's website and download an updated version - you'll be saving yourself a big headache.  The included manual reads like it was written by a non-English speaking third grader.  Example: "The keys will locked automatically, in the status without any operation and over the system keylock time."  Huh?  "Solution of unlock: Press 'Next' key and then press 'Last' key to unlock"  Needless to say, there is no 'Next' key.  Nor is there a 'Last' key.  REAL helpful directions there, guys.  I'm an IT professional who solves technology problems for a living, and I had a heck of time figuring this thing out.  Unless you're really into puzzles, I'd recommend spending a few more bucks on something that has usable instructions.  Please note that at least one of the people praising this comes right out and admits he doesn't own it - he owns a completely different model.  I'd take a "review" from someone who doesn't even own the product with a big grain of salt.

<Title>Pathetic tech Support
<Date>Tue Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player was good for 3 weeks and then I started having problems. The battery drained fast and then one it did not recognize the battery. I emailed their tech support and gave me a 800 number to call to. Every time I called the 800 number it went to a voice box. Left message no response. Emailed again stating the issue no response. The player was good while it lasted might have been fixed if I had the support. Tech support is really pathetic.

<Title>a few problems at first
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It is very flimsy.  I ordered 2.  One of them didn't work at all from the get-go.  I was able to get a return authorization  for a replacement (item comes with a "6 month warranty"  HA!) Well it has been 2 months now and no response.  I've e-mailed several times- no response.  I've called customer service and all I get is a voice mail.  and No, they don't call back.  Guess what?  they were slow but sent me a brand new player. both are working fine (so far) so I'll go step back and give it 2 and a half stars.   BUT DO NOT GO TO WAL MART TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC because wal-mart's protection label won't work with this player, so you can't play the music.

<Title>DONT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was my 2nd mp3 player (my first was the rio s10, which broke) and right when i opened it from the box the top button was screwed up it could only go one way it was SOOOOO annoying! Then about a month later it was so screwed up that it would freeze, turn off, and make the song sound weird! I threw this peice of trash away and got a Buslink MP3-SK 256 MB player which is way better! I love it! It has a built in loud speaker so i dont have to use those annoying earbuds! So i deffinatly recomend the buslink one over this stupid one!

<Title>Good value if you're clear on its limitations
<Date>Thu Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this inexpensive little player for playing podcasts in my car (through a $7.95 cassette-drive adapter). Works really well for that purpose. I agree with other reviewers that the earbuds are horrible, but since I don't use them, no problem. Putting the podcast files on it is easy in USB-key mode, drag and drop.  It's also a good USB key, which is what I mainly use it for. No problems here except that occasionally Windows has refused to release it - I think that's a Windows problem, not a problem with the unit.   It's a reasonable voice recorder, too, especially for the price. I recorded a two-person practice session in a class I was taking, and my voice was very clear, the other person's not - partly her voice, partly positioning, I think. If you were holding it in your hand and dictating notes into it it should be fine. You could even do a podcast interview using it as a microphone and pointing it back and forth. It makes MP3s.  That's what it does well. Things I wasn't so happy about:  * Here on the Amazon page it claims a ten-hour battery life, but I've found that mine tends to drain the battery even when it's not in use, and my batteries don't last nearly that long. I usually leave the battery out now when I'm not using it somewhere that needs the battery to be in (it doesn't need the battery in order to be used as a USB key, for example). Putting it in and out is an extra bit of fiddling I could do without. * As well as the podcasts I've used it to play an audiobook in MP3 format in my car. I got the recording at audiobooksforfree in the form of multiple smallish files (I'm too cheap to pay for a single file). What I found was that the unit didn't always play the files in the order of their filenames - meaning that I had to use the Mode switch to move around and find the next file. More fiddling that I could have done without. * I put a large audio file (about 18MB, 20 minutes long) on it and at first it wouldn't play, though later on it seemed to work all right. Don't know what was going on there.  In summary, if you want a cheap podcast player that's also a USB key and can record your voice if you need that occasionally, and you are using it, for preference, through an adapter so you don't need the earbuds, this is a pretty good buy for $30. It has a few quirks, though.

<Title>This is a handy little recorder
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband and I bought this MP3 player for our 5 year old son over 6 months ago based on reviews I read here.  Just as everyone said, it's very easy to use:  easy to put music on it, very easy to take music off, and recording is a breeze!  It has withstood the not so gentle attentions of an active 5year old boy and stills works like a charm.  Recently I took it to my Sweet Adeline's chorus rehearsal.  After my disappointment in a much more expensive digital recorder I decided to give this little guy a try.  The microphone is great!  It records a whole chorus just as clearly as it does one voice, very little static or fuzz.  It's so easy for me to upload my rehearsals to my computer; just plug it into the USB and I'm ready to go.  My reasons for not giving it a 5 star are that I've noticed it sometimes seems unresponsive when I try to navigate the menu (could just be user related), and the cap over the USB has become loose.  While it still stays on during use, it's not as snug as it used to be.  But seriously, such a little complaint for such a great, inexpensive product.

<Title>Excellent budget MP3 player at a Good price! 
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this player for about 4 years now, the only MP3 player i've ever owned, and it has always been reliable and functioned great. Sturdy build quality on this one too and navigating to different MP3 tracks is pretty easy thanks to the small back-lit LCD display. My only gripe is you need to install the included firmware update disc to make it truly 128MB, otherwise only 119MBs are available, i didn't bother to do this though and have since lost the firmware disc. This thing still works great though, 119MBs is enough to hold at least 2 hours of Good quality music, and it comes with a USB extension cord to make connecting to your PC and transferring MP3 tracks a breeze. Excellent player if your on a budget, can get it Cheap, and don't need anything fancy.
