<Title>Great Gadget (not for geeks)
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think that this is a great foundation for up and coming video playback machines. I currently own one and have had it since christmas day. I love it. It is soo easy to use. Even my little 7 year old brother uses it with ease. All the options on the machine make it impossible to get lost, and if you do, there is a back button. I tested out all the video players out during christmas time and found this one the best. I have had 3 iRiver Mp3 players and was anxious to get there video player. After trying to use it i often found myself lost and confused on the machine, so i kept having to power back on and off. I also tried the archos, which was even more confusing. Overall this is a great hassle free machine here are some pros and cons. If your wondering why I didn't rate it a 5 because no machine is perfect.  Cons -Big and bulky (Who cares it just means it has a big screen) -Can't record to device directly from TV -Scratches easily (I recommend using the case at all times) -Can't tinker with audio (Can't adjust bass, treble, balance, etc.) -Takes awhile to put video files on device  Pros -Unbeilavbly easy to use -Awesome video playback -Sound is great (even has own speaker) -Ultra fast putting music files on device -Easy to watch during day or night -Nice size memory for plenty of songs or video or pictures -Incredible battery life 1 day of music or half a day of video  If you want all the little geeky features this is not the machine for you. If you want a easy to use audio-video player, this is the machine for you.

<Title>The Best Media Player on Earth!
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think The Zen Portable Media Center is a great media player. It is for everyone!  All you need is an Microsoft Windows XP ( any one). You can put recorded TV on it. You need a Micrsoft Windows XP Media Center PC to do it. If you don't have a Media Center PC you can't use the recorded TV, but you can by a special TV recording device (has to hook up to your computer). Puting video on it takes a while. Puting music on it takes a few seconds. It is not easy to put pictures on. The software disc has Windows Media PLayer 10. You need it to put media on The Zen Portable Media Center. It also has the Portable Media Center software and    Acrobat Reader 5.0 There is also a reset button. If you have a problem like it is charged and pluged into the wall outlet and it won't turn on take a sharp object (DO NOT USE KNIVE!) and press reset and it should work.  This Media Center is a great size and it has a great sound system and great screen size.  It also has easy buttons. It has a back button, a Main Screen button, sound buttons, fast foward and rewind button,a pause and play button a move up muve down move left and right buttons,and Presets. Presets are buttons that you can save albums on. There are four. You can set them loke this. If you are at your favorite album, hold a preset untill it says,"This album has been asigned to Preset 1,2,3,or 4. Also you should buy the docking station and the external Zen Portable Media Center Rechargeable Li-ion Battery. Check out http://www.creative.com/ for more information.

<Title>In-Depth review and How-to put DVDs on this unit!!!!!
<Date>Sun Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Okay, I've had the Creative Zen PMC for a few months now and I think I have had enough experiences at this point to share my opinion. I absolutely think that this device is awesome!! There are a few things that could be improved with the next model but overall the unit is great. First off, I am 25, and active duty in the military. I also take full time classes in college to finish my Masters degree. I needed something that I could store files on while moving between computers, I wanted to take Mp3s with me everywhere I go, and finally, being able to watch some movies on a plane or even during a TDY and be able to look at pictures of my family and my girlfriend, which was a must. This device delivers on all of my expectations. It is very easy to use, very simple to figure out how to interact with the device and more or less, the unit stand up very well. The screen is rather prone to fingerprints but the screen is VERY crisp and clear. The battery life is about 7.5 hours watching movies so you can easily get through a plane ride. The battery comes out easy enough to change and a spare battery is priced well (Around $35). I wish that you could charge a spare battery in one of the charging cradles rather then having to put it in the unit in order to charge. But not a big deal. The external speaker is not very loud but the headphone jack offers superior sound!! Scrolling through the menus was easy enough for my 5 year old nephew who reads pretty well. Putting movies on this unit is easy but a little involving. Later in this review I will tell you EXACLTY how to put the movies on from DVD to Mpeg-1. But first, the optional devices. I HIGHLY recommend a charging cradle which allows you to just drop your PMC into the cradle and transfer files from your computer. The USB port also charges the unit as well which is very convenient. Oh yeah, you can charge this unit from any USB port which makes it yet again, very versatile. I would suggest you get a couple cradles like I did. They are very cheap and you can keep one connected to your computer and the other connected to your stereo like I did. With a cradle connected to your stereo, you might want to get the optional wireless remote. The remote is easy to use and only has a few buttons which made me happy. Efficiency is achieved through simplicity. Windows Media Player 10 is definitely not my favorite program in the world but it does effectively transfer files to their right location well and in a decent amount of time. This allows you to truly "Drag and Drop" just like advertised. The program will then convert any files over to an applicable format. Please don't complain about conversion times and processes. This thing is designed to use specific formats to maintain simplicity.  NOW HOW TO GET DVDs ONTO YOUR PMC!!!!  Now, the first thing you need to do is relax and don't be an impatient wuss. When I was only 140 lbs 7 years ago and started working out in the gym, I knew that it was going to take patience and dedication to get to the lean 215 lbs I am "7 YEARS LATER!".  Anywayz, you will need the following "FREE" software: Smartripper, TWO versions of DVD2AVI (Versions 1.82 & 1.77.4), and finally TMPGEnc.  Two different versions of DVD2AVI are needed because interaction problems regarding SP2. If you do not have SP2, then I would guess you might not experience the problems I had. It took me a day or two to search for, pinpoint, and bypass what was going wrong regarding interaction and I finally realized that it was the simplest to use two versions. Anywayz, when you download version 1.82, rename that as "DVD2AVI SOUND", as this version will correctly process your sound. When you download version 1.77.4, rename that as "DVD2AVI VIDEO", as this one will correctly process your video.    First use Smartripper to rip your .vob files into a folder. Open DVD2AVI programs and properly process your D2v files (You will know what this is once you start using the program) and the 2channel sound file). When you are finished processing those files, then you will want to open TMPGEnc and put it all together. TMPGEnc will ask you for a video stream and an audio stream. It will then allow you to create a destination location. Just put it on your desktop for now and then move it later. (...)  Now the final thing to remember is the same as the first: BE PATIENT!!! Your computer is not lightening fast no matter how expensive and brand new it is. It takes time to convert files. There are some programs advertised out there that claim to do all of this in no time at all and for a nice hefty price. My suggestion to you is to learn about your computer and your device by trying it yourself. These files are free and I promise you, THEY WORK!! I was blown away at how nice of a job it came out. God luck to all of you and I suggest you seriously give this product a chance!! Once you learn how to interact with it, you will be amazed at how easy it is to use.

<Title>Please.....Do not waste money on this Creative Zen
<Date>Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was getting excited again when i heard about the new Zen Vision coming out, but guess what?  My Creative Zen PMC died for the 3rd time!!!!! Same hard drive error. Error message 5. I've tried my best to barely even use the thing this time, used only "official" music, and still it fails.  I don't have the patience to deal with their customer service all over again.  I'll probably just get a cheap Iriver or maybe an Archos if I'm feeling empty without video.  If the new Zen Vision is anything like this one in terms of hardware quality or the amount (or lack of) software updates, I say good luck to anyone who wants to risk that venture.  Good job with the battery life of the PMC and your sound cards Creative. Everything else, not very creative at all.  Trust me, read the forums on the Creative website. Then you'll see what I mean.

<Title>No Customer Support for this Device
<Date>Tue Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> Warning to all new users - do not purchase this model as Creative no longer support the device because of the release of their newest model the Zen Vision.  Basically Creative have stated that they will not be doing any more software or firmware updates for the PMC Zen.  As a user of this device (which has been working since I purchased - fingers crossed) i'm very disappointed in the way that creative is not taking care of it's exisiting userbase for this device.  Again do not purchase...

<Title>A solid player especially if you have a Media Center PC
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The bottom line: If you have $3-400 to spend on a portable player, the Personal Media Center is the gold standard and the Zen is a great choice. A great but pricey companion for audio and video, durable enough for kids with room for everyone's favorite content.  The details: I've been using the Zen Portable Media Center ("PMC") for a few months now and have found this product to be a solid performer. The Zen is roughly the size of a VHS tape or a large PDA (remember the Newton?). It fit nicely into one of the slots of my laptop bag (which I suspect was designed for a large laptop battery) and the folding leather case flips up into a stand when seated on a table or lap.   The first thing you notice is - if you own a Windows XP Media Center Edition ("MCE") PC - the UI on the PMC is the same which I svery straight forward with simple scrolling selections for video, photos and music. The toggle controls on the left were responsive and quickly let me thumb up and down the selections. The audio volume controls on the right are a little small but easy to access and because they require solid contact are not accidentally bumped. And the audio/video playback controls on the right side are easy to understand and use, as we quickly were able to navigate through video clips: a quick press of the button skips ahead several seconds, while holding the controls down quickly fast forwards or rewinds through content.   Content is loaded on to the PMC via Windows Media Player 10 (WMP). Unlike other reports, I've had no problem getting content loaded. The software via WMP 10 is user friendly and fast - I found that conversions of files on my Media Center PC were happening at about 1/4 to 1/3 faster than real time (where a 1-hr show - edited to 42-44 minutes - was encoded in about 30 minutes). Once you assemble play lists of audio and video, you press the "sync" button and walk away... I set up a bunch of files to be loaded the night before a plane trip and found that all of the files successfully converted and loaded to the PMC.  Keep in mind the conversion time: files recorded on a MCE PC must be down converted to the screen size and resolution of the PMC - this takes time. But the resulting quality is very good: I converted several shows, cartoons and movies without any noticeable video artifacts and excellent audio. Some people have noted that conversion can take about the same amount of time as the play time of the show - this seems to be impacted by your PC's processor speed, so I found that although it was no speed demon, it worked fine.   On the operations side, the ultimate test is how quickly my young kids get up to speed: within a few minutes they were happily watching (and rewinding and watching again their favorite parts) from their favorite cartoons. My kids had no trouble holding it and watching it between the two of them, using a headphone splitter to accommodate both of them. An added bonus is the AV out on the PMC which connects to a supplied mini-plug cable that splits to separate AV RCA plugs: at the hotel, the kids (and parents!) were thankful that they could watch their favorite shows on the hotel room TV which (thankfully) had RCA inputs. Quality issues were noted on live action movies (as the resolution is lower than on MCE content) but very good for cartoons.  As for loading DVD movies, this is covered in other posts. For the purposes of playing back movies I recorded on my MCE, the movies looked and played fine. And `though some complain about smudges on the screen, I found it was fine and cleaned up easily with a damp cloth.  Operational controls are strong, with good fast-forward and rewind functions: if you pause a movie and return to it later, you can pick up where you left off (a nice feature). Battery life was great: I was able to run for six hours with no noticeable issues. (Note that on the first charge, you have to charge the battery overnight, and set a little switch inside the battery compartment - instructions are clear on this. Overall the Zen PMC is high quality with great design and very good manufacturing, resulting in a strong product that should last a while. The slightly padded case enabled it to survive several floor drops (and Creative offers an after-sale extended warranty that covers bumps and bangs).  Pros: Great quality TFT screen, video playback, battery life, super UI, good bundled software and strong manufacturing and design  Cons: Screen smudges and no support for SD cards as on newer units.

<Title>Very Great Product
<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this for a couple of months, and must say I enjoy it very much. It is ideal for someone who likes multimedia on the go. If you travel a lot, or just are on the go, and have limited access to entertainment, this is definetley the gadget for you. Battery Life is great. Usually lasts me atleast 18 hours of play, mixed in with a 6 or so hours of video, and the rest audio. Not a good pick for someone with over 5,000 songs (unless you want to dedicate the whole HD to just music), or someone with over 10 GB of Video (again, unless you want to dedicate the whole HD to just video). Someone with a couple of thousand songs and 15 movies or so would really appreciate this machine. It does however come with a audio/video compressor which helps a LOT. So even if you have over 20 GB of content, you can fit it on the HD. It does not come with a built-in FM Transmittor/Radio, but that is a small kink, as no present-day gadgets such as this provide that (to my knowledge). It has clear crisp sounds and video, very easy on the eyes with the great bright screen. Has an A/V Output Jack, so if you have a TV in your car, or want to hook it up at a friend's house on their TV, you can do so. Overall it is a very nice product, I would recommend it to everyone. Definetley beats an iPod, unless you are looking for tinyness.

<Title>Promising Product 
<Date>Mon Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This particular product is at the end of its lifecycle.  It always intrigued me, but I passed on it given the $400 price tag.  However, I came across it the other day and it had a $250 rebate so I decided to get it.  Most of the reviews are right on the money.  I've had it for a few days.  Downloading your own movies takes a long time.  You must be patient, and I agree with other reviewers that overnight is best.  Once you download the content it is great.  I am looking forward to taking it with me on my next trip.    A couple of days after I got this, they announced a new video IPOD.  I was particularly annoyed seeing as though I purchased the 60 gig photo IPOD less than 3 months ago.  In any event, I briefly toyed with the idea of taking this back and getting the video IPOD, but opted to stick with the Zen.  One reason was the rebate, but the second reason was that I think the video IPOD will be lacking in the video department.  Screen size was also a factor.  I will be using this exclusively for video, and will continue using my IPOD for photos and music.    We'll see what happens with these video players going forward.  I expect we'll see more of them with greater improvements.  Anyway, if you can get one of these while they are still around I recommend it (especially with the rebate).

<Title>Slave to Windows Media Player 10
<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I gave it 3 stars only out of a "give it the benefit of the doubt" sense of fairness.  In truth, I was unable to rate this device because I was unable to use it.  You must be running XP and you must install Windows Media Player 10.  Although my laptop has XP, I was unable to install wmp 10 on it -- w/o wmp 10, the device is useless.  I would have preferred something that just looks like a removeable disk drive and plays media in its native format -- possibly with extensible firmware for supporting DRM using alternative distribution format (e.g. RAX).  Running everything through the wmp blender for download strikes me as inelegant.  Also, my Real Player environment hung when I tried to install the extensions for the PMC.  May be a great device, but seems poorly conceived from an architectural perspective.

<Title>best choice
<Date>Tue Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i have had my zen pmc for 2 weeks and compared to all of the other players that i've reviewed, this had the best performance.  The screen is the biggest screen of the other pmc's at 3.8 inches.  Also, this screen in a hundred times better than ipod screens.  Fingerprints are easily wiped away and scratching it is not as easy.  After two weeks of use, the screen still looks new.  I know that 20 Gig doesn't sound like alot for a video player but with a simple program that costs $27, i have 27 full length movies, 1000 songs, and 300 pictures and i have 9.89 Gigs left.  This software is easily bought and downloaded at makayama.com and it is called DVD to Pocket PC.  You can copy your DVD's onto your computer in a little over 200 MB or you can encode downloaded movies.  So far, everything works.  Navigating throuhg your music, movies, and pictures is easy and, well, cool.  The speaker that comes on it really isn't that bad.  It's not great and you cant hear it in noisy areas. For example, you might want to plug your earphones in for a car ride.  The volume controls are very easy to use.  I think one of the best features that makes this player the best is its battery life.  It has by far the best battery life of any player that I've tested.  I've watched 4 movies in one charge and maybe an hour of music.  It also comes with a nice protective case.  my only problems with the case is that there isnt a slot in the bottom to plug the usb into the computer.  You have to take the player out of the case.  Also, there is a flap over the screen, but when you are watching it, there is no protection.  A plastic screen cover might've been a good idea.  There are 4 presets at the top that are easy to use.  When you are at a song, movie, playlist, album, picture, ect. all you have to do is hold in one of the buttons and then whenever you press it it goes right to it.  The player comes with a very simple cord that works on all tv's which allows you to view your movies, pictures, or music on the tv.  To get the picture on the screen, you have to go to settings on the menu of the pmc, then display, then tv out, then tv display:NTSC, then ok.  Though this is a cool feature, the resizing on the screen comes out terrible and it is unpleasent to watch.  It is better to watch on your player.  Even still pictures dont come out well.  However, you can plug the cord into any stereo easily so you can hear your music or video out of any stereo.  This makes buying one of those specially made speakers for the pmc pointless.  I've had only one minor problem.  I had the player in my pocket, off, and i had a text book on top of my lap because i was studying and i guess i was pushhing down on the book with my arms, which applied pressure to the pmc in my pocket.  When i took it out to use it, it would not turn on.  But all you have to do to turn it on is to turn it over, remove the battery, and use a pen and press the reset button, turn it back over, and it works again.  I'm not really sure what this is about.  I guess it just has bad shock resistance.  This player really is the best one out there and i highly recommend it.  Those of you planning to buy it after november 7th have defidenytly missed out.

<Title>Bulky but good performer, could connect only to your PC.
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My first impression when i got it was, "oooohhhh can i carry it..." Its really that huge and heavy to carry in pocket. The screen was really big and clear. Built in speakers are wonderful and headset is really good when compared to other products headphones. Navigation is easy. You could sort songs by title, album, genere, etc..... Could see photo slide show while hearing music.   It has a bit of learning curve and could be little difficult to people who dont know much about Windows Media Player 10. Will work only with your computer and if you want to use it in your friends PC you have to install software, which is really a big annoyance and this really lacks that feature. More than everything the manual hardly has anything. I would give rating of zero for manual.   carry case can't be put in your belt and this device cant even be carried in your pockets. so need strong arm or a good waist pouch to carry this.  Pros: Big screen, Good built in speakers, good headphones, battery life is good. Video playback, supports most of the file formats.  Cons: Manual is not at all helpful. You might know better than what is in manual. No inter operability, can't connect to others pc without installation, Bulky, Big, No easy to use for everyone.  If you are not good in creating libraries with Windows Media player and if you would want to connect to your friends PC then you may want to think twice.  If you are looking for something to carry in your pocket then you may want to look into other products.

<Title>Video transfer to the PMC
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I've read all the reviews here and other sites and the single biggest complaint I've read was the time it takes to transfer video to the PMC. After a couple weeks of trying and taking to heart all the reviews I almost went out and bought a Media PC to see if it worked. Then a light came on...the camcorder in the closet. It has a USB connection to hook to a computer. Guess what...AWESOME...    I've recorded from a DVD player, VCR, live TV and my Tivo directly to the camcorder. Time wise, all it takes is the lenght of the video recorded and just a couple minutes to transfer to the PCM. After the initial 2 hour record of a 2 hour video, it syncs to the PMC in about 7 minutes. You can get a 15 minute Sponge Bob recorded & loaded to the PMC in under 20 minutes.    So, if the video thing is a major headache for you and you have a camcorder that has a USB output, use it. If not the go buy a cheap camcorder and use it double duty for both live shoots & recording. I've seen several camcorders under $200 so it's well worth the time savings & headache.

<Title>Big let down
<Date>Sat Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Now that the video iPod is out this device is to be avoided. Among the problems I've had: 1) It absolutely will not display album cover art. I went through 3 rounds of e-mail support and two phone calls to Creative with no success. 2) Over half of my MP3 files will not play. The error message says "Item damaged or missing" yet the item in question plays just fine on every single other device I own and plays just fine in WMP 10. Creative had no solution to this problem. 3) You can burn DVDs to your hard drive and then transfer them to the PMC. However doing so violates some copyright laws in some countries so don't expect help from Creative on this. Blame the content owners, movie studios, etc. for this. Suffice it to say if you dream of loading your DVD collection to this thing for long plane flights be prepared to spend extra money on encoding software and be prepared to spend many, many hours tinkering with encoding variables so the sound doesn't get all out of sync with the video.  4) It's pretty much impossible to use one handed - unlike the iPod. 5) You can't transfer TV programs purchased from iTunes. Again, blame the studio owners for this. 6) It's prone to locking up. I have to carry a needle with me at all times so I can reset the machine when it locks up. This usually happens if you try to pause video.  On the upside, the tech support at Creative is very good. All my e-mails were responded to in 24 hours and I never waited more than 2 minutes to speak with a human being. Of course it would be nice to not call them in the first place!   In conclusion, get a video iPod. It does everything this device does plus it'll handle podcasts and allow you to play TV shows from the most popular downloading site.

<Title>Its Cool But Would be Cooler if It was Supported By Creative
<Date>Thu Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This PMC does what it is supposed to do.  It is in effect a Mini-Portable Media Center.  The only thing that I think is really special is that it takes Napster to Go Files. Now THAT is nice because I can take them along in my car.  The other nice thing is that it dovetails nicely with XP MCE (2005).    Since my van has onboard DVD/Entertainment, I can plug this thing in, instead of carting around a gazillion CDs and DVDs.  All of my entertainment is here.  Also, you can take home videos and pictures and show them to family when you visit without the clutter.    The downside is that creative doesn't support it anymore because they are pushing the upgraded version.  If I were you, I would get that one instead of the 20G Portable Media Center.

<Title>Great hardware... needs some work on the compatability.
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am 12 and 6 months ago I bought a PMC. I am very impressed with the hardware but it would be difficult to make the device any harder to put media on.  Part of the problem is that it is only capable with Windows Media Player. I have never been a fan of this program but I liked it even less when I tried to get content on the PMC. Everything must come on the device in a specific format that is sometimes impossible to acquire with your media. Getting music on the PMC is not too hard it just takes a while. However my music, all 817 songs are on I tunes. When I tried to browse through my files to retrieve these songs they would not appear. There are 2 reasons this does not work. 1. I tunes hides the files so they are nearly impossible to find 2. Even is you do find the files they are not in the proper format. What I ended up doing was burning all of the albums to individual disks then clicking over to Windows Media Player and ripping them to that library. After many hours work i had copied my music over. But i had no video or pictures. I tried over and over to put DVDs on it but the format was always incorrect. I tried online services that didn't even work. It took many ours to put pictures on the devise and then they ended up being too large of files so the Media Center said they where missing or damaged files. All in all the product was good but the software could have been better.

So I brought it back, my new one didn't work at all didn't recharge or anything so I brought it back and the latest that I have works but there was no battery in the box. But after reading other reviews I saw that there were not reallt problems with broken PMC's so probably the store sold used player because the boxes were not new and already opened. But in the time it worked I enjoyed it and I like it very much.

<Title>Very good product
<Date>Sun Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own a Media Center and I added this to watch programs. The product works great: excellent battery life, outstanding sound and nice screen output. Software is easy and user friendly and sync seamingless with my desktop Media Center. Easy to send audio to other devices (cars, home teathers, etc.)  The Cons that I found on this product are:  1. Unable to program your own playlist or to create them inside the PMCE. If its possible...not so easy to find out how. 2. You need third party software to convert video like Tv shows (mpeg) and DVDs...it is not expensive, but not included. 3. Device somehow thick. I think this is going to be an issue on the next generations. Also it is a little heavier than other products.  Overall is a great product and I am really satisfied with it. Much better to carry a protable DVD player. If you want a really cool device to hold your music and have a couple of movies to have some fun, this is for sure a great buy. Doesnt worth to pay the "list price".

<Title>Excellent product
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Terrific product.  I recently bought one on eBay and I love it.  I read a lot of the reviews here to help make the decision and found them very helpful. It hooks up very easily with Windows Media Player and is simple to use.  I tried out a lot of programs to transfer DVDs and I found the best one to be the CloneDVD Mobile program.  I have been transferring a lot of my DVD collection to a format of 320x240 and vary the size of the file to around 700MB.  I've also put a lot of the videos I have downloaded from the web on the the PMC.  Like people have said, the best thing to do is just set it to transfer and just go to bed.  I don't understand the complaint about it not having a kickstand for easier viewing, the carrying case can also double as a kickstand, so problem solved.  I highly recommend the PMC, after reading the reviews here, I was left unsure at just how good the picture quality was...would it be grainy?  pixelated?  not sharp enough?  All my worries vanished when I watched the first video, amazing quality, crystal clear, sharp, and very impressive.    Do some research like I did, go to creative.com and look at the PMC, read reviews on this site or at CNET.com.  CNET even has a video clip showing the PMC.  PCWorld.com has some good reviews.

<Title>Owned this for 2 years now - still works great 
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my autistic son for christmas two years ago. I wasn't sure about it then but it still works fine two years later. My son is rough with this player and it can take a licking and keep on ticking. He loves music and I've loaded disney pictures and family pictures on it as well as a favorite video on it. (getting the video on it was the most difficult). Keith has been able to manuever through all the different songs and he figured out how to get the picture slide show to play while playing music. This player is a bit on the heavy side but it has been such an enjoyment for Keith. It is the best $500 I've ever spent on him. He has an ipod shuffle I bought after this but he prefers the Zen. He has dropped it and tossed it aside when the battery has died. I recharge it and sometimes have to reset it (it is computerized). But it is hardly scratched at all. The only downside is that it shows fingerprints but even that is not so bad.

<Title>Absolutely do not buy this device
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned Creative products before, and have generally been happy with them: I have a MuVo I have been using for about five years, and have Soundblaster Audigy cards in my machines at home.  The Portable Media Center is a bad effort by Creative, and for several reasons:  1) It has a nice screen, and if you play WMA files with album art, the art displays.  However, if you have MP3s with album art, forget it.  I tried to get Creative's help with this, and got nowhere.  2) Some MP3 files will not play at all.  You get the message "The item is missing or damaged.  See Portable Media Center Help on your computer."  3) Some MP3s play, but with weird glitches in the first ten seconds or so.  It sounds like pieces of the file are skipped over at high speed.  This is repeatable (when a file has this problem, it always has the same glitches in the same places.)  Creative was no help with this.  4) Periodically the machine forgets it has an internal speaker (pull the headphones out of the jack and you hear nothing.)  If you reset the device then POOF, the speaker works again.  5) Though the PMC is VERY expensive ($500 for a 20Gb device that can only play Windows Media Video files?), Creative has never released an update for the buggy software.  I have been checking the Creative web site for a year and a half (since I got the player as a birthday present from my wife) and they have not put anything on there since 2004.  They released half a dozen updates for the Muvo firmware for my other player, but nothing for the PMC.  Apple updates their iPods, why can't Creative update their expensive clunker?  6) Creative will not help you with any problem after 60 days, unless you either buy their Support option or pay them $13 for a half-hour call.  They tell you to check the web site for information, but they don't even admit to the problems I have been having on their FAQs.  (I know they are aware of these problems, because I have read other people's complaints about the player, but they pretend the problems don't exist.)  One comment about the player itself.  The ergonomics are strange.  The rocker switch on the left only works when you are in the menu system; you cannot use it to skip from track to track while playing something.  The rocker switch on the right is not a "wheel" type rocker, though it is circular.  There is no "up" or "down" on it, though it would have been trivial to use that for volume, which would have reduced the number of switches (and the cost of the product.)  Because there is a special button to escape to the menu system, you could have got rid of every button on the right, and had exactly the same functionality.  Maybe they needed a box big enough to hold the battery and hard drive, so they decided to fill the space with buttons.  There are preset buttons on the top of the unit.  If you press and hold one, it will "bookmark" a song or video.  Pressing the button later will return to that content.  I have never had a use for this feature, and fail to understand what having four song or videos available by pressing one button is useful for.  (Maybe you need theme music when you enter a room?)  The video iPod is smaller, the Archos players play all kinds of formatted video, and virtually every other player in the universe can display the album art from an MP3 when playing it.  There is no reason to ever consider buying this player.  I am surprised Creative is still selling it.

<Title>Mobile multimedia whizzardary!!
<Date>Mon Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have only had this PMC for one week (bought it in S'pore at their launch in COMEX Exhibition); and it's just really grown on me - amazing that it has now stored practically all my video files (on my PC nearly 70 GB!) and on the Zen taken only 5 GB hard disc space and I am in the process of loading my pics collection of nearly 2000. The quality is superb on the TFT screen despite the compression but when you project the video files via the AV connection to the TV be prepared for the loss of resolution (I expected it but it is still watchable). The sound quality is second to none (5 stars to Creative Technology). I travel a fair bit and keeping occupied with music, movies, (and books!) will be no doubt provided by the PMC (the battery pack lasts 8 hours!). I have successfully recorded one TV documentary programme which awaits me in my next flight abroad! We just had our holiday in the Far East and the photos loaded had been shared with friends at work.  However I am a bit puzzled why the Windows Media Player 10 does not store on the PMC itself as it would add functionality & versatility to this mobile player and a cradle with the USB lead (like those that comes with PDA) would also help when one is synchronising with the PC. I am trying to find out whether it would store and project my powerpoint presentations. Otherwise so far I am happy with it and would recommend it if you are into multimedia whizzardary!!

<Title>Almost Fantastic
<Date>Thu Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had a few days to play with a Zen Portable Media Center because a friend of mine, who's the owner, had trouble getting content loaded. The Creative support folks were friendly, but clueless on this very newly released product. Since I'm his technology guru, he asked me to show him how to get it working.  The Zen is about the size of a paperback novel. It's small but is too large to carry in your pocket. It comes in a nice case the folds nicely into a simple stand. This let's you set the Zen on a table or airline tray-table while using it.   My first impression when I turn it on is that UI is a clone from XP Media Center Edition (which is Microsoft's Media Center PC OS). I own a couple of XP Media Center PC's so found the UI very familiar and intuitive. However, my first reaction was the navigation and play back controls were reversed. I've had a couple of other folks who played with the Zen make the same comment. Perhaps the UI control layout was designed by a lefty (I'm right handed) or perhaps they were XBox users (many XBox games use the left thumb for naviagation).  It's a minor nit in any case.  To load content on the Zen you must load Windows Media Player 10 which was just released from Microsoft. Clearly Microsoft wants to get into the content management market and is trying to "one up" the iPod and iTunes by supporting not only audio but video.   However Windows Media Player 10 was where my friend had difficulty. He was not able to figure out the new quirks of the substantially changed Windows Media Player UI. To load new content you must have the Zen plugged in, be in the Sync tab, and then create "play lists" of video, audio and picture contents that you want synced. Once the "play list" is created then the content can be synced to the Zen. It's not hard, but it's a bit of a stretch to call that a play list.   Once you've start the sync process you can prepare to wait... and wait... and wait some more. TV shows saved in XP MCE can be added to the "play list" and synced, however they must be converted to a WMA file that is compatible with the Zen. This takes about the same amount of time as the play time of the show. A half hour show takes about a half hour to convert and download, an hour show takes an hour and so on. Also, TV shows that I downloaded from my XP MCE machine had the colors goofed up. It was sort of like watching the film negative of the TV show. I suspect that's something that will get fixed in a software update (and is not a significant issue for my friend since he doesn't care about TV content).  My friend really wants to load DVD movies for long plane trips (he owns them and doesn't want to pay for them again to download them to his Zen). So this is where I went to work.  My first attempt to load a movie was using a product called "DVD To Pocket PC" by Makayama. It is suppose to convert DVD's directly to wma files for Pocket PC's and is suppose to work for the Zen. I tried the trial version and was initially unsuccessful (presumably because XP SR2 was installed). I ended up trying it on a non XP SR2 machine and it worked well. Since the application is fairly turnkey, it's probably a good choice for moving content from DVD's you own to your Zen.  Next I tried Dr. Divx. This application can convert unencrypted DVD's to Divx avi files. This worked for me (though it took a few tries to get the hang of it), however it's not nearly as turnkey as "DVD To Pocket PC". Also, Divx conversion takes awhile (somewhere between 2-4 hours for a full length movie). Be sure to use one of the portable formats because the Zen has a limited bit rate it can support. I had a little trouble getting the aspect ratio right, but a few tries resolved this too. Once the movie is converted then you must go to Windows Media Player 10, put it in a "play list" and sync it with the Zen. This takes awhile, but is worth the wait. The movies look and play great.   Having used it for a day or so I have a wish list of features that the Zen doesn't have (nothing here is a killer problem, but would make a good product even better). *	It needs parental control - I'd like to protect some content from my kids. Currently there is no way to do this. *	I'd like visualization plug-ins when listening to music. *	Since it's used during travel, a travel alarm clock feature would be very nice.  Pros: *	The player sounds good, the UI is great, and the size is very convenient, and the features are fantastic.  Cons: *	It's a bit pricey *	Moving TV content was only partially successful from my XP MCE machine (though I suspect this will get fixed), moving content is very time consuming and is probably something you want to do over night.  *	It's not really a direct replacement for an iPod (it's too darn big). Though that's not really a fair criticism of the Zen because it's not intended to directly replace the iPod   All in all, this is an impressive product, even considering this is V1.0 of the software management (WMP 10), and the hardware, and the firmware.  .

<Title>This sucks! - Get an Ipod instead!
<Date>Sun Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This device is usless!  I bought one and the battery life is only 1 hour.  The sound quality is lousy and it only has a small hard drive, so you can't even store alot of video on it! The windows OS installed is very buggy to say the least and it seems to slow down when video is played on it!  My advice is buy an ipod or wait until APPLE comes up with a better, cheaper, easier to use and more intuitive PMC!  I can't even sell it on Ebay at a loss - no one wants one!!!

<Title>A bit much for just a music player, but if you want video...
<Date>Tue Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I don't actually care about watching video on a portable device; I bought the PMC because:  1) It's the only device that can play WMA Lossless, in which format I have all my music stored; 2) The Microsoft interface is aesthetically attractive and has some nice usability touches; and 3) I don't want to have to install a driver, so something that works through the USB Mass Storage interface is great.  (That it also works with WMP 10 without any drivers is also a nice touch, but kinda cheating, since WMP 10 specifically supports PMCs.)  After using it for several days, I'm of mixed opinions.  The software is pretty good, but still has some 1.0-style rough edges to it; it's probably on par with the iPod (though obviously very different), and way above Archos or iRiver, though.  If you appreciate visual elegance, there's nothing in the PMC's league; if it's usability lagniappes that flip your switch, the PMC has some really nice bits (overlaying large letters when you fast-scroll through a list, for instance) and some really clumsy ones (its handling of artist/album artist/composer tags for classical music).  The actual hardware is less awkward than you'd think, thanks to the nice leather-ish included case, which has a magnetically clasping cover that, when opened, acts as a stand to prop it up.  Still, it's fairly big, and the controls are placed to preclude one-handed operation, so you have to pay attention to it when you   want to change things.  As a pure music player, it's ultimately compromised:  A nice, but not ideal UI mixed with too-bulky hardware for a price that really is more than a bit much.  Still, it's really not bad, and if I were at all interested in video, it'd probably be that much more compelling.  (As for the putative one-hour battery life of the previous review, um, no.  I haven't timed it but it's much, much longer than that for sure.  Perhaps he's leaving the screen on full-time?)

<Title>Great idea, but still not there yet
<Date>Wed Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had been waiting patiently for PVP (Personal Video Players) to arrive. Saw Archos, wasn't impressed. Creative Zen looked really good at the store, so I bought it. Have been playing with it. The video and audio play features are pretty reasonable. The speakers could be made a bit louder. The major flaw with this device is the limited ways in which u can load up the video files into it. You will need a Windows Media Center PC OR a PC with  a TV tuner/capture device to get video in acceptable formats accepted by Zen. Annoyingly it does not have video/audio inputs for capture. It has  video/audio outputs to connect it to a TV. The Windows Media Player 10, converts all files to wmv (very slowly) before syncing it with Zen. The Zen, irritatingly needs to be connected to the PC while the Windows Media Player converts the mpeg files to wmv. I am sure that there are lots of third party tools that can handle the capture/conversion rapidly, but I don't feel like investing more into this solution after spending 500 dollars on it. On the plus side, it is a very well made and polished piece of hardware. The video screen is very sharp and clear. I will probably return this and wait for the next release of Zen, or maybe wait for Apple to redo the magic they did with Ipod and hopefully they release a video version of Ipod. If you already have lots of video content already available in easily convertable format and/or own a media center pc, go ahead and buy this device. I guess I will wait around for version 2.0 of this device. Takes too much time and hassle to load up media onto this device. Creative should go with Linux and/or their own proprietary media management software. I own the Creative Zen MP3 player and the software is okay , if not excellent.  Microsoft Media Player 10 was a bad choice.  An update to the review. I have recently bought iRiver PMP-120 that is NOT based on Microsoft Media Center. There is another iRiver product model, PMC-120 that is based on Microsoft media center. Dont buy PMC-120, as U will run into same problems as the Creative product. With the iRiver PMP-120 + Pinnacle Dazzle USB Capture Card + Pinnacle Studio software + iRiver supplied DIVX codecs, I have been able to successfully capture a/v signals from my dish tv box, and then import them onto iRiver PMP-120. End Result : A portable DVR that can play captured video whenever I want. I was even able to capture HD channel outputs from my dish tv box using the A/V cables.  You will need to experiment with AVI formats and media conversion, before you get it right. The Pinnacle Dazzle capture device + software is about 60 bucks. iRiver provides all the media converter software and DIVX codecs that make it easy to import videos. Use the Portable Media Center profile, when using the iRiver DIVX codec.

<Date>Tue Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Things i don't like: Has trouble converting anything but mpegs (makes avi's looks greenish, though very clear, and I believe it's a problem with my own encoder, which can be fixed), 2) no remote to control the audio on the go (since the thing is a bit bulky and you would want to keep it in a bag or cargo pocket), 3)i haven't figured out a way to play tracks on the playlist in a shuffle mode (i'm sure i could figure it out if i played around with it a little more).  If you can get past those little problems, you've got a hell of a machine. Videos are crisp and the screen looks great. The audio hasn't let me down, even if the external speaker is small (put this thing in a room with good acoustics with the speaker all the way up, sounds great). Photo slideshows are awesome. Everything is sweet so far.  If you really want something that does it all, pick this up.

<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recently bought an Archos,  but had to take it back because it failed within a week.  The replacement went the same way,  so being sold on the concept,  I went for the Creative Zen as a replacement.  Although it lacks all the recording feature of the Archos,  I think its a better machine.  So far,  its tough enough to stand the kids use in the car without any signs of fatigue.  For content,  I find it better to skip Media Player 10 altogether,  and I bought a program for $ 25 called the Pocket DVD Wizard,  which lets me put my DVD's on the Zen,  and the quality is good.  A good tip is not to use Media Player to load the file at all,  just let the Wizard do its work,  then plug in the Zen,  go to Windows Explorer,  and drag the movie or mp3 from wherever you saved it straight into the video folder on the zen.  Its much faster that using media player,  and the results seem to be better (one less conversion!)  Overall,  im very pleased with it.
