<Title>BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
<Date>Sun May 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been waiting for a long time for the flash memory MP3 players to get large in capacity.  I would absolutely recommend this model if you were to get a flash memory player, because it can store up to 2,000 songs in WMA format at 64kbps, that's about 133 CDs.  I also played with this at Best Buy.  I hope I can get this little one during the summer before I go to college.

<Title>Love It!!
<Date>Tue Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Zen Micro for the past (2) years, but the headphone jack died on me.  Looking for an Ipod alternative, my girlfriend and I decided to take a chance on the Z5.  After getting used to using WMP for transfers and figuring out how to navigate the touchpad: We LOVE this product.  Battery life is outstanding, it sounds good, looks great and it feels sturdy (a big problem I have with the Micro and the Nano is the flimsiness). I wish there were a 5 gig version, but I'm getting used to the amount of music I can carry in one shot :)

<Title>Don't be fooled.....
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A few weeks ago, when I was looking for an mp3 player, I came across the Z5 at my local Best Buy.  I was so excited to find an iPod alternative that had all of the capabilities of the nano at around the same price.  In addition, I was amazed, yet slightly suspicious, about its "song capacity".  Both the iPod nano and the Z5 have 4GB of memory, but the Z5 said it held twice as many songs.  I asked the clerk at the store and told me that the Z5 holds 2,000 songs in wma format at 64bpm.  Hel then let me listen to what a song sounds like in 64bpm, then in 128 bpm (what apple uses as a "standard").  I felt a little bit betrayed when the 64 bpm song had horrible quality and sounded like it was being played underwater.  Not CD quality at all.  The battery life though, was amazing, even though i would never go for 35 hours without stopping somewhere where i could recharge. After considering all of my choices for a few days, I went back and bought an iPod nano even though I originally didn't want to.  I realized that even though everybody else in the world has them, they are the clearly the survivors in this mp3 player eat mp3 player world.  They have the most accesories available and Apple is a very respectable company today (my sister has a mac and loves it). Lastly, I realized that being different for the sake of being different wasn't really worth it in this case.

<Title>It is not as good as it looks
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pro: It has a bigger LCD to play photos. It is slim, and well constructed, and looks great.  Cons:  1) For $240 unit, the quality of sound is not impressive.            2) For the unit I own, the battery never runs 30 hours as Samsung claims. It only lasts no more than 8 hours without playing any photos.            3) Recharging battery is a big headache. First of all, you must connect the unit to a computer with Window XP. Sometimes, when I try to connect the unit to my computer, it is not able to get through. My computer does not recognize the unit. I have to restart my computer several times before get the unit connected. Then it takes 4.5 hours to 5 hours to fully recharge the battery. It is ridiculous for a MP3 running less than 8 hours, and then takes 4-5 hours to fully recharge.

<Title>Better than the Nano...
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I agree with most people Pros... -Great battery life -Great sound quality -Very nice design -Made of aluminum (and not some cheap coating that scratches) -Relatively large screen -Dedicated volume control  Cons...  -No on-the-go playlists -Has to charge through computer -Hmmm... Can't think of much else  I would definitely recommend this player. And I'll just give you a tip: Don't listen to the people who say that it has a difficult touchpad. I heard the same thing before I bought mine. When I pulled it out of the box and used it for the first time, the learning curb for the touchpad was about 2 minutes... seriously... I think some people are so used to the ipod that they have a hard time using anything that isn't a clickwheel.

<Title>Great Buy
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking for my first mp3 player for a trip back east, and I was seriously considering an ipod. I had messed with my friends nano, and I did not like the click wheel. Also, it was too thin, I couldn't get a nice grip on it. I bought this one because it looked about the same, and I liked the volume button on the side. I've read some of the anti-Samsung reviews for this player, and they're stupid. For one, the touchpad works better than the Ipod. Unlike the ipod, if you want to move between A through Z with a lot of artists, you have to keep spinning the wheel. With this, you just hold the touchpad down. The sound quality on this is awesome, but the headphones lack a good amount of bass. The picture quality is about the same compared to the ipod. I like being able to choose a background picture. If you have your own picture, just drag it into the wallpapers folder on the player. It says you need WMP 10 to work, but Winamp, Musicmatch, Real, all those non apple jukeboxes will work with it. I havn't timed the battery life, but it last a very long time. Sometimes a listen to it a night, and I fall asleep, leaving the player on all night, and the battery will still get me through the day. I wish it did come with an AC charger, but guess what, neither do the ipods. The body is thick and sturdy, but it isn't heavy. I just got a case for it because I wanted the beltclip.  Overall, there is really no problem with it and I think it far surpasses the nano. Just get an ac charger (ironically, the ipod charger works the best), some new heaphones (I got the Sony MDR-EX71 earbuds, yes I said earbuds) and a case if you want, and your set to go. You won't be dissapointed

<Title>Great sound quality, steeper learning curve than expected
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, so I can't compare the YP-Z5 to the ipod.    The YP-Z5's sound quality was considerably better than I'd expected ... really, the best listening experience I've ever had while using headphones.  Other MP3 players might be even better, but I'm more than satisfied with the YP-Z5.  The learning curve was much steeper than I'd expected for an appliance of this type.  I had to browse the Z5 specific forum at anythingbutipod.com to find tips on reducing battery drain, and sniff around the Windows Media Player help files to avoid uploading tracks with redundant and cross-linked menu listings.  The how-to for creating a mobile playlist also was on anythingbutipod.com -- I don't remember seeing it in the Samsung manual.  And I also learned from the Internet that the YP-Z5 can be operated in UMS mode, rather than strictly through WMP.  Battery life is acceptable, now that I've turned off the backlight and have taken other steps to reduce battery drain.  (None of which were provided by Samsung.)  I also can create a mobile playlist, thanks to an online FAQ.  The touch pad is a bit sensitive, but practice makes perfect here -- the more I use the player, the fewer errors I make.    I upgraded the firmware, and it's possible that the YP-Z5 behaves well specifically because I'm using a latest-greatest firmware version.  But the firmware upgrade is *not* intuitive, and some users have reported problems while trying to upgrade.    The online world doesn't agree on an appropriate charger to use for this device, when a computer isn't available.  I think Samsung could have included a wall charger, or could sell one separately at an other-than-cutthroat price.  Prospective buyers should know that far fewer tailored-for-YP accessories are available than can be purchased for the ipod.    Overall, though, I'm pleased with the purchase -- now that I've put in the study time to learn how to use it.

<Title>SIMPLY THE BEST MP3 PLAYER!
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently received the SAMSUNG 4GB YP-Z5 as a gift and after comparing with others, it has more bang for the buck.  I recommend checking out Sam's Club first.  So far, nothing beats their price.  I thougt of getting the IPOD, but it was too expensive for the same 4GB and looked too fragile for me.  The Z5 is sturdy and more stylish in silver.  The first time I dropped it, my heart skipped a beat, but relieved after it kept playing like normal.  The 4GB is more than I would ever need and anything else would be overkill and simply a waste of money.  Yes, we have to spend that extra money on gas for the car...  It holds up to 1000 songs, which is plenty.  Additionally, I hooked up the Z5 to my speakers at home and I was impressed with the clarity and bass.  Didn't think this compact MP3 player could put out so much sound, but it does...  As far as battery life, nothing comes close.  It goes on and on, just like the energizer bunny.  The last thing I want to worry about is having to keep recharging it.  I tried it out and believe this is a great selling feature.  I'm not too concernced with the hype of IPOD but long lasting quality.  Give the Z5 a try and you'll never go back.  I'm looking for some accessories to go with it now.

<Title>Where are the accessories?
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a 4 month ordeal trying to get an older, worthless iteration of Samsung MP3 player to work. Samsung really won me over with their customer service, as they eventually replaced the device with the pink version of this model.  My daughter was absolutely thrilled to get the pink version, and I was absolutely thrilled to have the monkey off my back for getting her something that never worked.  Obviously, this thing has some good points.    The things that make this better than an ipod nano: Battery life is really good. You can drag and drop files onto the device as if it were just another folder on your system. You don't have to install any bloated software that takes over your music files, renames them wrongly, stuffs metadata in them, etc (referring to WMP which is required by a lot of non-Apple products - iTunes isn't really bad, IMO). It supports OGG very well.  This doesn't matter to a lot of people, but if you think Apple audio format is good, you haven't heard this.  Not for the non-techie, though.  Bad points:  The earbuds really are very poor quality compared to what Apple gives you with any iPod. There are no accessories!  Where is the charging cradle with AC?!  Try and find cases, clips, etc.  Just not available. Playlists are very difficult to build and use.   Too many things end up in the 'Unknown' album since this thing can't simply list a folder name (which would be the group) when the tagging doesn't contain the group info.  This is a programming weakness; if Samsung had half a clue how humans work, they wouldn't have released this device with this particular programming failure.  It is one thing to know how your device works and yet another to understand how your market will use it. No AAC support, as well as other music formats that sometimes make sense.

<Content>the Audio Player works well - does its job as designed, we imagine - it's only a couple of loose ends that are annoying, really annoying  Microsoft redesigned the Windows Media Player - so the information provided does not line up with the actual computer view - the software cd was out of date, would not play and required a contact with Samsung - to date, they have not provided an up-to-date cd - we did download the manual via DSL otherwise, given it being 40-odd pages, we would still be waiting for it to finish downloading.  We were able, by trial and error, to figure out how it works as opposed to the iPod owned by my wife - who is much more capable than I am with Digtal Audio Players - what does this say about Apple and Samsung? - hmmm.....

<Title>Much Better Than IPOD Nano - Great for Subscription Services
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Beats the IPOD Nano hands down on screen size, screen quality, general build quality, scratch resistance and battery life. The display is great for album art and photos.   Matches or slightly betters Nano sound quality but the user interface is not as simple as IPOD wheel and menus. The touch pad menu selection takes getting used to, but the menus are logical and the play, pause, forward reverse are positive and easy to find without looking. Another pocket friendly feature is a big easy to user volume control on side - really easy to adjust ( Ipod Nano could use that feature)   I haven't seen the 35 hour spec battery life yet but it keeps going a long, long time.   Really good choice if you want a flash memory based player that supports music subscription services. While this beat the pants off the IPOD Nano, the hard drive Based IPODs are not much more expensive (until you start paying $1 a song) and are in many ways superior.   Summary if you like the "all you can eat" subscription services or want light, flash memory, device with very long battery life this is the best there is right now.

<Title>Best Purchase I have Made In A Long Time For MP3 Players
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Finally Amazon let's you write reviews for this device.  I copied and pasted my discussion below so you could see what I wrote earlier.  I have owned it for about 3 weeks now and I am still in love with it.  I could not ask for a better battery life or quality of sound (192kbps keep in mind).  Just a fantastic device!  Highly recommended.  "Let me start off by saying that I have been around the world and back trying so many different mp3 players because everyone has a problem. I came close to the best sounding player (Creative Zen Xtra), but the battery was not good. This Samsung mp3 player is fantastic. My only complaint is coming from a 40gb player down to 4gb, but that is it. Battery life = GREAT. I have been using it for 2 1/2 days here and there and the battery is half way down. Usually in 2 days my battery is ALWAYS dead with other mp3 players, and if you purchase the Philips Gogear like I did, you might not reach 2 days. It is a flash drive player so it is RAPID fire transfer to the device. I did 48 albums in 10 minutes! The screen is ok, nothing extraordinary but still very clean and big for such a small device...esp. compared to the Nano and it STILL gets longer battery life. To me personally, I thought the interface and controls were very easy to use despite other complaints on other websites. It is the lightest thing I have in my house and I can't even feel it when it is my pocket. Ironically enough, the headphones are heavier than the mp3 player. The sound quality is wonderful. It does depend completely on your headphones. I have two sets of headphones. On one I thought the treble was perfect and the base was *ok* but blended nicely. On my more expensive headphones, the base and treble were both great. Either way, point I am trying to make, it DEFINITELY has the sound you are looking for in a mp3 player. I actually think the sound quality is better than the Creative. Any questions or comments then feel free to e-mail me at pharmachesst@netscape.net. I always like to include my e-mail when writing reviews so people can actually have one-on-one interaction instead of just a review that might sound sugar-coated to promote the product. My reviews are legit and I come from probably more experience than one should have lol. Enjoy it if you buy it :),  Ed"

<Title>No complaints, absolutely no complaints
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I picked this little number up about a month ago and fell in love with it right away, and you will too.  I was actually considering the iPod Nano, but the Best Buy sales associate suggested this instead.  What sold me on this was the fact that it was thicker (read: MORE DURABLE!) and had a longer battery life.  Comparing this and the Nano on display, this looked far and away to be the sure fire winner.  The Z5 uses flash memory, which means lightning fast transfer of music from your PC.  Flash memory is also more durable than hard-drive based memory (which is found in the standard iPods and the now-retired iPod Mini) because with flash memory, there are NO moving parts.  Battery life is advertised as 35 hours.  I don't know if it really lasts THAT long, but it DOES last a long time.  I plugged this into the stereo system at work 2 nights in a row for 8 hours each night with no battery charging in between; started with a full battery and after the second night, the battery was still half full.  The metal casing and the screen are both very durable, but you may still want to consider purchasing a protective case for added protection, as I did.  Some people have made some comments about the controls.  Yes, they are different than the iPod, but you'll settle right into them in a hurry, and I have had no problems with them.  Samsung also features a dedicated volume control located on the right side of the case--very nice!  The Z5 also displays album artwork and photos.  The Z5 comes with earbuds, which are acceptable (I mean come on, they're earbuds--what do you expect?).  [See my update below].  Also included is a USB cable.  I also picked up an AC power adaptor into which you plug the the supplied USB cable, so you can charge the Z5 or run it on AC power if you're away from your computer.    Definately go for the Samsung Z5--you won't be disappointed.  UPDATE 10/5/06:  This thing is still working as good as the day I bought it new.  Recently updated the firmware to version 2.37 US, though none of the added features with the update are of any use to me.  I have all but abandoned the Samsung earbuds that came packaged with the device - the bass was too high with those buds.  I currently float between my Sony 828 earbuds (available at most retaliers for around $10, and the Phillips "Virtual Surround" buds (usually between $15-20), just because those suit my taste better.  You may find that other brands and/or models of earbuds/headsets work better for you.    UPDATE 4/24/07: Still kickin' after more than a year!  The case is starting to show the usual signs of wear, but the device still works perfectly.  In the meantime I had purchased a Creative Zen 30G, simply because of its larger capacity and video capabilities, and it was promptly returned to the store after not even a week due to its user unfriendliness (it worked fine, though).  The battery life on my Z5 is still as good as it ever was and has not begun to diminish (as these batteries do eventually).  Firmware updates--I think we're at version 2.47 now--have done even more to enhance the product; I update every time new FW is posted on Samsung's US website.  UPDATE 12/12/07:  Well Christmas is fast approaching so I thought it was time for another update.  The Z5 is still kickin.  The Z5 casing is showing the usual signs of wear (I have the DLO "Jam Jacket" but don't always use it), but the thing still works perfectly and battery life is as good as ever.  There are a few occasional gremlins lurking around with the way Windoze Media Player 11 reads the files on the device, but this is entirely a WMP and not a Z5 issue.  I'm approaching the 2 year mark with this thing and I'm sure it will see me through to the next update when the time comes.  I have had this player for over a year, and I still absolutely recommend it 100%.  It was without a doubt the best $250 purchase I ever made, though the price has dropped significantly since I bought it the day after it came out.  You will not be disappointed.

<Title>Samsung YP-Z5 is a great player!
<Date>Thu Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Initial installation was extremaly simple.  I plugged it in to my laptop with the provided USB cable and it was immediately recognized as an MTP device in WinXP.    I use it with Yahoo Music Unlimited and it works great.  It integrates nicely with the Yahoo music player.  Allowing drag and drop addition of music either by playlist, album, or track; or you can automatically synchornize.  It uploads all the album and track information as well as album art, which displays as the album is playing (very nice).  It also allows the uploading of custom playlists.    I had a problem when I first tried downloading to it, but once fixing the issue, everything worked as published.  I had to delete my DRM folder (rename it) and relicense everything after updating my "Windows Media Security" and then it worked without a hitch.  As far as sound quality goes, Yahoo Music encodes at 196kbps and the player has no problems with it.  It sounds better than I was expecting for such a small device that literally weighs a few ounces with super long battery life.  I compared it with my laptop headphone output playing the same tracks with a pair of Sennheiser PX-100s and they sound identical.  I would definately recommend upgrading the headphones.  The provided headphones have very little bass response and really limit the sound quality of the player.  I also connect it to my audio receiver in the house and it works great there also.  As far as operation of the player goes I have no problems.  It's a very intuitive and simple interface. Tracks can be played from a certain Artist, Track, Genre, Composer, Playlist, or simply "All Songs".  All of these can be played via shuffle if you desire a random selection.  All menus are navigated with the touch sensitive pad and a selection is made by pressing the pad like a button.  To go back a menu, there is a 'back' button.  It works very well after about 2 minutes of practicing.  I have not timed the full time of the battery life, but it's well over 20 hours.  The player is very efficient.  It immediately powers down when a playlist finishes, but takes 0 time to power back up.  If it's powered down during a song or paused it will also power off, but it immediately picks up where it left off when powered back up.  The screen dims and also turns off after a song has played for a while with no user intervention. These settings can be configured independantly from when the unit is battery powered or USB powered, which I like.  You can leave the screen on when the unit is charging.  I have not used the picture or slideshow capabilities of the player, but I know they exist.  In fact, I deleted the photos that came with the player to free up some space.  Other features the player has that I don't use are the DNSe sound enhancing feature.  You can select 'Rock', 'Jazz', 'Classical', 'Studio', etc.  There are also some 3D selections that some people would probably prefer to the 'Normal' selection.  It also has a sleep timer.  The only thing I would like to see is improved charging methods.  I had it down to about 50% battery life and it took about 2 hours to charge to 100%.  I think that's a little long if you're in a pinch and there's no way to charge besides hooking up with USB to a PC.  You can charge and listen at the same time however.  Also, I hope to see some accessories available for it.  I would like a little desk player that would charge it and have a couple of powered speakers to play aloud.  I don't know of anything like that is available for this player.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied.  I can listen to TONS of music at great quality for HOURS and HOURS wherever I go.  I love the fact that I can just search on an artist,  stream the music instantly, download the stuff I like straight to my little player in a couple of minutes and go out the door with it, for a flat monthly fee.  Awesome.

<Title>Excellent flash player
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a top notch MP3 player.  The controls and user interface are very nicely designed.  I'm not sure why CNET had such a hard time with the touch pad, it actually works quite well.  Sound quality is excellent, as is the battery life.  I've only used it with WMP10, but it works flawlessly and quickly.  My only complaint so far is the lack of on-the-go playlists.  This seems like an easy feature to implement... I'm hoping Samsung will add this feature in a future firmware update.  Having used both the iPod Nano and the YP-Z5, the Samsung is definitely the better player.  Unless all your music is in AAC format or you can't live without Solitaire on your MP3 player, the YP-Z5 is the way to go.

<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had two of these, but returned both because of battery life problems. I think this player was rushed to market and therefore has a high number of lemons out there. Both units I had would not hold a charge. Let me assure you, I am not a novice - I charged them fully as directed, for plenty of time, even disconnecting other USB accessories to be sure I got a good charge. (In fact, in subsequent tests, I even moved to another PC -  a brand new one.) Then I played them with medium-quality WMA music files, equalizer turned off, display off - in short, optimal conditions. In EVERY case, my battery life fell far short of the advertised "up to 35 hours". I got anywhere from 10 to 15 hours, tops, before the player ran out of juice. Sorry, but not acceptable...

<Title>Better than the IPod
<Date>Thu Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I switched from the Ipod Mini to the Z5 and haven't looked back since.  The sound quality is magnificant, the size is perfect and the durability is without question.  The battery life is much better than its Apple counterpart.    Buy the Z5 if you intend to work out with it or just use it for music.  It will not stratch like the nano and windows media player is much better than iTunes.  The only downside I've seen so far is that it didn't come with a wall charger, so you have to boot up your computer every time you want to charge it and I can't seem to find a samsung charger anywhere for it.  Also, you can't do an on the go playlist like you can with the iPod, which is frustrating.  Other than that, the Z5 is superior to the Nano.

<Title>Nice aspects, bad touchpad
<Date>Wed May 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The YP-Z5 is clearly inspired by the iPod nano in terms of functions, design, price and even packaging. It is small and light and has a super color display. A Samsung-specific USB cable is included, but no case and no charger.  This MP3 player certainly looks attractive and stable. There is a volume rocker switch at the right side which is welcome. A reset button can be found in a hole at the bottom. Like other high-end MP3 players, the YP-Z5 may crash occasionally, so it is a good a idea to carry a paper clip around because a ball pen is not sufficient for a reset.  While the buttons work fine, the touch pad is not what it appears to be. If you expect it to work like a notebook computer's touchpad, be prepared for a bad surprise: The square field functions just like arrow keys. You have to press this field repeatedly, a light touch will not work. If you press it too hard, the whole field will click and you have performed the Enter function. This is a frustrating experience for most people.  While the display is larger than the nano's, resolution is lower (128x160 versus 176x132). Unlike the iPod, the display cannot be read without backlighting. During playback, the display turns off completely after some time so you cannot read the playing title or the time with a glance. You have to press buttons at least twice to wake up the display. If you are jogging, for example, you cannot halt playback with a single press.  Sound quality is fine for my ears. Samsung states that Windows Media Player 10 would be required, but the YP-Z5 apparently mounts as a USB volume with any operating system, even with a Mac. This is very nice. However, not all MP3 tags are interpreted correctly. If titles contain special characters or German umlauts, music sometimes does not play. The device works with MP3 and WMA files, but not with M4A, AAC, audio books or uncompressed music.  Photos can be displayed if they come as JPEG files. GIF, PNG or TIFF won't work. Scrolling from one photo to the next requires a delay between one and four seconds. Some photos suffer from scaling artefacts and dark areas appear muddy. Still, photo viewing is better on this Samsung than on any digital camera or mobile phone I know of. It is only if compared to the iPod that the photo browsing appears sluggish. (iTunes compresses and optimizes photos before transferring them to the iPod, so the iPod photo storage requires significant less memory while the quality is better adapted to the display.) When scrolling thumbnails horizontally on the Samsung, the scroll field sometimes works and sometimes it does not.  Functions are similar to the iPod, so there is no sound recording, no radio and no photo loading, not even optional. There are also no calendar, address book, alarm clock, text display or games. The battery is built-in.  Summary: This is not the promised "nano killer". While the YP-Z5 has several nice aspects such as the volume rocker switch and USB disk mounting, it is much thicker and heavier than the iPod nano (12mm against 7mm, 58g against 42g). I don't see any real advantage compared to the nano, and the touchpad does not function reliably.

<Content>So I'm late to the MP3 party.  I wanted to go the music subscription route (chose Napster) so Apple was out.  Read the reviews and bought a Creative Zen Micro Photo 8GB.  It transferred files happily (albeit slowly) for two days - then stopped (with only about a 1 Gig of space used).  This is a good thing because I'd still be stuck with the thing if it hadn't "broke".  At this point if I wasn't dead set on the subscription thing, I'd have bought an iPod on the spot in the hope of avoiding future hassle.  But a PlaysForSure player was my first priority, so that wasn't an option.  Picked up the Samsung YP-Z5 in silver (couldn't find black and I wanted it ASAP) and couldn't be happier.  Yes the touch pad isn't as easy to use as an iPod - but it's an improvement (for me) over the Zen (which drove me crazy), and I've gotten used to it.  The only major complaint I have is the lack of an AC charger for this unit.  It's USB charging or a generic 3rd party AC USB charging device until someone comes out with a charger specifically for these.  I had to try a couple different AC USB chargers before finding one that worked (with a couple side-effects).  And since it uses a proprietary cable... don't loose it!

<Content>I just picked this player up the other day, and I must say it surpassed my expectations. You can drag and drop files in, you don't even need to use WMP10 if you don't want to. No itunes [...] needed like those annoying ipods. The sound quality is great, especially with the 3D Sound settings available, and the included earbuds are not bad either, they sound quite good as far as bundled earbuds go. Much better than ipod phones.  The screen is nice and large, and the resolution is quite crisp. I uploaded some of my photos onto the player, and they view quite nice, and the wallpaper is customizeable. The touch pad control is very easy to use, and the menu system is intuitive and well organized. The volume control buttons on the side of the unit are a welcome bonus as well.   I am usually very apprehensive when it comes to purchases of this nature, but I must say it was money well spent. The only aspect of the player that may be a downside is that the albums sort by ID3 tags so you may need to edit them to ensure proper categorization.
