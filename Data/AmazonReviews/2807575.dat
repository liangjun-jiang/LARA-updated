<Title>Small things comes in small package
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>5-12-07 I started with the MUVO when I first joined Audible, then I graduated to the MUVO TXFM 1GB.  I couldn't be more happier. With my initial MUVO I could load up to 7 unabridged books into it.  Now with the 1GB, I could load up to 15 unabridged book with several more to spare. I take this little MPlayer in my travels and it has never let me down. For the price it is well worth it. I would recommend it anytime. Oh and I am 62 yrs old too!!

<Title>Excellent portable music player with many features
<Date>Fri May 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1 GB of music is plenty for the average person on the go.  Flawless, no-install use as a USB drive makes this device ultra-compatible.  FM tuner works well as a bonus.  The only drawback encountered so far is the sheer smallness, which unfortunately makes it easier to lose.  Luckily, there's a built in lanyard loop for attaching the Muvo to keychains, lanyards, or whathaveyou.

<Title>Good value.
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is not as intuitive as my Rio but once you get used to it it works well. What I don't like is having to use the included software to load it. It doesn't work with the third party software I use with the RIO. Not sure if that's Creative or the software vendor. My only complaint with the player is that it doesn't come with an armband and instead includes a necklace from which it hangs. That's ok if you're hanging out, but if you are working out or playing sports it bounces off your chest.

<Title>Tough little unit
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the 256 MB version for a year and just upgraded to the 1 GB. The scroller wheel is easy to navigate and I don't even need to look at it to change certain functions. I work (cleaning carpet) with this daily and it has taken a beating and still works fine, the glass window is even cracked and I won't get rid of it. I'm very tough on things and have been surprised at the backbone this player has, I've been through three sets of headphones in this time. There was a firmware upgrade for my player but I never took it because it was working fine with no bugs. Since it's windows friendly putting on music is as easy as it gets, no software installations required unlike ipods. If mine ever break I will buy another one with out a doubt.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Sat Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the 256 MB Muvo mp3 player for 3 years and just bought the 1 GB player.  The Muvo is superior to most players.  Although I am not as happy with Creative's Zen mp3 player, this player works very well. If you are not looking for a player with a large storage capacity, this is a great option.   Unlike some other players Muvo does not have a touch screen, which makes it possible to navigate without having to look at the screen (very convenient when working out).  The scroll button is quite ingenious - one pull forward allows you to skip forward one song, and one pull back to go back a song.  Pressing down on the scroll button twice allows you to access the album list, through which you can navigate in a similar fashion - one pull forward to go forward an album, and one pull back to go back an album.  And the size of the player is just right - fits in the palm of your hand.   There is no need to carry around any cables because the player has a built-in USB plug for transferring files and it uses a AAA battery.  Not having to look for an outlet when the player dies makes this player great for long trips.  I use Rayovac rechargeables and get at least 10 hours of music out of each. I prefer players with removable batteries, because any rechargeables gradually "drain" over time, and it is much easier to get a new rechargeable AAA battery than to replace a custom built-in mp3 battery.     As for the special features, the voice recorder is quite convenient and I have used it to study, mainly to memorize vocabulary. Note that there are two Muvo models - one with and one without an FM radio. The player with the voice recorder and FM radio also allows you to record radio.  Lastly, the player is quite durable - I've dropped it a few times and got it wet, but it still works great.  All in all, a very versatile player; an excellent choice for those on the go.

<Title>Nice but...
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was my first MP3 player. I read tons of reviews before deciding which one to purchase. In the end I settled on this one.  Likes: It is light and easy to carry around. Comes with clip and armband so that if you wish to walk, run or go to the gym this one is for you.  It is really simple to use. Downloaded songs from Rhapsody is so simple just drop and drag and you're done!  It takes 1 AAA battery that seems to last forever! It's nice to have a battery that you can get from any store in case you run out.  Dislikes: The most disappointing thing for me was the way the player organized songs. It did so in alphabetical order, instead of in the order that I wanted to listen to the songs. I work as a DJ and it was one of the reasons that I bought an MP3 player. So that I could download my playlist and simply press and play and pause on air without having to shuffle through songs. I tried everything, even renaming the songs a,b,c d. etc... to get the player to order them like I wanted. Nothing worked. I called creative and asked the rep if or how I could change this feature. He said there was no way to do so. That the player would always alphabetized the songs by title and play them back that way! AGGGGGGGH!!!!!!  The head phones hurt my ears. So I bought another pair.   The FM radio tuner is not very good and hardly ever picked up a radio station. I live in the boonies so maybe I'm being unfair. An urban environment might produce better results.  Anyway I LOST the player after only having it for about three weeks. My spouse says I need something bigger. I disagree. I just need to be more careful. I would have easily purchased another one of these for the cost and ease of use it was worth every dollar. BUT since it does not allow me to list my playlist to my listening preferences I'm going to have to search for another product. If anyone has something that he/she would recommend to fit my needs that would be great.  Thanks.

<Title>MuVo is EASY!
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It actually a bit startling to find out how easy this little thing is... We use it just during flights and the battery lasts forever (a minimum 15 hours but possibly longer...). Sound is clear and crisp, bass is sufficient, and the LCD control is very intuitive. The set-up on the computer take less than 5 minutes even for a computer idiot like me, the fact that it is it's own USB simplify things to no end. For loading and rearranging files or songs you just need to know how to drag items with your mouse - no kidding - that's it! Five left thumbs up!!!

<Title>Built Ford tough
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this back when it was over $100. And even though it has dropped to the 70's, i'm still glad i bought it back then.  I love all of its features including: detachable USB, AAA battery, FM tuner, voice recorder, SUPER easy drag and drop capability. No need to use any software with this baby, just plug it in! Using a AAA battery instead of a built in means this thing will only die when the little harddisk inside dies!  I use an Energizer rechargable battery and keep a spare one charged up all the time so i never need to be around an outlet or computer to charge this mp3 player.  I've read reviews that badger its detachable usb, but i'd say its the thing that makes it stand out from an ipod! I use it for load homework to bring to school, and basically use it as flashdrive that i'll always have with me.  As for my review title, I've labeled this thing the toughest mp3 player i've ever met is that because i'm an on the move, and forgetful guy. So sometimes i leave things i need in the wrong places. i've left this thing [with and without beltclip/cover on] in my pants that eventually end up in the wash! It has survived two separate trips in my washing machine. All i had to do was air it out with a can of compressed air and it was working like new!  Now for the downside. I would take away one star though because i bought my brother a 512 version and it died before mine did. That may just be a coincidence though. Also, the "scroll" key to go on to another song/fastfoward can be a little troublesome at times.  All in all i'd give MY mp3 a 110% rating. As for the mp3 in general, a 93% would suffice.

<Content>I bought this for my wife's birthday.  It was her first mp3 player, so I chose something that had sufficient memory, but not too pricey.  She uses it primarily for exercise, so the flash memory was a must.  I've also recorded a live event (speaker) for her, and the voice quality was exceptional.  For the $$, this is an excellent product.

<Title>1 GB Creative Muvo TX player is great!
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is a great mp3 player.  It has sufficient power to drive decent headphones and battery life is long.  I like the AAA battery better than having a rechargable battery internally because if you're on the go and your battery dies, you can just pop in a new one instead of having to stop and recharge it.  The controls are very intuitive and easy to use.  The radio works well and has lots of preset options.  You can also customize the EQ on 5 frequencies.  I have a belt clip and an armband for mine and like them.  The thumb drive feature is nice as well.  I enjoy all features this player provides!  I bought one for my wife, then got myself one because it is so nice. This player also recieved the c-net editor's choice award.

<Content>Fine product, I've owned one for quite some time, I believe over two years.  (I'm old and over 65)  I bought this one for my wife, so she would give mine back .... she kept stealing mine to use at work.  I love to use these mp3 players while I work, just load them up with your own music and boogie on with a pack of "disco duck" tunes. My only complaint is that they only come in red, our situation with two of these is that we mix them up, my wife doesn't have the musical tastes I have ......  so a "baby blue" and a "girlie pink" would just make everything much better in our humble abode .....

I gave it only a four because it did not connect to the pc directly out of the package and the instructions didn't help.  It took me a while to get it to connect.  But now it works perfectly.

I downloaded alot of songs on it but sometimes the songs don't show up.  I find the Creative tutorial for downloading the songs confusing so I go thru WMP but I still have problems now and then.  I like the fact that there aren't alot of bells and whistles on this.  It's pretty user-friendly as far as scrolling through songs and the volume button.

<Title>Work horse that does it's job
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  Small size, slips easily into your pocket  Looks great, slick red color  Durable and simple. No worries that you will crack the screen. You can take it to the gym and not worry about breaking it.  Flash based. No moving parts to fail or hard drives to crash  Comes with a nice clip-on case that attaches to your belt or waist band  No adapter cables necessary to connect it to your computer  Can double as a flash drive  Uses one AAA battery that lasts a long time, no fooling with a USB cable to recharge, just pop in a new battery. Great for when you are traveling and don't have a computer around, or you are hit by a hurricane and the power is out       Cons:  Tiny display, but at least it's backlit. Some players in this price range have no display *Cough* Ipod Shuffle *Cough*  Small capacity compared to other more modern flash based players  Awkward controls. Scroll wheel thingy is small and doesn't feel all that great  As of the date of this review - for just a little more money, you can get an MP3 player that has more capacity and a much bigger color screen that can show pictures and even movies       Summary:  this player is good for doing it's job, which is to play music. I take away one star because the scroll wheel control isn't that good. The Sansa M series, which I have also owned, is similar and has better controls. I like this player better than the Sansa M series because it just looks so much cooler and plugs into my computer without an adapter.  Overall, my Muvo has served me well. I'll keep it as a backup and for jogging etc, but for a little more cash you can pick up a player that does much more. This one is good pick up if you can get it for a low price as a backup player.

<Title>SO far, SO good!!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I actuall give this player 4 1/2 stars!  I've had this player for a month now.  I must say, for the money this is GREAT!!  I've had no issues and like all the features it offers!!!  It is very simple to figure out and was no fuss to transfer songs to.  The only thing I really need now is a clip for it.  I do really wish it had one.  I don't like the neck lanyard very much.  When i run with it around my neck I feel like it is pulling and it just bounces everywhere!  I've been holding it in my hand with the lanyard in my hand too.  That's not too bad to do.  During winter it should be easy... Just make sure you run with a sweatshirt that has a pouch pocket in the front and you can stick it in there(put the player under your sweatshirt at the top and pull it out the bottom).  I did that a few days ago when it was 50 outside.  It worked like a charm!!! VERY GOOD product though.  NO other complaints.  Just put a clip on it!!!

<Title>Simple and good
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and I quite enjoy it.  Mind you, this is my first mp3 player and I don't own a computer so I wanted something that didn't require me to have to keep a program on my computer in order to listen to it (i.e. the IPod).  This little player is really just a 1 GB jump drive with a headphone outlet so you can't get more simple than that.  In hind sight, I think I should have bought the 2 GB version since I hardly listen to the radio these days.  Other than that I like it.  Sound quality is good (the earubuds are comfortable and work well).  I can even plug this thing into my stereo at home which I really love to do.  I'll eventually invest in a much larger mp3 player (possibly even the IPod, gasp) but for now this suits my needs.  It travels well and is perfect for the gym since you don't need 5,000 songs to generally get through a workout (and if you do, then you must be exhausted).  Also, a good thing to note is that you don't really have to worry about jostling this thing too much since it uses flash memory versus a hard drive.  Overall, a good product for the money, but I wouldn't spend much more on it than I did because as I said, it's just a jump drive with a headphone outlet (so shop around to get the best price).

<Content>Having bought three very expensive Ipods for my sons, I thought I would take a different tact and try this product and I couldn't be more pleased.  It is extremely easy to load music into it and the playback sounds great.  There are so many features packed into this tiny, lightweight package that I cannot believe the price I paid for it.  The only minor drawback I would mention are the earbuds.  They are a little tricky to get seated properly but having tried a couple of other brands, I came to realize just how great these were sound-wise.  Overall, I couldn't recommend a product more highly.

<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've bought one of these for 4 members of my family and have 2 for myself. They're  basically a 1 GB flash drive that plays mp3s. It is the size of lighter, needs no cord to plug into computer, and needs no software (just drag & drop your mp3 or podcasts).  It is Extremely kind on batteries.  FM reception is just OK and needs headphone cord as antenna (if you're a radio junkie and far from your favorite station, check out the portables by Sangean).  Caution: some older desktops (with USB in back) will have trouble accommodating this.    There have been frequent firmware updates, and I will mourn the time when I have to replace mine (assuming @pple squeezes every other model off the market).  I've used the voice recorder rarely but it is a nice bonus.  Incidentally, I've had my current one for 3 years w/o trouble. My wife has one of the original 256 MB 5 years and going strong

This product can be used as a usb flash drive. But if you want to expect a nice mp3 player that can record voices and play it back, you will definitely be disappointed.  I tried to return this product after a few tests. Unlike this seller's pledge like "buy with confidence," this merchandiser does not allow a return of any opened item.

<Title>Nice middle of the road player.
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this for about a year now.    Pros: A nice option if you want a compact, durable player for exercise.  I enjoy having a player that has a built in USB plug and can be used as a portable drive without having to bring along a cord.  Fairly decent equalizer and good sound range.  Good battery life (varies wildly with sound level, so it would be difficult to give an estimate).  Comes with sturdy clip and armband.  FM tuner is adequate for the gym TV system where I go.  Cons: Don't get this if you are wanting a nano or similar device.  The screen is small and takes a while to scroll through the song data.  The sound reproduction is above average, but not as good as some of the high end players.  The interface for "favorite" FM stations could have been better thought out.  I'm giving this 5 stars because it was exactly as advertised.  I knew what I was getting before I ordered.  This is the second MuVo I have had.  They are tough (ie survived washing machine).  I didn't want a nano or another delicate player.  I wanted something that would survive a long bike ride, a workout at the gym, get rinsed off, and still be OK to clip on my belt at work the next day.  For me, the "cons" were known and minor.  Highly recommended.

<Title>Works fine, lasts a long time
<Date>Thu Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm shopping for my second MuVo. With what seems like hundreds of choices out there, this is high praise.  1. It is simple - yet multi-functional, and works as adversized. 2. It does all core functions (play MP3/WMA, record with microphone, record from FM, play FM) well. 3. It isn't bogged down with digital rights management (DRM) garbage. Other players may make it "easier" to do some things, but that ease comes at a steep price. Just wait until the first time you lose hundreds of dollars of downloaded music files because you can't transfer them to a new device. 4. Emergency thumb drive. 5. Plugs straight into a USB port. If you have enough computer skills to use a USB "thumb" drive and copy files in Windows or Mac, you are smart enough to use this device. If not, you should probably just settle down with a good book and stop shopping right now.   P.S. My views on DRM are not an endorsement for illegal copying. While I despise the tactics of the RIAA and similar civility-challenged organizations, they are (at least in part) a response to a real problem. Don't add to that problem.

<Title>Absolute Recommendation
<Date>Tue Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I LOVE this player. I have the 512MB version but it's the same thing. I'm buying the 1GB version today.  Pros: 1. USB interface. No cords to connect, just plug 'n play. 2. Battery. A real battery. Not the internal, rechargeable kind. The quick-swap, good-to-go-in-10-seconds AAA kind. 3. Size. Less than three inches. Perfect size for a shirt pocket. 4. Durability. I have dropped this player onto concrete 20+ times, sent it through the wash, left it in the car in -25�C temperatures, slammed it in a car door, and lost it in the snow for 3 days. Yet, it still works great. (Looks like crap, but WORKS great)  Cons: Maybe... 1. No hold/lock button (if you care about that) 2. Smaller style screen. 3. Sometimes while fast-forwarding, I accidentally skip the song instead. (Probably just big fingers)  Overall, this is one great player for the price!

<Title>Great features
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit combines large storage with a very small size (the comparisons to a Bic lighter are appropriate).  It's also incredibly quick and easy to transfer music from your computer to the player - simply plug the unit into a USB port & copy/paste.  But I think the best feature of all is the 5 band equalizer.  It allows you to shape your sound more precisely than with pre-programmed settings (rock, jazz, etc) & I have not seen this function on any other player.  The only downside is that I don't get the advertised battery life - a single AAA seems to only last me about 6 hours.

<Title>Great for Audible Books!
<Date>Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After my old Creative Muvo finally died (it lasted 4 years), I went to the (....) site looking for replacement options.  The (....)lists more than 100 players, but doesn't really give you a good idea of how compatible they are, or what benefits one has over another.  A look at amazon does offer a filter for 'audible' format players, and so I found some inexpensive options this way.  The first player I tried was the Sansa M230, however, hookup with audible was impossible, and it also was missing two major requirements for use with audible books: the ability to skip sections, and also progressive fast forward.  Spending 5 minutes pressing fast forward to get 20 minutes further in a 5 hour book is not my idea of fun.  The player also had a defective backlight, so I returned it to Amazon, and started looking for other options.  After much searching online, I couldn't find any specific information about other players that offered progressive fast forward.  Even an email to Creative elicited a response that progressive fast forward was NOT available in any of their players.  I couldn't find anything else that really fit my needs, so I went ahead and purchased the MuVo TX FM.    It was an effortless process to get it connected to (....), and download books.  To my amazement, this player DOES have progressive fast forward!    I am very happy with this player.  There are better options for music, but if you listen to audible books, this is the least expensive good player I've found.

<Title>Makes Life Easy.
<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I only use the Muvo TX to listen to individual .mp3 files (i.e. no playlists) so I cannot speak for the advanced features it may have.  I tried to use the FM tuner in my house and I could pickup only 3 FM stations.  So, in my situation, the FM reception is poor.  Your mileage may vary.  With my previous .MP3 player I had to install software on my PC before I could transfer .mp3s.  This proved to be a headache.  I am very pleased with the file transfer to the Muvo Tx.  As advertised, I simply plug it into my USB port and then Drag and Drop files.  It even preserves any folder structures I transfer.  I am using Windows XP (haven't tested it in VISTA).  The learning curve for the device interface was very quick.  There are only 2 things I would change on the Muvo TX: 1) change the position of the power button (currently I almost have to push the power button to take the 2 sections apart). 2) The scan forward/scan backward is extremely slow.  Obviously these are 2 MINOR issues because I still rated the player 5 stars.

<Title>Simply, The Best
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After scouring the net for my next MP3, I realized that the Creative Muvo TX/FM that I already owned was superior to the rest! My current Muvo is a 256MB, and only holds around 4 CDs worth of music. When I got to looking around for a new MP3 player, I could never find another one that had Muvo's built-in USB plug (which makes transferring files as easy as wiping your nose). Every other MP3 player has a chord that you have to have on you, (and with me, there's the constant possibility that the kids have lost the darned thing). Also, no other MP3 out there comes with a built-in FM tuner, a 5 band equalizer, PLUS voice recording!   I use my FM radio all the time, and occassionally I'll use the voice recorder (when I have something important on my mind that I don't want to forget...). When I looked around a bit and discovered that other MP3s out there didn't have all these added features, I really started to appreciate my little white Muvo. Now, I'm buying the 1GB (Red) Muvo, and for $65.99, what a snag!   Oh, it doesn't have video, you say?  I say, if I want to watch a video on a 2 1/2 inch screen that costs me $350, I'll buy one of the fancier MP3s, but for now, my Muvo is for listening to music, the radio, and recording my latest ideas; my laptop is where I watch my movies (...on a 15 inch screen, at that).  Once I started reading some of other people's reviews I discovered how lucky I was to have picked up a Muvo in the first place! (One reviewer said he slammed his Muvo in his car door, left it overnight in freezing weather, and washed it in the washing machine and it still works!) That's what I'm talking about man... no more dippity doo fancy pants overpriced gadgets for me... I'm sticking with the Muvo. When you go to Amazon to look for MP3's and the muvo comes up in the top 5 when you sort by customer reviews, that says something. It's cheap ($65-$70), it's small (about the size of two bic lighters side-by-side), it's easy to use (no USB chords to tangle with), it's advanced (it has a graphic EQ... most other MP3's that I've looked at don't have totally adjustable, custom EQs!, plus it records!)... it's convenient (slips into a pocket, or you can use the little belt attachment, or the snappy armband thingy and wear it under your shirtsleeve). It's not a power hog... (It uses a single AAA battery, which lasts around 10-15 hours. I bought a AAA recharger set, and I never have to worry about my Muvo going dead... I just keep an extra battery in my pocket if I'm about to run out of juice). It's a flash drive! (use it to store Word documents, pictures, even program files... whatever you want, then transfer it to another computer!)  My new 1GB Muvo should be arriving within the next few days and I'm excited about the extra storage space. Like I said, my current one holds around 4 CDs worth of music... the 1 GB should give me 16 (how much more do you need, right?) The Creative Muvo, in my opinion, shows how much of a rip-off other MP3 players are. Why pay over $200 bucks for flash, when you can get a workhorse for around 70 bucks?

<Content>I brought this for 9 yr old son and he is totally in love with it.  I myself am impressed with it as well.  I usually will borrow his when I forget to charge my Zen m.  Only thing bad about this player is that it needs a triple A battery :(....but outside of that I think that it pretty good, it has fm radio, voice recorder, calender and can hold more than enough music to satisfy you in your daily adventure.  Good bang for the buck.

<Title>LOVE IT!
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I tried to convince my pre-teen daughter to replace her old MP3, which was an older version of this one, with an Ipod, but she didn't want to.  She wanted this one again.  She loves the recording ability as well as the FM tuner.  The downloading couldn't be easier, and the sound is great.  The reason she was replacing her older one is because it made a trip through the washer and dryer.  We thought it was a goner, but my younger daughter replaced the battery months later, and it STILL works perfectly, so now we have two of these!!  We don't have a need for huge memory space or any other fancy features.  You absolutely cannot get something better for the price.
