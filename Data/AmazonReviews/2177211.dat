<Title>Get Creative
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with. I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez) Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA8U12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7876944-6599335">Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)</a> Same price but get more, more more! A  little larger, same functions but at 20GB you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of Amazon's very varied music library.

<Title>Keeps on Surprising!
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Where to start? I've bought a lot of different Mp3 players. In fact, you might say I'm obsessed with them. I also have friends who have Ipods. (bah!) The only good thing about Ipods is the wide variety of accessories you can get for them. This little Zen beats them all, hands down! I'll start with the list of cons since there are so few.  CONS:  Touchy buttons. (even with senitivity turned on low, but easy to get used to, and there is a hold button) Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time. (?) Has ability to record, but has no line in.  PROS: (and this will be quite a list!)  Plays WAVE,Mp3,and WMA as well. (I have everything in WMA) Bass booster option. Smart volume option. Sound quality is great. I've read complaints about the bass boost being distorted. Turn on the smart volume and the disortion goes away. Crisp clean treble as well. Smart volume also adjust for different record levels. (quite nice) 5 band graphic eq, as well as plenty of presets. 8 gigs holds tons of music and photos. Very small. (fits in pocket comfortably) Works as an external hard dirve, and lets you decide how much space to use for this. (128mb upto 4gigs) Uses a standard 2.0 USB cord. (big advantage) Charge battery while you put music or photos on it. Not only is the battery rechargeable, but also replaceable. (you can buy extras for long trips) Screen looks bright and clear from any angle. Main menu is very customizable. (options, wallpaper,and colors) Easy to navigate. Almost no gap between songs. (good for Pink Floyd albums) Built in microphone. Seems to record pretty well. Has a calender where you can store reminders and events. Not so important, but it really looks COOL! Not a bad price for all it does.  LAST WORDS: At first I didn't like the fact that you have to use software to transfer files, but now I see why. I have other Mp3 players that are plug and play. It takes them a minute or so to boot up. Not this baby. Turn it on and it's ready to go in less than 3 seconds. The software updates the player when you close the program so that it doesn't have to boot up. I'm not the kind of person who likes to read manuals, and with this player, I didn't have to. It's almost too easy to use, and yet full of features. I've also read complaints about the software. If you know how to navigate windows, then software will be easy to use, and it works well. I've only had it for 3 days, so I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting or haven't found yet. But it just keeps getting better. Has more features than I dreamed it could.  BOTTOM LINE: Buy what you want, but the Zen Micro is BETTER!

<Title>Zen Micro Photo
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this LOVELY new toy for my b-day this past weekend. My best friend has an Ipod which she seems to love but I never did like the whole having to convert my music to iTunes before getting to listen to them. Since I have a ton of music from downloading my cds onto my computer there was no WAY I was going to lose all those hours of downloading because I miss up one transfre to iTunes. My boyfriend is into all things electronic so he told me about the Zen, he had an older model that although it was a really good MP3 player the touch senstive pad would stick. NO such problems with this one. I have been playing with it since Saturday. The one problem I have is the lack of accessories for the Mico Photo, I need a armguard for the gym and there doesn't appear to be one able as of yet.

<Title>Apples are meant to be eaten...
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I dont know what reviewer L. Maxey has been smoking, but hands down, the Creative Zen Micro Photo is a vastly SUPERIOR product to the Ipod...flash player or otherwise. Simply do your homework people and notice the many, many features that the Zen Photo offers compared to the Ipod. FM TUNER, RECORDER, CALENDAR, REMOVABLE, RECHARGEABLE battery (unlike iPods--where you will have to pay to have it shipped and repaired by the factory), AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, you can use it with Rhapsody To Go, which offers YOU, the user, basically EVERY album in its collection (current and past)for a set monthly fee of about $14.95. None of this "PAY PER SONG" BS that iTunes forces on you. Why pay $.99 to download a song when you can load your ZEN with all the latest albums---AS MANY AS YOU WANT---for a set monthly fee??  It comes in 10 different colors to fit whatever your particular taste is, and has a sweeeeeet cool BLUE glow when its on or when you navigate the controls. This player simply offers more bang for the buck. All in all, it's pretty clear cut to me what the superior product is... go do the research and find out for yourself.

<Title>ZMP
<Date>Sat Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>SOUND QUALity: nice, very nice USER INTERFACE - took me a couple of days to dominate the touchpad but now is very easy to use and manipulate, gotta be too careful not to touch the touchpad while playing though SOME COMMENTS - so far so good, the only weird thing is that sometimes when the player goes to screensaver mode it takes longer than usual, is supposed to be real quick but sometimes it drags for some reason as if it was in slow motion, you can see that the time elapsed is affected too cause it skips a number like so: 12, 14, 16, it only happens sometimes, not all the time, no trends noticed...it froze one time already while fowarding, it happened after using fowarding several times in a row but it was an easy fix by taking out the battery and putting it back in, just hope this little gliches are not a sign of things to come....and the OLED screen is great INDOORS, outdoor however you can BARELY read the screen, I had to change my wallpaper to a black-background just so I can see a little more. SUGGESTIONS - view photos while playing music BATTERY LIFE - approx 5 hrs using SONY MDR_V6 headphones, bass/EQ on, not bad considering I tend to use fowards/rewind a lot and most of mp3 are 192kbs or 256kbs. I left it playing overnight one time and it lasted more than 10hrs.

<Title>It's Great!
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am very impressed with my new Zen Micro Photo.  The 8 GB capacity is wonderful.  I put my entire cd collection on it, and still have room.  It was very easy to figure out and is simple to use.  With a simple cable (which my husband dug out of his box of wires) I can plug it into my stereo and have my entire collection, playlists, etc. playable through the stereo.  I did buy the belkin FM transmitter for the car for it, though my husband is thinking of doing more of a hardwire solution.  The best testimony, however, is probably the fact that my husband (a luddite computer engineer who questions the benefits of new technology and thought I was crazy for wanting one)now wants his own!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player!
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have no complaints with the MP3 player, although the software drives ActiveSync crazy, and I have to end the Creative drivers if I want to synchronize my PDA (this did not happen with the Creative software that came with the player, but with the "update"). Otherwise it has very good sound, good battery life, and it works with Yahoo Music to Go (being this the main reason to buy this player). Why not 5 stars? Well, the "protective pouch" sucks and having to pay extra to be able to charge it directly from an outlet also sucks. It makes no sense to have to carry a computer on vacation to charge this thing! (Hint: I took my powered USB hub w/o the laptop to charge it!)

<Title>Rockin' with Creative
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This little 8 GB player is great!  I've got over 1500 songs on my player and more than 1 GB still free.    Pros:  Lots of storage. Small. Radio. Bookmarking. Drag and drop.  Color screen.  While you can drag and drop to the player I recommend using the Creative Organizer software to transfer music for its syncing ability.  Supports several subscription services like Rhapsody among others.  Cons:  Not yet compatible with Audible.com files; hopefully soon.  Does not yet support MPEG-4 files.  Both of these can be fixed with a firmware upgrade when it becomes available.  I highly recommend this player as a great alternative to those not wanting to get tied into the iPod and iTunes.  Plus, this player offers twice the storage as the 4GB iPod Nano at the same price.

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is a piece of garbage.  I had it for 2 weeks and the player froze up on me.  I called for technical support and was able to "jump start" the player.  I used it for another two weeks and it froze again.  I was unable to "jump start" it again by following the same steps as when I called for help.  So I called again and was told that I had to ship it to the company for diagnostic checks.  After owning this product for 5 weeks, I've been able to use it for only 2 and had to pay shipping to send it back.  The company still has not returned my unit to me.  Get an iPod - it's well worth it.

DON'T buy this if you plan on jogging, bike-riding or even driving on a bumpy road!!   Broke within 45 days of easy listening - Customer service was fairly helpful with return of product however.   We have had all types of mp3's in our house including ipod's, creative and cheaper brands - Don't waste $250.00 on this one!!

<Title>Very Happy
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item for my 13 yr. old son.  It was a replacement for a similar unit bought at Best Buy that started freezing up a few weeks after we got it.  BB had little in stock and couldn't say when they'd get more (we could call back if we wanted to check), so we went to Amazon and had our choice of many brands, models and even colors.  Infinitely better selection than the chain stores.  The new Zen works perfect (to date!) and my son is really happy with it. We went with free shipping and it arrived in about 6 days, including a weekend.

<Title>Roomy + Feature + Style + Cost = Solid Product
<Date>Mon Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>An exhaustive research on the available MP3 players on the market yielded the Creative Micro Photo 8GB to be the chosen one. Roomy: 8GB as compared to iPod's 4GB. When I started to download, I quickly found out I filled this little toy with 5GB worth of music and photos. Many of us just don't realize how many good stuff we have in our computer. Feature-packed: a) The FM radio with 32 presets comes in handy. When I get tired of listening to my 2000+ songs, I can always switch to the radio for a change. In addition, I can record songs from the radio for my future use. b) The recording feature allows me to record a lecture or a concert. c) I may share photos with my friends anytime anyplace. Style: This toy looks great day and night with its futuristic neon type light. Just because of that, you find yourself unintentionally showing off this feature to your friends. The player is compact, feels great in hand and seems to be very sturdy (as compared to iPod's flimsy look). Cost: I paid $250. For the same price, you might get an iPod with 4GB. And iPod does not have FM radio, can't record, etc.

<Title>Almost too much music.....
<Date>Wed Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The nice thing about 8 Gigs of music is that I haven't listened to the same album in a week. The bad news is that it took me a month to rip all those CDs to WMA format. Small price to pay, I suppose. Battery life is great. The Photo display isn't great, but all the audio features rock. Haven't used the directory (which only imports from MS Outlook as far as I can tell). Well worth the purchase, anyway.

<Title>Looks cool and special. Easy to use. Great for travelling
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Disclaimer: I had an iPod before switching to the Zen Micro.   Features I love =============== 1. Looks.   There are those who buy things because others got it. But there're things in life cooler than military-issued white. In fact, I got my Sony MDR-EX71 ear-buds in black because white ear-buds are so passe now.  2. Uses standard USB cable.    This might seem like a small thing, but really appreciate the fact I just need one cable when travelling to sync and charge my MP3 player, cellphone, and digital camera. No more tangling mess of cables and charges, and I can always buy a USB line almost anywhere for less than $5 if I forgot to bring one.  3. No drivers required. Works like thumb drive.     The most significant consequence is that I can plug the Zen to the USB port of any PC, and be able to use the Zen like a USB thumb drive. My previous iPod needed to install drivers, which is a luxury I don't have with other people's PCs, or office PCs where they restrict your admin rights.  4. Music Subscription.  This is the best invention since iPod itself. I have been die-hard fans of only 2-3 artists, die-hard meaning I buy every single album and singles they produce. For everyone else, there are plenty of songs I 'kinda like' but I didn't feel they were worth the money to buy.   With this subscription thingy, I get to download entire albums simply to try out entirely new songs and artists to see if I like 'em. I doesn't bother me I lose them if I stop my subscription - they are songs I probably won't pay in full in the first place. But sometimes, not buying a song doesn't mean not worthing listening to it once in a while.  5. Solid construction. The Zen has a solid metal casing that not only feels sturdy and resistant to scratches, it can actually survive a four-feet drop without injury. (I've actually tried this, though not intentionally.) Couldn't say the same about my iPod. (My experience positively confirms that an iPod cannot survive a swinging knock against the subway door while inside a shoulder bag.)  6. Ease-of-use. The menu system is customizable and intuitive just like in iPod. (In fact, I heard the patent for the iPod menus are held by Creative Labs.) Synching songs is also piece of cake. Just plug-in and either WMP or Napster can sync up my library. This is probably standard feature now after iTunes set the standard.   At the end of the day, I can always resort to drag-n-drop straight from my windows explorer, for not only my music files but also data files. (See point #2 above.)  8. Battery Life I do 10-hour shuttles from the West Coast to the Other Side of the Pond at least once a month, and the iPod used to just flat out with less than 10 hours of playing. The Zen can not only sustain the entire trip, but also the train rides to/from the airports ony each side. And I bought an extra battery in case I miss a chance to charge up in between. The "stamina" of most batteries decreases with such consecutive high mileage use, and with the iPod I wasn't able to do anything about it other than to buy a new one or send it back to the factory. With the Zen I have an immediate solution for $30 in the local Circuit City.   Features I don't like =====================  1. No dedicated volume button. Need to go back to "Now Playing" screen to adjust the volume. Can't do it while I'm tweaking other things in different menus.  2. No podcast aggregation in Windows Media Player. Ok. This is more a WMP shortcoming than the Zen's. iTunes has the best podcast browser (though not the largest selection), so I continue to use iTunes to subscribe to podcasts, and let WMP automatically detect the new files and add to my player. It can be done, but I wish it can be done in one-step, one software.  These two dislikes mean it's not perfect for me, so, four stars.

The zen is durable and I have had no problems whatsoever.   The color display of photos is excellent & the zoom feature is easy to use. I'm not sure how viable any mp3 player is for picture display due to the screen size but this is probably as good as it gets. Would recommend to any one.

<Title>Great product - if it worked
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This would be a great MP3 player if it worked. I chose it so I could download subscription music. The first problem was that the LCD display never came on most of the time until I reset the player several times in a row. Resetting the player means removing the battery. I decided I could live with that until the thing stopped working altogether. Now its just a dead MP3 player. I just hope that I can get in touch with Creative Tech Support in time to get a replacement before the warranty runs out. No luck so far.

<Title>Should have bought Creative the first time around...
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Creative Zen MicroPhoto following the demise of my highly problematic iRiver H10 5gb.  The Zen has to date proven to be far superior in terms of its bug-free functionality with windows media player and Yahoo Unlimited.  The Zen does take longer than it should to locate and start playing tracks, but it moves between tracks on the same album without any pauses, a task which used to trip up the iRiver constantly.  I have not thoroughly tested the included Creative software, but despite the Zen literature's urgings to immediately load their interface program, the player works perfectly with Yahoo and there is no need to switch music programs from whatever the owner may already be using.  I use the Zen MP8 as a bridge to load up 30-40 albums from Yahoo, then feed the sound through a Radio Shack gold-tipped headphone jack to my high-end Yamaha amp--yes, it doesn't quite sound like a CD player, but the output quality is very liveable and you have to like the fixed-price music service model of Yahoo, Rhapsody, Napster etc as opposed to iTunes.  All in all, a nice player with battery life short of the promised 14 hrs but tolerable at a real world 8-10 hrs. One piece of advice, buy a cheap pda wallet to port the device around--it does scratch.

<Title>Great Interface, very customizable, except dislike the scroll pad
<Date>Thu Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Things I liked on this player (PROS):  -Size: It's small, and easy to hold in your hand. -Storage: 8GB of music, impressive for its size, it is heavy but feels solid in your hand.  -Screen: Picture display good on this player -Folder layout/Customizable: You can add or remove which folders, options or music layout on the main menu. This is awesome because if you use more setting/folders more often, you can add those to the main menu. I also like how it sorts music into genres, album or by artist. -Sound quality is excellent. 10/10 IMO -Battery: removable and last for 16 hours.  -Creative software: I thought it was okay software, and glad I didn't have to use WMP this time around.   Things I didn't like on this player (CONS):  -Power Adapter cord: you have to purchase this item separately for $32.00. -Scrolling Pad: Even with the sensitivity on low, it's still very sensitive to control. I like all the functions on the micro photo except this option. They should have removed this option, and made the menu key the select function.  -Software: One slight disadvantage you can't preview the song before adding it to your play list or adding it to the player. (Note: you can explore the folders from the creative menu, click on a song and listen to it in that section) -No external volume control, you have to access it in the menu options. -USB cord: Its very short in length compared to other players I've used in the past. If your plug this into the back of your PC good luck getting it in a bottom slot.   Conclusion: Creative has developed a solid product here. I really like how they setup the menu layout, except I really disliked the scrolling button which doubles as a select key. I planned on replacing my smaller 1GB mp3 player with the Micro Photo 8GB player, except the touch controls are too much of a hassle for me to use. I need something with an external volume control, and a touch pad that is a little more forgiving. Consumer Reports rated this MP3 player #1 for the Micro HD players. I still see this players as being an alternative choice to having to use an iPod.   FYI to the people with broken HD MP3 players: People who keep posting reviews on Micro & HD (hard drive) MP3 players should know that all these types of players are NOT intended to be used when doing physical activities like jogging! That's the reason why they keep BREAKING on YOU; HD type MP3 players are much like your computer hard drive. They have moving parts inside that are reading to a small hard drive, if you want an MP3 which can be used when jogging for example buy a flash based player!

<Content>Bought this player in Jan 06.  Picked the Creative player after doing a bit of research on all the larger MP-3 units.  When i got the unit in the mail, it was very easy to set up and run.  The screen is nice, crisp and clear, even in bright light situations.  There are only one item that i would like to see fixed with this player and that is the controls.  The slider/selector touch pad is difficult to master and prone to erroneous inputs.  Other than that, ive been quite pleased with it.

<Title>Fun and Stylish......But Not Quite Worth the Price
<Date>Fri Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Zen Micro for a little over a month with no catastrophic problems, which is a relief to me after reading some of the reviews concerning the unit itself being defective, not being compatible with PC software, etc.   Keeping in mind that my opinion could change at any time and that anything with technology is prone to dissapoint, here are my observations thus far concerning this Mp3 player...  *~THE PROS~*  * A whole rainbow of colors to choose from depending on your personality. (While I know that technically it's color does not determine whether or not it is a good product, I'm a girl and therefore love the choice of color!)  * Uses a standard USB cable to connect to you PC.  * It seems to have a solid construction. It's heavier than you would expect from the picture and the metal casing gives a sense of comfort for a clumsy person like me. I haven't dropped it yet but I've read other reviewers that have and it came out unscathed. Some people have said that you cannot workout with this player, but I take mine to the gym all the time. Just switch the power switch to the locked setting so you don't bump the touchpad.   * HUGE 8GB of storage space! I moved my whole music library (a measly 2GB), created several playlists, and stored lots of photos and I haven't even used half of the storage space yet.  * It plays all WAVE, Mp3, and WMA format files.  * Bass boost and smart volume especially are great features.  * It's smaller than it looks in the photo, about the size of a credit card but thicker.  * The battery is rechargeable and replaceable, which is great if you take long trips and don't want to worry about finding somewhere to recharge your player. Just pop in another battery and go!  * The menu screen is customizable. You can put your personal photos as wallpaper and choose from 8 different color schemes.  * I LOVE MAKING PLAYLISTS! That has to be one of the best features. If you have albums that you absolutely have to have at the push of a button make it into a playlist. I have all of Dave Matthews Band's albums arranged separately. Also if you workout a lot you can put songs that motivate you into a playlist, switch the power switch over to the locked setting so that you don't accidentally bump any buttons, and you're all set!  * FM Radio with programmable presets. I've read some reviews regarding the inconsistancy with the FM signal on their players and admit I've experienced it myself but there is a scan button that searches for the strongest signals. You can also save your favorites. I wish that there was an AM frequency too so I could listen to Coast to Coast at night but then maybe I am being picky.  *~THE CONS~*  * THE TOUCHPAD IS EXTREMELY TOUCHY! After quite a bit of practice, and also turning down the sensitivity, you can learn to master it but it is very frustrating, especially when you first get the device. It took me a half an hour just to get to the menu to turn down the sensitivity, hit the wrong button, and had to start all over. This is definately going to be a huge problem for people that are very push button, but you do get the hang of it after awhile.  * You cannot look at pictures while listening to music. This isn't a big deal for me since I hardly use the photo feature, but for some this could be dissapointing.  * If you take this player out in bright areas, especially outside in sunlight, the screen is very hard to see. I found that if I put a dark wallpaper on the screen it's easier to see, but not much.  * This player and it's software are Windows XP compatible only!   * While the length of the cord on the headphones is really nice for putting the player in your pocket, etc. the ear buds themselves are HUGE and hurt my ears after only having them in about 10 minutes. I threw them away and am back to my trusty Sony earphones...ahhhhh much better!  * The "protective pouch" is a JOKE! Seriously it's a drawstring bag that probably cost the company about a penny for 10 of them. Don't even waste your time trying to use it except maybe for long storage periods. I'm currently storing jewelery in mine!  * With as much as this player costs, Creative could have included a AC adapter. While being able to charge the player through the USB cable is nice when you're at home, if you travel it becomes a nuisance to find a computer to charge your player with.   * I've experienced the player trying to "idle shutdown" on me, usually when I'm listening to the FM Radio. This is mildly annoying and will stop if you just touch a button on the touchpad. I've read other reviewers having a similar problem so I think it's probably a bug in the product.  * Also sometimes when I've gone to connect my player to the USB to charge, it either doesn't recognize the player or something but it will not charge or let me organize files until I restart my computer. Again, mildly annoying and probably a bug in the product.   Overall I'm happy with my Zen Micro. The missing star is for the things that Creative overlooked or could have done better. Hope this review helped you.

<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First let me say the Zen Micro Photo has wonderful sound.  The ear plugs were of good sound quality.  I am very technically challenged my kids and husband have to help me with any thing technical.  I found the dial on the Zen Micro Photo to be impossible to operate.  It is VERY SENSITIVE to the touch, I could not even raise and lower the volume. Finally, when it began to freeze up on me regularly I did return this and Amazon kindly refunded all my money even the cost to ship it back.

<Title>Excellent product... better than Ipod?? At least its different
<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you want an alternative to the omnipresent ipod, then the creative zen microphoto might be for you. It works well, seems durable, and comes in a wide variety of colors. The only area it might suffer in an ipod-comparison are the menu controls; the controls on the ipod are tighter and less easily triggered on accident. It beats the ipod in that it offers FM radio and ummmm did I mention the wide variety of colors?? Definitely a good product.

<Title>Totally Worth It!
<Date>Sat Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was scared at first to buy this because I'm not a big spender, but I am 100% satisfied with my purchase! It's perfect to hold on to, put in you pocket or what have you. I use it at the gym, road trips, school (inbetween classes). It holds so many songs and photos also, I've not used even 1GB yet.  It's a purchase you won't regret, I keep telling others to look into getting one and the different colors you can choose from are a unique twist that's pleasant.

<Title>Zen - Great option to getting the IPOD
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted to avoid being like everyone else and purchased the Zen instead of an Apple product.  I did not want to be limited to Apple technology, when everying else I own is NOT Apple related.  I agree with pretty much everything Amber states. I have had my "purple" Zen 8 GB for about 4 months.  It has never frozen up on me, but does go "idle" at the most inappropriate times.  I really enjoy the ability to take my photos with me where ever I go. Zen gives you the ability to change the wallpaper and color of the menus to suit your personal choice.  This is great unless you select a color that is too light or dark and doesn't show on your wallpaper.  I enjoy the random play, but the system uses the same randomizing stratification, so you do hear the same songs over again if you listen more than 2-3 hours. I do suppose that has something to do with the number of songs loaded, (I have about 500 at this point).  The thing I dislike the most, and it is due more to my laziness than a product issue:  If an Album, Artist etc is spelled differently on two tracks when loaded, it will let you load the same song twice. Also, and worse in my opinion - if you load all songs from an album, and on one song the album name is misspelled, it does not find the song when you select that particular album to play.  It takes a long time to correct the categories prior to adding songs downloaded from different web sites.  This is not an issue if you copy directly from the CDs you own.  I have gotten around this by creating playlists.  The last, most irritating thing is that my computer does not always recognize the product when I plug it in. As Amber stated, I have to reboot almost every time.  I do use my dock station more often that just taking the player out on the road. I have never run the battery all the way down.  Bottom line:  a good alternative to the IPOD, but I wish I had waited two more months for the new 20 MB Zen product.  This is a selfish wish, since I probably won't use up all the memory on my current one for a long time.

<Title>Near Perfection...as for right now.
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Just got the black ZMP in the mail, and have to say, i love it. It looks great, it's small but not too small. Sound quality is great. I'm upgrading from a Rio Carbon, that i fortunately had for well over a year now, it still works! I just needed something new (a color screen) and a little more storage as my library grows to about 4.5 gigs. The gentle blue light that rings around the perimeter is absolutely amazing, it really make the ZMP look great, along with a light which backs the power button/Hold switch... As for sound quality, at first, i couldn't really find a difference between the ZMP and my Rio Carbon, however, once i tweaked the custom (recommended), sound was great. However, don't use the Bass Boost function if you listen to Rock or Hip-Hop-Rap, the low bass tones sound horrible. My suggestion, is to set the EQ in a nice u/V shape, and turn on Smart Sound, this feature really cleans up the sound of your music. The thing is, i listen to about 99% rap, and 1% R%B, so i can't speak for classical music, jazz, etc. As you can probably tell, everything up till now, has been nice. Now for my main pet peeve. The touch pad, like you probably know about if you've been researching, it can be kind of aggravating. In my honest opinion, the UI (user interface) is almost perfect, I honestly, can't  think of any changes I'd make to it. The cool thing, is that with the main menu, you can easily use checkboxes, within the Player Settings, of what things you want on your main menu. Direct albums, settings, calendar, things like that. But back the touch pad. Unlike the ZMP's little bigger brother, the Zen Sleek (not the Zen Vision:M), none of its buttons are tactile, meaning they don't physically click. Creative has added a nice feature, every time you touch a button on the pad, the player will actually click, which you can hear outside of your headphones, so this may annoy others. It does take time to get used to the pad, but if this is #1 pet peeve, nothing else will be. The screen is nice, though it's not an LCD, it's not as bright, but this really isn't noticeable... The screen is OLED, like the Zen Sleek a new type of technology, which is viewable at really any angle, unlike LCD. This basically means that if you turn the player to the side about 60 to 80 degrees, you can still see the screen as if it wasn't tilted at all, good screen overall! However, if you plan to use this player outside on bright days, you may want to re-consider a player with an LCD. The OLED is almost 0% viewable, as i noticed just today... But at the price i got it at, it's definitely worth it. As also probably know, no picture viewing, and listening to music simultaneously, a realy, real bummer, plus, no album art. Bad move Creative... it seems not many companies at all can get this right.  Conclusion. Compared to my Carbon, this thing is nice! The one thing I'm worried about is battery life. My Carbon had a "20 hour" as Rio said, as the ZMP is supposed to have 15, we'll see how that goes. Basically, the ZMP, 8GB player is for those who have a little bit of music, up to around 2000+ songs, give or take if they're WMA or MP3, who wants picture capability (JPEG only unfortunately). The only problems I see with this player are; the touch pad, which even with low sensitivity can be very touchy, you easily get used to it though. And no album art, or simultaneous image viewing and music listening... Definitely recommended, I  really give this player a 4.5, but ya know,, I'll give it a 5, for now.  P.S. Fortunately, i bought this player through Amazon, from J&R Music, because of their affiliation. The price at my purchase was cheap, Creative also has a rebate offer out.

<Title>Creative Zen Micro Photo 8 GB MP3 Player Black
<Date>Fri Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This review is coming from someone who had an iPod Nano.  This is the best mp3 player for the price. I had a nano, but it crashed after about a month and a half.  Pros: Design: very bright blue glow, looks even better in the dark Capacity: it is hard to find an 8 GB Mp3 player that is trustworthy for this price REMOVABLE rechargeable battery: sometimes an Mp3 player will stop working because the battery is screwed up. On the very unlikely chance that it happens to this Mp3 player, just buy a new battery, no more sending it back to the factory and waiting 3 weeks for your music Color screen: graphics aren't quite as good as the nano, but still above average Durable: this Mp3 player is known for taking a punch. I have rarely heard cases of it crashing. Another thing is that the screen is much better than the iPod. After carrying an iPod in my shirt pocket for just an hour, there were scratches all over, and before that I put it in the case it came with and it got scratched just from pulling it in and out. I've been carrying the MicroPhoto in my jean pocket for a few weeks and there isn't one scratch. FM Radio: some radio stations get average reception, some get amazing reception, but making presets is easy Voice recording: the best voice recording quality I have ever heard in an Mp3 player Controls: Everyone said it is difficult, but I just used it for 5, maybe 10 minutes, and I thought it was better than the iPod. Also, the on switch is in a good place. It is almost impossible to accidently turn it on in your pocket Sound quality: The headphones are great and the sound quality is better than the iPod Not very common: Everybody has an iPod. If someone sees you with an iPod, they don't care, they have seen it before. The MicroPhoto is eyecatching. Battery life: even better than the iPod  Cons: Music software: It is not bad at all, but just not quite as good as iTunes Accesories: hard to find in stores, but you won't need a case because this player is very durable No album art: just a minor flaw No multi-tasking: the music goes off if you click on photos, but again, a minor flaw Battery charging: takes longer than the iPod   Things the iPod Nano has over the MicroPhoto: 1.Slightly better screen 2.Smaller and lighter 3.Games 4.Music Software 5.Comes with $30 iTunes Music Card 6.Album art and multi-tasking 7.Accesories 8.Slightly faster battery charging  Things the MicroPhoto has over the iPod Nano: 1.Bigger screen 2.Better looking (In my opinion) 3.Durability 4.Price: For $250, you can get either a 4GB Nano or the MicroPhoto with 2X more space 5.FM Radio 6.Voice Recording 7.Sound Quality 8.Removeable rechargeable battery 9.Better battery life 10.Dedicated volume: there is no switch, but if you're buried in the menus, you can press the side menu and change it there 11.FM tuner 12.Avalaible in many colors (Black, gary, white, pink, purple, green, orange, light blue, dark blue, and red) 13.Track info 14.8 different wallpaper themes  Well, the MicroPhoto just seems better to me.If you want the best Mp3 player for the cost, get this. If you want what all your friends have and just want to fit in, get the Nano, and if you want the best Mp3 player period, and you don't care about money, check out the ZEN Vision.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Fri Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I've only had my Microphoto for about a week and a half now, but I am very happy with it.  It's been working fine with no bugs and no issues.  Yes, the controls take a little getting used to, but the touchpad isn't rocket science, I wouldn't even say it takes days like some of the other have mentioned.  Expect to get frustrated once or twice, then learn from your mistakes and get it down in short order.  The ear buds aren't the most comfortable I've used, but they work fine and sound quality is ok.  I like the flexibility of using almost any music source (as a long time Yahoo music patron) and I didn't want to have "just another IPod" like everyone else I know ... so I got the Microphoto and got twice the storage of the 4G Nano for the same price.   Call me a satisfied customer!!!

<Title>Very good player
<Date>Sat Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great player for people who want more space than what's offered on flash players like the iPod Nano, but don't need 30 gig of music in their pocket (what the iPod has to offer).  It's a mini harddrive player with some neat bells & whistles, and solid, meaty basics.  Here are a few of the pros and cons.  PROS 1. Physical size: small enough to fit in your pocket, not so small you could lose it. 2. Storage: the complete works of Bruce Springsteen (including Tracks, and including certain songs being listed more than once), in 128 bit MP3 format, takes up less than 1.5 GB.  8 GB is more than enough for the average person who might just use an MP3 player for commuting or going to the gym. 3. Sound: AWESOME.  Even with the standard issue headphones, it's still got great quality.  I use this on a city bus that often has very loud, rambunctious high school students (they're great kids, just loud), and I don't even need to hit the halfway point on the volume setting to drown them out.  As an added benefit, if you have no interest in getting separate headphones, you can crank the sound up pretty high and the sound will not be audible to those around you (I went to 3/4 full volume on a not-so-crowded bus and lightly covered the earbuds with my fingers), so you'll likely never be the idiot broadcasting his/her playlist to everyone around you unless you like deafening yourself. 4. Screen: good-sized, clear.   5. Rechargeable AND removable battery: no more contacting the manufacturer when the battery wears out.  Just go to your local electronics store and pick one up. 6. FM Radio: a lot of people will wonder why you need this on an MP3 player, but it's great if you're a commuter who takes the train to where you parked your car.  While you're on the train, you can listen for traffic reports - no more getting on the road only to find too late that your regular route is backed up and jammed.  Just listen to the radio on the train and plan an alternate route.  You can also record from the radio, if you hear a hard-to-find song being played (common for folks who listen to classic rock). 7. Charges while hooked up to your computer: this is handy for when you're loading songs and messing around with playlists.  Takes a few hours to get a full charge, but you can just leave it there overnight and it'll go to idle automatically when it's done.  I think you can also get a wall-charger for traveling with this, but I've never needed one, so I couldn't say for sure. 8. User interface: very easy to navigate the tracks (it'll break it down by album, artist, genre, or you can just view all tracks at once), very easy to mess about with the settings, and the background image can be customized. 9. Compatible with music subscription services: this is one of the reasons I didn't consider the iPod at all.  They're not compatible with things like Rhapsody-To-Go or the Napster subscription service.  With the Creative Zen Micro Photo, I can either buy a single song, or use the subscription services (which I love). 10. Easy to add music: it's basically just drag-and-drop, once you have the basics installed. 11. Use it as both an MP3 player and a removable drive: you can partition the unit to have a bit of space for other files to transport between computers. 12. Add songs to a playlist while listening to other songs: say you're listening to a song/album.  You decide you want to listen to more songs when you're done with the current song/album.  On a lot of other players, you'd have to stop/pause the song you're listening to, or wait until it was done, before adding other stuff to your playlist.  On the Micro Photo, you don't have to stop the music - just go to the track/album listing, and choose to add to the current playlist.  Cooler in action than in writing, trust me.  CONS 1. It's fugly.  Seriously, if the iPod is Keanu Reeves, the Micro Photo is Ron Jeremy.  But this only matters if you care more about looks than about having a functional, solid MP3 player.  Much like Ron Jeremy, you don't have to look at this thing to know that it's doing a bang-up job. 2. Not too many accessories.  This is an iPod's world, sadly, so it's hard to find cases and other doohickies for this, but they're out there if you look. 3. Shortish battery life: I got about 15 hours out of it.  That's still a long time, but there are other players with a longer battery life out there (Samsung makes a Nano-killer with about 30 hours, for instance).  This is one of the places where the swappable battery comes in handy - if you're on a long road trip, 15 hours can go by quickly, so have an extra battery on hand just in case. 4. There's no social status help.  This is important only to parents getting an MP3 player for their young teen or tween who may be more interested in popularity than in shopping around for the best possible player.  iPods are more popular than any other player, though there are many technically superior players.  Having a non-iPod might actually hurt your child's popularity, especially if they're halfway on the rise but not one of the popular kids just yet.  Be aware of why your kid is asking for an MP3 player - if it is, in part, to be more popular, just go with the iPod, unless you're trying to make them see that what's popular might not be what's best (though why you'd use an MP3 player to teach that, I don't know).  This point is not important if you're just getting it for someone who cares more about technical superiority than social status, but bear it in mind if you're buying it for someone obsessed with popularity. 5. Slow startup screen.  Still, it's only a few seconds longer than other players.  COULD GO EITHER WAY: -Touchscreen instead of clicky-buttons.  I got used to the touchscreen very quickly, but I'm used to touchpads on notebook computers.  Your mileage may vary.  For what it's worth, the touchpad sensitivity is adjustable. -Voice recorder: I don't actually use this function but, like the FM radio, someone might find it useful. -Volume control is part of the on-screen menu: where most players have an actual button, rocker switch, or scroll physically on the player's body, this one has a dropdown menu that includes the volume control.  It's easy to access, but I can see where some might want the volume control to be an actual physical switch.  Hope this helps in your search for the right MP3 player.  By the way, I'm not an audiophile - I'm really just an average person who likes having a good player.  I gave it 5 stars because none of the cons actually matter to me; I'm not a popularity-obsessed teen, I don't care that it's ugly, I don't use it more than five or six hours out of the day, and I'm not so impatient that I can't wait six or seven seconds before I can start listening to my music.

<Title>One of my favorite buys
<Date>Wed Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It took me about a month to decide weither I wanted that other popular MP3 player, whose name will not be said, though it sounds like "Eye Cod", or a Creative Zen. The Creative won. There are many things that the Creative does that the other does not. For example there is an FM radio on the Creative, and you are not tied down to using "Eye Toons". I personally prefer to use Windows Media Player. It has wonderful sound. I mostly use it in my car and it sounds much like a CD without the skips. It's not all wonderful, there are a few problem, but they are easily fixable. For a while the dial was way too sensitive, but through my exploration I found that there is a way to adjust the sensitivity. At last!! Everything was great until it began to freeze. But agian easily fixed. I went to the creative website and explained the problem, within two days they sent me an e-mail with step-by-step instructions to repair the player. AHA!! Everything is now perfect and I am more that satisfied with my purchase.

<Title>Great Player, but no Audible support...
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player!  It takes time to get used to the touch-buttons (I've never used an ipod before), and the ability to view photos while music is playing would be nice, but in general this is a nicely-executed product.  My biggest gripe however, is the lack of Audible support.  Creative has done a good job of making it's devices compatible with this popular audio-book service - I find it an incredible oversight that support wasn't included with the Microphoto.  Be aware of this if you decide to purchase one.    To 'digitally-sign' a petition for Creative to include support in the next firmware update, head over to the Creative Lab Discussion Forums, and search for: "Petition: Audible support for Zen Microphoto & all future Creative players (including Vision:M)"  I'd rate 4-or-5 stars if this support was there, since this is my primary use of an MP3 player.

<Title>Very Cool Little Player
<Date>Sun Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this one after shoping around a lot with different players and reviews. I am VERY happy with it. It has plenty of storage for the price, intuitive controls, and a great looking screen. The sound quality is very good.. I've been using my own head phones though, and haven't tried the ones that came with it. The only draw backs that I can say is that you cannot listen to music while looking at the pictures on the device, and also that you need to plug it into your computer to charge it unless you buy a seperate wall charger. Also, I would like to add that relative to my old player, it is very very easy to load and organize data on the device as well. Overall I would definitly recommend it!

It downloads music easily and is simple to handle and carry.  It is also cute as can be!  I like the recording function.  If you are a traditional or folk musician as I "pretend" to be...it is great for capturing a session of songs or tunes so that you can play them back and learn them later.

<Title>A good MP3 Player until you have to take the battery out....
<Date>Sat May 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this mp3 player after doing much research online, I was excited about all the rave reviews I read, I guess I should have went to customer-oriented sites like this to see how it lasts in real world situations. I am not new to mp3 players I have had an ipod which I loved and was sad when it met its demise, so i decided to buy this product....big mistake...after only having it for less than a month it froze on me, I tried reseting it with no results, so I read in the manual that you can remove the battery and reset it that way...Well that resulted in my hard drive deleting all of my songs, and my computer no longer recognized the player. Apparently this is a problem with the creative firmware erasing everything and no longer be recognized by the comp.  I would have to recommend not getting this one and going with another brand.

<Title>I have this player exactly and it's great!
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A nice plus that I didn't know about from online pictures is that the border of the metal grey face glows a brilliant blue. It's beautiful. I was initially relucatant to go with another brand aside from the coveted iPods, but this mp3 player is absolutely beautiful! Ipods look darb next to the brilliant display of the Zen.  pros -Great Sound -Easy To Use Software (You can load songs from different computers, untlike the iPod. I just went to a friend's house yesterday and took 20 songs from his trance collection, he only needed to download an online zen driver to give the songs to me - just drag and drop) -8GB is perfect for me. -Great size: It fits in the mini-pocket that many jeans have! -Comfortable in my hand. -If you know how to edit mp3 Tags, the player automatically categorizes the music for you. -My hand oils do not show smears over any of the mp3 player (though I avoid touching the LED display screen). I need to get a case. -Feels very durable.  cons -Earbuds are like those iPod earbuds. They don't snuggle well in most people's ears. Though the sound is good with the earbuds. -There have been reviews commenting on the frailty of the headphone port(hole). I'll see what happens in six months.  Neutral -If you don't know how to edit the tagging of mp3 player files, the player will have a messy categorization. To edit tagging, simply open realplayer, load songs into the library, highlight songs you want to edit and right click, push edit. If you want to avoid the trouble of dealing with "albums" and "genres" just highlight all your songs and you cant instantaneously put "?" or some other generic symbol for the albums and genres categories. -You don't need the "Yahoo! Music" software they give you if you already have a means of obtaining mp3s. All you need is the "Creative Explorer" and you can import all the mp3s and photos you want.  Overall -FANTASTIC VALUE!!! Appearance was never a big deal to me, but I am truly proud of my Zen for its cool blue character.

<Title>Beware of OS requirement
<Date>Wed May 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just got this and was surprised to find that this MP3 player does *not* work with any OS other than Windows XP.  I have Win2k at work so I can't even charge the player right now -- apparently you'll have to install the software first on an XP system and then connect the USB cable, which doubles as the AC charge cable.  There is *no* separate AC adapter in the package.  BTW, charging takes 5 hours, which is ridiculously long.  I'm disappointed Creative doesn't even include an AC adpater which would have cost them less than a dollar to make in Chinese sweatshops.  The vertical touchpad can drive you nuts, and is quite counter-intuitive.  For example, you cannot tap the up or down area to go down a list one item at a time; instead, you must move your finger to scroll, so it's very easy to "overshoot" the item you want.  To enter, you can hard-tap anywhere on the vertical bar, not just the center, which is not obvious at all.  The menu system is poorly designed.  For instance, it's not obvious at all how to go back to the "Now Playing" screen from a menu screen.  And what's driving me nuts right now is there seems no way to get back to the original background wallpaper.  But contrary to one "popular" reviewer claims, you *can* adjust the volume easily.  In the play screen, just scroll up or down the vertical touchpad.  In other screens (i.e., menus), just press the lower-right option button which gives you access to volume control.  FM radio sensitivity is not great; I'm right here in an open area near downtown Boston.  My Panasonic FM CD player has perfect reception and clarity, but not the Zen Micro Photo, which gives a lot of static noise.  The OLED screen is a big letdown so far.  It's really dark, even at the highest contrast level.  There's no brightness contorl, just contrast.  The sample pictures Creative bundles all look unimpressive at best.  Battery life is really disappointing.  My other hard drive-based MP3 player is a Sony NW-HD3, the thin one with 20GB capacity.  On a charge the Sony can last 20-30 hours playing MP3 tracks.  With the Zen MicroPhoto, I seem to be getting no more than 6-8 hours per charge.  I kid you not.  I don't shuffle or look at the photos any more -- cuz the screen really sucks for viewing photos -- but I swear I'm not getting more than eight hours, probably actually far less, per charge.  I talked to a coworker who has an earlier version of Zen Micro and he had the same problem.  The Zen's are made in Malaysia, a country hostile towards the U.S., so maybe they just put in defective parts to screw us.  I don't know.  I'm not happy about teh battery life.  Sound quality is good, but far inferior to my Sony NW-HD3.  As a couple other reviewers have pointed out, adjusting the EQ (equalizer) does absolutely nothing to sound quality.  I haven't tried the bass boost because I listen mostly to classical.  I use a good pair of Sony earphones.  I must say I'm not unhappy with the sound quality, and the volume can go higher than my Sony NW-HD3 player, so I think in the sound department this is good.  If only they made the EQ a real thing...  Getting MP3 files to the player is easy.  I like the Media Explorer.  Will probably never use the other utility, MediaSource which is like a jukebox.  Media Explorer works like Windows so it's quite intuitive.  I also like the CD ripping utility.  As I was never a fan of iTune's demented ugly interface or MusicMatch's constant pop-up ads, Media Explorer turned out to be the best part of this whole package.  Overall, I think the Zen MicroPhoto is quite disappointing.  I experienced a crash on the 12th day of ownership: after turning on, the big Creative logo appeared but the unit froze.  I had to remove the battery to reset the player, per Creative's instructions.  The overall user interface is really lacking in refinement and user-friendliness.  The battery life is too short.  Styling is decent, and many friends have said mine looked cute.  Ok, I'm a guy and I don't want something "cute."  I want something that works well.  In that aspect, Singapore-based Creative Technology falls short yet again.  Looks like their 15%-to-9% market share fall over the past 12 months will continue to shrink as Apple's iPods take over the world (until the U.S. government decides to sue Apple for being a monopoly).

<Title>I searched and compared
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to laugh at myself when I realize how hooked I am to this gadget.  I remember having a conversation with a woman in my exercise class who was walking and listening to her IPOD.  I asked her what the benefit was to having an IPOD over listening to a radio.  She said you can listen to what you like and not to what the DJ decides to play.  I could not relate because I just thought "so you change the station".    I bought a Palm TX and decided to venture into using the MP3 feature just out of curiousity.  Well, I became addicted.  Before I knew it I was searching for a good buy on a 1 GB SD card because I had use up my 512.  Then I spoke to a friend who said that an MP3 player gives you more space and you don't have to buy expansion cards.  So, I was on the web reading reviews and searching for the best player.  I searched and compared for a couple of weeks and bought the Creative Zen Micro Photo 8 GB Black.  I was amazed at how small it is compared to my Palm.  But, I was impressed with the capacity of this player.  It sounds great and was not hard to figure out.  The touch pad is a little "touchy" but I feel that I will adapt. My greatest criticism is the USB charger/sych cord, it is much to short making it awkward to access when transfering music (this is why I gave it 4 stars).  I was leary of using Yahoo Unlimited and had in fact previously canceled my trail subscription because it was giving me more challenges than I needed.  I was using Napster and was pleased with the service.  Curiosity got the best of me so I inserted the CD that came in the ZEN MP box and downloaded the engine.  Right off I notice that there were updates added. So, I was encouraged that the bugs may have been addressed. I also found the transfer of music to the device to be very simple.  You don't need WMP to do this unlike Napster.  Also the "TO GO" version is cheaper than Napster's as is the costs to burn a CD.    I am truly into my ZEN MP.  I feel good about not getting caught up in the IPOD madness.  I read many of the reviews and believe I made the best choice.  In nearly a week I have transfered 200 songs. I look forward to exploring for new songs.  This is a great player at a good price.

<Title>Disappointed BIG TIME!
<Date>Sat May 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this little mp3 player 4 months ago. Guess what? Now the battery life is 1 hour or less! The only good thing is that the battery is replacable but still who would like to replace the battery every 4 months. I highly recommend that you just get an Ipod even if this thing is cheaper. At least wait until Creative does something about their battery life.

<Title>Great looking MP3 BUT
<Date>Sun May 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Micro Photo 8GB Mp3 player is a beauty.  I have to say though that after owning for less than 10 days the player just froze the the Creative Zen Micro screen.  I tried taking out the battery and putting it back in but it still froze at exactly the same place.  I just decided to return it rather than replace it.

<Title>couldn't load music on it
<Date>Wed May 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Zen Touch 20Gb that I loved, but after 2 1/2 years of hard use, it stopped working.  So, I bought this one.  It was great when I took it out of the package.  I downloaded all the programs and hooked it up to the computer to charge.  After it finished charging, I tried to download music on it and I couldn't.  No matter what I did, my computer would not recognize the player.  I kept getting messages that the player was not detected.  I tried another computer and I got the same results.  After researching the problem and calling the company, I found out that this is a common complaint with this product.  I am so disappointed and I am returning it.

<Title>A Worthy Opponent of Ipod
<Date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me just say that this is a fantastic MP3 player. I had my worries since I'm new to Creative products but they were thrown out the window when this player arrived. The software that comes with it is ridiculousy easy to use and within fifteen minutes of owning it, I had four albums ripped to my Zen. Easy navigation and great interface are some of the best features. Not to mention its sleek build. This is a much better choice over any Ipod and is well worth the price.

<Title>Good features, poor quality and horrible customer support.
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Functionally (when it works) this is a great product with just the right feature set.  Unfortunately, it is made by a company with horrible policies and service.  My first player had a screen defect.  I returned it the first day.  Then the second one stopped working only 80 days from purchase.  I called and described the issue (10 minute boot time, no longer recognized by PC), and they said I can pay for support.  80 days out and I pay for support?  Buy an iPod.

<Title>Zen Micro Photo .........very complicated device
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Super speedy delivery from Amazon.com as always. However this MP3 player is unbelievably complicated.........navigating through the player itself is fairly straightforward but trying to organize, delete or move files around from your computer is an exercise in frustration. In fact it's so complicated that tech support were not able to provide me with really pretty base information on deleting files while the device is plugged into the computer! I have experience with database design using programs like Access; this little product is more complicated. I'm sure there are solutions to the problems I'm experiencing but the question is how much time should you have to spend learning new software and organizing data in order to get the most out of your MP3 player?

<Title>Not for novices!!! The Worst Customer Service Ever!!!
<Date>Tue May 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>A friend of mine owns one of these.  She purchased it because her sister-in-law had one.  What she didn't know is that her sister-in-law didn't know how to use it.  She came to me for help loading mp3s on it which I figured out.  The problem is that just because the device is loaded with mp3s, it doesn't mean you can play the songs.  I helped her out with this as well after calling the customer service phone number.  They were no help what so ever.  All they wanted was purchase info and the serial number of the device.  Then they proceeded to tell me that they couldn't help me but would send me a couple of emails with info.  They also informed me that my friend had 30 days worth of customer support and after that period it would cost her money if she needed any further help.  I think this STINKS!  She paid over $200 for this device.  I think they could offer a bit better customer service and for a longer period of time.  I ended up figuring things out by "playing with the device" for a while.  I would not recommend this device to anyone.

<Title>Nice features, questionable quality & support
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like the features of this unit (color screen, fm radio, voice recorder, 8 gb), but there are a few quirks that prevent me from recommending it.    First, the touch controls are unpredictable.  I've adjusted the sensitivity of the touchpad, but it's still jumpy.  I practically need to slam the play/pause button in order to get it to respond, but the slider control is hyper-sensitive.  Second, a very minor issue is the ergonomics/functionality of the on/off switch.  It is placed in an awckward position and it's difficult to know whether or not you've actually turned the unit on/off.   Both of the first two could be overlooked if not for the next two:  There is no easy way to transfer playlists from WMP 10 into the player.  All the songs on your playslist will transfer, but they will no longer be organized in a playlist once they land on the Zen.  This is a huge hassle, and I don't know whether it's a WMP 10 issue or a Zen issue.  The WMP 11 beta appears to resolve this problem, but I had other compatability issues (unrelated to the Zen) with the WMP 11 beta and had to uninstall it.  Finally, and this is the kicker - the battery refuses to charge!  It chaged once, but since then it simply won't charge.  It can remain plugged in to my computer's USB port for hours (6 hours or more), and the unit indicates that it's charging, but the charge never goes beyond about 10%.  I've tried different computers and sometimes it won't even charge at all.  Others have reported similar charging problems on the Creative user's forum but Creative seems to have no answer other than send it back to them for a replacement.  I've attempted to contact Creative via their web support, but have only recieved automated (and unhelpful) responses so far.  I have no interest in switching to i-Tunes, so an iPod is out of the question.  I like the features and cost of the Zen, but there are serious quirks and the customer support is lacking.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To begin, the Zen Micro Photo is nothing short of amazing. I love it. It's sleek, compact, and stylish. One thing that really got me was the fact that it has 8GB of space; thats a Nano killer right there.  Pros 1. The Zen Micro Photo is wonderfully small and compact. Very sturdy build. 2. The fact that it has 8GB of space is great. 3. The OLED screen is beautiful, and the blue light that runs around the edge is pretty cool when it lights up. 4. This thing has a pretty good battery life depending on the way you use it. Mine usually last around 10-12 hours. And the batteries are replaceable, big ipod killer again. 5. Fast transfer of music to player (depending on the kind of computer you have) 6. Sound quality is excellent..... The preset EQ's are OK.  Cons 1. To begin, the touch pad is very very touchy, meaning that you have to be careful how you touch it because it can react to the slightest thing... but you can set the sensitivity. Also you practically have to smash the play/pause button to get it to react(minor complaint); there's a trick to it, you kinda have to slide your finger across the play/pause button. 2. The OLED screen is difficult to see in sunlight (minor complaint). 3. This is my only big complaint but it's kind of a user/product conflict. When transfering music to the mp3 player, if you don't want your music all jumbled up, the mp3 tags may need to be organized. To organize the tags is a lengthy process. You may have to go into the organizing program and rename artists, songs, etc.....  Other 1. Don't really know when I'm gonna be using that FM radio
