<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPNB52/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-2136909-3390043">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Pink (2nd Generation)</a>  Could not get it to sync, charge, etc. The only thing it said was "Do not Disconnect". Sent it back and, after a few days, Apple returned it with upgraded firmware, but did not admit there was a problem. Works good now. Note to Steve: I have used DHL for electronics returns twice and have had miserable service both times. Please use a better freight company.
