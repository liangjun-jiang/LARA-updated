<Title>Sensative touchpad
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading a good review in one of my computer magazines I decided to buy this. I like the fact one isn't tied to Apple. There isn't much in the way of visuals on this. You have a very small display screen in black and white. My biggest gripe is the device is very small so when you handle it you can't help but hit the buttons which are very sensative. I don't have large hands so I imagine a person with them would have even a harder time manipulating the controls.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this item for over a month and its great. The only thing I wish was different is that would like for it to self install on a computer without having to install the softwear that came with it. Other than that it's great. battery lasts long.

<Title>Don't hesitate...you can't beat it for the money
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a sharp little device (I have it in black), it's easy to set up and use and 2gb is a lot of space to fill.    Several people have made note of the "sensitive touch-pad", and this WOULD be a real concern, but Samsung has either fixed it, or the previous reviewers didn't notice that there is a "hold" switch that disables the touch-pad.  This is a great feature, because without that switch the touch-pad would be really annoying because it is sensitive. And, even though I have large fingers I can still easily maneuver the volume and search controls.  The sound is excellent.  Even as I'm writing this review I'm hearing things in a song I've never heard before...maybe it's just that I'm hearing it through headphones...but the music sounds great.    My only knock on this product is that the USB plug appears to be an accident waiting to happen.  Once it "pops" out, there's no cover or guard to protect it.

<Title>It does NOT work as a USB Drive.
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Note: This YP - U3 will NOT work as a USB Drive. it used to work, then Samsung & Microsoft Teamed up to update the firmwire in this device, it can NOT be used as a usb drive now. and it ONLY work on windows XP (not even 2000), no linux, no mac.   And you will need Admin privilege to install the driver. (so if you want to transfer file between computer, this thing won't work).  I am IT engineer so I did a lot research on this and managed to update the firm ware. But it is such a hassle. I won't buy this thing if I know in advance it won't work as a usb drive.  I repeat, It will NOT work as a usual usb drive. you will have to install drivers on the computer. The description in Amazon in not accurate.    if you have a firm ware early than 1.07, it might work. most of them are 1.11 now.   Hope this will save you some money and time.

<Title>Gretat little player
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had this little mp3 player for a week and I love it. I have been involved with audio of many types for 40 years, and this player sounds as good as any I've used (except for my 20 y/o Denon turn table). It has good bass and clear highs, which, if the piece is decently engineered, are not edgy or metalic. Of course, it helps that it has a decent equilizer with which to adjust the frequency band and take it a few db down at 16000 mhz, and add a few db at 40 and 60hz, with a little boost in the midrange around 1000 mhz. Yes, the touch controls are sensitive, as many have mentioned, but the "hold" switch works fine. Also the software is terrific and makes it very easy to download mp3s and entire cds into the player. So, highly reccomended.
