<Title>Simple little player
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a very simple to use player. Just hook it up so it can charge up, add your songs and it's ready to use. It also doulbes as a storage device ala sandisk cruzer. I probably won't use that feature until I upgrade to a video player like the Zune. The controls are it's weak point. They are so ensitive that sometimes instead of lowering/increasing the volume, it ends up changing the song forward/back. If you have big fingers or stubby fingers then you will not enjoy the controls on this player. Otherwise it is a decent player.

<Title>Probably won't play any better than the 512MB

<Content>Please see my review of the 512MB version.  Not recommended unless the price drops a lot more.
