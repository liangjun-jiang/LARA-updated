<Content>Start up time is a little annoying, shuffle feature doesn't shuffle very well and upgrading the firmware has yet to be accomplished.  Aside from that, I'm happy with the price I paid, the fact that it is more durable than most other MP3 players out there, no proprietary software or format.  I have yet to purchase a decent rechargeable battery, a Duracell will last around 10-12 hours.  I was impressed with the fact that it has voice recorder and FM radio capabilities, don't use them much but I like the fact that I can.  I use mine constantly, bought one for the wife as well.  Best part is, if I do break it, it only cost me $50 dollars.

<Title>useless product

<Content>I bought this product after being caught up with the features it offered, got the product and loved it. I used all it features as soon as i got it. However one week after recieving this product it went unfunctional. My computer would not recoginse it and when i tried to power it on it will come on and freeze on the busy screen. Tried it over and over and it never worked again. ended up buying a Sony nw-s205f mp3 playerafter reading reviews over the net on this product. Seems like this product is not very good because there have been widespread problems with it. I recommend customers not to buy this product.
