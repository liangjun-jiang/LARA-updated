Thinner and lighter than my 60GB with video, and the navigation is superior. I really enjoy cover flow. I can finally get my entire music library, over 1000 CDs, on one tiny device. Amazing. Those who do videos may want to spring for the 160GB version, but this meets my needs perfectly. The new iPod touch is impressive, too, but the capacity is too limited. When Apple comes out with the 80GB model I'll be the first in line.

Can't believe how good this player is.  Great build quality, features & sound.  No complaints whatsoever.  For those who grump about the sound, 2 tips:  invest in a decent pair of headphones (e.g. in ear Shures)and rip your music at a high variable bit rate.
