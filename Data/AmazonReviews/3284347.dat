<Title>...a technological NIGHTMARE! updates, firmwares, more firmwares, more updates, fixes... Ugh!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my brother and thought "well... let me try it and maybe I'll buy one for me too".  Big mistake!  I popped the CD into my computer and made all the installation of the CONNECT software (the software you use to load this unit with mp3 files). Tried to use it and nothing. Strange messages kept on appearing saying there was a failure of some of the software's elements...  I tried the product support link on the same installation CD and got appaled when I discovered an incredible array of additional fixes, firmwares and other technological mistakes I was supposed to download and instal.  There was even an alternate software for those who thought the previous journey was too complicated (how sweet!!!).  I tried that one too and it still does not work on my computer.  I'll be returning the unit and getting something that actually works.  I'll forget this ever happened!  ...By the way, this player player comes with two demo songs (the only songs I succeeded on playing). They sounded great. This player has great sound... but I don'r see any point having it if the software it uses is so bad.

<Title>Nice little player
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchsed this item after having owned the Sony Psych 512 mb player.  I recieved the player three days after ordering (kudos to Amazon on again providing great service).  I already had Sonic Stage 3.0 installed on my computer and upgraded to the 4.0 version included with the player, which was a breeze.  Sony estimated a 20-30 minute load time but I had it loaded and running in less than 10.  I have read numerous reviews that Sonic Stage is horrible software and impossible to use.  I have had no problems with it other than a download problem with two songs which later was found to be a problem on Sony's end and they promptly credited my account for the error.  The player itself is pretty cool in design; I especially like the display screen.  It allows you to download your own playlists directly from Sonic Stage, or you can build your own directly on the player.  It holds a fair amount of songs (5000+) and the sound quality is everything that you'd expect from Sony.  The menus are easy to navigate through and the player is small enough to fit in a pocket and is not any heavier than a cell phone.  It's a solidly made device.  There are accessories out there to go with it such as speakers and FM transmitters; not as many as I-pod, but enough to have a nice little set-up.  For those of you who want a device that is not overly complicated, with solid hardware, you could do worse.

<Title>Very Good feminine look player
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is a very nice mp3 player with a feminine touch. it plays mp3s in a very nice sound quality. it has what it takes to be one of the best gifts for your gf. nice look, great color, innovative display, compact size. supports playlists, album, genre .... etc. some times it does not recognise some mp3 files. if you faced this problem, simply, convert it to WMA with any conversion tool and back to mp3 with no loss in quality and you are done. I recommend it.    
<Overall>5
