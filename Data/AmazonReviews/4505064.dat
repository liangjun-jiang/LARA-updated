<Title>Yes, previous slams on this product are true
<Date>Wed Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really wanted to like this product.  With SD slot with flash based memory and Wi-Fi, you can't hardly miss, right?  Archos missed the broad side of the barn on this one.    What it does do right; beautiful display, responsive touch screen, easy GUI and file transfer it is more then crippled by its numerous short comings.  First, my battery life was more like 3 hours for video.  It was definetely no where near the 5.5 touted on the specs page.  Second, it was VERY prone to lockups will using the WiFi.  Third, several songs had skips in them after they were transfered to the unit.  Lastly, Archos technical support was little to no help.  In reference to a question I sent them about the lock-ups, their response was to simply restart the unit.  That's it.  I will be returning this unit for a Meizu 8gb.  While it doesn't have Wifi or a SD slot, I won't feel handcuffed by the 4gb limitation.  Also, according to EVERY review I have read here and at Newegg, they are rock solid.  Something I can't say about the Archos 605.

<Title>Overall decent device,  but Archos needs to stop restricting potential
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This includes items about the DVR dock, which I had also purchased.  Cons - Archos website unnecessarily cumbersome, and not intuitive  - Archos support is nonexistant - Proprietary plug as an attempt to limit options to Archos accessories - Without the dock and extra plugins, the device is extremely limited - Won't play simple MPEG video without the plugin purchase. My camera takes short videos in MPEG, and this would have been nice. - Old WMV7 and WMV8 not supported - I still can't get the TV Program Guide to work (DVR dock needed) - ...and the TV Program Guide is only free for one year - Device aesthetics not up to par with competitors  Pros - SD card slot allows quick access to media without the need to use a PC - Best screen resolution for devices in its class - Has an external speaker. Not the best, but handy to have - Ability to connect wirelessly to UPnP shares....though I have yet been able to get it to work - Ability to record (DVR dock needed) - Ability to use USB Mass Storage Devices. I used an external hard drive and USB thumbdrives (DVR dock needed)  Having to pay extra for the plugins and browser is ridiculous. The DVR dock is also a necessity to fully enjoy the features of this device, and should be included. If this nickel and diming continues, I will be sure this is the last Archos product I buy.

<Title>Bad customer service & lousy web browser
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using Archos products for several years. But this product upgrade turned out to be a big headache. The customer service and the website to purchase plugin are horrible. Once the product arrived, I went to their website to purchase the web browser plugin. After adding the item into the cart, the currency symbol changed from USD $ to something else which I didn't recognize. I went ahead to place the order and later on found I was charged in Euro (equal to $43 instead of $30) instead. I contacted the customer service, and they insistd I selected the wrong country, which I am sure is not the case. I have tried again and again on my computer and the same thing happens everytime. However, Archos customer service still insisted it was me who made the mistake and finally ignored my emails. I am a software developer and the only thing I can think of is that their website defaults to Euro if the cookie from a cusotmer's computer can not be retrieved. When I decided to stop since no response from Archos any more, the web browser plugin keeps freezing when surfing to certain websites. I don't bother to contact them any more. I am sending it back to amazon and will lose $43 to pay for a lesson: DO NOT BUY ARCHOS.

<Title>Yes, It does all those things, BUT NONE of them sucessfully
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is so dull and boring. It's more for the super geek, no offense, that loves to spend time navigating thru many steps to get what u want. It's not very fun to use at all. It's like a computer expect but a bit more of a hassle to use because it does have the convenient of all the features of Windows OS. The only good thing worth mentioning is the screen. It's beautiful. Everything else performed from average to poor. Video playback was good. Mp3 playback was fair and cumbersome to use.Picture was pretty bad because it was slow at displaying thumbnails.  Anyways here are the pros and cons:  Pros: +Screen wow (800 X 480), loved viewing pictures on this screen! +Ability to view flash videos, but only sites that uses extension .flv and not .swf. this also means can't play flash games or interact with flash enable websites. wireless streaming of media from computer, it's works the first time i set it up then stopped., don't know why +Wifi,  but the range is pretty bad and frequently dropped signal for no reason whatsoever  Cons: -slow picture thumbnail view -slow slow slow everything -quite large isn't really pocket friendly -Plays only certain videos, I must buy plugins in order to unlock the player to play other common video formats -Broswer costs money($30), when its advertised was wifi -Takes 8-12 hours to charge via usb, Archos said that their docks charge a lot quicker(4-5 hours) , but you gotta buy it, of course. -Nothing hip about this device, plain boring device that plays a whole bunch of video formats if you buy the plugins, and plays mp3 and photos. -No stylus holder, but you can put it in the carrying pouch -Some photo can't be display. It said that it too large while that's not the problem because other photos are much larger in size and resolution got displayed.  Overall, this is not a complete valueless device once you factor in the screen, storage and wifi and all the stuff it's capable of playing once you buy the plugins.  However, its problem is that none of those features are implemented successfully. None of those features perform like how you would expect them to. The other major flaw with this device is that the GUI does not look very pleasing when you use it and everything seems so cluttered and slow on this device.  I would recommend this device to only the people to doesn't care about how things perform and just want to get the bare essentials of playing back various file formats on the device.  I would also recommend this for people who do nothing but watches movies on their portable device because of the beautiful screen. If you're looking for a music or photo player look somewhere else. This was a return for me. I really like the fact that this thing has wifi, which was one of the reasons I kept it for 2 weeks. I'm waiting for something better in the future and probably from another company b/c Archos obviously has no customer support whatsoever and this player was obviously released prematurely by them.

<Title>Make sure you know what you want it for!
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 lures you in with it's large, pretty display and relatively low price, then sucker punches you with a horrendous case of buyers' remorse that you're unlikely to encounter often.  The price you pay for the base unit is only the tip of the iceberg, you will probably have to spend around that much again to get the functionality you were hoping for. First, no AC adapter is included.  Ok, the ipod didn't either, but the ipod doesn't take ten hours to charge for the first time either.  After marveling at the pretty touchscreen and menus for the first few minutes, and attempting to use it as a pmp, you may begin to feel that the inconvenience of pulling the thing out of your pocket to change tracks on the touchscreen leaves something to be desired.  Ok so 30 bucks or so to buy the remote (I haven't, it disappeared off Amazon and I went back to the iPod).  Well, at least you can watch large pretty videos, right?  Well, chances are very good that a lot of what you want to watch is disabled in the Archos, so you'll have to go the the Archos website to pay them 20 bucks a pop for every function they built into the thing but are now charging you to use.  Now, yes, you could just download  every transcoding pack on the internet and spend the next few months recompiling your video library, but it probably won't take much of that before you eventually just head over to Archos and pay them off.  And if you got the flash memory version, (which I did because my iPod hard drive failed) SD cards are also available for purchase.  I would give the Archos a zero, but it does have such a great display........

<Title>Terrific Media Player
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a video ipod and my wife was wanting the new ipod touch for Christmas.  I remembered that there used to be a company that sold mp3 players in the stores but had disappeared.  I looked them up to see what they still offered.  Low and behold, Archos had this great little video/music player.  I immediately scoured the internet to see what else I could find about it.  I checked my online computer sources like CNet and they gave it a roaring review.  I went ahead and bought it for Christmas.  It works fantastic - the video is phenomenal, the built-in speakers are great, and it's very easy to use.  I didn't like that I had to buy a browser plug-in to view webpages online but I knew that going in so it was no surprise.  I love that you can use the camera memory cards to keep more music/video/photos on.  Eventually, you'll be able to buy 32 Gig cards to use with it.  You can't use those on the ipods.  It was easy to set up but easier when you are computer literate.  You are supposed to be able to buy the web plug-in using the Archos but I had to go to their website and buy it there instead.  No big deal but a little confusing.  Player works great with Windows Media Player.  I've never liked itunes anyways.  Love all the features and love being able to use a stylis with it.  Also, since we have AT&T's DSL service, my wife can use her Archos browser at the local McDonalds wifi for free while the kids play.  How cool is that?  As the word gets out, this player will start making a dent in Apple's ipod touch.  I'm going to sell my ipod video and get the Archos for myself.

<Title>I love it
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using the device for a number of months now and while it does have its issues, it is still an awesome device. It has become a money pit tho also, since it was only 4gb internal, id reccomend atleast another 4gb or larger sd card. For most people you can stop right there but to unlock all the functionality you need to but other things. Internet access, 30$, Playback of AC3 audio from dvdrips, and H264 files from say itunes, 20$ each, it can work as a dvr, the dvr station dock is 90$, battery life averages about 4.5hours sometimes you need longer so i got a battery pack, 50$, case so the screen is protected, 20$, and thats not everything ive gotten so it can add up quickly, be careful of this fact, otherwise i do not regret this purchase at all

<Title>I Should Have Listened to the Negative Feedback!!!
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son wanted an MP3/Video player that wasn't an iPod, and had a large screen.  The Archos 605 seemed like a great choice.  My research revealed some positive reviews/feedback, and plenty of negative feedback and horror stories.  I wanted to believe the good reviews... but shouldn't have!  Within 48 hours of receiving the unit for Christmas, it had frozen.  We stepped through the recovery procedures on the screen, but nothing worked.  We returned it to Amazon.  Amazon handled the return extremely well.  Stay away from this product!!!

<Title>Try it BEFORE you write... amazing toy
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Got this as a christmas present for my daughter (13 yrs)... yes, I realized up front that they nickle and dime you for capabilities... but knowing that up front made it less upsetting, as I mentally added the prices when deciding what to get. I got her the 4 Gig 605, Dock, 4 GB SDHC and the internet plug it... right at $320 for the whole group.  So far everything has worked flawlessly... we have played movies on my 50" Sony TV and it looks great... WIFI works throughout the home and the remote allows a 'useable' internet experience on the TV.  Watching recorded TV/Movies has made trips in the car fun for her.  All-in-all a blast of a 'toy'.  Works great with an external drive, so I am confused why anyone would buy the HD versions unless you MUST have access on the road to many movies at once.  Otherwise, use a stand-alone HD as your 'home base', and drag movies to the SD card or player as needed.  Multiple SD cards allows near limitless viewing on the road, and the knowledge that your hard-drive will never crash on you (since it doesn't have one!).  I have an Archos AV500 that has served me faithfully commuting for years... now I REALLY wish it would die so I can upgrade to one of these things!  Only negatives (similar to AV500, so I am used to it) are on the MP3 side... pretty lame music-player software.  That being said, it works fine for MP3s and I think they have the best VIDEO software/ hardware on the market.  This thing is a steal at under $200 for the base unit.

<Title>I should have read more reveiws.
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok i think this review is mainly centered at my particular device, because i think i got a lemon. i really do have some nice things to say further down. First, yes the charging takes the better part of a day, probably something akin to the 12 hours i've seen reported on here. Next the customer service is quite rude. I tried to d/l the web browser from the site, it kept saying there were problems with my billing address/ and or credit card number, I kept trying to fix the issues but to no avail. I contacted Archos and I was rather rudely told that I must have not put in my proper address ( hello i know where i live ) so upon checking and rechecking and looking at credit card statements ect....still no luck. So i called again and got rude customer service person #2 where I was told if i tried over five times "my credit card company won't let the transaction go through" then she looked and rather scornfully told me that I had tried 12 times to get the transaction to work. Then she told me i couldn't use my card for 72 hours on the site. I buy a ton of stuff online and i have never had so many problems making a simple purchase. She then told me to just use another credit card. Great thanks...It never did mean anything to her that the address was correct the entire time. Anyways i finally received the plug in and i also d/l the newest firmware. The device was okay that night. I watched a few videos, for the most part i really liked the device. the menus are rather weird because you have no idea what all the icons do since theres no text and you can't rollover the icon to see what it does, you have to seriously push the button and hope thats what you thought it did. I couldn't even find a legend for all the different icons in the "manual" (I use the term manual loosly because its really just one page of warnings and legal mumbo jumbo)   The next morning the device kept locking up when i tried to stream a video. I reset it, and it locked up again. It locked up a few more times while browsing the web. I was messing around with it before i went to sleep, then I turned it off and set it on the nightstand. This morning it kept booting up then shutting down as soon as the home screen came on. i hooked it up to the usb on my laptop only to discover that the battery completely drained itself even though the unit was shut off. Now thats a handy feature.  On the plus side The screen is gorgeous, and the web service is relatively quick at least in my house anyways. The MP3 controls are a little weird and I wouldn't recommend trying to use this while driving, but the sound is nice It would be a great player to sit around and listen to. I really like the fact that it displays the track before and after the current one playing, very cool. i would say the sound is comparable to my trusty creative ZVM. Once you get the hang of it the web browsing is pretty good but some of the links are really hard to hit making you zoom in to engage them, but thats not really the devices fault. i think its cool when you watch a flash video online the unit instantly blows it up to full screen. the video quality is great so far, even bad transfers are at least watchable. I'm really not sure that the web browser plug in should be an item you have to pay for (i mean it is marketed as being a wi-fi device and all) but it's not that big of a deal i guess. All in all I think its a cool device and a great alternative to the ipod touch just don't expect much support from the customer service dept. I think I may have just gotten a bad player, i'm sure it happens but depending on how the return goes I'm not sure i'll be jumping up to get another archos product in the future.

<Title>plays media - but.......
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you want a media player this works. But it it very finicky. It does into  diagnostic mode 30% of the time and requires a file system repair.  When the repair fails and the format is required, it formats the internal and external memory. So the SD gets wiped.  The music player is almost non functional.  You cannot sync playlists to it. It will not correctly integrate the music on the SD into the general lists for genre, artist, album, so on.  You have to manually create the playlists on the device which is not easy to do.  A 3 hours play list for a road trip will take 30 minutes to do even if you know the songs.  I have tried to sync the playlists from Yahoo, rhapsody, napster, iTunes, windows media player and iTunes. The unit does not recognize any of them.  The suspend mode uses too much power. From one day to another it uses 1 bar of the battery meter while in suspend mode.  It takes over a minute to boot.  It takes 8 hours to charge off the USB cable.  It take 4 hours off A/C.  The A/C adapter requires spending $99 for the DVR or $30 for this semi-useless dock and the adapter. Do not by the "travel DVR". No A/C. So to have a DVR and the A/C will still cost $99.  The best feature is the $99 DVR unit. You can record off the TV. So you can watch your TV shoes while at the gym.  It takes standard RCA in, so where it is legal :-) you can play your favorite dvds and it will record like a VCR.  Other than this ONE feature, by the apple itouch or look into the creative devices.

<Title>Poor video, terrible customer support
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received mine two days ago. First it took way to long to charge, over 8 hours. I tried to buy the Browser plug-in but received an error code when I tried to install it. I then tried to upgrade the firmware and got the same error code. I called customer support, but the guy who deals with the plug-ins, one guy!, was out to lunch! They said they would call me back or email, two days later no call. Their site doesn't even have support for the product any more, it was there two days ago. I tried to look up the technical support number this morning and their site doesn't have that info now. I tried to use the broadband with my WPA wireless password and it failed to connect. I had to disable the security on my wireless to get it to work. I downloaded an episode of The Office from Amazon Unbox and the video was very "Choppy". It makes me a little seasick.  This is definitely going back, I just pre-ordered the Ipod Touch. The short time that I owned the Iphone, I Loved the video playback and wireless capabilities, just returned it because the phone part was terrible.  Edit: The product really went wrong after I wrote the review. Every time I tried to plug in the usb cable it rebooted. I reset it to factory default and lost touch screen functionality and it still wouldn't connect by USB. Total lemon. Amazon will not let me revote, I would give it 0 stars.

<Title>Terrible Customer Service
<Date>Tue Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Been trying to buy the Web plug in since Sunday evening. I tried 3 times Sunday and once tonight all with the same results......sorry but you need to input the correct information on your credit card.  Check my credit card on line...guess what??? they have tried to charge my card 4 times for $29.95.  Have been calling customer service.  Got a nice jazz song for 30 minutes before they hung up on me.  The second time I got through to someone after 30 minutes again, and they said they need to transfer me, and it hung up again.  Finally I got someone Monday morning who actually told me they are having trouble with their website and to try again in 24hrs.  Here I am trying again tonight with the same results.  Checked my online credit card account, and low and behold there is the 4th charge.  Also, I went over to Panera Bread wifi and tried there with the 605.  Connected on the network and it promptly became disengaged when I tried to buy the plugin on-line.  What a screwball company.  I am going out of town till next Monday.  I will try one last time, and if no luck....back it goes to Amazon.  What poor planning for a product release.  Bunch of amateurs.

Just don't update the firmware(yet) there is some problems with the ones they released.  You don't need to update it works just fine.  I recommend getting the dvr dock and a 4gb sd card.  Then you have the best product that will last you a very very long time because it is flash.

<Content>This would be a cool little gadget if there weren't so many negatives. Takes a long time to charge, over 12 hours and you have to use your computer. Lot of issues getting it to work right.  Whatever you do don't call Archos customer service, they'll make it worse.  Relatively inexpensive initial purchase but if you want the full features plan on another $300.    Can't record without the DVR station.  I returned it, just too many problems.  Didn't want to spend hours trying to get it to work properly.  I must say that Amazon's return procedure is fantastic.  Very happy with Amazon not with Archos.

<Title>In LOVE with this device!
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sometimes you buy something and you spend alot of money and just don't feel like you have gotten your moneys worth or don't use it enough to justify to yourself the purchase. Well, for me, the Archos device is just about the best purchase that I have ever made. It is just incredible. I literally use it every day. I take it on the train. I take it backpacking. I watch TV in bed before going to sleep. I even watch it at work occasionally. I really have no complaints whatsoever on this device!  I previously purchased the Archos 604 30GB model. And yes, I bought all the plugins... This purchase was for the Wifi and higher resolution than my 604. After firmware upgrade it has worked flawlessly. Everything else on the device is just great. Let me say that I purchased the video iPod and the video itself looks great but it is SO SMALL! The screen size on this is perfect. I actually went thru alot of pain to get VIDEO ON THE IPOD! Well, this baby will play alot of formats the ipod will not. mpeg2, vob, avi, mpeg4. Just buy the plugins and you are good to go. Yes, its a little more expense.. blah blah blah To do movie conversion I use Nero Recoder for ipod (mpeg4).  For TV shows I used bittorrent. :) Legally of course :)  Somehow there are alot of negative comments about the device. I don't understand. I've had the 604 for about 6 months and still rave about it. The 605 is just as nice. If you don't own one already I'd recommend getting the 30GB one if you can afford it. The flash is nice for expansion but is slower for copying files to the device. Flash is getting much cheaper (2GB SD card for ~$20 now...) though. Anyway, if you want to watch video get the Archos. If you want a music player buy an iPod. If you want people to think you have money buy an iTouch. Hope my comments were useful to you. If you buy it and are dissappointed I will be too.  The following is added after having the unit for over a month:  - I still love it  - Never had ANY problems playing video   - Never had ANY problems playing music  - Lockup has occurred using Web Browser. They are not frequent      and I am assuming that Archos will continue to make the     product more robust with Opera. They have yet to release     the widgets so my guess is that they are working on it.     So... still very happy with Web Browser  - Complaints about having special cable are goofy (see iPod cable)  - The Media Server option is GREAT! I have a Maxtor NAS drive     which supports uPnP so I don't have to copy stuff onto the     device itself. For shows > 1hr I copy them to the device because     the fast forward does not work with the media server. (If you     use PC and share then use the file browser, it does) All being said, I would lower the stars to 4.5 because of the lockups  during Web Browsing.  Hope the additional comments help you.  Thanks  Update on Dec 11:  New firmware makes the device even better. Haven't seen any lockups  using the webbrowser. And now it supports flash games. OK OK... so  the CPU is not that powerful and it won't play alot of games to  satisfaction but it does play the cards games just fine.  Anyway... Yes yes yes... you have to buy plugins for the webbrowser  and if you want to play some different formats... Just figure an  extra 50 dollars. But again.. if you want to watch VIDEO then this  IS the device for you. If you want music then there are ALOT of   better mp3 players out there. And the complaints about video conversion..  well, 1 plugin buys you anything you would watch on the ipod.  Like I said above.. sorry if you don't like it.

<Title>Great Display  - Quick Response - Convenient Memory
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for the quality of the display, and it met all expectations.  It does does full justice to Divx video.  The built-in speaker is remarkably good and is far and away the best sound I ve heard in anything this small.     I use it primarily to show people short video clips of machine functions. It is far more convenient and dignified than whipping out a laptop computer, and its quality adds credibility to the presentation. The quick response is professional quality and provides instant gratification. The resolution, clarity, and unsmeared motion images are comparable to a good laptop display.   Text is clearly readable, even in smaller fonts.  The pdf player works smoothly and has a very readable display with the included pdf instruction manual, which suggests outputting PowerPoint slide shows in pdf for use here. It is more than capable of a clearly readable slide show display, given the fonts and graphics commonly used in slide shows.    Even the 4GB is more than enough for data I need, particularly after erasing most of the preloaded files by using the intuitive file brouser.  It is nice to know that it would use another 16 GB on an HCSD card, but the  handiest use for this slot so far is the 2 GB SD card out of a camera. The quality of the displayed images is so much better than the display on the camera that you much better check on focus and exposure.    I have had an Archos AV-420 for 3 years, and it is still a great product, which has more built-in flexibility in connecting to tv and cable systems.  I just never got around to using any of that functionality and don t expect to miss it here.  Technology is moving toward integration with the computer thru USB, where this device excels.  The display on the 420 was great for standard tv resolutions, but was not adequate for most text. This display is more consistent with computer displays and HDTV.  The 605 obviously lacks HD resolution, but it s hard to tell on a screen of this size, unless you've got a magnifying glass in your pocket.    I considered the 405 first, but this seems like a lot more machine for the money.  Once you've seen this display, it s hard to go back.  It fits  easily in a front pocket and I wouldn't find a smaller format any more convenient.     I plan to get the browser soon.  The WIFI worked great to update the firmware.  The touch screen keyboard made it easy to enter the key for accessing an encrypted wireless router.

<Title>Archos 605 4GB--not ready for the consumer
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a prior Archos media player owner, I had high hopes that the 605 was going to be a wonderful device.  The screen is large, the touch screen and features that were advertised are great and the fact that you could pop in an SD card was a +.  I owned the device for about 2 weeks.  Upon receiving it, I immediately upgraded to the latest firmware. The wi-fi capability is not good in this device, whether through poor software implementation or hardware.  Every other device I own with wi-fi capability can link to my network easily from any room in my home and sometimes in the yard.  The 605 struggled to keep and often dropped the connection.  Within 10 days of casual use (5-10 times/day) the on-off switch ceased to function.  The only way to power the device on and off was to connect it to the USB port on my computer.  Shortly after that, the device started to report system errors which some research showed normally happens by not properly removing the device under Windows.  Let me assure you that I know what I am doing and always used the "Safely Remove Hardware" option to stop the device prior to unplugging it.  I reset the device to its factory settings and this did nothing to remedy any of the problems.  Amazon has kindly taken my 605 back and I am now the proud owner of an Ipod Touch  Archos has lost a repeat buyer and loyal customer...

<Title>Customer Service and Web Store Sucks
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>605 looks real good, except, without the plug-ins, it doesn't do what I bought it to do. Can't buy the plug-ins - not from the web and not from the incompetent customer service representatives Archos uses to answer their phones.  Archos has by far produced the silliest customer service business unit I have ever dealt with.  I still have high hopes for my 605, but my patience is wearing thin and I may return my unit in favor of an I Touch instead of waiting out the incompetence.

<Title>Questionable product stability
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first unit I received had a complete failure on the touch screen after a couple of weeks of usage. Amazon was very prompt in replacing the faulty unit. The second unit will mysteriously freeze on various tasks. In general the product should have been delayed in its release to the market given the numerous problems I have encountered so far with the product.
