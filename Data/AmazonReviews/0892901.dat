<Title>Great Little Player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love music and try to have something playing all the time.  I have three iPods and my only gripe is that I have to use headphones.  I HATE ear buds.  I thought the speakers would be tinny but they are really more than adequate to enjoy tunes.  I place it on my desk at work and it plays all day.  Great battery life.  As an earlier post noted - one minus is that there is not a separate a/c recharger.  I am tempted to use my Shuffle recharger that has the USB receptacle . . . maybe not - with my luck the thing will fry.

<Title>K5 player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This K5 aka MP3 player stands up to expectations set by the manufacturers description. I experienced one problem, there isn't a way to charge the player in a wall outlet. This posed a problem while on vacation. The website stated charging took about 4 hours on a PC and 2 hours in a wall outlet. When I called Samsung I was told there is no outlet recharge connection nor do they see a date there would be one.

<Title>Ugh...
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A friend of mine bought this for her husband as a gift and I got commissioned to load it with music since their computer does not have Windows XP. This was the first annoyance. Then, since I am an iTunes user and an iPodder, we had to load all of their music onto my computer in mp3 format into the Samsung Media Player thinking we would be able to make playlists only to find we could not. So, we then copied it over to WMP so that we could make playlists. Once we got all of the music into the little bugger we were all very impressed by the sound quality of it and had no complaints, but there are definitely more user friendly products on the market.

<Content>Outstanding quality and plenty of space. My only drawback is that I wish the speakers were a little louder but are still quite impressive for such a small package.

<Title>Great  Player

<Content>I love this little player.  I am on the road 4 to 5 hours a day in a vehicle with no radio.  I am in and out of the vehicle dealing with the public and it is not allowed to wear earpieces of any kind. This player if perfect. The sound is great for such a small speaker.

<Title>perfect little unit
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 is an outstanding and unique player.  At work, I drive and walk around outside and I need to be aware of my surroudings, so no earbuds.  The built in speakers are what sold me and they sound great, considering that each of the two speakers are about the size of a dime.  Even with the speaker out, it easily goes in and stays in my pocket.  The play modes live up to their descriptions. I use Bass Boost for in the car & outside, and 3D for the ear buds.  Listening with the included earbuds is EXCELLENT.  Realiability has been excellent.  I've dropped it a couple times already but it's without a scratch.  Another reason I bought it was the good reviews (much better than Scan Disk).  There is a good video of the Samsung on C-Net, which show it's size and is described well. I've had the unit a little over a month now and it topped out at 800 WMA songs.  This was my first venture into the MP3 world and it's fantastic.  No more annoying songs or car commercials.  It's like TIVO for radio only better because it's free, commercial free and all your favorite songs are played, whenever and however you want.  Not in the mood for a song?  skip it for the next one.  Select albums, artists, songs, rock... country, pop, jazz, etc.  And the color changing clock is really a neat bonus. As for the cons, I would have liked the full manual and not the site to go get one in Adobe.  The touch pad requires a very light touch, but you get used to it.  Normal play is actually a little better than shuffle too, as in shuffle will try to sneak in a previously skipped track. Also, you must charge it through the computer..  There is not much in the way of accesories either.  I wound up going to Walmart where I bought a Samsonite cell phone cover and clip (fits a Nokia 3500) so I can wear it on the riding mower with the ear buds neatly tucked in ear protection. Last little gripe, you have to plug in the ear buds to receive FM, but you can still listen to the radio through speakers.  Pulls in a lot of distant stations with no fade. If you haven't guessed yet, I would buy this item again and HIGHLY recommend it!

<Title>Poor Customer Service
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player itself is ok but the customer service and support at Samsung is the worst I have ever been through.  After 5 phone calls, 10 disconnects, and over 10 hours on hold, they have promised for the fifth time they would get back to me.  The player is supposed to come with 1 month of free downloads from your choice of three services.  None of them will give you more than one week of free connect time and will still charge for each download.  Samsung cannot seem to fix the problem and has an I do not care attitude.  Avoid them and their products if possible.

<Title>MP3 Player with Speakers
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is excellent for my purposes because it has a built in speaker and I can use it to listen to quiet music whenever I want to, even to help me sleep.

<Title>Very cool player..
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been playing with this player for about a week now and there have been good and bad points about it. I'll start with what I disliked about the player. Although I love this player, I was disappointed about the music transferring process. I don't use an ipod so I don't know how the samsung compares to it, but my friends who have ipods tell me that it's extremely user friendly. I use itunes on my PC [because my bro has an ipod] and it's easy to create playlists on itunes, but the Samsung uses the Samsung Medio Studio, which is somewhat confusing for me. I found out that I couldn't change information of the songs that were already uploaded onto the player, nor could I organize them/move them around to form a new playlist. I still haven't figured out how to make playlists yet..Also, if several songs are of the same artist, but the artist name isn't uniform [ex: yellowcard v.s. Yellowcard], then it'll show up as two different artists on the artist category in the player.  Another thing is that since it's a touch-screen player, the surface can get kind of smudgy with fingerprints (but you can always wipe that off). Also, the player doesn't include a charger that can be used on wall outlets. So you'd have to buy one or always charge the player on the PC. The earphones are rather funky too (weird shape).    Despite all that, I still love this player because the design is so beautiful and the sound is amazing. It's not big and bulky like the Creative Zen players, and it's not thin and fragile like ipods. It's thicker than an ipod, but at a thickness that's very comfortable to hold. The slide-out speaker makes it the coolest thing ever. The sound from the speakers is way better than I expected. The alarm clock is really loud, but that definitely wakes me up! Plus, I can wake up to the song of my choice.  It's a very sleek and pleasing design..The glowing blue buttons complement the black mp3 player very nicely. I love touch-screen even though it leaves fingerprints because it doesn't make any sounds. One of my turn-offs of the Creative Zen player was the big plasticky buttons...when I press them, it reminds me of pressing a plastic toy button. But the Samsung touch-screen buttons makes it seem very sophisticated and high-tech. The different sound effects/modes are wonderful..I love the concert hall mode most. It really does sound like what it'd be like at a live concert.   This is not a player that will satisfy everyone, probably because it's only 4GB, can't show videos, etc. But it was a perfect match for me since I don't like wearing head/earphones for long periods of time (so the slide-out speaker is convenient) and the style of the player is amazing. I don't really need a video features..I just need it for the music. I guess if your music files are very organized, the transfer process will be a breeze. If you think this player has what you want, then you'll absolutely love it. :D
