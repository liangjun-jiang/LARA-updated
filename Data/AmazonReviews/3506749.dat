<Content>My biggest problem with these little guys is that when I turn them off then back on they come one at track 1.   Seems to me the program in my car CD that lets me turn the car off, run into the store and come back and when i crank on the car the CD player picks up where it left off....   If these little player did that then I'd even spring for the Ipod.  What a great feature none of these have.  My VL-532 came right from Asia in it's little brown envelope with the customs sticker on it as so many products do these days.  What I like about the features is that I can put it down for a couple of months and pick it up and figure it out without having to reread the instruction manuel.  They are all a bit different but you can't break it by trying out different buttons and soon I'm listen to Hawkins brief history of time, the brandenburg concertos, etc...   For random music I download stuff I like to listen over and over to so 512Mb is fine for my usage.  That will hold several books and many songs....  If I need a change, the process of deleting and adding other is just drag and drop.  Battery life is better than I need (for me) and if it did have a sleep timer it would be better but it don't.  Screen is easy to read.... one thing important you have to remmeber is weather or not it charges from the USB port with the power switch on or off...  Some are one way, some the other so take note, if not the learning curve is quick :-)  Nice little DMV format video took months to find because the download was NOT on the CD but eventually the VideoLan web site had a good link.   OLED screen is great as it can be for a sub one inch diaganol.  With a nice set of headphones enjoy the low cost and decent reliability.  Let me know if you think diffent or better still got a better throw away MP3 player.
