<Content>This item is excellent.  It works perfectly and hold plenty of songs for a short trip and also serve great as a usb storage drive.  It's small enough for me to take any where I go and I love using it to listen to musics while I'm running. Great buy for the price.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Manual in 3 font print.  Translation to English very poor.  Instructions not clear.  Would not load music.  Gave error messages.  On closer look, it already had a music file on it.  The entire drive is "write protected"  used?? not new. Waiting to hear back from seller
