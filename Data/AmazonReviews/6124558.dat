<Title>Works fine.
<Date>Tue Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had this item for over a year and it works fine. Simple, easy to use and understand interface. No frills( that's a plus) Only complaint is the first one I had had intermittent problems reading the smartmedia card. At first I thought the problem was the card (it wasn't). I exchanged the unit it's worked fine ever since.

<Title>Not bad

<Content>I've had it for about 2 years not and it hasen't messed up once. Though when  bought this it was top of the line but you can now buy MP3s for almost the same price, maybe 20 bucks more...but it will have like 3x the memory. Don't buy this now unless you plan to upgrade later (maybe get smart and invest in a Ipod...i did and that works fine too)Just my opinion.

<Content>One star is generous. Forget this piece of junk, it is not worth even a 10th of the price.  Spend $10.00 more and get an iPod shuffle with 10X the space.  Why this is still being offered is beyond me.  They don't even make smart media cards anymore!  Please tell me this is a joke.
