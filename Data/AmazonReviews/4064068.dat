<Content>Got one for my wife for Christmas.  It is incredibly light and easy to operate.  Also easy to load songs on it using pretty much any software or just dragging and dropping in windows explorer.  Less than half the price of my daughter's IPOD.  Personally, I hate the apple software and don't find the IPOD as easy to operate as the Creative Zen Stone or my super cheap RCA MP3 player.

<Title>Zen Stone Plus is good for the money

<Content>The Zen Stone Plus does all that it says in the product description.  However, there are drawbacks to this device that I enjoyed with the shuffle.  The first is that it doesn't come with a built in clip, which is a constant struggle in that I only use it for workouts.  Having to buy a separate clip that does not firmly attach to the unit is a daily annoyance.  I happened to purchase the sport pack which included the skin, clip, and armband.  I haven't found a good use for the armband.  The skin covers the screen making it hard to navigate. The battery life seems to be extremely short and it since it has multiple functions, this means charging it after every workout (4 times a week).   Sometimes the on/off function is a challenge in that you have to hold the button for at least 5 seconds. The other drawback is the short USB cord - 5 inches long. I do enjoy the portability of the device and the sound is good.  For the money and storage size, this does offer more than the shuffle including a radio, timer, stopwatch, recorder, music, and screen.  But if you want more from a smaller device, I would recommend the Zen V or Zen V plus, which is in the same price range with a bigger color screen. My overall rating is 3.5 out of 5 stars.
