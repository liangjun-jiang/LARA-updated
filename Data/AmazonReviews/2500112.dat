<Title>never trust coby again
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After all the bad reviews I see for coby products, I thought _maybe_ they should have learned from their mistakes and finally make something that works.  It's not a far fetched hope since this is their 2nd gen of this mp3+speaker system.  But no, the unit froze on me by inserting an SD card.  Turning the unit off and on again is of no help.  It has a reset procedure, but only accessable from the menu, which of course is of no use since the unit is frozen.  If they make crappy products, they should at least make the reset a hardware reset..

<Title>Fairly Good...
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If the Coby MP-C351 is anything, it is unique. There aren't really any other mini boom-box MP3 players that have both internal stereo speakers and internal memory - especially in this price range. Coby is known for budget electronics, and the MP-C351 lives up to that reputation.  The MP-C351 is about the size of a foot-long sub sandwich. It produces fairly good sound, especially for talk content - which is mostly what I play. There are five equalizer settings. It can easily be clearly heard from across a 15' x 20' room, but when playing music it doesn't exactly fill the room. The firmware has a menu interface that is at least slightly clumsy, but functional. The FM radio seems okay, and you can record from it too.  I purchased the MP-C351 mostly to listen to MP3s of audio books, lectures, and podcasts. It works quite well for this purpose - with a couple of caveats. First, the seek function isn't fast enough to quickly seek through a lengthly MP3. Seeking any more than five minutes seems impractical. What is nice is that the MP-C351 will save your place if you pause a MP3 and power down. Even if the power cord or batteries are removed, it will still start up again right where you left off. BUT... not if a SD card is inserted. Something about the way the firmware checks and loads a SD card upon power-up disrupts the process of picking up playback where it was last paused. This applies to both content on the SD card and the internal memory. Just having a SD card inserted means that the paused location cannot be saved for any content on the device. Hence, I've decided not to use any SD cards with it. With regard to battery life, I'm using 2500mAh nickel metal hydride 'C' cells, with which I get upwards of 8-10 hours of high-volume MP3 playback time.  Lastly, the build quality of the MP-C351 is decent for low-end budget electronics, but just barely. My MP-C351 had a few sample defects. The AC power adapter was defective, so I replaced it with an aftermarket adapter. There was a piece of plastic rattling around inside the device, which I removed after disassembling the device. The 'piece of plastic' turned out to be a chunk of hot glue which had been used to seal the speaker wires coming out of the baffled speaker enclosure. Note that if the baffled speaker enclosure is not properly sealed, the sound quality goes way down such that there may be buzzing and distortion at higher volume levels. So, I repaired the hot glue seal around the speaker wires on the baffle. I also noticed a broken solder connection at the FM antenna wire. Given the number of defects in my sample, the probability of getting a perfect unit on the first try is probably reduced.  Overall, I like the MP-C351. It would be nice if a firmware update could fix the SD card issue and offer variable speed seek, but I won't be holding my breath. The 512MB of internal memory is enough for my purposes.

<Title>Dead after 15 minutes of use
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's been a long time since I've had a brand new electronic product that died within the first half hour of use.  I've always stayed away from low-end brands like Coby like the plague, but I started noticing nicer-looking products from Coby while cruising through stores like Walgreens and Target,  so I decided finally to give Coby a chance when my wife needed a simple MP3 boombox (no CD) that has a flash card slot, to play tunes for our baby.  And it just so turns out that Coby is one of very few brands that makes such a device (strange but true, as of Dec 2007).  When it arrived, things were looking good.  My wife liked its appearance, and it generally felt like a semi-quality piece.  So I dropped several dozen songs onto an SD card and slipped it into the Coby's CD slot.  I browsed through some of the settings in the menu, which were straightforward and effective, and setup the radio with my preferred presets.  All of this took 10 minutes or so.  Then...after playing 3 or 4 songs, it froze.  None of the buttons worked.  I unplugged the device from the power socket, replugged it in, the LCD came back on, but none of the buttons were responsive.  I unplugged and replugged it in several more times.  No luck.  It won't turn on.  None of the buttons work.  I'm RMA'ing back to Amazon the very same day I got it.  Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy.  And...I will not touch Coby again.

<Title>More than I expected for such a small unit
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have owned for about 2 months now and am pleased with purchase.  Use nightly for 10 to 12 hours to play white noise recorded on SD card, daily to play TV audio with my small projector, and ocasionally during day to play music from SD card or listen to NPR.  Will take 2 GB SD card without problems.  Does a very good job for such a small unit.  Works well on FM, internal and external (SD card) memory, and line in.  Volume as expected is lower than a larger unit.  Only complaint is the lack of AM radio and a remote would be nice.
