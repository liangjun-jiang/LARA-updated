<Title>User interface is slow!
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After trying several units at different Apple stores, all of the new iPod Classics suffer from a slow interface. Apple added Cover Flow and additional graphics but apparently underpowered the device and menu items have a noticable delay, Cover Flow is slow to refresh and even the clickwheel navigation is sluggish. These problems are not shared by the new Nano, which operates beautifully. I wanted to buy the classic, but now will go with either a Nano or a Touch.

<Title>Still great for Music and awesome storage space
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 4 iPods including a 2G refurb I keep in my car.  So obviously they work well for me.  There are a number of solid alternatives to the iPod and depending upon your needs one of those could be better value.  For the classic the screen is too small for video but that is true of most "video" players and cell phones.  Overall the Apple iPod + iTunes experience can not be beat.  It is an elegant seamless integration and experience.  An often overlooked feature of getting an iPod is that there are tons of accessories to select from and that alone is compelling reason to go with an iPod.  If video is must look elsewhere perhaps to the iPod touch (great screen and makes video actually an option) or one of the Archos options (better screen size and storage then the touch and some with video in option).  If you need a voice recorder or fm tuner other options such as those from Creative might suit you better.  These can be added to the iPod but only at additional costs.  But the core - the simplicity, power of use, battery life and organizing and storing music, photo and video files the iPod is still the best.  Don't get distracted by bells and whistles that really are not important to your core end user experience.  Don't focus on  marginal battery draining features like Zune's wifi unless you really think that those feature are important to you.  If you are on a budget and are willing to forego Apples legendry and well deserved elegance, you can find a decent player for much less.  If you have more specific needs add them to the vlaue equation and figure if the iPod + accessories is worth the extra cost to you.  And if you want a great music player that simply works go with an iPod.

<Title>Too good to be true!!!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always thought that an ipod sold solely because of publicity. I assumed that most people who bought it didn't research well or didn't know what they wanted to buy. I was often surprised to see people buying one ipod after another for their family and friends!   Now I know how wrong I was!   I am finally a proud owner of the 80 GB Classic (Black)! Now, I'd like to jump to the list of pros and cons for this great product:  PROS: 1. Unbelievably slim for an 80 GB player. 2. All metal design is really impressive (less scratches). 3. Cover flow definitely adds a lot of pleasure to the user experience. 4. Preview for the selected menu option is impressive. 5. More controllable click wheel. 6. Great Battery life. 7. Great Extras (especially the games)  I guess, I could go on n on n on...  CONS: 1. Menu to Cover flow transition is slow. 2. iTunes consumes all your resources on PC. 3. I'm not sure about the datastructure in an ipod, but it seems that if there is an album in which there are songs by various artists, the album shows up as many times as the number of artists in the cover flow mode. 4. Although certain photos get copied but they don't open (Note: They are visible as thumbnails) 5. Need more menu options for photo viewer. 6. Can't change EQ settings from a song. Need to go to the menu->setings->EQ to change it. 7. Artwork for certain albums don't show up even though iTunes shows them correctly.  Finally, I would definitely like to say that this is a great product and one of it's kind. Once you own it, you would never wanna part with it!

<Title>Nice capacity, but that's it...
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is definitely a great gadget, but not the best out there. It still gets scratched just as the other ones, but that's no surprise. I was excited to see how the cover flow feature would work, since it was on the iPod Touch also, and it was not that great. It is slower that the touch and freezes on some occasions. I did like how they kept it sleek and thin as it used to be. It didn't come with many accessories (this means no protective sleeve either), but I didn't mind since I didn't end up paying for the iPod. It's also very affordable, unlike the other iPods. And for those wondering how I "got" my iPod go here -> http://flingk.com/n21v9v1 I saw it on CNN, FOX, G4TV, so I tried it and it actually worked! Overall this is a great MP3 Player, but not the best.

<Title>Music Great.... Video lets hope for a update
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the Classic now for 4 days.  The interface is much better than Gen 5 but the Classic is slower.  All and all for for Music and watching video on the iPod its self the Classic wins.  The bad.  Most of all the iPods docs and ALL Of the past iPod cables do not work with any of the new iPods. Apple change the computability so that you have to buy new cables and docs. They say it is because the old ones put to much drain on the battery(whatever I have had no issue). So if you are not upgrading from a previous iPod it may not be an issue because you will have to buy the $50.00 cable any way but if you already have all your iPod accessories you may want to keep the iPod you have until they fix this issue.  By the way if your car radio has a adapter for a iPod. Like the Pioneer D3 I just bought.  You guessed it none of the new iPods will work.

<Title>not good if you want to watch video
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple won't tell you this before you buy this product. If you use this with third-party video products it wont let you switch the TV OUT selector to ON. This means it won't work with those products. Apple sells two special cable sets you need in order to watch video. Each of these sells for $49.99. There is currently a four week wait for these cables. I have a laptop-like Vision Video 55 that allows the ipod to drop into a special bay so you can watch videos on a bigger screen and carry it around. Its great for traveling etc. My previous ipod videos worked great with this and a similar unit sold by Phillips. Now if I want to use these portable video devices I need one of these special cables partially defeating the point of having these custom devices. And this isn't a fit issue. Apple has purposely done this to prevent users from using third-party devices. Don't look to future after-market video devices to fix this problem. Apple has decided to be greedy on this point. If you just watch video on the ipod itself or on your home TV this will work fine (if you buy one of Apple's $50 cables). I wish I could return my ipod but they wont take it back :-(. Maybe I'll start calling mine the ipoop :-).

<Title>Good but not Great (yet)
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a 5.5 Generation 80G and I got a 80G classic, so I quite literally did a side by side comparison. True, the new interface is lovely, the screen is a touch brighter and its a thiner design, but even after the update from Apple, the spin up time on the interface is just so slow. Its especially horrible going to a listing of movies, it once took nearly 2 min for all my movies to display. The classic is sluggish and for me that is a bit of a deal breaker. I'm a huuuge Apple fan, I have 3 ipods (iPod mini 1st generation, Shuffle 2nd generation and my 5.5 generation 80G), a Mac Mini and will be shelling out for a Mac book pro next month when Leopard comes out, but this one is going back. I have a feeling the next generation Classic may be the one to watch for but for now its all Style and not enough substance, if your going for a ipod video get the 5th generation while you still can or wait until Apple has a chance to get rid of the glitches in this one.

I give it 1 star because you have to buy a universal dock to use it Apple does not tell you this When you buy the unit. just what i need is more gear to carry on a plane if you don't want to mess with docks and stuff to plug an i pod into a tv at a hotel stick with the 5 gen.

<Title>Posting User C. J. F. Was mistaken. It works. Here's Why...
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just as someone else stated, you do not need a Dock, for this or ANY iPod to work for that matter. That is an optional accessory, but not really needed.  Just use the USB cord that comes with it.  It's fastest if your computer has USB 2.0 ports built-in, but it also connects with older slower machines like mine that only have USB 1.1 ports.  It's great.!  USB 1.1 has a much slower data transfer rate than USB 2.0. Just be patient when doing your very first sync. Other syncing is faster just because you will be syncing less data at one sitting.  I love it. 80 GB, well worth it.

<Title>This product rocks!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>THE GOOD: Good price, lots of HD for the price, has an equalizer, is basically easy to use; can be recharged via a USB 2.0 port on a PC. Also, it looks good (if you need a snappy-looking MP3 player), the touch-pad control is very convenient to use and it's good for audio books too.  THE BAD: No FM tuner, dinky earbuds, weird (incomprehensible to me at least) filing system if you're using a PC running Windows and you try to find individual files in the iPod using Windows Explorer. So, instead of being able to easily delete a few files here and there, it's easier to just restore (ie reformat) the HD and start from scratch. AND, the battery isn't meant to be changed by the owner - you're supposed to mail it back to Apple when the battery dies (although aftermarket batteries are available for the more technically adept owners).  OTHER POINTS: Uses iTunes software to upload & download from, won't support music purchased from anyplace other than iTunes. iTunes is pretty easy to use, make sure your PC can run iTunes 7.6 before you buy an iPod! RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES: Speck ToughSkin rubberized case for iPods & a decent set of brand-name earbuds. CONCLUSION: The pluses outweigh the minuses as far as I'm concerned - I love my iPod! If you disagree, check out the Microsoft Zune or Creative Labs MP3 players.

<Title>No problems or issues at all, complaints seem overblown
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We have just upgraded from a 30GB gen 5.5. video iPod to this model, and are happy overall.  Any complaints regarding software glitches, cover flow, etc. can be fixed quite simply by downloading the newest software update as soon as you first hook your new iPod up to your computer, and it takes about 10 seconds to disable the cover flow feature.  It's a good price for the amount of memory.  I haven't noticed any drastic reduction in sound quality, but on the other hand, there isn't any improvement either.  The only reasons this doesn't get five stars is because there doesn't seem to be any upgrade in sound quality, and even with the software updates, the click wheel seems a touch slower than the old Video model.  But for the extra storage and price, and the improved exterior casing, it's still a great deal.

<Title>INCOMPATIBLE with Accessories
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought into the iPod despite concerns about being locked into a proprietary format.  This buy-in was based on the ecosystem of accessories available (and mainly options to integrate in my car).   I just "upgraded" to the 80GB iPod classic.  Everything I own that used to work with my previous 5G iPod video no longer works.  Anapod Explorer - BROKEN.  Never liked iTunes, and this was my solution.  It no longer works, which is, in Apple's Defense, Anapod's responsibility.  Fortunately the newest WinAmp integrates well (although it can't seem to get cover art right).  Still important to note that whatever file system changes were implemented here are likely to impact other products as well.  Auto OEM Adapter Kid - BROKEN.  My $600 OEM iPod car adapter no longer recognizes the iPod.  This is what I used my iPod for 90% of the time.  No auto connectivity, and this product is borderline worthless to me.  Logitech mm50 Speakers - PARTIALLY BROKEN.  Plays music but no longer charges the iPod.  How tough is it to make sure the newest iPods can still be charged with older accessories???  All in all, a MAJOR disappointment.  I'll be looking for a used or refurbished iPod video to replace this as soon as I get the chance.

<Content>I had been hesitant to buy a new iPod because of the high price tag for any of them, but I finally decided to spend the money and upgrade from my old iPod mini, which the battery was starting to becom bad on. I first looked at the 8gb Nano, but decided to spend $50 more and get 72gb more space, and the larger screen. Let me tell you, this device will change you life. The video and picture quality is unbelievable, and the music quality is also tremendous. For someone like me who travels a lot, this is a great product to own.

<Title>A worthy upgrade
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The most important thing to consider about purchasing this iPod is what you're coming from or comparing it too. Sure, it may not be that much different than the 5th Generation, but for people that have held on to older models (I had a 3rd Generation) or for whom this is their first iPod, it's absolutely as good as it gets. Sure, the scroll wheel isn't perfect, but it's better than the significantly older models, and it's definitely better than nothing! The only real major that I can see from the 5g is the new hard drive capacity. When I was considering getting a new iPod, I knew I wanted space, but I wasn't quite willing to sacrifice the slimness of the 30 gig. Now that's not at all an issue and all my needs are satisfied. On top of that, the new cover looks terrific (not nearly as rounded as it looks in all the pictures) and the cover flow is nice, though not perfect. So I would say that if you've got a 5g, it would probably be wise to hold out for a bigger iPod touch or something, but if you've got an older model or nothing at all, then this is just about as good as it gets.

<Title>A believer at last....
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been a PC guy for most of my computing life and recently switched to a Mac. I bought the Classic when it became available and am amazed at its ease of use, user friendly interface, capacity and most of all the quality of the sound that it plays. I am very picky about my music and until I bought the Classic I thought my Zen was a good player. This player puts the Zen to shame! It works seamlessly with Itunes and is all in all a great player. The only thing that I can negatively say about it is that when switching between playlists/songs etc there is a lag of a few seconds that takes a bit of getting used to but I guess thats the difference between flash memory and a hard drive. Other than that little quibble, the Classic is the way to go if you have a pretty good sized music collection. Set up was a snap and there were no issues with the OS. Another winner from Apple!

Had NO idea that Apple has totally removed the capability to run on W2K until I tried to install the software (Amazon, you should have put a warning somewhere). Spent several hours searching forums and looking for 3rd party SW to make it work but found nothing. I have way too much $ invested in SW that will not run under XP to switch operating systems.  Apple, gotta give you credit, you can shoot yourselves in the foot better than any company I know of (except maybe Microsoft).

<Title>Beware J&R for purchases
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had no idea there were different generations of the 80GB ipod, and J&R saw an opportunity to dump old inventory. My wife originally ordered the 30GB ipod from J&R through Amazon back in August. After much delay on the order, she called for an update on Sept 8.  She was told by their sales person that the black was out of stock and so she asked if there was something comparable. He said he had an 80GB he could send for the same price ($249) - sounded to my like it was the new ipod.     That arrived in the mail the second week of September.  Today, I walked into Circuit City to buy her the same 80GB ipod.  I spent the same $249. I was shocked to see that the one I just bought is much thinner, lighter, the graphics are more advanced, and there are more games on it. It's a totally different ipod.  J&R did not inform my wife as to what they were selling her.  They tricked her into thinking she was getting 80GB for the price of a 30GB when they actually sent her one of two (older gen) ipods they had lying around in stock, just when the NEW 80GB's hit the stores and the 30GB's were being discounted. The one they sent her is white with a gray dial, not silver with a white dial.  The ipod's themselves are wonderful, but beware what you're getting for the price when buying anything from J&R. They mislead and mis-inform people.

<Title>major problems with thumbwheel
<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I strongly urge anyone considering this product to do a test-drive first.  Apple has redesigned the thumbwheel and it just doesn't work properly.  Its virtually impossible to stop on the desired album or track.  Also, the album art is a disaster - images don't load timely and as they do, it causes the flow to freeze and then release 10 albums away from where you were trying to get to.  The Nano doesn't have this delay issue, so it must be related to the hard-drive slower access times.  But both the classic and nano both have the same redesigned thumbwheel that is very hard to control.  I was completely frastrated with my experience.  I'm not going to recommend another product, just don't buy this or the redesigned Nano.

<Content>I had a 5.5 gen IPOD before but decided to get Classic this week since it has larger storage and is thiner.  I got it Friday, but I have been disappointed with the issues I encountered.  1) The new IPOD already crashed once and I have to reboot it. I never rebooted my previous IPOD 5.5. 2) Sometimes I connect the IPOD with computer, the IPOD didn't show  the connected sign. Replug the cable didn't help and I have to reboot the IPOD to make it connected. 3) I upgraded Itunes to 7.4.2 so that I can use this IPOD. The iTunes  told me there is a IPOD software version 1.0.1 available which I expect they have some patches. But the upgrade failed because of some "1415" error.  I believe all of those issues will get fixed in the following few months. But I'm still disappointed, they should have done more testing before  putting it on market.  2 stars for what they did. I'll keep this ipod for 1 more week and will  return it if I still have problems with it.

<Title>So far so good...
<Date>Tue Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this ipod as soon as they became available at Apple stores.  The main problems that I have encountered so far is of course the clickwheel not being as sensitive as previous ipods.  I tend to wear my ipod on a belt clip, and before if I had a t-shirt over the ipod, I would be able to adjust the volume over the shirt.  However, I can no longer do that.  But that's not a big issue.  The other problem seems to be with the USB connections.  Sometimes when I sync my ipod or try to charge it, I have to adjust the USB cord a little bit to make a connection.  It's a bit aggravating but manageable.  The cover art flow does lag but fully loads in about 2 seconds.  I don't mind waiting that long.  The positives in regards to this ipod are of course the 80G space (my previous ipod was a 30G), the cheaper price (my 30G ipod was $300 when i purchased it) and a sleeker overall feel, whether it's the main menu flowing cover art or browsing by category.  In the end, I am satisfied with my purchase, so far.  Luckily, I haven't crashed yet.

<Title>Not for first timers
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this as a requested Christmas gift and was very much looking forward to having an easily portable drive that could play my CD collection at home as well as at work with docking stations, or, wherever I chose with the headphones.  The unit I received was purchased new at Best Buy, along with a charging cable.  Upon opening I found an 8 page simplisitc folder that tells you how to turn it on and off, but not much else.  No problem - go to the iTunes website and download a 70+ page instruction manual.  Great!  Here we go - loaded 700 Cd's worth of music onto the iPod, and enjoyed it for three weeks.  Then the iPod froze.  I tried to re-sync but it would no longer recognize several files stored in the iTunes library.  Deleted those files, "restored" the iPod to factory settings and tried to re-sync.  If collecting different "unknown error messages" is your hobby you might be happy with this.  Unless you're a big fan of user forums that offer multiple solutions to problems that should've been resolved before putting the product on the market I'd suggest that you seriously consider other options before purchasing this product.  (And no, I'm not an 80 yr old who knows nothing about them 'puters'.)

<Content>This is my first iPod and I have fallen in love.  With no prior product to compare it with, it is everything I wanted and more.  I love the screen, I love that my entire collection can be stored on it, I love the cover flow.  Pretty much I love everything about it.

<Content>Don't expect your 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime to arrive in 2-3 days. It's been almost as week and I still haven't received mine. UPS says it's still in transit.

<Content>80 GB is a great size.  If you're planning on doing anything with music videos or DVD's, perhaps go for the larger one.  My ipod arrived new and undamaged within a few days.  I've been loading stuff on it for a couple of weeks and only have 12GB on it.  I'll have my life back soon.

<Title>whoohoo for iPod!
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just joined the "iPod club" and purchased my first iPod from Amazon.  Fast delivery, lowest price anywhere and it's a guaranteed Apple product.  I've already downloaded my music library and I'm slowly (VERY slowly) filling it up.  80GB is HUGE!  I even downloaded a movie from iTunes and the clarity was so much better than what I was expecting.  This will be great for road-trips back home from school :-)

<Title>Better than the 20 Gig model (so far) but it doesn't have a 40 hour battery
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was one of the first people to buy the 4th generation 20GB ipod when it came out a couple of years ago and I really loved it but A) after a year of so of use it started to freeze a couple of times a month every month and B) it just totally died after a year and a half of use.  That being said, that made me a little reluctant to get a new iPod. So I got the 80GB two weeks or so ago and I'm liking it so far. I like the idea of being able to watch the movies and TV episodes I have on my computer  on my MP3 player and I think the coverflow feature is cool but I'm pretty disappointed with the battery life so far. The ads say you should get about 40 hour of music playback but the last two times I've listened to the music before a recharge I've gotten about eight or nine hours of battery life at the most and that kind of concerns me seeing as how I just got the thing two weeks ago and the battery life is already a little crappy (hence a four star review and not a five star review). In the unit's defense though my iPod did play for two hours this afternoon (with the backlight set to the "always on" setting) with the smallest sliver of battery life left so I was impressed with that (I set the backlight to "always on" when I'm trying to finish off the battery's life so I can recharge it sooner).  So all in all it's a really cool improvement over the 20GB model in most respects and the video option is really awesome as well but the battery life seems as poor as the original iPods and that's kind of a shame seeing as how that seems like something Apple could and should improve rather easily.  So I would recommend this baby if you have an eight hour flight or road trip but I don't know if it would be that great if you had a ten to twelve hour flight or road trip. Maybe a Zune would be better for that. I don't know.

<Title>Worth every penny, cover flow is just a minor flaw.
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The iPod is amazaing especially for people with huge music collections like me. But everyone keeps putting it down because the coverflow is a litte slow at loading the album art. Can you blame it? If you have 50 albums on the iPod do you think it can just load them up effortlessly? It's the same way on the iTunes menu on the computer. If you let the cover flows 2 second load up time get in the way of you enjoying your iPod then you have missed the point.
