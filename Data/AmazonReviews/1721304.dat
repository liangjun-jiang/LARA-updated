<Title>Stunning display

<Content>The first visual impression is the stunning clarity and colors of the OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)in amber and blue which makes it easy to navigate the menus and folders with high resolution graphics and icons.  The second impression is the easy operation of the functions by long or short presses of the menu button together with the FF, RW and play/pause buttons.  The third impression is the sound quality with decent earspeakers. The FM radio works well with my local stations even when close to an inteference source like the computer.  The internal battery recharges slowly through the USB port(10 hours) and the wall adapter will recharge the Li-ion battery 5 times faster (2 hours). The Visual Land armband is adjustable with velcro closure and buckle, is elastic, soft, thick and comfortable.   I have tried the Line Input recording function, the input jack is the earphone jack. The recording quality from the Line Input and the FM radio is a mere 8Kbps in mono, not very high quality. The file format also does not play back directly but can be played back on the PC in Windows Media player, very awkward. The voice record function works better than an analog minicassette recorder with a longer record time, higher fidelity, more concealable size and the digital file can be burned to a CDR using a utility like "Nero" for example.  The manual is not easy to read with poor grammar and lack of clarity.  Overall, a very impressive value. With its compact size and 512MB capacity, it also is useful as a USB flashdrive or pendrive when the retractable USB connector is extended with the thumbslide button.   
<Overall>5
