<Content>Well i have had this product for a while and it still works great. The price of $60.00 is worth it the bad thing about is its screen resolution sucks but the screen is very bright. Bottom line its worth buying.

<Title>Barely Works
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Good: -memory appears like a flash drive and will hold songs from WM Player -a single song will play on this player -battery lasts about 6 to 8 hours -Windows Media Player can convert song files to Sansa; if you don't have WMP, there is no software from Sandisk that will load them.  Bad: -Beyond playing a song, player can't do much more -Playlists can only be installed on the fixed 2GB memory, non-removable -Added micro SD card appears as another player, not additional memory -Added memory is limited to 2 GB Micro SD (NOT Micro SDHC) -Total memory cannot be more than 2 GB plus 2 GB, always separated -Playlists cannot play from both memories, only the fixed internal 2GB -If two playlists contain the same song, the song will be added twice -Sound quality is minimal -Sound volume at max is about medium compared to other players -Available operator's manual/website has little or no information -Player is physically very weak, won't play at temperatures below 50 F  Overall, if you are looking to play more than 500 songs or if you want to have multiple playlists without duplicate songs in memory, this ain't it!

<Title>Well, I got it going...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought it as a less expensive option to the iPod Nano for my 12-year old daughter.  No music software came with it, though an add for Rhapsody was included.  Took me a while before I realized I could use Windows Media Player - d'oh!  Not very intuitive but downloaded version 11 which is a definite improvement over 10.    And it works!  My daughter "Ripped" music from her CDs and it plays and sounds very nice.    Initial concerns with it freezing in the on position.  Couldn't find any reset technique in the instructions or on the Sandisk website, so we just let it run down the battery.  Haven't run any firmware update - afraid to now that it works.    Bottom line: If money's an issue, this is a reasonable option, but parental unit must be somewhat tech-savvy.  If you can spare an extra $75, go with iPod Nano.

<Title>Great alternative to 2GB iPod Nano
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great and cheaper alternative to the 2GB iPod Nano. I like the fact that it is expandable using Micro SD cards and has voice recording capabilities.  The unit is also easy to use, I figured out most of the functions in an hour (hint: get familiar with the menu options and visit Sandisk's site for some videos on using this unit).  The unit's functions are accessable with one hand after you are familiar with them.  Tip: To turn off the Sansa, press MENU once and then press and hold MENU for 2 seconds  You can use the supplied software to put your music on it but I found using Windows Media Player 11 is the easiest way to do so.  I have not used Rhapsody to buy and upload any music to my Sansa yet.  Sound quality is excellant using the supplied earbuds, I had slightly mixed results with the sound quality using my car's cassette deck (the songs ripped at higher bit rates sounded better).  I am hoping that Sandisk (and others) develope a more complete set of accessories for this unit like a docking unit and a case.

<Title>Fantastic form factor and excellent Mp3 performance
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit to supplement my 40gb 4th gen iPod.  My iPod is fantastic, but it is not easy to take everywhere due to its larger size.  I wanted a smaller MP3 player I could take and listen to at work, gym, and when shopping at the stores/running errands.  After weeks of research and some earlier purchases which were returned, I think this unit is going to fit the bill perfectly.  This unit has a lot of nifty features: -mp3 player -FM radio -voice recorder -photo viewer  The MP3 player and FM radio sounds excellent, very close to my iPod with decent headsets. I didn't use the standard headsets with the unit - instead I purchased Panasonic necklace fashion headsets with better frequency response.  This unit hangs unnoticed from my neck with the Panasonic headsets, and the sound quality is fantastic.  The FM radio reception is pretty good, although it does not pick up some stations as strongly as a dedicated radio with antennas.  The voice recorder has excellent clarity, but the menu could be better. Once you record a quick note, you have to switch back to the main menu, click to music, then voice recorder, then select the recording to hear the recording.  And there is no way to delete the recording except on the computer.  I wanted the voice recorder to record reminders and to-do's but this voice recorder is not as easy to use as my dedicated digital audio recorder.  The photo viewer seems no better than the photo viewer on most camera cellphones, and I doubt I'll be using it much.  The main purpose is to play music and listen to FM radio.  The unit seems very sturdy and the buttons seem to be very sold.  Overall it has a high quality construction feel, and the compact dimensions of the unit lend it to being taken everywhere to be used.  I love my iPod, but I think I will be using this unit a lot more than my iPod simply because it easier to carry around, has FM radio, and excellent performance for the sub-$100 price.  My friends strongly recommend I buy the Sansa e250 unit over this one.  But after much research, playing with the e250 unit in the store, I decided that I like the form factor of this unit better than the e250 unit with the awkward click wheel.  The click wheel felt quite stiff and not very smooth when I tried the demo unit in the store.  I'm used to the slick wheel of the iPod, and didn't want a unit that poorly duplicated the wheel.  The buttons on the c250 work perfectly fine without a wheel.    The e250 is also wider and longer than this unit, making it a bit less suitable as an alternative to my iPod.  edit: I also discovered that this player does not have a clock.  Due to a recent sale, I switched to the Sansa e260 player, which has 2 very important (to me) features:  date / clock, and the ability to delete voice recordings.   For those on the fence about buying a Sansa cXXX player or a eXXX player, I think the eXXX is the better player, despite its slightly larger size.  There are more accessories available for the eXXX than the cXXX, and the clock / voice recorder are more useful.

<Content>I have had this MP-3 player just over a month now and it has performed just fine.  I have had no problems loading or unloading songs onto it.  The quality of the music it plays is good with both headphones and external speakers.  The only thing I wish it had was an actual stop button instead of having to turn the unit off (it does at least have a pause button.   For the price I paid I feel that I got a good deal.

<Content>I'm writing a pre-purchase review. I have no idea whether to purchase this item or not because the dimensions CAN'T be accurate! How can the product weigh a whole pound more than it's own shipping weight?? And who'd want to carry a 2 POUND MP3 player? Why does the product dimensions say the thing is 9 inches long? That can't be accurate when everyone else is saying it's so small...well, how small??  Someone help me out here!   Concerned MP3er

<Title>No Audio Books
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this player with one MAJOR exception: it is not supported by Audible.com so you cannot have your audio books on it. All the comparable Sansa players are supported, so I bought this with the expectation of being able to listen to Audible content like any other SanDisk product. However none of the c200 series players are supported and Audible says this is because SanDisk has not provided them with the tech specs necessary. SanDisk was non-responsive to my inquiry as to when they would get this done like their other products - a generic thanks for your inquiry but no info. Bottom line - if you want just music this is a great choice. If you need versatility of also having audio books, buy something else.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this with my 8 year old daughter who wanted to spend her Christmas money on a player. She couldn't afford an i-pod, and this was a great solution. Easy for her to use, includes a decent FM radio, and a voice recorder so she can record herself. I was able to get her going and transferred her small CD collection quickly and easily. The screen is a tad small, so I might not use this for a photo album, but so is the nano's screen. I own an i-pod nano and had I known, I would have bought this just for the radio if nothing else. I haven't downloaded with Rhapsody or Napster yet, so I can't comment on that aspect yet. It will be interesting to see the differences between i-tunes and these. Bottom line: Consider this player for kids or yourself. A very good value.

<Title>Best MP3 player I've used
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my c250 for almost a year and it's never given me any trouble at all.  I took it on a six-week cross-country bicycle ride last summer and the thing is bomb-proof.  I didn't even have the protective case, but I think I may purchase that now.  Great battery life too.    I can't really explain the negative reviews this player has gotten, my experience has been great.  I find the display easy to read and I've had no issues with XP compatibility.  I had an iAudio player by Cowon before and it was always freezing up, requiring a firmware update.  The Sansa has been trouble free.

<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this Sansa almost a year ago. I was happy with it at first, but I'm beginning to discover it's more of a headache.  I'm not a technical wizard, but I'm no slouch either.  I found it extremely easy to download the music onto the player, but I have run into trouble.  I can't get the music OFF of the player and download new music.  I've sat down at my computer three times to try to acomplish this with no success.  I end up giving up and walking away.  I think I'm going to suck it up and buy an ipod.

<Title>Tester
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Sound is great, navigation easy, good quality voice recording.  There are two major problems:  1. The title and artist name of some songs is not copied to the player. They are simply "lost" for some songs, without any detectable reason. 2. After copying, recording and deleting files in the player does not correctly release the memory space. The result is that you have less and less space for new songs and recordings. The only way I found to correct the problem is to format and reload the songs, but that re-creates the problem described in #1. I am not sure if a new firmware would resolve it. I opted to return the player.

<Content>I was looking for a good alternative to the over priced Ipods. I bought this product a few months ago and I'm fairly happy with it and haven't had any big problems. I love that it can hold music, that I can easily cycle through, as well as play a radio. Blowing away the Ipod Shuffle at a lower cost. I've had some troubles with songs sometimes falling under their own separate categories. But for the most part the product was well worth the money and I'd recommend it to others.

<Title>Disappointing MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this item to use it for DRM-protected audio books. Felt a little flimsy and cheap when taken out of the box. After the installation, this supposedly plug and play device caused my computer to keep disconnecting and then reconnecting with the player. Two updates later I was able to transfer some files. Everything worked fine, however not with audio book playback. Unlike an Ipod, the player doesn't remember where I previously paused the current track after turning it back on. Also, when fast forwarding for longer than a minute of the track, the player switches to fast-fast forward, however re-starts the song when the fast-forward button is released!!! Really annoying. So between a cheap feel, poorly written and documented software and everyday problems with the interface I returned the item after 12 hours of trial.

When traveling, it isn't always convenient to recharge this way.  The user interface is simple and using iTunes and Windows Media Player it was easy to rip 20 CDs onto the player.

<Title>Which to buy?
<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am writing a pre-purchase review.  I am trying to decide between the sansa c-250 and the sansa e-250.  I have read a few comments in the reviews here, but am still undecided.  I don't think there is a big difference in size, but the e-250 may be easier to hold in one hand and operate while driving.  But, the C is cheaper, and cost is an issue for me.  Is the E really worth the extra $$?  Update:  I bought the e250 instead of the c250 and I'm very satisfied.  However, if you only want to put music on the player, as I do, the c is probably all you need.  Especially for the money, but I knew my wife would eventually want an ipod and the e resembled the ipod, so I knew when she saw it she would want the e over the ipod.  She already had a player that resembled the c and now, yes, she has already asked me if I'm going to get her an e250.

<Title>one big fault  -- otherwise quite great for the price
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The contrast level on the display is so low no matter how one adjusts the brightness and backlight that you will have a hard time seeing what feature/song you are selecting.  Its genuinely bizarre that they used a very light-blue field against a white backround. Text is black so at least you can see that clearly.  Other than that, the sound is good for such a cheap player and it has a built-in equalizer to adjust the sound to your own liking.  It will operate in MSC mode, which simply means that you can load music files into the player directly from the My Computer icon.  No software of any sort needed at all to load songs into the player. You lose the ability to make playlists in MSC mode but personally I prefer the speed and simplicity of MSC mode.  You cannot use MSC mode to play digitally-protected music.  Again not an issue for me. If you are looking for a cheap mp3 player, this is worth considering.

Might take a little patience. Works directly with Mindows Media Player's sync command. Syncs easily very little bs.   The jump from song to song is a little slower if your used to a zune or an ipod but if you your new to the mp3 player market this is one fine tiny option.

This player is a good, cost effective alternative to an iPod.  I'd highly recommend it.
