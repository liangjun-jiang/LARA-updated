<Title>The Best Looking MP3 Player!
<Date>Sat Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I opened the package skimmed through the instruction book and was listening to music in no time. The FM tuner is good, better than any other in my difficult to recieve area. I enjoy the belt clip, presents the joy-stick at just the right possition. I cannot imagine using an arm-band. The sound is awesome. The controls are easy to use. I remain very happy I chose Samsung. I feel Samsung is miles ahead of iMac.

<Title>SUPERB!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
<Date>Sun Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This wonderful tiny unit has it all!  I myself am not an ipod fan.  Yes, they do contain more memory but lack in other areas.  I needed a high quality voice recorder with decent sized memory capacity and this baby fits the bill with extras to boot.  A screen to view text or pictures, FM radio with great reception, time,voice recording and a host of other features which you may need in the future, if not right away. Rechargeable inbuilt battery that can run for 9 hours.  Sure beats having to constantly replace those draining AAA batteries. Its size is fantastic?  Discreet - unlike the somewhat larger ipods, which the same cannot be said about. You can clip this on your trouser loop and no one will be the wiser, and no chance of losing the unit either. I love it and cannot find a fault at this stage.  This lovely audio player is all I will need for some time. I don't know why some US sellers are unhappy about the US price tag.  In Australia the item costs twice as much and I still wouldn't trade it for anything else.

<Title>Feature-laden and good quality
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's great for almost all the reasons everyone else has shared so I won't repeat them here.  So instead... here are the things which I didn't like about it:  - I found the "joystick" navigation allowed for multiple errors which could've been entirely avoided had Samsung used the standard push-button navigation (assuming it wouldn't drastically change the form factor).  Although infrequent, sometimes when I intended to press straight down on the joystick it'd slip in another direction forcing me to navigate back to the original screen and try again.  - I'd prefer a carrying case that's more protective, especially in covering the screen and corners.  The way it looks, I'm afraid the case will break before the player does.  - The carrying hook is somewhat annoying if you don't use the lanyard since it rattles about (and it's especially evident when recording voice).  It would've been nice if it was slightly depressed within the device with a rubber cover over it, like a smaller version of the one on the bottom.  - Playback while fast forwarding or rewinding should be audible, but instead you don't hear anything.  - The headphones are definitely a disappointment.  My pair distorted slightly at middle volume when I turned on the SRS, Bass Boost, and WOW enhancement options.  (Test music was a 192kbs encoded Elliott Smith mp3.)  Also, retractable earbuds might've been a good idea to continue the theme of small and compact.  - Aluminum/magnesium shell is a bit soft, but it's understandable since it was an obvious choice of style over substance.  I scratched it on Day 1 as I was putting the device into the carrying case (you need to make sure that the initial fit is perfect before sliding it in).  Other than that...  this thing rocks.  :)  Samsung should build a phone around this with all the trimmings.  Even with a slightly larger footprint, I'd buy this to avoid carrying multiple devices around.

<Title>Great features, small unit
<Date>Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I also agree with the other reviews so will not say everything over again either.  I will point out a few things I liked that I didn't see in the other reviews.  *Love the FM record feature.  I set it up to automatically record my XM Radio FM mod signal every night and I have a fresh playlist everyday without having to download songs to it (but that's easy, and I still do occasionally).  *Don't forget this works as portable storage too.  You can create folders and move files with it from computer to computer.  *I liked the belt-clip over the arm band myself.  IMO, it makes it easier to remove and replace.  Plus, I just don't like things straped to my arm.  *Very easy to learn how to use.  Plus, you can play with the other features and most of the time be able to listen to music at the same time.  I figured everything out on my first walk.  *Very complete and well written manual.  I would assume someone in THIS country wrote it.    Tip: The manual suggests using the included software to convert CDs to MP3s, but I found it easier to use Windows Media Player.  Just rip your CDs to the WMP library (which converts them to WMA, and then Sync your library with the player.  Works very well, and this way you only have to use one program.  I didn't really dislike anything about this player, although I don't see much use in the text or image viewer.  The screen is too small and not THAT good to do either well.  The hard drive is a little smaller than a comparable iPod or Zen.  Overall a very good value, especially since it's cheaper than the mini versions of iPod and Zen (at least mine was, after rebate) and have most if not all or more of the features.

<Title>bad experience
<Date>Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>well, this was the second mp3 player i bought. the first was a sony  NW-E75 that i bought and it worked great. only reason i decided to buy a new one was because that one only had 256mb of memory and now i was looking for a 1gb player. so i went to circuit city and was looking at the 1gb players. i decided to go with the samsung YP-T7Z over the sony NW-E507 because the samsung looked smaller and more compact. so i bought it, took it home, and wanted to try it out. the first thing that got me was that when i opened it, it said i had to charge it for 2 hours, which seemed odd to me. well i did, and then, i decided to test it out. i plugged in the headphones, and pressed play to hear the 2 default songs already in there. i will say that the sound quality was wonderful and i was impresed. however, when i switched it to the next song, it stopped in the middle of the 2nd song. i thought it was because i acidently pressed play or accidently hit a button, but it had gotten stuck for some reason. i couldnt turn it off or anything. i tried pressing stop several times, nothing. menu, nothing, tried the reset button, nothing. it was just stuck there, the screen still lit up. so needless to say, i was dissapointed, because it would have been the perfect thing to work out with. i took it back to circuit city and just stuck with sony since i already know it. i know its odd to base ones opinion on one defective device, but the sony products i have so far have not caused me any problems.

<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's really kind of cool to have such a small player carrying so much music or audiobooks.  The earbuds seem fine--good fidelity and fairly long cord.  Haven't figured out if I like the clip attachment better than using the cord with the player dangling around my neck--nice to have a choice, though.

<Title>i love it
<Date>Thu Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the player 3 days ago and so far im loving it. I got the 129.99 refurbrished 1 gig one, and apart for a minor very unnoticeable scratch, it feels and works like new. Im very confident that i will not be using the 90 day manufacture warrenty (ill post again if the player breaks down on me).   As for the player, im totaly in love with it. My first impressions when i saw it and picked it up was how light it is, and not to mention very very small (its easy onto the palm of my hand and i have small hands). I expected it tobe much heavier because it was so small.   It has so many functions for such a little player, it can... view photos, text, record voice - fmradio - and directly for another portable audioplayer with an included audio-in wire, there is VERY powerful(the most powerful fm tuner on a player this size ive ever seen, channels are sooooo clear) STEREO fm radio with 20 presets, i think somone wrote on a review there is no playlist...well there is a playist! the player also has a clock and shows the bitrate of the song that is currently playing( a feature i've never seen on a player before).  I've heard a complain its very hard to see the screen, its not bright enough or too glazed. Its true when you dont press anything screen goes very black and its hard to see the screen, but once you touch the navigation button it lights up brightly. It becomes very visible and readable even with a small screen.   Im not sure about battery life, but i've been using it for 3 days without a recharge and its still on full! I think ive used it for a total of 5 hours. I'm pretty sure it will last you a whole 10 work day.  The player also doubles as a usb storage device, it comes with a very little direct connect usb adapter that turns your player into a thumb drive.   As for the softerware i have not tried it yet, but it does come with software for your music, photos, and text.   The only draw-backs are the earbud headphones are not that great.And the player does not come with a case only a belt clip. The player is sooo cute! i dont wanna get a scratch on it. I hope  a 3rd party makes a case soon.

<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you run, & sweat when you run, this unit will NOT hold up. Samsung will tell you it is designed for sport enthusiasts...it is not. This MP3 (1 year) malfunctioned due to 'Water Damage' resulting from perspiration...not caught in the rain, not dropped in the sink. It is not repairable, not honored by the warrantee, and Samsung basically washes it's hands because of their own poor quality casing design. Guess I'll be 'running' to have better luck with an iPod...

<Date>Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It plays ogg. on the fly playlist. firmware support. fm/picture/text/music/usb drive...plus voice/fm/in-line recording... hot damn.  All features are implemented quite well even FM radio and FM recording.    I am very picky when come to spending this kind of money.  But I definitely feels that the extra $50 on this compare to the iPod shuffle is well justified.   Only bad: price.  could be $50.00 cheaper.  It also features internal battery instead of using AA/AAA battery. It's a trade off between size and style.  Do expect this unit to die after a couple years of hard use since it's internal battery will eventually give out.  This maybe a buying decision for some of you.  But for now I am happy...somewhat...before I realize how much I spent on this.  Now only if they can put a 20GB flash chip and make it play video...lol.  It's a wonderful ultra compact unit but for a price.

<Title>howie
<Date>Fri Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: It is the one of the first players that is Certified for  MS Windows Media 10.0 play for sure, which mean it will play all existing audio format, mp4, ogg, secure wma, asf,etc.  This is my first FLASH mp3 player. Yes it looks expensive. but the quality is amazing, I am picky to the sound quality. The SRS and WOW, and equalizer feature is awesome. the charger is 120V and 240V also, good for shaver plug in all 3+ star hotels over the world. It also can slowly be charged from any usb 2.0 port too. This unit is very small and looks sharp.  The supplied headphone is superior in quality,  not those cheap one that you need a replacement.  The screen is vivid, and it can play picture and text files too. ( I can download some notes and minutes to read )  It also have a voice recording mp3 recording, and FM stereo recording that is so nice. Language support is wide and all songs id tag can be displayed in its own language.  The belt-clip is perfect for guys that used to wear beeper, the necklace is preferred by the ladies.  It is a flash player so you can jump up and down without worrying the harddrive crash like in those big harddrive based ipods.  The ipod shuffle do not even have a display, does not fit me. The menu control is very innovative, one small menu button, and I can browse through the menu and change setting quick  after reading the small booklet provided.  It will last for 16+ hours per charge.  I called this my silver match-box player. ( a bit more than 2") Oh, the metal shell is made with magnesium alloy, not some plastic casing.  Cons : Be patient on the initial battery charge, it does take me 1.5 hour. And make sure to unlock the HOLD button. A bit expensive, but what the heck, it is a gadget, and you need to get one that really make the ipod shuffle inferior.

<Title>Awesome player...
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this player a little over a week ago.  Here are my observations and thoughts so far:  1) Size: The size of this thing is amazing, so tiny.  You can't even tell if it is in your pocket.    2) FM: I have used this several times in the gym, they have the mini transmitters so you can watch and listen to the TV.  It works great and helps pass the time.  3) FM Record:  Works great, haven't used it since when I was first playing around, but the record quality is good.  4) Line Record: Works pretty much like the FM Record, sounds great, works like a charm.  5) Color Display: HUGE plus. It looks cool, the menus take a bit to learn, but after about 20 minutes of messing around it becomes 2nd nature.  I haven't used it for picts yet, but given the small size, it will probably be more of a "wallet" shot kinda things, (picts of the family etc).  6) MP3: plays most file formats I can think of...the burn software inclued works well.  7) Sound: Using the earphones provided, the sound is very good.  I have yet to hook it up to the stereo, but given the sound quality so far I am sure it is excellent.  The EQ features all work great, lots of stuff to mess around with.  8) Battery: I have had my player for a week, so far I have not even seen a decrease in the power bar. My use so far includes:     - 3 trips to the gym (45 min each time)     - 2 flight SEA-LAX (about 1.5 hours use each way)     - office and home use about 4 hours     - Loaded about 500mb from the USB     - Recorded 2 songs via Line record     - Recorded 1 song on FM  9) Battery part II: I was concerned about the built-in battery and almost purchased another unit with a AA due to that fact.  However, given my experiance so far, the battery life has been excellent.  I also did some homework on the Samsung website.  You can order a replacement battery for about 50 bucks.  If you are in any way mechanically inclided I am sure that it is not complicated to replace it.  If the battery craps out in the near future I will probably go that route.  But given the way technology goes, by that time I may want a new player. :)  I have no regrets in purchasing the player.  The one thing I wish they had included would have been an integrated USB port (ala Shuffle).  While it would have doubled the size, it still would have been nice.  I did have a chance to look at the shuffle and it doesn't compare.  Just that one feature.  Enjoy!

<Title>A tiny, stylish, powerful little player.
<Date>Sat May 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>[[ Pro ]] WINDOWS COMPATIBLE: If you are using Windows XP, you can plug the player in using the USB cable and instantly begin to drag and drop the files. There's no need to install anything.  HOW IT LOOKS: As other reviewers have mentioned, the YP-T7Z is tiny and light. The display screen is about 1/2 the size of the player, and the player itself is about the size of a large eraser, in other words, it's adorable.  SPACE: 1 GB, it can double as a flash drive. This is excellent if you want to transfer movie files from 1 computer to another. Currently I have 226 songs saved, with 70MB to spare.   FUNCTIONS: Impressive. This player is packed to the brim with functions. There's FM radio, voice recording, playlist creation, text viewer, and image viewer. The player also doubles as a calendar/clock--just like today's cellphones. Under "setting >> display >> languages," you can select to view the player in a range of languages, including chinese (S and T), French, German...even Hungarian. This is a really cool function if you want to show the player to your grandmother, who can only read Chinese.   For a college student like me, the "voice recording" function is particularly useful (when I'm not listening to music or the radio). In my experiments, I was able to pick up perfect voice recordings from 1 end of the house to the other. The voice quality was also pure--no static/weird sounds.   FM radio is excellent. When I set the frequency to "high," it picked up many stations around my city that I didn't even know existed. It has 20 presets, which is more than enough for most people, I imagine.  SOUND: Awesome sound quality, especially if you have a good headphone.  NAVIGATION: Very very easy.  TRANSFER: On USB 2.0, the songs transfer almost instantly. So fast. On a slower USB (like the one on my laptop), a full album takes about 2 minutes.   EARBUDS: The earbuds are ligh gray (setting them apart from the white iPods) and are fairly comfortable after putting on the black sleeve/thingy.  BELT STRAP/NECK STRAP: the belt strap is clear plastic, and goes on securely over pants. The neck strap is pretty ugly though (it's a wire wrapped in a clear plastic).  [[ CON ]]  BATTERY LIFE: 10 hours (or so they claim). It feels more like 8 hours to me, but don't quote me on that. I'm having to charge the batter every 2-3 days which is a minor inconvenience. It takes me about 3 hours to fully recharge the battery, which is also a minor annoyance.  PRICE: This player is a bit pricey for a 1G device, so shop around the internet for the best price.  [[ SUMMARY ]]  I love my little Samsung. It's ingeniously constructed, pretty, and powerful. I would recommend the YP-T7Z to anyone who's looking for an alternative to the ubiquitous iPod.  [[ EDIT as of Dec. 24, 2005 ]] I've had this player for close to year now, and it's working fine. The earphones broke, so I got a new pair. Now I realize that you can get even better sound quality out of the player if you have a good pair of earphones. Once, when I accidently dropped it, the screen froze. I resolved this problem by pressing the "reset" problem. I recently took the player to China, and found that I had no trouble charging it using the Chinese electrical voltage.

<Title>You get what you pay for
<Date>Mon May 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Looks: Silver for 1 Gb version, Light blue for 512 Gb version, I have the silver one, has rounded corners and looks decent but not particularly impressive  Features: Plays many digital music formats, radio tuner, voice/line-in/radio recording function, with a touch of image view and text view, all inside the little box half the size of a mini-ipod.  Cons: If you selected the play-mode as "shuffle folder" and then you switch to playing a different folder, then the player doesn't "remember" the previous play-mode setting and would default to playing the songs in the folder sequentially. Also there's limited playlist support, to create a playlist one has to select each song he wants in the playlist and press a button, if you want to add hundreds of songs in different folders into a playlist it'll take forever. Controls are intuitive enough but sometimes I find myself mistakenly pressed and held the 5-directional button when I wanted to simply press it and vice versa.

<Title>excellent but with a few quirks
<Date>Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really like the fully customizable equalizer to get the sound just the way I want it. I also like that you simply drag files from your WindowsXP computer to the MP3 player.  No extra software needed to move music files to the player.  The battery life is only OK at max 10 hours and it takes several hours to recharge, which seems a bit odd.  The little stick is a bit more loose than it should be -- sometimes you will move it up and it will think you moved it to the right, et cetera.   Still, the sound is so great, these are really minor quibbles.

<Title>Great Flash-Based MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this little guy and I love it!    APPEARANCE: The silver metal casing is great, durable, definitely better than plastic. The color screen is a huge plus, not necessary, but it definitely makes the overall appearance much more appealing. Displays 65K colors and is 1-1/4in in size.  Buttons located on side of player are easy to use. One very minor drawback I feel is the small retractable clasp on top of the player for which a neckstrap can be attached.  When no strap is attached, the clasp retracts, rattles around and is very annoying.     MENU/FOLDERS: Very easy to view and understand. Folders consist of Now Playing, Navigation, FM Radio, Playlist, Image Viewer, Text Viewer, Settings, Exit.   NAVIGATION: Though the navigation takes a little while to get accustom to, just spend a few minutes playing around and you'll figure it out. The only minor drawback is the navigation toggle. It feels a little loose as other reviewers have mentioned, and it tends to misguide you sometimes. An example might be I want to increase the volume, though when I push the toggle up it sometimes might accept the right or left toggle action, thus changing the music track. Again, you just need to play with it a little to get the movement down.  If you have large thumbs....good luck!    BATTERY: Lithium based; Charge time roughly 2 hrs; Playtime is around  8-10 hours.  OTHER COOL FEATURES: Equalizer with SRS and WOW capabilities; voice recorder-great sound quality; FM radio with preset options; Picture viewer-view jpeg images; Text viewer-read .txt files, Doubles as a Flash storage device; Screensaver-displays time and date; Etc.  DOWNLOADING & USB CAPABILITIES: Too cool! This player is designed to work flawlessly with newer versions of Microsoft Windows Media Player. Simply click and drag your music files from your desktop to the player via the USB 2.0 adaptor and you're done...no software needed! Though the Samsung YP-T7Z does come with software to adjust images, create music folders and playlists, if you have WMP you're all set. You can also connect the YP-T7Z to a CD player and it will record your CD music files into MP3 format.  Hope this was helpful!

<Title>love it, or hate it
<Date>Wed Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It seems people either love this one or hate it. It has a ton of features most of which i'll never use, but its awesome that they thought of almost everything. Here's the things that i discovered i don't like. 1)The single knob style menu key is really hard to press in the exact direction you need, and you end up jumping out of the menu you were trying to use, a few more separate keys would be helpful. 2) The player doesnt give you much time to read or do anything in a menu before automatically jumping out to the main screen, so if you have a long filename your trying to read (even at the fastest scroll speed) it jumps back before you can see it all. 3) There doesn't seem to be a way to order the songs in a folder the way you want, not even alphabetical like a pc arranges them. Its the order you put them on the player and thats it. 4) only one playlist option as far as i can tell. You have to pick each song and mark it to be played by the playlist instead of playing every song on the player. I would prefer multiple playlist option like you can do on the included software that seems to only let you do that for pc playback. I could be wrong, i'd suggest going to the store and playing with one before buying. Other than that its been a great player, no lockups like the mpio i traded in on it.

<Title>Excellent recorder
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This player was recommended to me by a co-worker, and I took it on three major interviews -- interviews I couldn't afford to lose.   It worked superbly. I highly recommend it as a recorder. It saved my interviews as MP3s, which I was able to play back using Windows Media Player.   It is a good player as well. I moved some music to it, and they played well. The computer interface is very easy to use.   My only caveat is that the lighted screen goes off too fast, but I have to figure out how to change that.   The battery life is long -- 10 hours, and it can record up to 4 hours of interviews. It's also very small -- my biggest fear was that I was going to lose it from my purse!

<Title>Definately THE BEST!!!!!! 
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received it Yesterday and I have to admit it was soo much easier than learning how to store info on my Cell phone!! My pictures are vivid, My Music sound-is Superb!!! I couldn't believe how much this tiny thing PACKED A HUGE PUNCH!!!   At first I was debating between the i-Nano or this and I'm VERY pleased I choose this. It also includes a belt clip & a necklace holder so if you're an "on the go" person who DOESN'T like big clunky things then this is perfect!!!  Also, I hooked it up to my old computer Labtec speakers at work and the SOUND WAS SUPER CLEAR.. Its even better than when my comupter is hooked-up to these old speakers..for a moment I thought someone switched my speakers!! I still can't get over the quality of this product... SAMSUNG has definately done an AWSOME job!!! My co-worker actually bought the I-Nano and it ended up bending in her pocket... so go figure... You won't be sorry with the price and the quality of this product!!!

<Title>Not With Audible You Wont.......
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this unit to use with Audible downloads.  After receiving the unit and trying to get Audible to recognize it I discovered that they are NOT compatible (pays to do your homework FIRST).  The screen is dull when displaying pictures and the joy stick seems to be unpredictable, working some of the time and other times ignoring the control.

<Title>BIG SOUND AND FEATURES IN A MATCHBOX !
<Date>Sat Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you want a player with lots of features this is the unit for you.  Unlike more expensive units you get not only the FM tuner (which can be recorded), but also the ability to have pictures, use a preset EQ or customize to your taste, and a host of other great features.  Of course it's not perfect, but it meets every need most people will have and it's simple to use.  I didn't have to read the manual to setup and start downloading and navigating.  Several reviews say the earbuds are not good but for the average listener they are exceptional.  This is a cool and very good looking player.  The quality is also very nice and the price is right...Give it a look b/4 you shell out big bucks for another unit with less features.

<Title>Plays for sure? Hmm.  Not so sure.
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me be fair to Samsung: I *wanted* to like this product.  The dings other posters gave this product (screen too dark, screen too small; "joystick" a bit flaky)I could easily overlook.  I had this product for only two days- the first day was all about "getting to know you" (device features; screen navigation; becoming accustomed to the tactile elements), which amounted to nothing more than the FM tuner.  All of which was fine.  Day two was a futile attempt to have WinXP recognize it as a device so I could start moving files into it.  Hopeless. Samsumg tech support and I went through all the usual configuration suspects.  We booted and re-booted countless times.  USB recognized it as device, but WinXP refused to see it as removable drive.  Samsung's final verdict- a bad "USB chip", and the device would need to be returned for servicing.  Too bad.  I think all the positive kudos about the Samsung YP-TZ are deserved.  It sounds (at least the FM tuner) and looks great.  I wanted a well rounded MP3 player that was not of the Ipod pedigree, and the Samsung YP-T7Z fit the bill perfectly.  But for something this profound to go wrong at such an early stage of ownership- sorry- I can't buy it (or accept it).  Samsung will go back, and Creative Labs- here I come!

<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this player could be the best, has lots of functions, but after a couple months, the thing started having problems such as can't play songs, or it freezes up.  Those occurred every other week or so, but now it doesn't let me add songs nor write any firmware.  Called Samsung customer service and the supervisor said "we only sell you the product, the problem is yours not ours"

<Title>don't throw your money away on this
<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I must say this player appears attractive, colored LCD screen, FM, friendly user interface, support OGG files...You may not believe, it freezed when I turn it on for the second time. I couldn't do anything but reset it. That first day, I had to reset about twenty times. Extremely upset, I had to sent it back to samsung for repair. Many other reviewers share the very same problem. I cannot understand why Samsung allow these players to come out. I suggest you don't take the risk of throwing money away on buying this.

<Title>Feature packed and super portable
<Date>Sat Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I picked up a refurb for $83 on eBay. Great little player. One really nice feature is you can fast forward and rewind mp3's, which is great if you're listening to an audiobook in that format. MP3 and FM radio sounds really nice through a pair of computer speakers. I imagine it would sound even better through a full size stereo. You get exceptional quality sound through a pair of high quality headphones. The earbuds included are ok but they're not form fitting, so they fall out real easy. I listened through a pair of BOSE with noise cancellation and it was amazing, the difference in the quality compared to my Trisonic dollar store clip ons. It's also a portable drive and a voice recorder. You could really go stealth with the voice recorder, being it's so small. You can even look at pics on it. I highly recommend. Samsung has really stepped up the quality of their electronics over the past couple years and I have not had a problem yet with this unit.

<Title>Super portable, excellent sound and feature packed
<Date>Sat Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this item from Amazon 1 month ago. Based on the reviews I chose this player over iPod because of the voice recording capabilities and built in radio.  Pros:  Sound, and I mean sound is excellent. I am still amazed after 1 month with the quality of sound and with the options to customize it. I like the Wow and customizable equalizer. I am also very happy with the battery life. I have been using it about 2 hours a day listening to music and went 2 weeks on one charge. I prefer internal battery over AAA, and there is an option to buy new battery after couple of years if this wears out. Charging is very fast on the included charger. Voice recording is very nice and since it records in MP3 I can record many hours of lectures. The radio is also a plus if you get tired of music and want to listen to news etc. It works very nicely. The setup is almost non-existent. If you have Windows XP, just plug it in out of the box, no software needed. Windows recognizes it as a flash drive and you are ready to drag-drop folders with your music into the player. The transfer rate is so fast that I don't think the Samsung 1GB vs iPod nano 2GB makes much difference since it takes few seconds to replace music you want on it (no sweat). It plays both, WMA and MP3 as well as other formats which I don't use.   Cons: The ear buds are not very good and I purchased new Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds with it right away. As mentioned by others, the neck strap holder in the player moves a little and some people may think it's annoying. I find it non-obtrusive, since if you have it in you pocket it doesn't move and if you jog, you have head phones and you don't hear it. Don't buy it for viewing text or pictures because the player is a size of a matchbox and screen on it is small. I never use these features.   Why I purchased this player over iPod? Loaded with features (voice recording, FM). Plays many music formats. Feels more sturdy then iPod nano, which gets scratched and screen breaks a lot. iPod nano is very thin, and I was afraid it will break in my pocket if I accidentally sit down on it (Heard it happen to other people). Price is cheaper and I can use it as a flash drive with any music software or music formats (plays for sure logo).  Highly recommend for those who don't need to have all their music collection with them on the player at all times.

<Title>Far Superior to Ipod
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this player for Christmas from my other half, I was told that I was going to get an Ipod but everyone in town was sold out.  After listening to my favorite music on this unit and listening on a friends ipod nano, the nano is like breaking out the old cassette tapes.  Great features, battery life, FM radio, pictures(that takes up music space, but i still have about 100MB free)  The ear buds are pretty good, bit I am thinking of getting a better set.  I plugged in a friends B&O headphones into it and the sound quality really shows.  stay away from fruit go with samsung!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Fixed My freeze up Problem!
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was 100% satisfied with this player -- the features are awesome.  After 2 months, however, the unit started to freeze immediately after starting up.  I tried everything - letting the battery drain, resetting the unit 20+ times, etc, and it constantly froze up when I started it up.  All my computers said "USB Device not recognized" when I plugged it into them.  Nothing played, and the clock on it stated the current time it started up, and it froze there.  I was ready to go to Samsung for an RMA...  ...when my wife did something I didn't think of doing.  She reset the unit, so, it was powered down.  She then plugged it it into her laptop without turning it on at all, and wala!  She could see ALL the MP3s on the unit!  After she erased all of the MP3s from it, she put back on one, and boom!  the thing powers up and works beautifully!  Puzzled, I was to the point where I assumed that one (or more) of the MP3s that were copied to the unit were causing the freezeup.  We went through all the MP3s, and got rid of ALL the MP3s with bitrates that weren't 128kbps, 160kbps, or 192kbps (I read somewhere that this player didnt do anything over 192kbps, not sure if thats true).  We loaded the unit back up after ensuring they were all one of the 3 "standard" bitrates, and it works beautifully!  I seriously hope this information may help others of you who have this same problem.  I have a feeling its just one of your MP3s thats corrupted / or an incorrect bitrate that this player might not support.  If it weren't for this odd issue it would have definitely got 5 stars from me!!!!

<Title>Awesome audio but awkward controls
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The audio from the large lighter size player is awesome, incredible.  The controls are awkward and setup and operation takes a long time. The manual is more detailed than for most products but the player does not always respond consistently in accordance with the instructions.  If you are patient, have time to invest in figuring the player out, can accept the ocassional inconsistent control responses, this is a good player for the price.  The earplugs are useless...the Sony plugs not any better, unless you have earlobes of steel (plugs fall out)...I recommend a good comfortable headset.

<Title>My new best friend
<Date>Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got this in the mail yesterday. And I have to admit, I was turned off by how small this little thing is. The photos make it look so big. But in this case, size has nothing to do with this.   The sound this thing gives is impressive. I was using a PSP for my music and this MP3 player blows it away. It can get REALLY loud. Plus you can play around with the equalizers to enhance the sound more, which is a good thing.   The menus are really easy to navigate and songs are very eay to get onto the machine. You can use Windows Media player if you like or you can download the songs then simply copy and paste them into the player or folder. The screen is quite small but you can also put pictures onto it as well. If you're tired of listening to the songs you've downloaded, you can listen to the built in FM radio.   Overall, this is a great MP3 player for someone who thinks the iPod is too expensive. It can hold 250 songs, has great sound, easy menu navigation, picture viewing, built in radio, and recording and 1 GB of space for a decent price. (If you can find a used or refurbished one) I recommend this 100%

<Title>Faulty product NOT supported by Samsung
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player December '06, and was very pleased with it for 4 months. However, when I went to delete files one day, I got a No space for DB error, and the player froze on the Samsung screen. I reset the player to no avail. The player is not recognized by a computer now. I contacted Samsung in hope of help-my player is still under warranty. However, my serial number has rubbed off, because it's only a sticker stuck on the back, and wore off due to normal use. When I told Samsung the serial number was no longer readable, they wouldn't help, even though I still have my receipt to prove purchase. I researched to see if there was any fix I could do-this one error is very common to the player. Basically, Samsung won't support their product from a common problem that's endemic to their player. I can't recommend this product for this reason.
