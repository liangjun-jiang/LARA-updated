<Title>Finally, the drag and drop MP3 player I have always wanted
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had the Sony Network Walkman and the Apple Nano Ipod.  Both sucked with the proprietary software to get MP3s on to the device.  This is the best MP3 player out there right now.  The only reason why I gave it 4 starts was due to the USB cable which has a proprietary connector.  If you lose this cable, you are screwed and will have to try and buy a replacement from SanDisk.

<Title>By far the BEST flash mp3 player on the market
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the e270 about two weeks ago and really put it through it's paces.  I travel on a plane about 10 hours each week, so I've gotten some use out of it.  Oh, and I watch tv shows on it too, which is surprisingly tolerable given the small screen size.  Positives: -The screen is way bigger than a Nano, and it's really nice -Plays Video -User changeable battery (when they release it, which I'm sure will be soon) -Flash upgradable using MicroSD (also, there will be full albums coming out in MicroSD compatible "gruvi" cards) -Sound recorder, with easy to use record button -VERY VERY sturdy, with a metal back, that looks great and does not scratch easily (I don't even have a case) -Plays FM radio -6gb for the same price or less than a 4gb nano  Negatives: -The charger is USB only which for 98% of people is not an issue, but if you need one reportedly the Griffin Powerblock works fine, as I would suspect any charger that allows a usb cable to be plugged in -A bit thicker than the nano, but I actually prefer the e200 form factor

<Title>Love It
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's a beautiful player, a little bit bigger than the IPOD nano but that doesn't bother me. The fact that it has FM, and can hold pics and video is enough that I can deal with it being a little bit bigger and maybe heavier, but it's negligible.  Good: I like the scroll whell on this. I don't like the IPOD scrolls because I always move past the selection that I want or tab it by accident and select something I didn't want. This, you feel the wheel click so that won't be a problem. The buttons around the wheel is a bit small but I have small fingers so it's not a big deal. The interface is easy, I just dragged my music over and it was fine. Battery life is great. I already watched one movie and listened to ~5 hours of music and I still have 3/4 of my battery.   Bad: You have to use a computer to charge it. When it plays movies, it pauses in between scenes for about 5-30 secs which can be annoying. The screen is a bit small that you can't see the pics too clearly but it's a small player with a flash drive, so that's unavoidable. You have to convert the movies/pictures using their converter, which freezes my computer sometimes and it takes a while for it to transfer movies (~20 min for a 650MB movie). Also, there aren't that many accessories you can buy for it. I've been trying to buy an adaptor so I can use it in my car but haven't been able to find anything. And when you plug it into the computer, you can't do anything to the player.   Overall, I think it's a great player. It's a flash drive, so you can take it running and not worrying about possibly damaging the harddrive inside. I originally had Creative Zen Sleek Photo but returned it and got this one and I'm VERY glad, not that Creative don't make great mp3 players but this one is much smaller and has video and I can exercise with it (assuming I get off my butt and actually go to the gym)

<Title>So far I love it!!
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this from Amazon a few weeks ago and so far I love it.   I had an iPod 30GB video player that died loading songs the first time.  Apple replaced it and then the replacement died the same way.   (Apple gave me a full refund to their credit!)   I'm not sure why my iPod didn't work and so I've been a little gun shy with the SanDisk, but I haven't broken it yet!   Turns out, when Windows Media Player tries to sync with the device - it get's screwed up.  (Hold down the power button for 20 seconds to reset.)  But - when I drag and drop files - it works perfectly.  The album art is not displayed on the SanDisk and the Windows help site has an item on their FAQ about this saying it is a SanDisk problem.  Also, the radio reception is not the greatest, wish it had a little antena or something.  Also, I'd really like a wall charger for it.   Other than that it's perfect!   I REALLY like it - and - I haven't broken it which is amazing considering my experience with iPods.   Update on 7/14/2006.   The Sansa did lock up when trying to load over 700 songs until I did the following: 1)  Changed the USB Mode Setting to MSC from MTP. 2)  Formatted the Sansa from Windows specifing "Fat-32" - You need to be in MSC mode to specify Fat-32 formatting. 3)  Then I changed back to MTP mode and haven't had it lock up anymore.     Maybe with a new firmware update this won't happen, but I read about this tip on the web and it helped me.    Also - the odd song doesn't show up on the player (but IS in the Sansa Music folder when you view it through Windows) and I have to copy it over again for it to show up to play the song.  Also, I wish there was a easy way to merge songs in WMP like there is in iTunes.  And I still am not getting the Album Art to show up.   However, I have to say I LOVE this thing and I've been very happy.

<Title>Do All The People Who Have Reviewed This Product Work for SanDisk??
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>They must b/c I don't know how they're all so happy with it.  I'm not going to write a long diatribe here, but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270.  For starters, it's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services. It is compatible with Rhapsody, but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer. The MTC protocol (see, I told you it is difficult. . . and I'm not that technologically savvy) only works with USB 2.0, not 1.1, which I have.  Also, it scratches way easily. If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it.   The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next, but the scroll wheel is pretty cool.   I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better. The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you're in the gym or on a plane, you can hear all sorts of backround noise b/c it isn't loud enough. (And yes, I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $150 and I'm still not pleased with the sound performance).  I can't totally trash the player, although I'm super dissapointed with it. . .especially in light of how much money I spent on it.  Customer Support has been great. Quick and responsive. The player design is cool. It's small, but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate. The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking.  Overall, if you're looking for a player that's compatible with all of the music to go, subscription-based services, look further than the e270. If you are cool with paying per song, go with the Nano and itunes. Oh, and who cares about the expansion slot. 6GBs are enough.

<Title>Good, Serviceable Player
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This marks my 3rd MP3 player and I have been quite happy with it.  It doesn't have the capacity of some of the larger hard drive based players, but I've discovered that I don't really miss the capacity.  I had a 20 GB  player that I was very happy with until I left it on a plane, but I'm not sure that the extra capacity was worth the extra size, it was over twice the size of my Sansa.   I also have a smaller 1 GB player that I'm giving to a friend now that I have this one, 1 GB just wasn't enough capacity and the player itself was also just too small. The biggest plus I see with this player is that they have FINALLY incorporated the feature I've been screaming for ever since these players first came out, a flash card slot.  With flash card capacities now getting into the multiple GB range, I've been after a player that accepted cards in essence giving you unlimited capacity, as long as you're willing to buy more flash cards.

<Date>Mon Jul 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a beautiful machine, and I was very excited to buy it. Unfortunately, it locked up twice, once while synchronizing, WMP 10, and once while listening. Both times I could not turn it off, and it was unresponsive. I did not call tech support, because I have little patience for products that don't work as they should.

<Title>Very, very Satisfied
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I narrowed my selection to the 4G Nano, and the Sansa e270.  I selected the Sansa due to 1)Larger memory, 2) Available expansion slot, 3) Larger screen, 4) More Durable, and 5) It was different from what everyone else had.  The unit worked perfectly right out of the box.  The large display was excellent (I can't read a damn thing without my glasses, ^$#& middle age), I don't need my reading glasses to navigate and make my choices.  Sound was just as good as my Discman (I picked up some higher quality earphones, the ones that are included are good, the ones I added were better).  The unit was extremely easy to use, and stored practically everything of interest I had, from Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears to Green Day and Velvet Revolver.  And still has room for more.  FM reception sucks, but be serious, if FM radio was any good after Clear Channel ruined the industry, why buy a MP3 player in the first place?  The only down side is item 5) in my criteria, since its not an I-pod like everyone else, there are very few accessories.  Other than that, I'm happy with my choice, and would make the same one again.

<Title>Video clips?  Not really.
<Date>Thu Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will not disagree about the music capabilities others have reported. However, the video clip implementation is terrible.   They list a variety of supported clip formats. THEY ARE NOT NATIVE to this device. Everything must be converted. This player can only understand an apparently proprietary setting for Quicktime files. Only .mov format....and only with unknown settings. Do not attempt to copy a .mov file directly. It will not work.   You must convert ALL video and photos using the Sansa Converter, written by the terrible software company ArcSoft.   1. You are supposed to be able to import VOBs. WRONG. It will import about 30 seconds of a VOB, say everything is OK, and when you go to play it back everything outside of the short 30 seconds is gone. There is no way around this bug.   2. You have absolutely no control over compression settings. If you use the converter with an .mp4 file that is lower in bit rate than it wants, it upconverts to a higher bit rate. The device can handle one, and only one, format and depends on all other formats to be converted using this flawed utility.   3. If you import a somewhat lengthy video, the program divides the video into 114 megabyte segments...it stops for about 10 seconds between these. There is no way to avoid this. If you try to join the files, they will not play.   4. The compression is about 65%...therefore expect 1 gig to take 325+ or so megs of space.   5. The Sansa/ArchSoft converter software gives an 'unknown failure' abort when converting any .mpgs produced by Nero or Movie Factory.    Pros:   This is really a nifty player.  I like the wheel implementation.  The battery life is amazing.  I have run full color videos with maximum sound and had battery left after 8-10 hours...I did not have patience to test further.  However, tech support is useless, they have no concern about flaws or providing for the issue of battery charging support, replacement batteries and cables in the future. You cannot get a cable or battery...anywhere, including from SanDisk. If you lose the cable you are out of luck and must discard the unit.   I suggest this is a flawed implementation of a good idea.    Update  The firmware is very unstable.  Do NOT try and read data from the unit, or it will go into a nearly infinate loop "UPDATING DIRECTORY".  You will need to reset several times, and if your file is large, wait up to an HOUR for the function to either work or fail.  Very frustrating.  ONLY use this unit with the supplied software and ONLY with Windows Media Player for management.  Anything else is a recipe for potential disaster.  I talked to SanDisk USA support, and they confirmed were aware of some of my observations.  Firmware updates are to fix these things.....someday.

<Title>Not worth it
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the SanDisk SDMX4-6144 Sansa e270 6 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot a few weeks ago and I am very disappointed.  The features seemed to be a better value that the Apple Ipod Nano but the thumb wheel for selection feels cheap and requires quite a bit of pressure to operate.  If you have a lot of songs on the unit, you will wish there was an easire way.  Also, after 2 1/2 weeks of use, the unit froze up on me during a synchronization and I have had to return it.  I am getting a refund and buying a Nano instead.

<Title>iPod lovers beware...
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>IPOD lovers beware.  There's a new player in town. The Sandisk Sansa E200 series.  Now for the review:  The iPod nano.  You can listen to music and look at photos. 4gb.  $250.  I don't get it.  The Sansa Sandisk.  You can look at photos, watch movies, listen to music, listen to FM, record FM, record VOICE, expand the memory via microSD cards, etc. for less than $250 for a 6gb player.  I have had my 4gb Sansa Sandisk, and directly compared it to an iPod nano 4gb.  Here's my thoughts. 1. Screen is better on the Sansa E200 series, brightness is unmatched 2. Back of Sansa is extremely difficult to scratch, Nano is very easy to scratch. 3. Sounds quality: Equal footing, i couldn't tell the difference between the two. 4.Navigation: I almost prefer the iPod nano on this one.  The Jog dial on the Sansa is a bit too tactile for my taste.  However, I am now use to it and doesn't harm my enjoyment of the Sansa. 5. Sansa e200 series you can import photos...such a small screen its not very worthwhile to put a high-detailed photo on there, but some photos look good. Ipod the same. 6. Sansa you can watch movies. I imported a Family Guy episode, and imported Lawrence of Arabia onto the Sansa.  Family guy episode went great, and fast.  It was only around 15-20 minutes long, and the sansa had to break up the file.  However, the only pause I saw once it transitioned from the first file to the second was a slight "jump" in the film and a small distortion in the sound.  Not bad at all!  Lawrence was the same, but the 4th file didn't copy over at all. Not sure where it went. I tried again, and it copied just fine.  The movie plays great.  Software is okay, but fine overall. 7. Accessories.  This is where any MP3 player looses out.  Apple is everywhere with iPod.  Car stereos, speaker docks, etc.  Time will tell how well Sansa competes in this area. 8. Battery life.  My sansa played music for a total of 18:42.  The Nano (with the same playlist) played only for 14:55.  Thats almost 4 hours extra.  Nice job Sansa!  And the battery is user-replaceable! 9. Software.  I used Rhapsody, Media Monkey, and iTunes to sort and transfer music to the MP3 players.  Itunes only worked with the IPOD, and Rhapsody and Media Monkey were fine with the Sansa. I much prefer Rhapsody than Itunes.  The feel of it, the ease of transfering, the playlist/last listened to features are superb, though itunes is good as well (it just won't work with the Sansa) 10. Stability:  Nano wins here.  The Sansa is on its 2nd firmware release, and a 3rd one promising a LOT of improvements is just around the corner (as of 7/14/06).  The Sansa has locked up once while transfering music, and locked up for 10 seconds while I was trying to back out of a movie.  The Nano never once locked up.  Good job Apple, but Sandisk is giving their Sansa a lot of support.  Overall I love my Sansa.  For the price i paid for the 4gb ($150 on deal, coupon) at almost $100 LESS than the Nano, the Sansa wins by a good margin of features for the price.  I just hope Sansa keeps up with developing new firmware to help out the stability of the player as well as add new features.  This and more accesories.  I talked to Sandisk and they said a compatible speaker dock as well as a car charger/FM broadcaster were going to be released this fall for the e200 series.  Sandisk, i give your Sansa a 5-star rating.  Ipod Nano, compared to the Sansa I knock you down to a 4-star rating.

<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What I like about the sansa e270 is the fact that I can play videos, mp3s and listen to the radio. when I'm walking on the streets I like to listen to the radio, when I'm on the subway train I play mp3s or watch a movie, that's pretty much what I need, the picture thing, I don't care about it. A way to make this mp3 player the best is improving the radio reception and the sound like any sony product. It sounds good, but it will be excellent if it has bass boost.

<Title>I'm so glad I waited!
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been researching and looking at mp3 players for almost two years.  I finally decided I preferred a flash-drive versus a hard drive, and I really wanted a battery that was user-replaceable. I didn't want an iPod, mainly because I felt like part of a herd - - I knew other options were just around the corner.  I've been looking at the Sansa products for quite some time now, and was nearly going to settle for a 1gb w/expandable SD memory card capability.  Then I found the Sansa e270, with 6 gbs of memory and expandable with a microSD!  For just over two hundred bucks, I got more than enough mp3/wma storage, PLUS a beautiful color screen to watch movies/video/pictures, a voice recorder to remind myself to pick up milk on the way home, and an FM radio (with capability to record off the radio - - do people still do that?)!  It has been so easy to convert my cds to wmas and synch them using Windows Media Player.  It even puts the album cover in for me.  It is so cute!  It is black, and sleek, and the buttons are very easy to use, even with my big hands and long fingernails, I don't have any trouble getting it do to what I want it to do.  I am assuming Sansa will be adding more accessories in the near future.  I would love a car adaptor and more selection in covers (only grey and white are available now).  The propietary cable is not a big concern to me, but I hear Sansa now has them available.  The sound is great, too!  All in all, I am quite pleased and very happy with my selection.

<Title>Very disappointed in this product
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've waited 6 months for this production only to find it very dispointing.  I've had an IPOD, Zen, and I've always wanted to search for a better player.  I thought this was it.  The ideas are great.  But the way the product was implented was terrible.  Here's some of the pros/cons:  Pros: Nice color screen, the size is small and feels good in my palm, the recording feature, the photo and video feature, the micro SD feature.  Cons: #1 disapointment of all is the navigation and control of this terrible, terrible device.  the scroll wheel is raised up too high and it is too slow in scrolling up and down.  It is raised up so high that the 4 buttoms surrounding it can't even be pressed.  You gotta use your long nail to press those little buttoms.  You have to rely on those little buttoms that are so hard to press to navigate through songs and FF/FR through your songs.  Besides the Pros I've listed, everything about this thing really kills me and pissed me off.  Now I have to sell it back on ebay since I can't return it for a full refund because I've opened the package.

<Date>Sat Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let me begin by saying "I am NOT a tech head".  I struggle to get by with most computer related technologies.  I have had no problems learning and using this mp3 player.  I like the fact that I can use the Microsoft software and all I did was plug the player in and the music was down loaded.  I added all of my CD's and was able to carry over 1200 songs with me on my last road trip.  I also use this with my workouts.  I only use the player for music.  I was considering the Apple Nano initially.  The software and Itune monopoly and high cost forced me to consider this product, I am very glad I did.  Alot of people have mentioned that they don't like the "cheap" feel of the wheel; I agree with that.  I also agree that the four buttons around the wheel are marginally hard to get use to.  If you have been considering a flash mp3 player, this one should be at the top of your list.

<Content>This MP3 player is good and easy to use, and easy to download music from your CDs from Windows Media Player. However one big drawback, the Sansa does not have a recharge plug.  The USB plug must be pluged into the USB port of ones computer, which is OK if one has their computer on, however on the road without a computer can pose a problem if one needs to recharge their Sansa e270.  This was an over sight or SanDisk had their head where the sun does not shine when they designed this system.  Hopefuly SanDisk will see the light and continue to give iPod a run for the money.

<Title>Great possibilities, perhaps a QA issue
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned an iRiver cd slimline, philips mini-cd mp3, and an iPod 40GB. I was hoping for something I could take jogging (flash memory vs harddisk or cdr). Out of the box I must say I was impressed with the little 6GB Sansa e270, but over the next two weeks flaws would appear.  One of the things that made me return the player was the order of the tracks; 1) actual track name 2) album (taken from id tags) 3) artist (also taken from id tags). This was a major source of headache for me as alot of my songs had incomplete idtags. I suppose if I had a smaller player (1 or 2gb) going back fixing the tags would be viable, but 6GB (or 8GB if you get the additional 2GB SDcard) seems daunting. I like to just dump my mp3s in to root or some folder I created so I can sort thru them that way, but folders is not an option for sorting. Now there is a playlist you can create ON the player, which is very cumbersome. Maybe if you could create or import them from your PC, but from the player is too time consuming. Compounded by the fact that once the playlist is made, scrolling thru the list is very laggy. This must be a design flaw, as the lag isnt apparent when going thru sorting by track name, album, or artist.  And as others have posted, the player seems to randomly freeze and require a power off restart. As well as the terrible buttons for the up down left right being so recessed by the wheel that it is nigh impossible to press. The wheel does not scroll fast enough thru the list either. An option I find great in iRiver is a 10 song skip, instead of having to scroll thru 1 at a time, which is great for cds (650megs). Something like 10 or 50 would be nice when scrolling thru 6 gigs, not one at a time! You pretty much are forced to use the sorting by Album or Artist option (see above for my pains with the ID tags).  I dont mind the Sandisk USB cable to charge/move mp3s as I have a laptop with me often. But I can definitely sympathize people wanting an wall AC charger for trips w/o laptop. Some people might only have desktops, so charging away from home is an impossibility.  Long and short of it, paid almost 300$ for the Sansa, I shouldnt have to put with these headaches. Currently I am trying a Creatize Zen for my flashdisk needs (jogging).. so far none of the above problems, but its also alot smaller (1gb), and I have had to return it once for failing (after a few days), hopefully this is just a bad unit and not indicative of the line.. (might have to go ipod nano)..

<Title>Good but could be better
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have already owned several large capacity MP3 players. The ones with hard drives always have hard drive failures eventually. I like the large capacity flash memory on the Sansa, no moving parts! I like the way it works. I like the user control, they are comforatble and easy to use. I also like the sound quality. I don't like the software at all, it sucks, expect to purchse a 3rd party alternaive. I also wish there were more assecories. And lastly, I hate proprietary power adapters as this has. I lost mine and SanDisk hasn't even been able to sell me a replacement.

<Date>Tue Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I absolutely love this product.  It has great sound quality; however, I did purchase a new set of headphones that I could use in the gym.  The functions are very intuitive and it's quite simple to sync with Media Player.  It doesn't get much better than this.  The only drawback to this product would be the lack of accessories as compared to the iPODs.

<Title>Excellent competitive approach by SanDisk!!!
<Date>Fri Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the SanDisk e270 7/2006 and am happy with most everything.  It is completely flash/EEPROM (NO HARD DRIVE!), and expandable with micro SD cards.  It is easy to use, especially with WMP-10.  Microsoft has a few things with WMP I don't like however.  It's size and strength are very good 8/10.  There are some freezing issues if you don't know how to configure the USB MTP or MSC mode (don't place music on it in both modes).  It also has a lack of pulldown resistors on it's final stage amp output, leading to a 1.25V DC offset that builds up on an internal capacitance when driving high impedance loads such as an amplifier in your home or car  (headphones load it properly).  This makes a loud pop when switching tracks, but eventually discharges after several changes.  I've been told by customer support (which is excellent right now) that it can be fixed in firmware, which will come out next month (pull-downs are now in processors these days, sweet!).  Other than these minor, but fixable things, it's an AWSOME device!  Supports drag and drop without WMA/MP3 conversion!!  NICELY DONE SANDISK!

<Date>Wed Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player to replace my iRiver MP3 "brick". The sound quality is average, lower than my older player. This morning, after 1.5 months of LIGHT use (40 minutes a day 5 days a week) the player died without any reason. The wheel lights up but there is nothing on the screen. I cannot even turn it off. The power button does nothing.  Stay away !

<Title>I prefer over nano
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Sansa mp3 player can play mp3s,vid files, record, play radio. The 2gb ipod nano is about the same price or more than this mp3 player. Only problem is that the lcd blanks out once in a while, this might be due to lack of batteries or something. Once u restart the mp3 player it gets back to normal. So if u wanna get a MP3 player and do not wanna conform with your fellow ipod friends, get the sansa mp3 player.

<Title>Awesome mp3 Player!!!
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is very user friendly and has great sound.  I have throughly enjoyed using it and think I made the right decision.  It does have a few small quirks, like when it is in shuffle play it always starts with the first song in my list and if you have the micro SD card in it has to "Refresh Database" everytime you start but it doesn't take long.  The radio gets great reception, especially compared to the other mp3 player I had.  I highly recommend this mp3 player!!!!!

<Title>don't trust rebate or after purchase support
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player lives up to everything it should be but after purchase support by Sandisk needs to improve.  The rebate offered on line is a nice little extra but it really pissed me off that I just received a post card saying that my purchase was invalid. I checked all the requirements prior to purchasing and again before I sent in the form only to have it dismissed. I have ceased using other vendors that tempt you with troublesome rebates and I think it is time to do the same with Sandisk products. This is just plain false advertising!  Other complaints with the player are that Sandisk does not offer a USB cable for sale separate from the player. I asked Sandisk nicely about this and after numerous exchanges they agreed that they would send me cable as a once only replacement cable; after more then a month I am still waiting.  The worst part of the after purchase issues had to do with dealing with customer support. Mind you, the customer support personnel were very nice but the process of trying to get resolution was grueling.  They needed me to register my e270 but they wanted a serial number that is not easily found. I went through 4 exchanges of email asking for its location and a possible picture so that I could locate it. It turns out that you must disassemble the e270 to get to the serial number. When I asked why they didn't have any instructions as to how to do this, support responded that they don't want to have people know how to take the device apart. HUH! THEN WHY THE HECK DO THEY PUT THE SN IN A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT APART AND THEN REQUIRE THAT YOU DO SO!  I like the product but I am definitely not impressed with after purchase support.

<Title>A Great All-Around Player
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this item last week with 6Gb. It's a great device. It has good display and great features.   The *MUSIC* that you want can easily be dragged onto the Sansa. The device automatically gives the playlists of artist, album, etc.  The converter that comes with the item is really amazing. It was a big hastle to put videos on my PSP but the converter makes it so easy to put it on the Sansa 270. You can put pretty much any type of *VIDEO* onto the converter and it will do all the work for you. Im not a big *PHOTO* person but the converter in suposed to be able to do that as well. The *RADIO* can almost always pick up channels very clearly and the recording of the radio is good quality as well. The VOICE RECORDER is very good quality. It is much better than any recorder that comes on a cell phone.  The only few bad things about the Sansa e270 is that it does not come with a wall charger or car charger(i dont think that they even sell them) You can only charge the device by using the USB cord that it comes with to charge it in your computer. Also the Sansa does not offer a lot of storage space or accessories(but you can buy extra memory to put in your expansion slot)  I encourage you to buy this great item

<Title>overall good product for the price
<Date>Tue Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>when i first recieved the Sansa e270 it was all i hoped it would be: small(almost too small), good sound quality, and a very sleek design.  However, some things that i do not like about the e270 are the "cheap" scroll wheel, the fact that it refreshes the database everytime i plug it into the computer, and the media converter that comes in the package.     Loading music into the e270 was very simple once i mastered the use of windows media player 11.  The device was automatically loaded with all my songs once i connected it to my computer because the windows media player detects all songs and automatically synced with my player.    However, loading video was a whole different animal.  The media converter that came with the player was mediocre at best.  all the videos i had saved on my computer were all wrong types of video formats so the converter wouldnt accept them.  *IMPORTANT* to load video onto my device i downloaded the Videora video converter for the iPod.  This FREE program accepted all my video types anid converted them into a format that the sansa media converter could recognize.    This player is great for the price and i would highly recommend it to anyone with a [...] dollar budget.  Remeber to read the prodect detail carefully because this player may be smaller than you expected.  Also remember to download a program like videora to convert your video file to make them compible with the sansa media converter.

<Title>Absolutely frustrating
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The unit functioned for a week and then died. A day later after holding up the unit to a co-worker and telling them what a piece of crap it was and then tossing it back onto my desk, I noticed that the screen flickered to life for a second. To get it working, I had to rap it on my desk several times. Obviously, the unit is not working as intended or maybe this is the expected quality of an IPOD clone.  The IPOD killer turned out to be a Chihuahua. One female co-worker had an IPOD that went dead after 2 months and Apple took it back no questions asked. Right now I am going back and forth with Sansa support and I already see where it's going from their last e-mail "Please also be informed that any damaged inflict to the device voids the warranty." This means that the scratches from trying to pry the back lid open to get their serial are going to be the excuse they need to walk away from this.  Before asking yourself if you should take a chance buying this MP3 player, consider my experience. A NYC subway full of people with white IPOD headphones listening to music and there I am with the Sansa trying to figure out why my MP3 player isn't working.  ----------------  FOLLOWUP - TOTAL BLOWOFF BY TECH SUPPORT  After sending the exact quote materials from above, they replied with the following:  If the problems that you experience with your device occurs with regularity we will be replacing the device under warranty policies.  Should you have any other concerns and queries please let us know, it is indeed our pleasure to assist you.  Note the term "regularity"!!! One of the girls called Apple and they replaced it in 4 days! I call and they literally close the case in my face! Simply amazing support on this product.

<Title>Impressed
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have used my little Motorola MP3 player for a few years until I found something I would really be happy with.  The e270 is it.  I am extremely impressed.  I love the fact that I can drag and drop files onto it without using more software to clog up my computer.  The sound quality is fantastic.  I flashed it to the newest firmware and it really does everything I want it to do.  The little screen is great, easy to read and bright enough on a sunny day.  I figured out how to do my own album art and upload pictures but in the end, it's all about how easy it is to use and how good it sounds.  In those categories it excels.  There are two small issues, one is that every now and then (maybe every 100 songs) a song only plays on one channel, this can be fixed by restarting the song.  I'm sure this is a firmware issue and hopefully it will be addressed at some point.  The other thing is that the buttons around the dial are a little on the small side and can be hard to push. I bought the Sansa E200 Travel Case Kit which is very nice, and a Trekstor USB charger which works beautifully. All in all I am very pleased and future firmware revisions can only make this player even better.

<Title>Pretty Good -- Hopefully Getting Better
<Date>Tue Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using the 270 (6 GB version) for about 3 weeks now, and largely agree with the positive comments on this site. Sandisk just released a v. 1.01.11 update for the e200 series, so be sure that you go to the Sandisk website and download the updater (all updates after this version will be installed automatically when you sync).  I thought about getting one of the harddisk based players which offer up to 60 GB of space, but they seem to have high rates of problems and disk crashes -- not suprising given the workout these tiny devices are subject to. So I 'settled' for the 6 GB version. That is a huge amount of music, certainly more than I can listen to at a single sitting. I have the equivalent about 68 of my library disks on right now, say, about 40 hours of music PLUS another 20-30 hours of old time radio shows. So a big flash memory drive is the way to go, and 8 gigs would be more than enough for almost anyone. Remember that the e200 series all accept microSD memory chips. Currently the 1GB microSD is going for about $US 55 in local retailers, less online. I expect that a 2 GB chip will be releases shortly at around $US 100. IMHO, only college students that are skipping all of their classes would have the time to fully use more than 8 GB of storage.  The removable battery is a Very Good Thing. All you need is a SMALL phillips electronics type screwdriver to remove the four tiny screws in the back and the battery removes as easily as a cell phone battery. I'm puzzled by the reviewer who complained that he left scratches when he "pried" it open -- no prying is necessary -- the case back splits easily from the front. Be sure to put the screws in a safe place (I use a little plastic bag), because they can easily get lost.  Which leads me to the next point:  The firmware is improving, but is not all the way there. One of the annoying problems that occasionally reported (and I experienced) is a hard crash and lockup -- this happened to me -- and the solution is fairly easy, just pull the battery and replace it after 10 seconds (not something you can do on an iPod). I am guessing it's some kind of operating system programming issue that can be easily fixed in a future update. If and when that happens, I'd give the e200 series an upgrade to 5 stars.  Note that the Sansa relies on the internal .mp3 file tags for artist/album/track information. This means that if you have music that was converted to .mp3 with bad tags, they'll have to be fixed for things to be identified and ordered correctly. I had that problem as I used early versions of RealPlayer, which apparently didn't write tags into the .mp3 files correctly until recently. It took about an hour to rewrite the bad tags with a tagging program that used the internet music info database to retag, after which things worked fine. As noted in other posts, the Sansa e200's conversion codecs for video yield a fairly a large set of quicktime files - a full length video can take up from 1.25 - 1.5 Gigs of space. Given that the screen resolution is very small, this needs improvement. However, it actually DOES do video and movies, and they are actually watchable with decent sound. It would also be nice if SanDisk would support some other common formats besides .mp3 and .wma.  Given that the e200 series has been out less than a year, it seems likely that all of these issues will be addressed shortly.   The best part is that it's not an iPod, and I'm not yoked to Apple's iTunes service if I want to buy content from a competitor. With the e200 series' ability to use microSD chips, I'm guessing that Sandisk hopes to sell movies and other content on micro SD chips at retail in the future. But it also opens up the possibility of easy transfer of home video as many camcorders can store SD format as well and with an SD reader and a computer it is easy to transfer all kinds of content.

<Title>Greatest MP3 Player on the market, it has everything
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted the ability to take audio books and some music with me both for the airplane ride and when I'm at my location and this device fills the requirement perfectly.  I've had my 4 GB unit about 3 months now and I absolutely love it.  I looked at the Nano and others and decided on this unit due to the expansion slot, the FM tuner and the user replaceable battery.  One nit, I wish there was some way to quickly scan forward or backward in a selection.  As it is now, you can easily move to the next chapter/song or move back to the beginning, but I use it for audio books a lot and the ability to scan easily would be a real bonus.  Now you have to menu back, dial down to the scan option, select that option and then scan through the song.  I know this is a nit, but if you want my only reservation about the Sansa, this is it.  Maybe Sandisk will offer this as a firmware upgrade.  Love it.  Buy this unit.  Amazon had the best deal.  I've since ordered two more units for my daughters who wanted Nanos until they saw my Sansa.

<Content>I bought this two days ago, it arrived in my mail yesterday.  I tried to turn it on, and it will not turn on, even my hold key was turn to off.  No where in manual it says, what to do in this case.  I tried their reset method for this unit, after that this mp3 player started, the method is press the menu key for 15min, which was under some other FAQ, and thought lets reset and see what happens.  I was ready to return this unit back to Amazon.  Now that it is functioning, I am impressed with this unit.  The image is crystal clear and sharp, no hard drive to go bad on you, and expand the music library with expansion card, the question is how much music are you going to store before you get bored with the old music?    Any way great product, great price, nobody could beat Amazon's deal.

<Content>Oh if only I could rate this item with negative stars!  What a piece of trash! The design of the player is nice and I love how I can drag and drop files through explorer, but just as I am starting to enjoy my player, it breaks.   The first one didn't last a week. It just stopped turning on by day six. The second one didn't last a week either and it also stopped turning on. Sandisk obviously doesn't care about quality control, since both players malfunctioned in under seven days. And yes, the batteries were charged and I did not in any way damage the player to cause the problems.   I'm returning my piece of trash and requesting a refund that I will probably spend on an i pod. I hate i pods, but I hate being jerked around even more.  Here's a word of advice to the potential customer. Save the packaging. I guarntee by day six your player will break too.

I then stupidly put in an over suffed backpack and ended up cracking the screen and something else as well so it stopped working. A month later I bought a 512 blue one and I dropped it a million times and dropped it in water twice and it still worked! I love these things but I fell asleep listening to it and the headphone jack bent inside and now sound only comes out one ear. So now I've spent weeks shopping for a new one and I kept coming back to this one. $170 for a 6gb video player!?!?!?!?!? UNREAL! so I bought it and got a silicon case for my Bday, only the case is a lent magnet.   The buttons are a bit funky and the screen a bit small but I love this thing so much! I could get a 4 gb Ipod Nano or w/e and miss out on this but Everyone who I know whos HAD an I pod broke theirs in their pocket.    Sandisk rules Ipods Drool. Amen

<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm not really an audiophile, but I do enjoy great sound fidelity.   This player offers many great features and the user interface is decent (not as intuitive as the other better players out on the market). I can't really complain about those two things.  It's got so many features that I thought $180 for the player was a steal.  My only complaint (and a big one at that) is the sound quality this player transmits. I use Shure E4C earphones, and they definitely expose a bad source. The sound on this player compared to the iAudio X5L that I sold doesn't even compare (i've tried the iriver clix too, and that thing also sounds way better). The sound is very flat and muffled to my ears, it lacks any aggressiveness or warmth that i've been accustomed to. Bass response is also very muffled.

<Content>I did my research before buying this player, and from the reviews i saw (which were many) this player seemed like the best one on the market. And it is. I don't want to waste your time, so I'll just sum up everything about this player:  Pros: Beautiful Presentation (inside and out), big screen Good Controls - very simple and easy to use, although the menu/power button may be a little annoying for the left handed Great Sound Music Options - shuffle, repeat, custom/preset EQ, album art, etc. Video/Photo/Fm Tuner/Voice Recording Removable Battery Extremely Easy to use Plays Music while charging (part of firmware) Compatible on all computers due to its two usb modes - use WMP or just drag and drop Firmware updates - currently on 1.02.07A  Cons: No asian support as of yet - it can easily be fixed with firmware; in fact, a few languages have already been added via firmware Hides time on now playing screen - also fixable by firmware Can only be charged via usb  That pretty much sums up this great player

<Title>The best mp3 player for the money
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll list the main reasons this is the best mp3 player out there  1. more memory/dollar. 6gb for 150 bucks, same price as 2gb nano.  a bargain compared to other players. 2. TONS of features.  videos look great, though of course not as good as ipod video's.  radio works well.  microphone recording is high quality, so you can record lectures, your own singing, whatever.  pictures look great. 3. use as a usb storage device.  drag and drop files and folders onto the sansa using windows explorer.  very simple and easy.  you can transfer the audio files from the sansa onto a different computer and share music with a friend!  you can also back up files onto the sansa.  most other players out there DON'T HAVE THIS VALUABLE FEATURE because the files get converted upon transfer.  yeah the buttons are kinda small but theyre not annoying to use.  there's no gapless playback but almost no one will miss it.  there are NO real flaws i can think of that'll hurt your listening experience.  this is the best mp3 player.  i just wish they had some advertising so more people would know.

<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I rarely write reviews, but had to let you know that this little mp3 player is the first one I've ever used that puts an ipod to shame. I've had three ipods and always made sure to get rid of them before their warranty was up.  Ipod owners will know what I'm talking about. I was waiting for flash players to get large enough and affordable enough. The sansa is amazing.  I updated the firmware, but it functioned perfectly fine before that.  Anyways, the audio is amazing, the videos are killer and the FM radio gets amazing reception. I've always thought nanos were too small and flimsy.  The sansa is pretty much a cross between the mini and nano sizewise and is built rather well. It's so much more affordable now and had a million more features than the nano. Battery Life is also amazing, but I'm coming from an ipod video so I'm used to a weak battery. I highly recommend this product.

<Title>Sansa Player Promising, but Desperately Needs Enhancements
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love to listen to books on tape.  I often listen to 2 or 3 books at at time.  One of the features sorely missing from the Sansa player is a bookmarking capability.  There is no way to pause in the middle of an audio file currently.    A second shortcoming is memory corruption.  There are times when songs/files skip around.   Third, customer support has been poor.  I have written Sansa about these shortcomings and have gotten no response.

<Title>What Nano?
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I keep coming back to Sandisk for MP3 players primarily because of reliability, owner replaceable battery and expandable memory.  This is my 3rd Sandisk Sansa purchase (e100, e250 & e260) and I have been happy with all of them.  I have never owned an Ipod and never will so I can't give a first hand opinion on how the e250 compares to it.  I have briefly listened to my friend's Ipod Nano and as far as sound goes, I think with the Sansa's pre-programmed and customizable equalizer, the e250 sounds better.  Other than Apple's "click wheel", it looks like the Sansa got them in every category.  I'm all about getting the best bang for my buck and this e250 wins hands down.  Do a side by side specification comparison and see for yourself.   I noticed that one of the biggest gripes of Sansa owners is not being able to use the player while it's charging.  That is not true. I'm not sure why Sandisk did not include this feature in the user manual.  Anyway, all you need to do is plug in your player to a USB port while the player is OFF and let the USB power it up. Doing so will let the player charge without your PC recognizing it as one of your USB device making it useable while charging.  You can even set it to turn off automatically after the charging is complete.  Just press and hold the power for 2 sec. like you are turning it off and the LCD screen icon will change and say, "Charging".   Another gripe is the buttons are placed too closely to the navigation wheel making it challenge to press them at time.  I highly recommend buying a Kroo Silicone Skin for the e200 to remedy this which I can be had for $12 shipped. The thickness of the skin is perfect to pad the 4 buttons around the wheel to elevate them just above the nav wheel without interfering with the wheel movement.   Don't bother with Sansa OEM Silicone Skin as it will NOT help with the problem.    Hopefully this review helps current and future Sansa owners with these 2 issues.

<Title>Nice package, but not user-friendly enough
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this to replace my MP3 Companion, also a Sandisk product. I connected the e270, transferred over 3GB's of wma's (over 60 folders worth), and watched as the firmware lumped all my music into ONE HUGE collection called UNKNOWN. It was not possible to play the songs in one folder, nor to browse the folders by name. This was possible with my MP3 Companion. I contacted Sandisk Tech Support and they confirmed that in order to group songs by Artist or Album Name, the MP3 ID tags must be ripped with the song or album. No ID tag, no grouping. Well, most of my music DOES NOT have the ID tags attached to the file name, and I can't even get some of the original CD's to re-rip the music. Furthermore, I'm not about to spend hours re-ripping the CD's I do have.  This is going back, shame on Sandisk for removing the functionality given us in the MP3 Companion and earlier flash-based players. At least with those, you could browse and play by folder, regardless of ID tag or not.

<Content>I purchased my Sansa e270 mainly to watch a video podcast I download.  I have not been able to get it to work on my player, the instructions on the software that comes with the Sansa e270 do not go into much detail.  My player also froze up one time but I was able to reset it by pressing the start button for a long time.  Other than that, the size, look, sound, and feel of the devise is great.  I like the added features of a radio, the recorder and the photos player is great.  All I need to do now is to get that video to work!

<Title>Over Promised, Under Delivered
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The specs and price on this player look great.  It's a nice form factor although it turned out being smaller than I had expected.  Two things to watch out for ... 1) The player locked up constantly.  A quick Google search reveals that this is common and might be related to the firmware.  2) The "scroll wheel" (the blue circle) comes across as just cheap.  It doesn't have a smooth scroll to it.  I ended up returning mine because I couldn't live with the lock-ups.

<Content>Reliability of flash memory, all of the features you want, accommodation to Microsoft--in addition to remarkable standard MP3/video/photo capabilities, and a design at least as good as the iPod. A well written instruction book and a great user interface. And decent FM radio and quick recording when you need it.  And for videophiles, standard SD expansion.  Could not be better for those who need or want to hear lots of MP3 audio.  I used mine for conference call recording I need to hear, faculty lectures, and podcasts.

<Title>with a few improvements, this could possibly be an I-pod killer
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Being a music junkie, I love this product because it fulfilled what it promised. With 6 GB of space, I felt like I could put in all the music that I wanted and more. To date, I saved around 500 songs; and I still have space for a thousand more!   The video quality is top-notch. And although video files are supposed to be converted first (as well as photos), I think that's forgivable given that I can transfer songs without downloading a program. I just plug in my Sansa, drag and drop the songs I want, and thats it!  FM Radio and Voice recorder features are excellent. I have no complaints. I also love the fact that it has an expansion slot so my 6 GB can become 8 GB if I wanted to!   If at all, what I could only complain about are the following:  1.) the clickwheel and the buttons-kind of hard to press  2.) the lanyard is made of rubberized cord; doesnt really look good when hanging from my neck since it doesnt straighten out. 3.) I dont know if I just have small ears but the earphones are kinda big for me; but they're not uncomfortable.  4.) playlists or compilation albums cannot exist here. Songs are listed by Artist, Album and a full list of Songs. But, for someone who arranges songs in a certain way, you wouldnt like the fact that you cant play your compilation album the way you want it.    Given all these, I give the Sansa e270 a rating of 4 stars. A very good buy if you're not quite particular about small misgivings.

<Title>This is awesome!
<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to give me some sort of MP3 device when traveling on aircraft that I don't have to worry about changing batteries and can carry a large number of songs. This thing is awesome for that. It is small enough that I can fit it on an interior coat pocket and be rocking out to my songs with out having a bunch any discomfort at all.  To load up all I have to do is plug this in to my computer, which also recharges the battery, and drag and drop from my music directory onto the SANSA or sync it up via the Windows Media player. The only software on the CD provided is what you need to convert some basic picture files over and to covert a videos for presentation on the screen. The screen is pretty small and I wouldn't recommend converting a movie or anything else over to be played on the small screen. There is a large amount of detail lost. Though this only has a 6GB internal drive it is expandable by buying some of SanDisk's microSD cards of which there are 2GB cards out there so you could expand this to a 8GB player with out a problem. The only downsides I have with this is the provided ear buds, the simple felt carrying pouch, and there is no arm or waist bad provided to secure this for exersicings. Don't use the wrist strap they included, I did and ended up dropping it on a run, when the strap broke.  You should look at getting a better pair of ear buds and look at buying a hard plastic travel case for this when you do buy this MP3 Player

<Title>bad file can crash player completely
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When it's working it's pretty good, but if you copied a corrupted file, the player is not smart enough to simply skip the file, but goes blurry and freezes completely.  I had to call Sandisk for tech support twice, and repeated SEVERAL times the process of firmware downgrade, drive format, firmware re-upgrade for a total of 3 hours to figure out the problem.  For computer newbies, this is not worth the hassle.  I'm only keeping the player because I could figure out the problem, and too lazy to return it for a refund.  Also, $150 is a good price for this e270 6GB model compared to other Flash-memory MP3 players. If you want something that functions better, have more features, and don't mind paying a little more, go for the iPod Nano or the Creative Zen V. If you're wallet-conscious and can live without advanced playlist creation like the smart-list feature in iTunes or Creative's Media Source software, then this is an OK player.  You get what you pay for.

<Content>it's a great player in a small container. Watching vcd is fun, about 10 disks fit on 6GB - I wish there was a model with more memory when I purchased the device. The rip software is a bit tricky, sometimes aborting without good reason, but it could be because of my older notebook (AMD 2500+). Also, so far I was not able to use another rip software like media converter et al. I would like to see more features, like compression and quality levels to choose.

<Title>Almost Perfect (E270, 6 Gig)
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player replaces my first MP3 player, and it's a step up in design and build quality.  The color graphics and picture/video support are cool but I mainly use it to listen to music I rip off CDs in my collection.  The player's sound quality is good.  I typically encode MP3s at 192 kbps, and  unless I'm in the gym, I listen to music with Shure E3C headphones.  I can hear noise from the unit occasionally--mostly at the beginning and end of a track.  You can also hear noise sometimes if you're navigating around menus while music is playing.  I haven't had any problems loading music onto the player, and I've easily updated the firmware twice since buying it.  The USB 2.0 interface is great--music transfers very quickly.  I'm anxious for accessories to become available.  I guess companies are waiting for an installed user base before they begin selling them.  A case with a belt clip would be appreciated!

<Title>Great buy
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So far, I am satisfied.  I updated to the latest firmware right after I recieved it on front of my door, and I highly suggest you to do it too. I had it for about a month, and had never freezed. The latest firmware also has custom EQ, which sounds better than those presets, in my opinion. If you high the bass, however, it sounds very distorted. You can reduce that by lowering the second and third bars of the eq. Overall sound quality is nothing to be wow-ed about.(my other mp3 player, iriver u10, is noticably better.) Still, acceptable and better than the nano's. If you aren't picky about sound quality, you should be fine. When you convert videos on the Sandisk media converter, the sound quality is noticably reduced. A very bad thing when you are transfering music videos, but you can mod the program to solve that problem. Just search how by going to the e200 forums in the anythingbutipod website. Photos were easy, but I had to go in rotate all my photos so it will appear full screen on my Sansa. That's time consuming. I think that the mechanical wheel is better than the ipod touch. You can actually feel it scrolling, if you know what I mean. The bad thing is, after exessive use on the wheel, it becomes a little loose and chuggy. I personally have no problem pressing the buttons on the outer side of it(I have small fingers), but if you have thick fingertips, I understand that it will be a little difficult, especially when you have a case put on the player.  Occasionally, the sound drops to one channel when using custom eq. When I switch it back to normal, the sound comes back in both channels again. I think it's a firmware problem. Hopefully they will fix it soon. I once dropped my device pretty hard on the kitchen floor. Surprisingly, no damage was made externally and internally(still, be careful!)  Overall, very good player. I definitly choose it over the ipod nano.  I mean you get more battery life, a bigger(and brighter)screen, video playback, fm radio, voice recorder, USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, custom eq, expandable memory.. All in half the price. I wouldn't understand why some people would still choose to buy a nano. Because of those people, there are not a lot of accessories for the e2xx(yet).

<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I dislike ipods so i figure I try something else and hope for the best..Unfortunately I was wrong Itunes and Ipods are definitely much better.. Basically this device is a cheap piece of crap and it seems like Sandisk's approach is WYSIWYG..disappointing  PROS: - long battery life - email tech support is quick and good but website support sucks bad  CONS: - it's easy to setup but instruction manual is useless - buttons are rigid and miniature and difficult to press with a skin on - wheel is very stiff and offers very little functionality - software is buggy and terrible - freezes occasionally - navigating through menus stutters and lags - boot time is 10 seconds - video mode has no options - needs serious firmware updates - time is listed only in settings menu = useless - tons of issues with playlists getting erased or not working properly - every firmware update erases all your settings, including radio presets and the list of issues goes on and on...  anyone who has reviewed this product positively obviously didnt do a thorough job because these issues exist and its definitely irritating I am extremely disappointed and will never buy a sandisk player ever again  My suggestion is to try it out thorougly before buying..so you dont make the same mistake I did and trust other people's lopsided reviews...

<Title>Great Sound Quality - Smokin' Video
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture. You wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an I-Pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the I-Pod. The unit is not perfect, it does freeze occasionally, but the re-set function has always unlocked it. The video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also. But the conversion software was able to handle very large files. I suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions. Sound quality is great. Combine this with Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds and you'll love it. This is my forth MP3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product. The previous player, Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3, quit working the week the warranty ran out. Thumbs up on this one.

<Content>I took a long time finding a new mp3 players.  My old one is a Phillips CD/Mp3 player from years and years ago, that is actually still going strong, but it's big and I had to burn mp3's to a cd to use it. I have an extensive mp3 collection, and i didn't want to convert everything to another format (like the ipods require), and I wanted something easy to use and be able to just drag and drop files.  The sound quality is great too. The Sansa fit perfect and after a few months of use, I don't have a single complaint... although I don't really use the video feature, so I have nothing to say about that.  Altogether a great product.  I'd recommend it.

I work out at a gym and switch between the gym's TV stations (broadcast through the FM tuner in the Sansa -- something the iPod's don't have) and my recorded music. I also love not having a hard drive--no skipping. The video capability is nice, but not something I really use. Also, battery life is incredible. I work out probably 6 hours per week and I only charge the Sansa every two weeks!!! I'm still waiting for the made-for-Sansa products to come out. As soon as that happens, watch out Apple!!!

<Title>Solid product for an attractive price
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have bought 2 Ipods for my two sons and have watched them fight the file format issue since we have a PC instead of a Mac. When it came time to buy a portabile music player for myself, I set the following criteria:  1. Must be compatible with Rhapsody which I have been using for years. 2. Must not have a hard drive 3. Capable of handling the large number of WMA format music I have converted from CD. 4. Price / valuable ratio must be good.  I finally broke down and bought a Sansa E270 last week. I have been listening to it nearly non-stop.   The pros:  It fit my criteria listed above. It is easy for me to use (at 47 I don't want to fight technology) The sound is great when I substituted higher grade noise canceling headphones for the earbuds it came with. While it doesn't handle the thousands of songs I had hoped it would, it handles as many as I need and syncing with Rhapsody is easy.  The cons:  Face plastic scratches very easily Ear buds furnished with it are worthless Software bundled with it was hard to install on one of my computers Doesn't come with wall charger.  Summary:  I bought a wall and car charger and rubber case on Ebay for it for less than 10 bucks, they work well. I really like being able to move my Rhapsody music easily over to the Sansa. I didn't realize that I had to change my Rhapsody subscription from $9.95 a month to $14.95 a month, but it is worth it to have all the new fresh music available from Rhapsody each month.

The sound quality is great and navigation is simple and quick. The best part for a person with 'older' eyes like me is the VERY BRIGHT and clear screen.  Negatives are few: the supplied earbuds are some of the worst I've ever used (I bought some Panasonic in-ear buds and I am thrilled). The on-off button is difficult to operate (especially with the Griffin leather case).  Great to look at - great to hold - wonderful design!

<Title>Easy to use for first time user
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first mp3 player and there were a few glitches, but they were not the fault of the player. First of all, my windows would not recognize the player so I called tech support and found that I needed to download service pack 2. After that, my computer still had to search the internet for the driver, but was finally able to install it. Also, the disc comes with Windows Media Player 10, but the install program for that did not load automatically on my computer. I had to browse the disc and found the setup program for it that way. Once everything was installed and ready to go, I found it very easy to use. The software is user friendly, and I did not have to consult the pdf manual at all. The little quick reference guide was sufficient. I wanted a small player so it would be easy to carry in a pocket, and this one fits the bill. I was going to buy the 4 gb player, but I bought the 6 gb because of one of the other reviews from a gal who said the storage capacity was misleading. She said that the format she uses didn't allow as many songs as what was advertised. So far, I have loaded a couple of hundred songs on my 6 gb, and have plenty of room to spare, so my thanks to the gal who wrote that review. My only complaint about the player is that the earphones hurt and are too big for my ears. In order to get them to stay, I have to jam them in my 'too small' ears, or they fall out. I'll be looking for replacement ones right away, as I don't think I can take the discomfort.

<Title>Almost there, SanDisk....almost
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My e270 has been a mixture of the enjoyable and the frustrating...with a few changes this little gadget could be simply outstanding.  Instead, the Sansa e200 series falls short of what it should be, but remains a good value for those with the technical savvy and patience to put up with it.  For crying out loud, SanDisk, when are you going to support folders, or creating play lists on the fly?  The e200 will organize your music for you, IF your tags are in order.  You can create a "go list" list on the fly, but that's it.  Your music (MP3, WMA or WAV only) can be browsed by artist, song title, album, genre and a "go list".  There is another category, "my top rated", but if you rate your songs with the Sansa, it'll freeze... how much simpler life with the Sansa would be if there was support for folders or multiple play list creation.  The list of EQ settings that the player ships with are also limiting...there is a custom EQ with the latest firmware, but it isn't as robust as the EQ choices on my older e140, and some users report that it's buggy.  So far, I haven't had that problem.  The sound is good, with good earphones.  The earphones the e200 comes with have been relegated to under the pillow use by me...the ones I got with the old e140 were much better, and the Koss KSC75 clip-on's better yet.    Video?  Yep, but the MOV QuickTime format is as bloated as a beached whale.  The bundled media converter will chop your video in to 10 minute chunks with iffy sound and in widescreen format.  All this can be changed (except the MOV format) with some file editing, but why should a user have to dig through the anythingbutIpod forums to find this out?  What could have been an outstanding feature with MP4 support is merely a novelty.  Voice recording?  Yes, in WAV format.  You can record FM on the fly, (when is a Sansa player going to have AM support, anyway?) and there are photos with a slideshow function via the media converter.   Left out of the package as of the 01.02.15A firmware- An alarm function and a sleep timer.  The Sansa is fine with me from a control standpoint.  The voice record button is placed where you can hit it by accident, the scroll wheel should be progressive, and the buttons around the wheel are hard to find with my fat fingers, but for something this size it's all livable.  Battery life is as advertised, but you are a slave to your USB port unless you buy an aftermarket adapter.  Don't lose the cable, its Sansa only.  I enjoy my e270; the six gigs of storage, plus the expansion possible via micro SD are plenty for my use.  A lot of the niggling problems I've encountered have been solved with the use of a good MP3 tag editor (MediaMonkey is great for this) and some searching through Sansa forums.

<Title>better than i-pod
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>there are a few problems with this item that i think most people should be able to deal with. occassionally it freezes up, sometimes in a very inconvenient spot. it only takes a few seconds to reboot and pick up up right where you left off. the more songs you get the harder it is to navigate quicky. the radio is good enough as long as your in a big city. i have tried the trick of leaving the chord plugged into the player for better reception, but that doesn't seem to make a noticeable difference. let's be honest though you don't buy this thing for the radio. that is just an added bonus. that seems to be the main problems with mine and the freezing up of mine, i honestly think i got some bad files on there. the player is a good quality player. the battery seems to last forever, unlike the ipod that most people comlain that thier's last around five hours max. i also suggest if you buy this that you also buy the rubber cover for it. mine stays in my pocket with keys, change, and other stuff and it still looks almost brand new.

<Title>Good but not great
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's a good product. Solidly build (except for the badly designed USB connection, which I doubt would get loose in two months), large memory, very good video and audio, and very cheap. However, the buttons and menu system can be better designed, and Sandisk apparently abandoned the huge Asian market by not providing any Asian language support while the competition supports most of major Asian languages.

<Title>Excellent choice!
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He absolutely loves it!  The 6 Gigs are more than enough space for his use, but there's that expansion slot just in case he feels like doing anything extra.  I love the screen size and the portability (it's smaller than the Nano).  You are also not subjected to iTunes...a big plus.  Setup and transfers are very easy.  The sound quality on the earbuds that are included are exceptional.  If you are looking at Best Buy to buy your Sansa, be forwarned!  I did some research on this gift, and this is what I found out:  Best Buy has a "package deal" with their Sansa.  You get two free months of Rhapsody and a reduced rate thereafter if you purchase your MP3 player there.  That is the ONLY difference between the one at Best Buy and the one on Amazon.  Plus, the one on Amazon comes with a code for a 30 day trial for Rhapsody, so it doesn't make much sense to spend more at Best Buy, unless you need it NOW.    He has been playing with it for a week and has not run into problems (unless you count his impatience with the load time sometimes).  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a starter MP3.

<Content>This is a great MP3 player, it's consumer friendly, quick to download  music, pictures, messages, it might not have the space of a 30gb MP3,  but, it's enough space for me.  What I like is the ease of hooking it up  to my PC and being able to change playlists, edit songs I want to keep listening to.  The size is also key, no bigger than a credit card, portable enough to slip into a pocket, & take along.  One suggestion, get a case for the  Sansa, otherwise, it's scratches up the face of the player.

<Content>This is a real good player from SanDisk. I just love it. The size is real good, as it slips comfortably into any pocket. The user interface is smooth without any flaw. The fact that it gets charged through a USB connection to a PC, eliminates the need for looking out for batteries. The sound clarity, be it MP3 songs or FM is also good. In all, it is a real nice music player for the price.

<Title>Solid I-Pod Nano alternative
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for an MP3 player and after researching various models, I choose the SanDisk. The SanDisk offers more storage per dollar compared to the I-Pod. This was the main reason why I purchased it. It also offers features such as the FM tuner, photo options and video options. I only use the FM tuner and the MP3 player. It is not as stylish as the I-Pod, but its overall package and functionality is superior. I have had no mechanical problems to speak of so far, but it has been less than six months since I bought it, so take that one with a grain of salt. One negative is the lack of accessories available for the SanDisk Sansa. You will not be able to find all the nifty cases that the I-Pod has going for it. This is especially true when looking for an armband type of case. It is also larger than an I-Pod Nano, but it is not cumbersome. The SanDisk works well with the Rhapsody music service, but I am unfamiliar with I-Tunes, so I can not say which one is superior. Overall, its a solid MP3 player and a solid purchase when you consider the cost. I purchased it via Amazon and took advantage of a rebate (came in less than two months), so the price was quite reasonable (about $160 for the 6GB model).

<Title>Two bad units in a row!!! Third one is good finally!
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What is wrong with this?  The first one I got from Amazon was clearly an used unit. It had black dirty mark all over the player body, and it even got finger-prints on the screen (below the screen protector)!  Okay, I just did an exchange with Amazon and the new unit was received within a couple days.  What a surprise!  There was a big scratch on the player!  I requested another exchange, and what they told me is they couldn't do it anymore.  THANK YOU Amazon!  You really want me to do business with you again?  I have to give a rating of 1, but it's mostly the problem with Amazon, not the player itself.  EDIT: Finally Amazon sent me a third one and it's all good now.  Oh well, how do I change the rating?

<Title>not for you if you like having Playlists
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this unit since it was first released, and I paid a fortune for it (considering the price went down over one hundred dollars for the unit).  Needless to say, this player is sub-par at best.  I will greatly admit the sound quality if excellent, the interface is...well... not all that, and the functionality of it is great (fm, voice recorder, video and music playback).  My big issue with the unit, and it really is a big one, is that playlists getting exported to the device are nearly impossible.  When I first bought it, I had an issue getting a playlist on because I didn't know you had to use Rhapsody, but since then, I started putting playlists on... that is, until the firmware update.  THIS IS SOMETHING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING AWAY FROM!!!!  I can't get a single playlist on the unit now... AT ALL!  I've used rhapsody, and now it even enables you to use WMP 10 OR 11, and still nothing.  If it were up to me (which I'll be doing soon) if you want what COULD be seamless operation between the unit and WMP, I would suggest the Zune.  The OS on the unit is almost like a WMP lite for the most part, so I don't think ya can really go wrong, but, as I said, if you don't care about the playlist factor, this unit is good for you (considering it's one of the only units out there with an easily replaceable LiIon battery)  Edited January 7th, 2007:  I've also discovered a new issue with the player.  Lately, every time I power the unit up, it has to "refresh database" on startup.  Doesn't sound like much of an issue, but if your player is almost full, it takes nearly three minutes or so.  THAT'S VERY IRRITATING!!!!  I did originally rate this as three stars, but I'll have to take that down for the interface on this unit is that aggrivating. By tomorrow, I may rate it only one star!

<Title>Great little MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I have a hangup with iPods because I don't like iTunes.  But so many other MP3 players are just plain bad and lacking features.  Or they are big and bulky and cost just as much as an iPod.  When I came across this MP3 player, I found a nice balance.  First, it has many features including an FM tuner, FM recorder, and voice recorder.  It even plays limited formats of video and limited formats of pictures.  I don't use these features much, but they do not seem to robust.  If you are looking for a multimedia powerhouse do not buy this!  Second, it is small.  It has a nice sturdy feel and I've never felt like it would break.  Third, there are many add-ons available for this product.  Sure it doesn't match the 3rd party power of the iPod, but you can actually get accessories, which is unheard of for most cheap MP3 players.  It also works seamlessly with windows media player 10 and 11 (thats all I tried it with). 6GB plus expansion capabilities is great and I can fit most of my collection on this device.  I really wanted to give this 4.5 stars, because it does have some problems - but they are minor TO ME.  First, it freezes occasionally.  If I'm on a 3-hour trip in a vehicle, it MAY freeze once.  It really doesn't bother me because it is relatively rare and easy to fix (hold down power button).  Second, the navigation wheel is not the same quality as the rest of the unit.  I said earlier that it felt solid, but that excludes the wheel.  But it works fine, and for the price - I'll give it 5 stars!!

The wheel feels somewhat cheap and should have had a rubber feel to it not plastic.  Sound quality is great but as others noted you hear minute mechanical sounds at the beginning of your music(this only happens some of the time). Radio works wonderfully. Intuitive interface.

<Title>Best MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I spent an imense amount of time looking for an MP3 player because I was particular about the features that I wanted.  Those features were: 1. A rechargeable battery. 2. A non-proprietary mp3 download format (Get tunes from anywhere) 3. The capability to play music videos. 4. Ergonomic design. 5. Nice full color screen. 6. A large storage capacity. 7. An easy to navigate menu format.  I found all of these things with the SanDisk Sansa e270 Player.  If I am being honest, there were only 2 other companies in the competition and they were I-Pod and Sony.  The comparable I-Pods did not have half of the features of the Sansa or half of the storage capacity.  They just don't look as cool either!  As far as the Sony, well Sony has a major problem.  Their MP3 players are excellent in design and function...probably the best on the market for overall features in a compact format. The problem with Sony is that their operating system for music downloads is lousy!    It is aggressively proprietary, which means that files downloaded from other sites are impossible to switch to the Sony format.  Even files ripped from a CD to your computer are difficult to transfer to Sony's format if they were weren't originally stored that way!! The Sansa not only had all of the features that I wanted, it also had picture capability as well as voice recording and FM radio.  I-Pod and Sony have been resting on their laurels...try the new SanDisk.  It beats all of the competition out there!

Sleek, black, and it has a gorgeous color display that will show video and photos in addition to the menu. Downloading songs from Napster is occasionally hit and miss, but it's easy to drag and drop mp3 files from my hard drive. If you would rather not subscribe to a download service, then ripping from your own CDs is quick and easy. My daughter (15) loves it and carries it everywhere. Best of all, it isn't an ipod.

<Content>When I first started looking for an mp3 player, like most people I immediately thought of getting an ipod. But after searching around, I ended up purchasing the 6gb sansa. Its interface is very user friendly and I have had no problems with it. It is a bit irritating that I can only charge it by usb, but, on the up side, I've found that it holds its charge much longer than I ever anticipated. If you're looking for an mp3 player and you don't have a ridiculously huge library of music, then this is a great choice. I love my sansa.

<Content>I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She really wanted an iPod Red, but we realized that we were paying a $30 premium when only $10 goes to charity.  It really turned us off anything Apple.  And how happy we are that it did.  The Sansa is much more flexible than an iPod and other music players.  Besides the range of media - pictures, video, music, radio, etc., it is also easier to get music on and off the Sansa than any media players locked to a particular service.  (We didn't want to do any hacks or complex work arounds just so her media library was unique from mine.)  My wife loves the screen.  It is clear and sharp.  And the device itself is smaller than what was in the picture on Amazon!  She loves how she can make playlists in Windows Media Player and sync up to her player just the songs and albums she wants.  I love that I can use it under Linux without an problems.

<Title>Sansa 6 gig MP3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>LOVE this thing.  One of my twins had another player, the other one bought this.  When shopping around, we were looking for the most 'bang for the buck'.  The 'big brand' seemed too much $ for too little product, his brother's pick, although good, was more than he needed or wanted to spend.  The features that sold 'us' on the San Disk Sansa were:  Expandable Memory... you can keep additional music on memory cards, so if the player "Suddenly stops working", as have been reported with other brands of MP3's, you haven't lost all your time and money in the downloading. And really, who can listen to everything you have at once?  He just comes home, switches out the cards, and goes again.  Also, the batteries being rechargeable, and able to be charged while I'm on the computer is a bonus.  No separate charger to worry about, and the same USB cable he uses to download from the pc allows charging.  He loves how small it is-- ABSOLUTELY TINY. He can conceal it easily, which his brother couldn't do with his MP3 player- led to it being stolen. Finally, the price for the Gigs- well worth it.

<Title>Great potential, but a couple frustrating issues
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this as a gift for Christmas after the battery on my iPod stopped recharging. I hadn't picked this one out, just said I wanted an mp3 player, but I was quite happy with the choice because it had an FM radio, the voice recording thing seemed really cool, and if I had battery issues I would be able to replace it. I've been using it for about a month now. Overall, it works okay, but there are a couple issues that are just annoying enough to piss me off without making me return it.  The first trouble I ran into is the power button. When you're turning it on, you have to hold the button for something ridiculously exact like 1.7 seconds, otherwise the volume adjustor will light up and nothing else will. If that happens you have to hold it for 15 seconds to get it to turn off all the way and try again, and you might get the same result. I can't tell you how frustrating this is. The power button is also the button to get to the main menu, so if you're trying to get there and you hold it too long it'll turn off.  The second, even more troublesome issue is updating it. I wish it came with its own update software or something. It works well with Windows Media Player, which I HATE - I use WinAmp instead, and it refuses to update correctly with that. You plug it in and hit 'synch', and it's all downhill from there. It takes hours and hours to put on a couple hundred songs, IF it doesn't freeze up your program. There have been a couple of times when I've gotten it working right, left it on all night so it would have time, then gotten up in the morning to see that it stopped about fifteen minutes after I went to bed. I swear it does this stuff just to spite me.  A couple of more minor problems:  -You can't charge it on an electrical outlet, only the computer -There's no place to go for 'now playing': if you navigate away from it while the song is playing you just have to wait for it to go back on its own -Foam parts refuse to stay on included headphones (admittedly, even without the foam they're more comfortable than iPod headphones)  Overall...this is the most maddening object I own. I would definitely prefer to have an iPod, just for ease of use, even though I know it wouldn't last as long. And yet, it's not so bad that I would throw it out and get a different mp3 player - it does fine once you actually get it playing music, and it has decent battery life. However, the fact that it's good enough to keep just makes it worse. I can tell I'm going to be in for a couple years of yelling at it.

<Title>Sansa e270: High quality, lots of features, low price
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa e270 is a nice product worthy of your consideration. It is attractive and well built, although I would say due to the feel and action of the thumbwheel it may be slightly below at least the perceived quality of an iPod. It looks as good as or maybe even better than an Ipod though and appears to be durable.  The FM radio works well and is a nice option. The expansion slot is welcome, as I realize it doesn't take all that much effort to fill up 6 GB. Next time I'd probably go with the 8 GB model.   We also have the Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker System, which also works well. The combimation is plenty small enough to sit on a windowsill in the kitchen nicely out of the way. We primarily bought the system for this purpose, and it works perfectly as a kitchen radio/mp3 player.  The menus and controls are all easy and intuitive to use.  We haven't messed with the photo or video options yet. For me, the screen is small enough to make those seem more of a novelty than anything too practical. The quality of the screen is good though, so that's not an issue.  I'd recommend upgrading the earphones, if you're planning to use those very much.  Bottom line, the Sansa e270 works as advertised: about the same quality as an iPod, with more features and flexibility, and at a lower price.

<Content>I ordered the 2GB model in December and it came like 4 days later. The only problem i ran to was one of the songs said bad track and i turned to another song and the WHOLE MP3 player froze. I called sandisk and they was nice to help me. So i took off the song that caused the problem and the problem was solved. OVERALL I LUV IT!!!!! BUY IT!!!!

<Title>Nice little player
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm happy with this player though there are some pros and cons:  Pros: small, built-in FM tuner, beautiful to look at  Cons: audio quality is OK, not great.  The earphones that came with it is cheap and lousy, I replaced them with a pair of Shure and it sounds much better, but still, I feel that it doesn't have the same audio quality of an Ipod.  The EQ feature built-in is nice but doesn't work as well, distortion can be heard when the EQ level is set to anything other than flat.  Hopefully future firmware will fix it.

<Title>Very Nice Player
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the e270 6 gig and also have a 2 gig flash card.  The player sounds great.  No errors or issues.  It is very important that you READ the manual.  Most issues can be avoided by understanding how the device operates.  I only use this device for listening to music.  I sync with my PC running XP Home and load music via the Musicmatch interface.   I have not had any experience with video or images.

<Content>I am a first-time MP3 user. Because my 2 kids own iPot, I wanted to try something different. Overall,it's a solid, handsome product, convenient for workout in gym, walking outdoor, or travel. It's easy for me to load a few books and all of the songs I like. There are 2 features I wish I couldhave with this Sansa:  1. I wish it can handle the Chinese or Japanese characters like iPot. Now the song titles appear in blank squares on screen. 2. I wish it has the fast-playback feature.

<Content>I love my Sandisk Sansa. It's compact, easy to use, and it's not an iPoD. I have nothing against iPOds, except the proprietary software needed to load them. This little baby has great sound, a fair FM tuner, and a nice, bright screen. The card slot allows for increasing storage size, a feature I like since I always seem to have extra storage cards around. And the price was great, and it has come down since I purchased mine.

<Content>I got Ipods, Sony's walkmans mp3, mpio, and others mp3 players. This unit is wanderful. Good sounds, with a huge memory, you can watch videos, movies, ear mp3 and radio station, record radio and voices, etc. The bad point.. When you turn on the player.. if the memory is almost full... you can drink a coffee while wait to play something.. and the is the some if you wanna play a entire movie.. the sansa cuts in a parts, and you need wait a little to get the next part. Therefore, I rated it with 4 stars.

<Title>Best gadget I've bought in years
<Date>Wed May 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was hesitating on buying the iPod Nano because I'm the guy who usually bought something and the next week something newer and better came out. I think this time I finally got it right. The e270 is sexy. I've seen the Creative Zens get cosmetic scratches within minutes of pulling it out of the box, this tiny e270 looks great, appears durable, and I'm confident it will survive my abuse. Dragging and dropping music is a cinch, the iPod and Zen software my friends use took some getting used to...and the out of the box conversion software to put videos and graphics on this baby is just too easy. The variety of accepted formats wasn't impressive, but it took my mp3s and wmas with no problem. It converted my jpgs with no issue. There were 5 out of 40 music mpegs had an error during conversion. And a movie in .avi format was broken down into 12 .mov files. I took this with a grain of salt and assume future firmware improvements might fix this. The menu works better for me and I prefer the e270's dial over other mp3 players. Improvements I would like to see would be the ability to put the videos in subfolders without disappearing from the menu, a different style headphones, a freebie screen protector and some way to wear it other than the supplied carry pouch or lanyard. I'm still trying to pick up an FM station, can't determine if the weakness lies with the built in antenna or the AFN stations in Iraq. The flash memory was the basis for this buy, the drive players were too bulky and sensitive to my treatment. The added feature of a micro SD slot is probably excessive, but not unwelcome. I am VERY happy with this purchase. Now how about making some accessories for this thing!?

<Content>With the new firmware update this player is great.  I had the 20 Gig Zen Touch and it died on me after a year and a half.  Being in the market for a new player I wanted the highest capacity flash player I could find.  With the 1 Gig Micro SD it runs at 7 gigs and that's just about enough for me.  Being used to 20 Gigs I had to be picky.  Atleast, I can run with this one.  Video is always an option, but just not enjoyable with the small screen.

<Title>Why did Apple make the iPod?
<Date>Mon May 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The main reason Apple made the iPod is that the market in 2001 was fraught with terrible music players...most took hours to update and had very Windows like folder user interfaces.    Everyone should also remember that none of the Windows Plays For Sure players (including the Sansa 270) will not play on Mac OS X.  They all require you to move to the "open" Windows XP/WMP 10 system.  I would love to have someone tell me why this is better than iPod/iTunes.  I would consider other players if they integrate (not just mount as a hard disk) and allow me to buy (can't use any Windows Media Audio buying services) on my MacBook Pro without launching Windows XP.  For the Mac user, Apple had to create iPod/iTunes to allow us to enjoy music and they accidentally created a huge market that loves industrial design and focus on user experience.  Napster, Urge, Sony Connect, Yahoo Music - Not Mac OS X Compatible.  Buy an iPod!

This is easily the most feature packed flash memory player on the market.  Claims of low level 'noise" and tired thumbs are complete nonsense.  The Sansa e270's release will not make the evening news, but it is clearly the Nano KILLER!

<Title>great!
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'd have preferred to be able to give 4.75 stars rather than 4 or 5.  The reason for this is the placement of the RECORD button.  I have made more than a couple inadvertant recordings simply as a result of handling the unit.  Other than that, I like the fit and feel of the thing.  I don't know that the micro-SD slot contributes much to the user -I think it was meant rather to contribute to SanDisk (manufacturers of same, not coincidentally).  I like that the unit will "keep track" of your progress through a long track (I like to use my Sansa for listening to audiobooks, the files of which can be quite long and finding one's place manually can be a rank tedium).  The screen is quite nice- disproportionately large for so small a unit.  Finally: battery life for mine on the first two charges was between 20 and 22 hours.  Not bad at all.

<Title>Very happy except for one Issue/risk
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>June 15 2006 - Unlike some of the reviewers, I couldn't care less about music "services" be they iTunes, Rhapsody, etc.   Why pay 0.99 to anyone for DRM crippled tracks?  The artist doesn't benefit.  I listen to CDs I have bought and ripped.   For that purpose, this unit works beautifully with *any* OS including Mac X, WinXP, even Linux.  The e270 can act like a flash/keychain drive: just go into the Settings menu and change the USB mode.   The e270 also shows the album art (folder.jpg) while playing tracks. The e200 series has a beautiful display, better than the Nano.   I wouldn't whine about the design being imitative: the Nano has better quality buttons/wheel,  the e270's controls are comparatively flimsy-feeling and are harder for large fingers to operate.  Besides, didn't Apple copy from *Creative's* mp3 players in the first place?  The courts are reviewing that question now. THE ISSUE. My only issue is that the USB cable is proprietary, mandatory, and irreplaceable.   And, Sandisk is currently unable to provide a replacement if you lose it.   Without the special Sandisk USB cable, you can't even recharge the on-board Lithium battery,  and also there's no wall wart for AC power available either.   By contrast, my previous Sandisk e140 player (a 1GB model) uses an AAA battery --and the same USB cable most digital cameras use.   Battery- and connection-wise the e140 is a better solution,  but the drawback is a dim monocolor display. If you have good eyesight, the e140 is a great economy player; but the e270 is the ultimate luxury toy. Everyone who sees my e270 is smitten. UPDATE July 6th -  Sandisk says it is _now_ able to ship me a replacement  "e270 to USB" cable, so give them credit for that. Also, according to internet rumor, Griffin makes an e270-compatible wall-wart (AC Power) solution. Finally, no solution is available yet to the "cannot play-tracks-in-album-order" issue, a problem I failed to mention above.   This might drive you seriously insane when you play Mozart or Beethoven on the thing when the IV movement isn't played fourth.  Or, when an mp3 audio book can't be played  in chapter order! We're waiting every day for the firmware update from Sandisk that fixes this track ordering bug.

<Title>The Good, bad and ugly
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have since resolved most of the problems I had with subscription services eventually getting the Sansa to work with Napster service but not Rhapsody. However, Sansa music downloads from Napster generate multiple download errors once I have download 3 or 4 playlists. Also, the more music you have on your Sansa, the longer it takes to download successive tracks. Napster confirmed that the Sansa e270 is not compatible with their service. This is what I would recommend to minimize problems with subscription services.  1) Use Windows Media Player 10 NOT Version 11 Beta - Version 11 Beta did not work with my Sansa. 2) Format the Sansa with Windows Media Player 10 PRIOR to connecting to Napster (just deleting the songs Sandisk provides on the Sansa upon shipment does not delete all the tracks for some reason and created a problem for me so formating was the only solution that worked.  The Sansa now works for the most part with my subscription service and allows me to download 3 or 4 Napster playlists directly to my Sansa!.  The good: The Sansa e270 looks great, is amazingly small and has a good display. The 6GB storage is large enough that you no longer need a hard drive device which means you get player with great battery life and able to stand up to knocks without skipping / breaking. If you have a lot of purchased music or CDs on your computer, then this is the MP3 player for you - (see my warning below about subscription services!)  The bad: Scroll wheel feels a little cheap and button placement takes some getting used to especially if you have big fingers The Sansa e270 does not support playlist created on Rhapsody, Yahoo or Napster. You can set up playlist but this is done on the device which is extremely time consuming especially if you are a playlist guy like myself. Placement of the record button means you inadvertanly hit it initiating recording while you are handling the player.  The Ugly: The Sansa e270 support for subscription music services is extremely buggy. I would not purchase the e270 if you plan to use it with Rhapsody, Yahoo, Napster or other subscription services. After spending several hours trying to figure out why my tracks would not  download ( I eventually re-loaded firmware and reset device), I evetually managed to download tracks. However, the next day at the gym I got a message telling me to re-synch and none of the tracks would play. Now I'm trying to figure out how to renew the licesne so I can play music on my Sansa. I never had this problem with my Creative Zen MP3 player.  Conclusion - The Sansa is close to an Ipod killer but limited support for subscription players will relegate it to "also ran" status compared to Zen MP3 players, which fully support subscription services. Great design, good features, consider if you own a lot of your own music. Give the Sensa e270 a miss if you like playlists or use subscription services.

<Title>An undiscovered territory
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What is this you may ask? good question. San Disk never advertised their MP3 players so you have to go on Amazon or to a media store to find out what all the buzz is about. This item may not be as sleak as the "Nano" but it is a lot of fun. It will take about an hour to 15 mins. to figure out how to click and drag the music files but it is worth it. Spoiler: to click and drag if you have Windows: Go into "My Documents" and you will see a seperate file called "e270" when you click into that file you will see two folders: Data and Media. If you want to download the music go to "media". However you have to copy and paste the music from your "My Music" folder which can be a pain in the touchas for people who are on the go. BTW: delete the other music that is in the folder. It is just stuff that San Disk put in to promote underground artists.  Other than that, the rest is a piece of cake. The button is a lot easier than their 1 gig mp3 player joystick. The radio is not bad but it could be better.   It is one of the hottest items for this summer.

<Title>Unusable if you travel without a laptop to charge the player
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought a SanDisk Sansa e270, and deeply regret the purchase.  I need a travel charger and a spare battery, but you don't sell either, and will not tell me what other chargers, if any are compatible with the e270.  Your technical support representative's answers are absolutely useless - I have cut and pasted my questions and his responses below.  Given the non-existent customer support, I will not buy another SanDisk product again.    ===============     Your Question/Problem: I want to use the Sansa e270 when I travel, but won't be carrying a laptop. How do I charge the battery since you don't sell a travel charger? Can I use the IPod Nano/mini charger brick and plug the Sansa USB into it? If not, what can I use.  Also, I want to buy a spare battery since it is user replaceable, but you don't sell it either. Where do I buy one?  ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/20/2006 08:09)  Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. As of now there is no available wallcharger and spare battery for the Sansa e200 series. Also we do not recommend that you use the charger of the ipod player, considering that is not a product of SanDisk. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!  Sincerely, Michael Louie I. SanDisk Technical Support ________________________________________ Your Response: (06/21/2006 08:03) My trips typically last 2-4 weeks, so I really do need to charge. Since you do not sell chargers and batteries, and recommend not using non-SanDisk chargers, that makes my SanDisk unusable after the charge runs out. The only alternative is to use the IPod charger - please tell me what the correct voltage, amperage, and polarity is to charge the Sansa e270. I am willing to use a non-SanDisk product even if it means voiding the warranty. Otherwise I have wasted almost $300. And when will you start selling spare batteries, since one of the reasons I bought the Sansa was because SanDisk advertised it had a replaceable battery - although this may be true in theory, it is not true if you don't sell one! ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/21/2006 08:03)   Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. The ampherage, polarity and voltage are all proprietary information that we are unable to release at this time. You may try to do a search on a compatible charger for the Sansa e200 series player. However we do not guarantee that anything will work with it until we put a charger on the market. But we have no information when it will be out. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!

<Title>Lots of features but some problems
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was hyped to get in on the x-mas deal.  I really liked the fact that I wasn't buying an iPod.  The player has a ton of features but their implementation is not all that great.  For example, it plays video.  In reality the hassle of converting video files to the proprietary sansa mjpeg format is a real pain considering the quality is not all that great.  You must use the media converter software to accomplish this.  No direct uploading of standard video files.  It took my 10mb WMA 320x240 file and converted it into a 50MB lower resolution file.  Not an efficient codec at all.  The user interface is a little slow as well.  There is noticeable lag in some navigation screens.  Sounds quality is good although not as good as the Nano.  And one of the most troubling feature of this player is the navigation wheel. It has a real cheap feel to it.  Very cheap plastic and a constant grinding feel to it.  Sandisk could have really made this nice if they were to use the same metal they used on teh backplate.  Overall this player is good because of its features and its price.  But there are many areas for improvement.

<Title>A nice MP3 player
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using this MP3 player for a while and I found it's a very nice one.  Pros: The sound is very good and clear. I never used a ipod so I don't know the comparison with ipod. But it's as good as, maybe better than other brands, like creative, phillips or SONY ones. It's easy to use, you don't even need to read the manual.   It is simple to use the included Sandisk converter software to transfer photos and video clips from your computer to the player. The screen is not big but pretty clear.   The battery life is very good. A fully charged battery can survive at least 15 hours (don't know that exactly, but close). It automatically charges the battery everytime you connect the player to your PC to transfer files.   It has a small size so it's easy to fit in your pocket.  Cons: The surface of the player is easy to be scratched. I bought a silicon case from Ebay so it's better now. But it already has a scratch mark on the screen now.  The earbud hurt my ears very much. I have to use another one from an older Sandisk player. But it depends on the size and shape of your ears. :)  It supports a few languages but not many. So if your song's title is Japanese or Chinese, it won't show correctly.

<Content>I have never purchased an MP3 player before but wanted something for working out.  I read a lot of reviews on several different players and chose this one.  I am fairly tech savvy; however you need minimum technology skills to use the USB cable to add music to the mp3 player.  Not only am I satisfied with the player, but Amazon shipped it to me super fast...ordered on Sat. got in on Wed.    I followed the instructions and let the player charge...after that I checked on the radio features which works awesome!!  Then I read the easy to follow, simple instructions about streaming music...the instruction say you need Windows Media Player; however I went to real player and drug the tracks over that I wanted (much like burning a cd)all of the tracks worked and it only took about 4 minutes to put 40 songs on the player.    I can honestly say I haven't put pics or videos on, but this is wonderful as an MP3 player...and really simple to use!!  I do have small ears and the earphones are too large, but you can get headphones anywhere.  I did buy an exercise case; however I missed them when they delivered it.  The package does not come with an armband...so make sure you buy one separately.

<Title>Great MP3 player, few minor problems
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The e270 is the 6 GB model in the SanDisk Sansa e200 series of MP3 players.  Possible Capacities are 2, 4, 6, and 8 GBs, beyond the capacity differences the e200 series are identical.  Pros -Fairly Inexpensive -Better Sound Quality than previous SanDisk MP3 players -Up to 2 GBs of memory expansion via MicroSD card (4 GB MicroSD cards are not available and it is unknown if they will be compatible) -FM Radio -Displays Pictures and plays video -Fast sync time   Cons -Proprietary USB connection -Easy finger print magnet -Screen is ok, not great -Crappy headphones included  The screen is a nice display, it looks good for being on such a small device, but it is not as nice looking as some of the Hard Drive based MP3 players such as the iPod.  Unlike most MP3 players this one has a memory expansion slot, a very nice addition.  The headphones which are supplied are pretty crappy, but when are headphones included with the MP3 player ever good?  The music quality is very good, obviously  the encoding is extremely important, but the Sansa sounds better than my old Dell Pocket DJ.  Proprietary Ports suck, but the proprietary USB cable is included.  In order to put pictures or video on the Sansa they have to go through the media converter.  Pictures and video can only be stored on the actual Sansa, not a MicroSD card. As of right now the e200 series supports MicroSD cards up to 2 GBs, there are 4 GB MicroSD cards on the horizion, but as of right now it is unknown if they will be compatible with the e200 series. The drawbacks are very minor, if it was possible to give 4.5 stars I would.  Definetly reccommended.

<Title>Take all of the reviews in perspective !
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've used my 6g Sansa for 2 weeks and love it. I'm happy with its versatility and ease of use. Some complained about boot up time but I find that inconsequential. Some complained about noise between recorded tracks, I've not noticed that. Some complained about the size of the buttons. I have extra large hands and have absolutely NO problems. I did approach a Best Buy salesgirl prior to ordering mine and asked which MP3  players have the least returns, she said SanDisk by a wide margin and I hadn't told her I was considering one. I'm completely happy with my Sansa 6g and so far have 500 songs loaded. Battery life is MUCH greater than my daughter's Ipod. The FM radio makes it even more versital and I have mine plugged into the sound system on my Honda GoldWing and the cassette and cd players are no longer used. Buy one you won't be sorry !

<Title>BEATS THE IPOD, BUT NOT PERFECT
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa is a better MP3 player than any IPod, but it's not perfect. For example, it's hard to find accessories; many places which sell this player don't handle any accessories for it.   Other issues:   You can't use the player while it's connected to your PC. If the battery is low, you can't charge the player and use it unless you buy an A/C adapter.  The player doesn't remember the volume settings between sessions. The auto shutdown feature helps extend your battery life, but the volume always returns to the default settings which can be way too loud sometimes.  I also found the lowest volume setting is too loud when working in a quiet environment. There needs to be a more graduated lower volume setting.  Overall, you'll find the performance, sound quality and storage capacity hard to beat. However, be prepared for the downside of purchasing a player that's not "mainstream" (anything that's not an IPod is not mainstream).

<Content>I've purchased two Sansas, a 4 GB & this 6 GB model for my late teen boys. Both are operating flawlessly...the smaller version going on 6 months.  Buy the largest GB capacity you can afford if purchasing for someone who is somewhat an avid collector of tunes.  My son filled the 4 GB version amazingly fast--the only complaint that's been lodged.

<Title>Works great but seems to lack some basic features
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Sansa e270 mp3 player and am pleased by the amount of songs this little unit can hold, as well as the extra long battery life (about 6-7 hours, though I did use the miserly settings ie: low brightness, short backlight, auto shut-off).  All I really wanted was somethign that played music; however, even with my "low" standards, I have noticed this MP3 player lacks some pretty basic features:  1) Volume control.  There's only two settings (well, three, if you consider "pause/mute" a volume)- loud and LOUDEST.  It's ok using on the train or airplane, but if I'm wearing it while running, I find I have to hang the earphones around my neck rather than have them in my ears, because it's just too darn loud.  I'm very surprised at the lack of volume control as I was expecting a wheel or some sort of "dial-a-volume" feature.  2) Lack of FF/REW/Stop buttons.  Or maybe I haven't figured it out?  anyway, there seems to be one play/pause button, but you literally can't stop a song unless you switch to either the video, photo or radio option.  Maybe it's just me but I don't really like shutting down the unit while it's still playing.  As for the Fast forward/rewind, it seems you have to go through the menu to find "scan through song" option in order to do so.  When you push the > button, it advances to the next song instead.    Seems to be a few minor bugs, too.  I noticed the "Rate the Song" feature doesn't seem to work and just freezes my Sansa player.  Everytime I turn on the player and select "Play All" it always seems to start off playing the same song each time, rather than picking a song at random, as I've set it.    I did go to the SanDisk website and downloaded the "latest" (who really knows?) software or update; this seemed to speed up the startup and shutdown process noticeably but did not fix any of the aforementioned bugs.   I really was expecting an MP3 player that worked 100%, but again, i just need something that that plays music (which the Sansa e270 does very well).  However, the problems I have noted may be significant to other consumers, so Buyer Beware.

<Title>Awesome MP3 player at great price
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had other small MP3 players (Creative MuVo 256 and 512MB) over the years that I've used at the gym and in my car and I was getting tired of constantly swapping songs around and decided to take the plunge into a large capacity player.  After looking around and doing some research, I decided to purchase a Sansa e series player.  I was planning on getting a 2GB player, but when I found that I could move into a 6 GB player for only about $40 more, I was sold.  You can't buy 4 GB of memory for $40.  Out of the box, the Sansa is a very attractive player, equal in looks to an iPod in my opinion.  Being a computer person, I liked the fact that I didn't have to use any specific software to load my songs onto the player.  All I had to do was connect and let Windows load the drivers and my Sansa showed up as a portable drive.  I quickly filled the 6GB of space available and let the player charge completely.  From the first time I started using the Sansa, I was impressed.  The navigation is very simply and easy to understand and the controls are pretty easy to use.  The buttons are a little small, but they are usable.  One small annoyance is that once the Sansa goes into it's power saving mode, you need to hit the buttons twice, once to "wake it up" and once to do the function you wanted (this does not include the scroll wheel for volume as it works immediately).  It would also be nice to be able to delete songs on the fly without reconnecting to the PC.  The screen is clear and crisp and the sound is great.  I use the player when I work out, so I had to purchase a arm band case since nothing came with the player, but I was able to find a Griffin "Sansa approved" case for about $15 delivered.  I switched out the headphones for my standard over the ear clips that I already had and was on my way.  The headphones that are included work fine and I keep them in my bag as a back-up.  A standard plug-in recharging cable would have been nice since you have to connect to the computer to recharge and you can't use the player when it's connected to the PC.  I always have a laptop with me, so it's not a problem of accessibility, it's a matter of convenience.  I may invest in a docking station to take advantage of my Sansa when at home.  Overall, this is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for an MP3 player.  If you are thinking about an iPod, look at this player first.  I got 6GB player (3 times the capacity) for less than you will pay for a 2GB iPod and I'm not shackled to the iTunes software.

<Content>Ok well this thing is pretty nice. I have used it for everything except recording, and have come to find out that pictures are pointless to put on there because you cant see them.  And videos are ok, but whats the point of the video if the screen is so delicate(scratches)so the screen starts getting harder to see. Umm about the durability, well its fallen like twice and works just fine, but just it bugs me how easy it scratches. All and all though it has w/e sound quality, not the best but also not the worst so thats ok, the headphones suck dont use them please. And this thing is really small compareble to the nano so yeah I would buy it again but get like something to protect the screen. So you should but it, NOW!

<Title>Decision...Decision
<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have done lots of research for about 2 months and compared many differentproducts and listened to their sound quality at the local stores. Icompared Sansa e200 series, iPod nano, iRiver, Creative Zen, and some otherbrands. If you are into gadgets and you don't run/jog or rigorous/bouncingtype of exercise then the iPod 30g+ and Zen V M 30g+ are at the top withZune 30g+ following close behind. If you are not into making a fashionstatement then the Zen V M 30g+ is the best deal (more bang for you buck).If you're into gadgets like watching movies on tiny screen and accessoriesthat allows you to plug your player into the toaster then I would recommendthe iPod 30g+ but don't forget the Zen has better display and betterbattery life. Both of them are easy to use unless you are totally computerilliterate then I would say the iPod would be the better choice. Soundquality are about the same. If you are really into music and more likely touse your player for exercising then the best deal is the Sansa e270 ore280. I bought the e270 (6 gigs) because Amazon has it cheaper than theiPod 2 gigs. If you like to download lots of music then go with theiPods/iTunes otherwise Sansa/Rhapsody is as good. I hope this help you withyour buying decision.

<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased a Sansa E-270 MP3 Player.  I couldn't be more satisfied. The sound quality is very good.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use while the device is in a pocket.  I've got over 1,000 songs loaded and still have room for more, and I haven't used the 2gb micro SD card yet!  The device is tough, I've already dropped it once and there is no discernible damage. The software gives you several configuration options.  The size is perfect.  I purchased it on recommendation from a friend.  I've already recommended it to several friends myself.

<Title>Fantastic and inexpensive.
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 4 GB Sansa MP3 player about a year ago, but it was recently stolen.  Because I'm anti-iPod (too expensive) and I was fairly happy with my previous Sansa player I decided to get the same thing again.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the price had gone down in the past year, and the 6 GB was $80 cheaper than the 4 GB was a year ago.  One of the biggest problems I had with my previous Sansa MP3 player was that the FM radio sound was fairly poor (too soft to actually hear if there's any outside noise).  I also had difficulty with transferring play lists.  The sound issue has been addressed and transferring and recording music and play lists is extremely easy now when using the Rhapsody music management application (included).  I'm extremely happy with my Sansa e270, and for the price you can't beat it.

<Title>Adequate but not good enough
<Date>Wed May 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa e270 has the basic functionality which it promotes: plays music, plays videos, plays radio, and records. For basic use, it is sufficient. The player is also small and light enough to fit in your pockets, making it really handy to bring along to almost any place. Audio quality was also good.  But I wasn't pleased with it; firstly I wanted to watch some of my AVI videos on the player - I first had to convert it using the Sansa converter which came along with the package but it didn't work for my Xvid codecs. Then the player would also try to "arrange" my MP3s to fit its filing methodology, which just seemed to screw up my playlist. I could not find a lot of my music files after the "arrangement". I also found that I couldn't delete tracks on the player - I had to plug it into my computer and delete it using the computer interface. I also can't create different playlists of my own on the player, and for some weird reason, some playlists I created on the computer were corrupted on the player. What a mess! I have since then returned the player.   Ultimately, I would say the Sansa e200 series is a good series, worth its money. But for sticklers like me, it just doesn't cut it. I'm going to try other players.

<Content>The SanDisk plays well, with good sound and picture quality.  Our frustration is with the interface to load songs and - worse - to delete them.  The player came with quick instructions to get up and running fast.  Unfortunately, it didn't come with any detailed instructions whatsoever, so the frustration set in after a day or two as we tried to manage the files.  Summary: Good price for the quality, but a frustrating lack of documentation.

<Title>GREAT - BUT DON'T BUY FOR THE FM RADIO
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did not want to spend the money for a ipod.  This mp3 player had everything i wanted.  It had a fm radio with fm recorder.  I can replace the battery.  You can store pictures and video.  I have not tried this.  It also has a voice recorder.  The FM radio has poor reception but I read that the ear plugs are an antenna.  If you move it the reception becomes clearer.  I find this cumbersome.  I purchased mainly for storing music.  You can also add memory.    I did have trouble when I down loaded the software.  It froze everyday.  I was ready to ship it back.  I called customer service and a nice rep walked me through reformatting.  I have not had any problem since.   I am 55 years old and had some trouble using windows media player.  After using media player a few times, I had no problem downloading files.  I do get some errors in the media player but I believe it is a windows issue since i get codec errors once in awhile.  I purchased a case to protect and keep scratch free.    The only negative thing i can think of is the reception on the FM radio.  I would like to see AM on mp3 players because I listen to sports but I don't think that there are plans for this.

<Title>Sansa E270 6 GB player- I'm satisfied with it.
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've got the 6 gig version of the Sansa, the E270.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the product, but there are a few annoyances. On the plus side- the unit sounds good.  I use the WMA 128 kbps format, which isn't lossless, but sounds close enough to cd- quality that I'm satisfied.  (I work part-time as a recording engineer, so I'm moderately picky with regards to the quality of music playback.) I've currently got 280 songs, and they take up about 2 gigs of memory.  Plenty of space for a lot more music, more than I'll need for a while.   The battery life has been good.  I've run the unit for 10 hours, and still seemed to have about the battery life left.   Loading songs works well, as long as I'm not doing playlists.  When I hook the Sansa up to the computer, it shows up as a USB drive, and I just drag the songs I want into the Sansa folder. I'm not interested in watching videos on the Sansa, but I have tried loading a few videos just out of curiosity.  Worked just fine.    On the negative side, as I mentioned above, Playlists don't work for me, as I don't have my computer linked to the internet, which you need to have for playlists to operate properly.  However, since I have my songs categorized using artist, genre, and album, I have enough ways to listen the music I want. My chief complaint with the Sansa is the 'shuffle' feature.  It does not work very well.  It will play the same song twice in a row, and completely ignore others in the category I'm wishing to listen to.  It's not so big an issue as to cause me to regret getting the Sansa, just more of an annoyance.    As I said initially, I'm satisfied with the product.  I would buy it again if I lost the one I have.

<Title>Sandisk's e260 makes for a great mp3 player
<Date>Fri Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I was looking for a new mp3 player I came across this sandisk.  I had had another sandisk mp3 player previously and it was good so I tried this new one.  The player works effortlessly and I love the fact that is has an FM radio which the iPod lacks.  It also can play video clips (if they are not longer than 10 minutes).  I have been using Windows Media Player 11 to transfer my music and it works well.  The microSD card slot allows you to add up to 2 gigabytes more to the player if you have a large library.  The voice and FM recorders come in handy if you want to record a voice memo or a talk show on the radio.  Sandisk has created a great new mp3 player and I think it was a terrific buy.

<Title>Sansa MP3, beats iPod for sure. 
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player and a new iPod at the same time.  I returned the iPod, if that tells you anything.  With this MP3 player, you are not tied to iTunes.  I wish I had known which protective skin to buy for it because the one I have seems to interfere a bit with the volume roll button, but that's not biggie really.  I pretty much use the player with my Rhapsody account and to load favorite songs from CDs. I had no idea how handy I would find the voice recorder.  I can pop a message to  myself in it while I am driving or working and my life is becoming a bit more organized by using this tool. I also love having a radio feature.  In town, reception is great!  I can sit by the pool at the gym and listen to my favorite stations.  The numerous features in this player take it far ahead of the very popular, however severely limited, iPod.

<Content>I bought the Sansa e270 as a gift for my brother in May. Now in September its back part is all craked up with a little piece coming off. He hasn't dropped it. The company says that "my brother used it too much or carried it with him too long." The product page says that it can play 96 hours of music. If he already played that much, does it mean that the MP3 is already obsolete and it is disintegrating? Does it mean that a MP3 should be kept at home not carry it with you? Hello!!!I think these products are designed to be carried it with us and to stand continued use since that's why they were created for in the beginning. There is no complain about the performance since it does its job. The main issue you should put attention to if you are thinking about buying one of these is the durability. Also, the custumer attention. The company does not give you any option, but to buy another one. Amazon says that a refund can be issued only after 30 days of purchase. But the device was ok until a month ago. I had never heard of an MP3 cracking up and falling apart after just 4 months of use! What can be done in this case? Is it Amazon.com's fault for not doing a good reasearch on the companies they sell products from? Or is it the company for not making good quality products that can stand a normal period of use without breaking up and falling apart? That's why I gave it only one star. The device works, but only for a short period of time. Not even 6 months and it is already falling apart. I regret so much that I bought this in the first place. For the price I paid for it, I think that you better invest a little more and get yourselves an iPod. My sister has one, bought it in the same month and is fine. Or you can still buy yourselves the Sansa...and be ready to replace it every 4 months...You do the math...

<Title>Solid all-around player
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>PROS: for the money: nice variety of features; comfortable size and weight; interface that's easy to learn and use; many cheap aftermarket accessories available; impressive battery life; ability to replace battery is nice...hopefully replacement batteries will still be available years in the future.  CONS: (minor) the voice record button on the left side is easily pressed accidentally, disrupting music (an annoyance while running); you cannot queue up songs while a song is playing; apparently playlists are difficult to create.  After a month, I'm quite pleased. Note, I use this solely for music, so I cannot speak to the photo or video capabilities.

<Title>A good solid player, but some continuously annoying things
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, this review is after a year of using the Sansa e270.  I got this player to stay sane at work (what's with this bullpen garbage).  The good points: 1. It is a sharp player for the price 2. It has the capacity without the hard disk. 3. The size is right. 4. The sound is good. 3. The color display, especially of the album covers is nice, but certainly not required. 4. Yes, I like the option of FM radio, or taking my own recordings, but I have yet to use it.  My main and only point of getting this player was 6 GB of shuffle.  It works fairly well, and I would not trade it for the other players on the market.  That said, there are some issues.  1. You can only charge by plugging into a computer that is turned on.  The 3rd party wall-wart costs extra.  It should not. 2. The cable is custom and fragile (although, I have yet to break it). 3. You cannot listen to music while it is charging.  Unlike some other posts here, it takes 2-3 hours for my player to charge. 4. It resets your location in a playlist after charging.  The firmware has gone back and forth on this one, but the latest status is that you cannot.  This matters because one battery round is not enough to play all the music stored on it. 5. Shuffle does not kick in until after the first song plays.  IOW, it always plays song one first. 6. This is the cardinal sin: Shuffle is not shuffle.  It is random.  If you hit the back button, it will not go back to the song it was playing before, and some songs tend to get hit more often than others (not a good PRNG). 7. Minor nit: up and down are backwards on the main menu.  The sad thing is most of these things should be firmware correctable, but after waiting a year, they have not been fixed.  I still do not see a better player on the market.  It has all the show-stoppers taken care of.  If they could just fix shuffle and restoring location after charge, my major gripes would be resolved, and I could recommend it without hesitation.

<Title>Good value
<Date>Fri Nov 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for approximately a year.  I like it very much and it works great.    I have a couple minor complaints.  The light is very bright and can be annoying when it is charging.  The shuffle feature for mp3s seems to play the same songs and skip over songs.  I wish that the randomizing algorithm was better.    I do like the FM tuner and being able to view pictures on the player.  The brightness is pretty good for such a small screen.  The size and weight of the device is good too.  I slip it in my pocket when walking at lunch.  I recommend using Windows Media Player for organizing your music.  There is the ability to drag and drop songs, but I found that it was much easier to use Media Player.

<Title>Dead out of the box - at first
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Sansa was dead out of the box.  I contacted support (very helpful) and within a day they recommended that I open the unit and re-seat the battery.  Well, it turns out that the battery was installed upside down, thus not making contact to charge.  After rectifying this, the unit is performing great!

<Title>MP3 player with a good recorder
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Meanly, I purchase this e270 for replace/upgrade my old recorder. I used the voice recording function for choir practice.  I just hang it on my neck and press the button. The play back sound is loud & clear.  Now I don't have to deal with all the cassette tapes.  This MP3 player is very easy to use. I am not a "high tech" person, but I have no problem down loading music to and from my computer (XP home version). Good radio reception. Screen is big enough for basic photos. I haven't use the video function yet.   The price is reasonable compare with other bands.

<Content>This item was supposed to be a Christmas present.  I ordered it on December 17 and paid for 1-day shipping.  It was (and is!) showing "In Stock", but for some reason I won't get it until possibly February???  Come on!

<Title>Good mp3 player, but unreliable
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Only lasted 9 months of fairly careful use before dying. Mine also had issues with illuminating the back light... periodically, it would just not light the display and you had to do a reset to bring it back. Replaced with a video nano.

<Content>A great mp3 player with 2 special qualities - it has a replacable battery and it supports the free RockBox software that has lots of games, colors, themes, all sorts of extra features.  If you don't feel stuck to I-Pod, I think you'll like it.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was my first MP3 player purchased and I just turned 60.  I have had it for a month and could not be happier.  It fills my needs perfectly.  It took me 3 days to fill it up to 90% capacity with music from my CD collection.  I love the fact that I can add a memory chip to expand capacity and the battery is user replaceable.  I had no difficulty finding cases, car and wall rechargers, and wires and systems to play on my car radio and stero system.  My grand kids and daughter in law all have ipods, so I tried them out and did backround work on the internet comparing makes and models before my purchase.  I am extremely happy with the sound quality, fm radio and the factory supplied ear buds.  I have some more expensive sennheiser headphones that I have not used on this player yet and probably won't til the originals wear out.  The only problem that I had was placement of the voice recorder button on the side of the unit.  I hit it by mistake several times.  When I bought a crystal case for protection, it also resolved that problem.  I hope that Sand Disk comes out with larger memory chips than the 2 gig in the future but I can buy the 2 gig chips for $29 from internet suppliers.  No problems ripping and syncing.  Excellent owners manual and customer service.  Have had no lock ups.  Battery life is excellent at 20 hours.  I love my e270 sansa!

<Title>Bought it, never received it, bought an iPod, love that.
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this thing from a seller on Amazon over a year and a half ago and I never received it. I bought it because I didn't want to conform and buy an iPod. After I never received the Sansa, I just gave in and bought the new (2007 when I bought it) 8 gig nano/video thingy iPod. I love the iPod. I am hooked.  -F*** salt!

<Title>Great player with a few bugs
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was on my Hanukkah wishlist after I lost/broke two of my previous 2 gig sansa players that I was relatively satisfied with, but just want more capacity this time.  I was elated when my Dad, who take great care of me, but can be relatively stiff when it comes to holiday stuff, actually bought it for me.  After having it for three months (and not losing or breaking it) I can say I have a good feel for what works really really well, and what could use improving.  My main use is for when I take the train to school (essentially helping my 45 minute long wake-up process) and for when I'm doing my homework.  Basically, the only function I use is the music function.  I never use the video or the recording function.  I have used the radio function.  PROS: -Great size, easily fits into tight pockets -Love the volume wheel. -Sound is awesome -Easy to find stuff, screen is nice and bright and everything's as organized as it can be, really. -Easy to adjust settings when it comes to sound, etc. -Radio seems ok here in Boston -Even has the time on it, once you set it. -Easy to drag/drop items.  CONS: The major one:  -Twice it has frozen up.  Both times it was really cold (like, below zero) so I grant that my little gadget just didn't want to go to work anymore than I did, but I'm afraid this will become a constant problem in less extreme weather.  One time it stopped freezing on its own when I threatened to take the battery out with the screwdriver at work.  One time though, the battery just wore out and I wasn't able to recharge it until I had access to a compy (I was on a trip).  The minor ones: -It doesn't delete all of the songs off the playlists even when I've deleted the files.  Kind of weird, but I can live with it.  At some point I'll clean it out and reset everything. -When changing tracks on an album by going back and forth (not going to the menu) it reacts slowly and sometimes it skips back past the song I wanted. -At the end of each album, it goes back to the menu automatically.  I'd rather it not do that and just replay the album and only go to the menu if I click the menu button.  Also if I'm going through the tracks on the album and accidentally click past the last song, it goes to the menu, kind of annoying. -It would be nice to have a car charger or a wall adapter. -Would be nice to be able to listen to the walk man while it's charging. -Doesn't seem to like JPEG  Still, this is the best little gadget I've ever owned.  It's really easily worth my Dad's money just because it gets so much use and I'm pretty happy with it, despite its few flaws.  I hope they iron those out for the next model.

<Title>expansion slot only uses "microsd cards" 2gb max.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>CAUTION-- The Sansa website states "that all "microsd" and "microsdhc" cards may be used with the e200 series players". That is a FALSE statement!!!! All the e200 series players may only use the "microsd card" maximum--2gb. NONE of the players may use the microsdhc cards. I checked the website before I bought an e260 player. I bought an 8gb "microsdhc" card and I found out the hard way. I wrote customer support and basically got the answer OOPS!! Sorry your screwed. I am now the proud owner of an 8gb microdsdhc card that has no use. If you plan to add more than 2gb to these players forget it!!!
