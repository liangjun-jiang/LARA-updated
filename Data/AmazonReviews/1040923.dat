<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>A Zune is worth a thousand pictures!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great item, bought my wife the ipod she wanted, and I got this same time. Both are great, do not let anybody tell you otherwise<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>. If you can get this for less money, than why get the ipod? (plus the screen is great, a definate plus over the ipod)I had considered the itouch since I was looking for best bang for the buck with the best screen. I am so glad I did not get the itouch! A friend has the itouch, and it is great until you realize that you are constantly looking at it through you finger prints (that sucks).I will update if necessary.

<Title>This Zune is Great!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the 30GB Zune for my son for Christmas in Dec 2007. I was torn between the ipod and the Zune, but since my son had thousands of songs from his DVDs and MP3 collection which the ipod would not play, I went with the Zune. I was a little concerned by a number of the negative reviews about the Zune PC software.  But I was amazed.  I installed the software on both my Windows XP and my sons Windows VISTA and it was the easiest and fastest instal I have ever done. It installed flawlessly and it recognized the devise immediately, it recognized that a newer version of the Zune software was available and after checking with me it then unstalled it smothly and quickly with no intervention on my part.  It then asked me if I wanted to load MP3,JPEG, and video files from my compuer and allowed me to override or limit, then it synched up the files flawlessly and was ready to play.  The music was great and the large screen (twice the size of the ipod) looked fantastic.  Manuvering around and using the Zune was easy and fun.  If there were problems in the Zune software earlier, they appear to be fixed because everything was easy, smooth and worked great.  I highly recommend the Zune!  Apple better watch out because the new Zune clobers the ipod hands down.  I highly recommend it and I am going to get another for my other son!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Zune family

I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks. I have about 1900 songs,40 videos, and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go. Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband, son, and sister. We are now a 6 Zune family and growing. We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older.

<Title>Great deal at $99
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this from Dell for their $99 price which included shipping.  Originally this was for only the brown version, but Dell ran out and substituted a white model which was nice.  I'm running the v2.3 firmware and I have the latest version of the Zune software.  I've had no sync problems.  The software is excellent and it's easy to manage my CD collection.  I have zero complaints about this product, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $200 price people are asking.   Pros: 1. Zune Software is easy to use 2. Zune UI is easy to use 3. Music quality is good 4. Wireless sync now works 5. Seems to be well made Cons: 1. A bit bulky 2. No auto rotate feature on the videos (doesn't auto-sense like an iPod phone). 3. Supplied earbuds are not that great (iPod owners complain of the same issue).  I got this as a Christmas present.  I liked it so much, I got two.  What I like best is that this simply does what it's supposed to do.  It's simple.  It was also a bargain.  I use it with an Altec Lansing docking station and that's also very nice.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQLPZE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Altec Lansing M604 Powered Audio System for Zune</a>.

<Title>More then happy!
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've seen the Zune around for a while now and for the longest time I gave it the cold shoulder. It didn't impress me, just like the Ipod. I started to take interest in the Zune when the Zune 80 was announced 80 gigs for $250 was not bad in my book, plus the controls for it reminded me of my Creative zen micro. I've been a big Creative mp3 player fan for the longest time. I was considering getting another one till I saw that the Zune 30 was going to have the same firm ware as the Zune 80 and it was on sale for $89.99 on Amazon. I could not pass up a deal like that, so I bought the brown Zune 30 gb, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXP946/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune Home A/V Pack</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWN1LM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune Leather Case 30 GB</a>, and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M1EBGG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Car Charger Cigarette Lighter Adapter for Microsoft Zune</a> which I got all of these for under $180. Getting the Zune was probably one of the best decision I have made in my life. It's very stylish (I don't care what people say, but brown is a nice color for a mp3 player), it's really easy to use, the software isn't as bad as people say it is, and it was very cheep (at least for how much I got it for). Only problems I have with it is that I don't know many that have Zune's so the wireless social file transferring is kind of pointless to me. Another thing that annoyed me about the Zune is that it is only compatible with the Zune software and don't work for WMP's "PlayForSure" software (which I used for my Zen and worked just fine). One last thing that I had a problem was that the wireless transfer to PC was a Vista only(I got XP and I don't want to "upgrade"), not really a problem but I wanted to try it out. But the few problems aside this is a really good mp3 player and for the value I got it for, it blows other mp3 players out of the water! I would highly recommend this mp3 player to PC users.

<Title>For 99$ its a steal. 
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall a good player for 99$, especially with the latest firmware update. But it doesn't play well with Linux, unless you have a virtual machine installed [VirtualBox on Linux with USB enabled]. Another lock-in is the MS Zune Player software.   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-7719226-5553753">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a>

So I have yet to see her operate her own, but she gives the store displays quite a run for their money.  Which is exactly why she is getting the Zune instead of any of the other MP3s on the market.  The Zune arrived securely packed and on time.
