<Title>pretty good mp3 player...but it doesnt last too long
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i've had this mp3 player for about 2 years now and it's been pretty good. Well it was for about a year anyway. After that the buttons pretty much stopped working. At first, it was just one and then gradually they all stopped working. It really sucks because this is a good mp3 player and it holds all my music but now i cant use it because the buttons dont work. Besides the buttons not working, it also doesnt hold a charge for very long. It lasts for about 4 hours until it dies. If you want a mp3 player that lasts long and is durable then you should probably keep looking because this definitly doesnt. But it was good while it lasted =/

<Title>One of the worst MP3 players ever made
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm a big techno-geek, but this is been one of the most awkward, horrible experiences I've had trying to get this device to do the simplist things. The application to get your MP3s on this is not user friendly, not intuitive. It's like it's strived to be so different from the ipod that it took out all of the good and left the bad. The player doesn't even register half the time with my computer. It takes a good half hour of messing around with the device and the settings to get it to work. I plug in the Ipod and it takes maybe 30 seconds. 1 minute tops.  Save your money. Save your aggravation. Get something, anything else.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Thu Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is an excellent player for those of you who dont like to use itunes. The hard drive went out on my first player, so i had to get a replacement, but the replacement works fine. The sound quality is better than my old ipod mini, the battery lasts longer than my ipod mini, and it plays wma. Also it works great with windows media player and my yahoo subscription, which is a big plus for me.

<Title>Who needs an iPod.....
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Really happy with the Zen Micro.  I am using it with Napster To Go and have am thrilled.  The playback sound is great (with smart volume on) and it looks cool.    A few gripes: - As a previous reviewer stated, the battery life was short at first, but after a couple full discharges - I'm getting at least 10 hours of music per charge. - The touchpad is WAY TOO SENSITIVE!  I have to lock it when I do not want to use the controls (and its on low sensitivity). - No accessories.  I can't find a holster/clip for this thing for use when exercising.  You'd think there would be tons out there....go figure. - Creative Media software is marginal. - it's the same toilet-white as an iPod on the sides and back.  All things being equal, I'd buy it again.

<Title>Zen MP3 player sounds great
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm new to MP3 players so I'm still working out how to transfer and arrage the files.  I say "files" rather than music because I'm more interested in recorded books and podcasts than music. Music does sound GREAT using the earphones that came with it - and the books sound great, too, but it's still a trial and error process getting all tracks of all discs of a book in order.  That will take a little more practice on my part.  The touchpad also took a little getting used to, but I was able to master it in a day or two. I was not happy when I realized that the only way provided to charge it was by hooking it up to the computer USB port.  That means you have to take your computer on the road with you.  No wall outlet or auto adapter was provided. All in all I'm pleased with this purchase - and I suspect I'll like it better after I've had some time to figure out how to arrange the files or playlists.

<Title>Best Value in the Land of Un-iPOD
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Zen Micro is near perfect.    I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.    I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.  It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.  It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.  It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.    All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.  So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.  The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.    It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... charm.  When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.    It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!  Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.    My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.  It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.  over and over again.  But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.  I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.   The accesories that come with the player are great.  White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.  Also all the required cables and what not.  To me, currently at $218, this player is a best in class.  It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.    Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.    Pick your favorite color and buy it.

<Title>My GF loves it.
<Date>Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought this as a present for my girl's birthday, and it is really very tiny. The pictures do not provide a good reference point, but we are talking about half a pack of smokes in size. A good little player from what I can tell, she loves it.

<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good quality sound. Holds up to 3,000 songs and still has an F.M. radio. Also this baby coms with a built in mic so u are able to record lectures and also record off the radio. I would definitly get this over an ipod mini.

<Title>good so far
<Date>Sat Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this player for a little more than 4 hrs and from what i can see so far, it has alot of great things about it. At first i was like i dont know if i can get used to the touch pad and i eventually did. I plugged it in and after a fairly long install and a restart, i started loading songs onto it using the nice media organizer program. For the people that want to know how big it is, it fits very nicely into a standard pack of altoids. Or dimensions 3in. x 2in. x 3/4in. sorry metric people. One thing i must mention is the great sound quality. Before this player, i bought the Samsung blue square looking one, 512mb and i was not impressed so far as sound and navagation. Speaking of navigation, the buttons are layed out very nice. I dont use the drop down menu button very much. The menus all are easy to navigate. The radio is decent, and the recorder is O.K. also.   PROS  +STYLE +TOUCH PAD +AUDIO +GOOD EARBUDS +REMOVABLE BATTERY +MORE SPACE THAN IPODMINI +FITS EASILY IN HAND +ENTERTAINING BLUE GLOW  CONS -SOFTWARE COULD BE BETTER -HARD DRIVE BASED (POTENTIAL PROBLEMS?)  All in all, if you are looking for a good player, but dont want a mini then get the ZEN MICRO

<Title>IPOD Killer
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is awesome. I have nothing bad to say about it. The software is extremely easy to use. The only problem I have is trying to navigate the menu in the car (which I shouldn't be doing anyway) and really isn't the players fault I guess. One other thing is it only has a 3 bar battery monitor so when one bar is left you could have 10 mins or up to 8 hrs. Other than that though it is perfect. After using my brother's IPOD for a month prior to getting this, the Micro is preferable in many ways (most important to me is ease of use and it is considerably smaller).

<Title>Average mp3 player and don't buy to use with Napster to go!
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Do not use with Napster to go!!!! The firmware upgrade needed to be compatible with napster to go is only in beta form and last I checked has not been updated by Creative Labs (what's up with that!?!) It makes the zen micro freeze up in the middle of songs for no reason, it loses lincenses needed to play songs you have downloaded (and even purchased), then it freezes completly and the reset button and removing the battery do nothing. After that it is just an expensive and pretty paper weight.      Other then that if you keep the firmware it came with it's a pretty cool mp3 player. It's small, visually atractive, has a FM tuner, and ok sound qaulity. However, it's not very loud at it's highest volume.      I've read a lot about the sound qaulity being so great, but I disagree. It's not bad sound qaulity, it's not good either. Just average and acceptable. And better headphones only minimally help the sound qaulity, but I don't think many people will pay more for their headphones or earbuds then they paid for their mp3 player (but you should because they are worth it!!)If you want sound qaulity go for an Iriver h320 or a Cowon X5 or experiment for yourself.      Also, if this review darkened your dream of using the zen micro with napster to go, don't worry, the Iriver H320 is compatible (and superior!)     Oh and one last thing, you can not customize the equallizer settings, they are all preset, which sucks!    Well I hope that this has been a helpful review.
