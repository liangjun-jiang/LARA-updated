<Title>mp3 player
<Date>Sun Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this product is my first mp3 player and i'd have to say that over all im pretty content. getting started with it was pretty hard. it was confusing on how exactly to get the files i downloaded onto my mp3 player. after a few hours i finally got it. and then it was stuck on the &amp;amp;quot;music&amp;amp;quot; screen and then it would just shut off. eventually it worked (dont ask me how).   i would also have to say that the keypad is pretty difficult to control. the slighest touch will hit the other button. also, there is NO off button. so yeah...idk if you are really good with electronics then i'd say this is a great product,i thought i was until now... good luck

<Title>Yall READ the directions!
<Date>Tue Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am frustrated with the other reviewers, because, my gosh, the software has the manual right on your computer, and it the files can be dragged and dropped (it took us 4 minutes to use all 256MB) and it even tells you how to turn it off!! (UGH!)   The sound is really, really good. And, we got some good deals on SD cards, and you can just pop one out and put another in!   Like having hours of music on teeny tiny cds! Fun stuff.

<Title>Just One annoying problem.
<Date>Fri Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have read the online manual, but I am still having problems deleting files from one of the drives.  The files keeps reappearing after I have erased the files.  In addition, after deleting it from the player, once played back, it reappears again.  Any suggestions out there.  Otherwise, there are no other problems and the sound is wonderful!

<Title>really cool, but one slight problem....
<Date>Tue Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this item and started downloading all my music, but the only problem is, it will not let me download music to the memory card! I filled the internal memory with music, but can't get anything else to load. Any suggestions??  Otherwise, I LOVE this player. Sounds really great, and I can even use it in the car. Much better than hunting for CD's!

<Title>Don't waste your money
<Date>Thu Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I wasted 5 hours of my time today on endless help-line holds, downloading patches and drivers from Philips, and working fruitlessly with their support staff who could not bring this not-ready-for-primetime device to life.  It gets returned tomorrow.  Don't waste your time.

<Title>SD card problems, transferring
<Date>Mon Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i read all the reviews on this page before i bought the mp3 player. well, i didn't see to many bad reviews so i bought it-big mistake! i have had two problems with this device. one, when i store songs on it it still does not recognize them. i went through my browser and opened the 2 mass storage devices to see if they were actually empty. all of the songs i downloaded to the mp3 player were listed-and yes they were all in mp3 file format. then a few days later it magically recognized them and started playing. now it has returned to its original non functioning state. when i turn it on it says, NO FILES! another problem i had with the device was with the SD card. i called Philips and they told me they just discovered in some units the SANDISK card does not work. well i guess i am just lucky! when i save songs to my sd card drive everything shuts off now. when i try and play only songs from my card only option, the mp3 player shuts off! so, buy it at your own risk, believe me i know how to read the instructions and even when i called Philips they acknowledged there are some problems. so i do not recommend that anybody buy this mp3 player.

<Title>Easy file transfer for SD cards
<Date>Sun Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I found out that the best way to tranfer files into a SD card it's using a SD card reader and writer,I use them with this MP# player that I just bought and also to transfer media and files I use in my Pocket PC, they use USB connections to transfer files, they come with different input slots for the different types of cards (SD, CF,MMC,etc) you put the card in the reader and then you can access it just like a removable hard drive and tranfer files as simple as copy and paste, they are a lot of them offered out there, you just have to know which USB port you have on your computer (USB 1.1 or 2.0) to be compatible, this way you wont have to worry about using your device to import mp3 files into the SD card. Also they are very unexpensive, average starting usd12.00. I hope this info could help someone.

<Title>Simple to use, works like they say
<Date>Mon Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Purchased for use @ healthclub. Upgraded the drivers and works like a charm. Allows me to download unlike other users and plays exactly the songs I want. If people actually READ instructions, bad reviews on good products would not happen. I have used several other brand SD cards w/o issue as well.  My only problem is switching songs because I have big fingers, but simply reprogramming my card to delete the songs I dont want works for me. Battery life is amazing. Its on week 3 with one simple AAA. We are purchasing a second one for my husbands use. The SOUND IS incredible! Comes with software you dont need as well but are nice to have. Just drag and drop songs onto memory card!

<Title>Not so good....
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The button in the middle annoys me.  In order to use the back (or up) button, you must push it in just the right spot.  It takes me, on average, about three or four tries to get that button to do what I want it to do.  It either pauses the song or goes back a few seconds when all I want it to do is go back to the beginning of the song! So annoying.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;I'm taking my product back to Target today to get a refund.  It was overpriced anyway.

<Title>on a scale from 1-10 i'd give it a 7
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>hmm.. well this was my first mp3 player i ever bought i had no real clue about them but i managed to figure it out relativly fast with the software. with the internan memory you get is only 128mb had about 30 songs on it then i bought the 256mb card and i couldn't access the cards memory i think it was too much for it to handle i think i should have bought the 128mb card for it to work right but anyways long story short it is a good item but when you buy it you can only hold about 30 songs or so and with the card you can put roughly 60 songs on there. long story short it you just need something small to take around with you to hold a few of your personal songs to get it but if your seeking more memory i suggest you just get an ipod. i hope this was helpful, later

<Title>I do not like this one at all
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had this music player before, and I have to admit, it's pathetic. The &quot;256MB&quot; it supposedly has on the player is only 128MB. The reason I do not like it is because it had erased all of my music when I didn't even do anything to it.

<Title>Surprising performance
<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This unit has surprisingly good features for the discounted price that I paid (sub-$100). Decent audio, light weight, acceptable supplied earbuds, and handy neckstrap + armband made a good package. Pluses are that it can be used to hold data files as well as mp3 as a mass storage device. Also, the FM tuner is pretty good.   128 MB SD card limitation DOES NOT apply on my unit, however it is not explained how to make it function with larger cards. Simply hold the center button down until the unit powers up! For the supplied 128MB card it only takes a couple of seconds, but, for a 1GB card, it takes up to 8 seconds or so, but it will work if you are patient. My guess is that the player has to build a database of files on the card before powering up completely, and the processor is a little slow. 1.128 GB of storage gives a lot of files to listen to during the day.   Cons are that the batteries do not last more than about 10 hours if it includes time consumed by much moving of data to/from the unit with the USB transfer. Also, the latch that keeps the back cover on does not seem to hold too tightly, but I have not had a problem with it, yet.

<Title>Extremely inconvenient & horrible!!!
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had no problem getting songs on this player.  Just used drag & drop in Windows Explorer.  I never even installed the software they included.  It even shows the extra memory as a separate drive, so it was no problem to divide the music up. My problems with this... #1 In Mp3 mode, it eats up the battery fast.  I go through a battery in one day.  Gets expensive fast. #2 The battery will show 2/3 charge left, but the player will just stop.  It won't restart without a new battery. #3  The main button to go forward, back, change radio stations etc is extremely unresponsive.  You have to hit the button 2 or more times to get it to do what you want.  Try doing this on a treadmill! I wasted over $100 on this and am now looking at other, better MP3 players.  Don't waste your money.

<Title>Easy to use but some serious flaws
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my 2nd Mp3 player.  My first is a San Disk Mp3 Companion which worked fine but has some of the same problems as this one.  First this unit does sound good and the addition of the FM tuner and the Voice recorder is a nice touch.  If you buy this for Mp3 listening, you need to realize there are limitations.  My biggest problem is getting a playlist to work or even get an album to play in proper order.  Here is an example of the order I have saved in Windows:   Black Sabbath - 01 - Turn Up the Night  Black Sabbath - 02 - VooDoo  Black Sabbath - 03 - Sign of the Southern Cross  Black Sabbath - 04 - E5150  Black Sabbath - 05 - The Mob Rules  Black Sabbath - 06 - Country Girl  Black Sabbath - 07 - Falling of the Edge of the World  Black Sabbath - 08 - Slipping Away  Black Sabbath - 09 - Over and Over   After syncing with the Philips Rush here is the order it plays:   6- Country Girl  5- The Mob Rules  9- Over and Over  7- Falling of the Edge of the World  1- Turn Up the Night  2- VooDoo  3- Sign of the Southern Cross  4- E5150  8- Slipping Away   The limitations are frustrating and Philips customer service is a joke.  I talked to 5 different people last weekend all giving me dead end solutions.  Some reps were giving info that was contradicting other reps.  One said this unit doesn't support playlists, yet the product manual decribes a step by step process (that doesn't work at all by the way)to create a playlist under Music Match software.  The most laughable was a rep said keep checking on their website for firmware upgrades, since they are always coming out with new updates.  Last upgrade was August 2004!!!  Over a year ago!!!  Looks like they aborted this baby...
