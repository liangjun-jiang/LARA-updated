<Title>The Worst Purchase I've Ever Made
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I regret purchasing Creative's Zen Vision W 100%. I spent a lot of time researching players, and narrowed it down to the Vision W and Zune's 30 GB player, and I made the wrong choice. Though I haven't loaded any pictures or video yet, I will say that the screen is BEAUTIFUL -very clear and I love the widescreen. The sound is great, even with my mediocre headphones. It's big, though, and heavy, though that didn't bother me at all. I cannot give this item anything but an F, and if I could give it zero or negative stars, I would.  When I received the player I was able to load 1300 songs right away. No problems whatsoever. However, starting with the very next day, when I tried to load more, I had nothing but complete failure. Suddenly the device wasn't recognized, other than maybe once every 15 tries. Even in that one time the player was recognized, it froze in 'DOCKING' mode before any songs could be added, and the only way to do anything -even turn it off -was to remove the battery and then have the system 'REBUILD.' I hate this player, and will never buy another Creative product. The Creative website, too, is a joke. There are all these questions you have to answer -none of which gives you an answer, other than something like, 'You should change your Reg files. Here's how to do it.' Then it tells you, once you update the Reg files, your system may become unstable. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! I'm going to do that when I don't even know what the problem is? I notice, also, that CL obviously doesn't want to talk to customers -all CS is YOU spending time troubleshooting. I finally fired off an email -I'm sick of wasting my time. I paid $258 to waste my time? So the emails tell me to reboot, then when that didn't work to update the Reg files, which I did. Nothing helped. Customer service then told me I would have to send the player in to have it analyzed, and if they couldn't find anything wrong, I'd be charged for postage both ways. In a last-ditch effort I finally reformatted the stupid thing -erasing the nearly 4 hours of time spent downloading the 1300+ songs already on the beast. Only then could I re-load the songs. After doing that I knew the next day would be make-or-break. I tried adding more songs. Nope. Apparently, one had better load all the songs one ever wants at one time, or forget about it. I had the same exact problems as before -freezing in docking mode and an unrecognized device. Thankfully, Amazon is great. I've purchased so much from them over the years and this is the first item I've ever had to return anything. They made the entire process completely painless, as far as returning the defective item for a full refund. I do not recommend the Creative Zen Vision W AT ALL. It's garbage, and their customer service is severely lacking.

<Title>Good player if only I can get it to connect
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this 2 weeks ago and was able to play with it.  I immediately updated the firmware and tranferred a few GB of files.  Unfortunately, the connection broke and I'm now unable to connect the device to my computer via USB.  It just won't detect it.  I looked on the forums and quite a few people have this problem.  I tried this on 2 computers and got the same problem.  With the files I was able to play I really do like the player.  The screen is nice and it comes with a screen protector.  The movies play a bit slow especially bigger ones.  I have only 2 gripes about this besides the USB connection issue.  1) No strap.  Isn't the reason for having a mobile player is to bring it around.  Having a device of this size I would expect a strap so that I feel safe holding out just in case someone bumps into me.  There wasn't even a hole for my own strap!  2) Audio and video adjuster.  It would be nice to have some control to adjust the video settings and audio settings while playing a video.

<Title>Great improvement over the old Vision!
<Date>Sun Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my second pvp after the original creative zen vision and this version basically picked up where the old unit left off and corrected the minor issues for a stellar little machine!!  1.The viewing angle issues that plagued the first generation are gone completely allowing me to share the video with multiple ppl without having to adjust everyone in some exact manner.  2.No one ever fussed about the speaker and neither did I until I fired up the little speaker on this baby that blew away the previous model's COMPLETELY!!  3.I have bad vision and the small letters on the vision were slightly annoying because of that...but NO MORE with these big clear letters on this big beautiful screen!!!  4.The jump in video quality is very noticeable even by average joe sixpack...and the screen size increase is a very welcome improvement as well which only adds to that nice and sturdy feeling that assures you that this product should work for a long time.  5.One thing that bothered me about the old model was it's visual appeal with that tacky chrome-like bordering which also left fingerprints, and made it look sorta cheap...thank god Creative fixed that with that brushed metal look and the screws that keep them locked on to the Zen making it look like a real fashionable yet tough machine invulnerable to that annoying fingerprint that plauges the ipod and several other electronics.  So basically all in all it's the result of Creative's will to please it's fanbase and create an affordable alternative to the ever so mundane smallscreen videoplaying MP3 players out there.

<Title>non-tech review
<Date>Mon Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My Creative Zen player died on me (through carelessness on my own part) and I decided to get a replacement. I was looking for another mp3 player but spotted this instead. Afer much deliberation - I only wanted to spend under $100 on an mp3 player, so I had to take in account the other features that come with this - I decided to go for it. And I have not regretted it since.   Like I mentioned in review title, this is strictly non-technical, because I am as layman a user as you can get, so the technical stuff just go over my head. I will simply tell you what I like about this player and why I feel every penny spent is justified. I'm not someone who will read the whole manual, and I'd rather just start using and learn as I use the item. Only when I am stuck or something bad happens do I start looking through, therefore everything I say here is from my own experience with my player. This might be a good review for someone else like me.  My findings:   The screen is very good, the picture is clear and the angle of view is good. My friends and I crowded around it when I first got it, and everyone could see clearly what was shown on the screen. The sound on the built-in speaker isn't that great for songs, but for watching a movie, it works good.   It plays everything I have downloaded so far. When the format or file is unsuitable, the software automatically tells you to convert. All you have to do is follow the steps and the files will be changed to fit into the player. It will even transfer the file when the conversion is finished. Granted, conversion takes a while (I don't know what a standard time to convert a full movie file is though) but usually I leave it to convert and transfer while I sleep and everything's done by the time I wake up. I love how I can just leave it to work while I go away or to sleep.  The files you download, if under a folder, will automatically be transferred under a folder of the same name. I haven't worked out if I can move the files around in the player yet (when hooked to the computer), because I would like to just have all movies under one folder instead of having 20 differently named folders with 1 movie in each. But some people might like this aspect, so it's a personal issue for me.  A small thing that I like is that the album picture of the song you're playing will be displayed when you play the song. This is not the case for all songs, especially if downloaded from unknown sources online. But if you ripped it from your cds, it should display the picture.  I'm still a little confused about how the fast forward and rewind button works. It seems that for some movies it will simply skip to bookmarked points, whereas others it will work as if it's a VCR and you have to stop it. When in such a "VCR mode", picture doesn't run while in fast forward or rewind, so you'll need to get used and I bet you'll be able to estimate well with experience.  There are a few view modes on this player, Fit to Screen, Stretch to Full,  Zoom to Full & Original Size. I find myself using Zoom to Full when viewing widescreen movies. The Stretch to Full makes everything look out of proportion, so I'm not touching that.  I tried the built in microphone once to record my friend snoring from about 2 feet away. I couldn't hear it when I play back on the built-in speaker but I can hear the snoring when I use the headphones. Another instance I recorded my friends and I chatting normally while sitting at different positions in a enclosed room, and we could hear just fine from the speakers when we play it back. So it might be ok for normal volume recording but most likely you'll use it for personal voice recording.  I don't know if it's a technical issue, but I'm bummed that you can't use the fm radio without using the headphones. It'd have been nice to be able to set it down and listen to the radio sometimes.  I haven't had the player go flat on me yet - it charges up whenever it's plugged through the USB, so I never have to worry about it. I only plug it in with the adaptor when I am in a hurry to charge it up, otherwise I wait till I am transferring files on it. It gives good playback life, although I haven't really timed it. All I know is I bring it with me on the road and after watching 2 or 3 movies, it's still not out. The auto-shutdown feature is great because there will be the occasion when you just forget to turn it off and you'll be glad that it didn't run flat because of that.  I uploaded photographs and although the quality of the pictures isn't perfect (you get that compressed look), it's more than sufficient to be able to view the photographs in detail. You can even rate your pictures so that you can view only pictures from a certain rating that you wish. Of course, the slideshow feature is always a good thing.  Plugging the player into the tv was easy! Once plugged in, your tv screen will reflect what is shown on the player. All you have to do is select your movie/music/photo slideshow and play as per normal! It's that simple!  A lot of people have complained about the size of it, though I admit it is a little bulky, I don't see the point of having a tiny player which will come with a tiny screen and then you won't be able to view much anyway. So for my viewing enjoyment, I'll gladly accept the size :)  Hope this has been helpful to you!

<Title>Excellent, but not perfect; great software.
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to agree with all the previous reviews that this is an amazing product. I can do so much more with this thing than my last PMC which got stolen.:( the sound quality is great, and the colors on the videos are amazing. I liked the calendar feature, the memory card feature, and especially being able to change the background and the theme. I also found that the creative software is great for converting videos from google video, itunes, and recordings from a computer. The bag it comes in is useless, and the cord broke the second day of use. So i bought a psp screen cover for $5 at target that fits the screen perfectly.i am also thinging about buying the leather case for more protection. Also, if you have a lot of music artists, you can scroll down them alphabeticlly on the side. i really like that. my only gripe is that you have to put the player on hold for the screen to completely go off to save the battery. Overall, a great product that i hope will last me for years to come. DONT BUY AN IPOD!! this thing is tons better and cost the same! if you do your homework, you will find that this,a nd many other products are far better than the ipod.

<Title>Great gadget
<Date>Mon Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This devise is very slick. It does everything it advertises, and for me so far, it does them perfectly. I just wish we could mix such great features into a wireless phone and add WiFi and bluetooth. Such a combination would satisfy my tech needs for quite some time.  I have found the W to be very easy to use. There are not a lot of places yet to easily get video for such devices though. I have found the usual places, but I can watch dvds on my home player. Getting personal video onto the computer is very time consuming, but that is not the fault of the ZVW. I love the FM radio and I like the fact that I can easily transfer my podcasts to the ZVW.

<Title>Loved it, but not enough to keep it...
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read most of the positive reviews and ordered the Zen Vision W. I got mine today. Used it for several hours and am sending it back tomorrow. Why you ask?  The screen is gorgeous. I love the screen. It is so much better than my video iPod's.  But it had some quirky things I didn't care for. Lots of buttons and not all in the best positions. Not a deal-breaker, just something I thought was ergonomically off (ps - I don't care all that much for the iPod wheel either)...  I hated the software that comes with the Zen. It is nowhere near as good as iTunes and requires way too many programs to do badly whay iTunes does great.  I signed up for the IzzyVideo ZenCast (I have all o fthe iPod version Izzy as well). They downloaded fine and then took forever to "convert" into the Zen. Convert? Geez, I thought it read just about everything. Half the things I tried to download gave conversion errors. Maybe I was doing something wrong, but if I was, the software wasn't intuitive enough...   Unlike my iPod, I can't simply drag and drop items into it from my file explorer...   The Zen was slow. It loaded videos and music quite slowly which surprised me. It also seemed to have no volume control that worked. With headphones on the only volume available was loud. It would not allow me to lower the volume even though I had the volume level to zero... Didn't seem to affect it and my ears were ringing it was so loud...  All in all, I feel so sad sending it back and looking at my iPod video... I can only hope the widescreen iPod is good (if it's real as the rumors say)...

<Title>BEUATIFUL & SIMPLE TO USE!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Beautiful is one of the only words you can use to describe the still and video images this player is capable of. They can be absolutely stunning. This pmp is so easy to navigate that my 95 year old grandmother wants one after she saw it! There is just tons of space on this thing. I've already put almost all my music (which is farely extensive) and about 3 years worth of photos on it and i've barely scratched the surface! I still have about 26gb left! I don't have any videos on it yet. It is so cool even for the technology challenged person. It can easily be connected to any tv using the av jacks. The only real downside to this pmp is that it doesn't record video so you can't use it like a dvr. Creative doesn't make a zen player with that capability that i'm aware of. If it did it would be second to none. It's not a big deal if you're not really into movies, but if you are it's kind of a blow, because it would be much simpler to direct record something off your tv than converting all those video files and stuff just to get a dvd on the thing, especially for the techno challenged consumer. If it were a recorder you would just simply put the dvd in the player and record directly from the tv and voila, your favorite movie is now on your player. One other drawback at this time is the lack of a good wireless remote accessory. They only have one that is barely available and i think there are some problems with it, because i don't think it was designed specifically for this pmp. Again, it might not seem like a big deal, but remember this is multimedia playe,not just a mp3 player/photoviewer. If they want you to put your life's entertainment on it, it would be a lot easier to navigate with a good remote! When you connect to a tv, the remote is a almost a must, it's a pain without it!

<Title>I love it
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I do not normally write reviews, but after reading others I'd like to clear a few things up. A. It does have a volume control. B. It plays almost any downloaded .avi video file you can throw at it without the admittedly long conversion time needed. A simple check of the file you want will let you know if conversion is needed. The player only accepts avi files with an mp3 audio track, otherwise conversion will happen during transfer. It is usually the audio format that requires conversion. I have had no trouble on my aging Win XP using the software provided. C. It is easy to convert a DVD to a format for this player and it takes about an hour on a 4 year old OLD AMD 1800+ Athlon. Figure your time if you have a newer 'puter to be faster. I especially like third party programs such as cloneDVDmobile for this purpose. D. Drag and drop DOES work.   This player suits my needs PERFECTLY.   I exercise on machines and love to watch videos time shifted from my computer's TV card. The 4.3 inch screen is the size that just tips the scale to comfortable viewing in my opinion. The Zume while bigger than most is not as big as the Vision W nor as colorful.   It is super in hotel rooms as it hooks up easily to 90 percent of the cheap 27 inch televisions I find. It goes right in the front of the set and you are done; where my laptop outputs only s-video and needs an act of congress to configure IF there is an s-video input which is almost never.   The audio is excellent. Playlists are a snap to configure with or without your computer. There is room for up to ten bookmarks for audio. Resume play works for audio or video files in which your shut the player down in the middle of a file and play is resumed at that point when you turn the player back on. I like that when I am reading an audiobook in the car or watching a movie in pieces as I sometimes do during exercise.  If you jog or like to use your player in your pocket while you are active this or ANY TRUE portable media player (meaning with a decent sized screen) is NOT for you. While it will fit in almost any pocket and is easy to tote from place to place this way, it will become uncomfortable if you are exercizing and bouncing around a lot because of its weight.  It is unfortunate that this player is not in the major brick and mortars to see and touch before you buy it. If I had been able to see it in one of those places, I would have bought it MUCH sooner as I was worried about the chance of spending money on a screen that was too small to use and an item too big and heavy to carry in a pocket. Turns out that it was a flawless match for my needs.

<Title>Good for video.
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this Zen Vision W for a few months now and I love it. It's got a great screen and 30 GB is big enough. I got it as a birthday gift, otherwise I probably wouldn't have bought it on my own.  Pros: Great screen. Good hard drive. Easy to use.  Cons: Not great as an MP3 player (too big). Can't play a folder of videos, just one file at a time. Trouble transferring stuff in and getting it to fit exactly to the screen size, even though Creative feels like they dealt with this using a "Zoom to Fit" feature.  Overall, it's a neat tool. Best for taking ALL of your family photos with you and being able to setup slide shows for the Grandparents. Or catching up on vidcasts.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a present for my wife.  She loves being able to load it up with lots of photos to show off the grandkids and still have plenty of space for music.  Display and sound quality are good. The menus are simple to use, which is a big plus for her. The included software isn't fancy but it does the job. I like being able to use it as an external data drive. It comes in handy if we're visiting and I don't have a thumb drive with me. The only real complaint is that the instructions could be better, especially for the software.  I recommend buying the optional rubberized skin.  The non-skid surface gives the player a better feel and doesn't interfere with operation.

<Title>Does Almost Nothing it claims to
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was misled by the earlier reviews and was amazed how little this product can actually do, if creative claims it can do it in most cases it cannot. Many of the eariler reviews was after one day of use, I have been trying to use this thing for 3 weeks.  Pros-   * Nice Screen  Cons-   * Does not play standard format anything   * Does not play MGEG2 files, Creative flat out lies when they      say it does. The only way it will play MPEG2 is to reduce the        bitrate to unusable low rate then strip the ac3 and change       it to mp3. To me that is no longer MPEG2.   * The convert software doesn't work on 75% of files.   * When the convert software does work about 50% of the files that     the creative software processes will not play.   * No Customer Service dept at Creative, or so they tell me.   * Tech Support Dept speaks 2nd grade English at best. Talking to      a 3 year old is easier than understanding their very unhelpful     tech support line.  I really wanted to like this product, I am disappointed on so many levels. I researched for weeks before choosing the Zen W for "its support of so many video formats" This support is JUST NOT TRUE. This thing will not play hardly any formats at all. Copy a MPG4 file to it and more than likely it will not play.  The only way I got files to play at all was to download the demo of DVD Clone mobile and convert from DVD to their ZEN W format.. Even this way I only got about 60% of the files to play  Please don't get stuck the way I did.....

<Title>Love this!
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this product. I had originally bought the Zune, but the software for Zune is such a pain to use (typically getting my song titles and artists mixed up, somehow, I don't know why). I decided to get rid of the Zune and buy this one, it works very well with Windows Media Player, it's very easy to use. I also like the little speakers it comes with (not separate ones, but built-in ones) so if you don't have the earphones you can still listen to it. The only drawback other people might find is the size, people can find it bulky. I don't have a problem with that, I prefer my players bulky because then they are not as fragile and less likely to break after a fall. Anywho, that's my two cents on this...

<Title>Great player
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player as a Christmas present and I love it.  I previously had a Nomad Jukebox and loved that one but that one was on it's last legs and the case was falling apart and I wanted something a bit snazzier.  This fit the bill.  The screen is far superior to any other media player on the market.  The picture is crisp and clear and the color is amazing.  I like how easy it was to synch my old player and this new one through the provided program and transfer my music.  The only problem I encountered was that it would not transfer files with the same song name even if it was a different artist and album.  I had 4 different versions of Dust in the Wind and it would only transfer one.  But I think I know how to fix that.  This player is a keeper.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Receieved this as a Christmas present and was undetectable out of the box.  Disappointed to learn that in order to get it repaired/replaced, I would have to eat a shipping charge.  The replacement unit worked for one day before it too became undetectable.  Had to eat another shipping charge to send that in for repair/replacement.  This has been sitting at Creative for 3 weeks and I can not get a straight answer to the status of the RMA.  Pros: Have no idea, since I have only been able to use the unit for 2 hours in the 4 weeks of receiving the original unit.  Cons: Had to send in for constant repairs/replacements. Had to pay (to date) over $30 in shipping charges for a unit that should have worked out of the box on original purchase. Dealing with tech support is a major hassle. Poor tech support staff.   I am at the point where I am looking at other (more reliable) products.  I feel sorry for my poor mother who just flushed $300 down the toilet for this.

I was terribly excited to give it to my gf as it was replacing an older IPOD and I thought with her travel schedule having movies and such would really be a great addition for her.  Before she ever got it out of the house it was freezing up and not going through more than 30 or 40 files without having to be reset.  With each reset it took about 5 minutes to reload it's library.  I guess we will be trying a zune now....

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my wife - who is not an "early adopter" of tech toys.  Loading it with her entire file of photos and music was nearly effortless (I had already loaded the music on the desktop).  After the initial "what's this???" and a five minute lesson on navigating the photo files and music listings, I couldn't get it away from her.  Two long plane rides later (to visit family and show off her photo albums) she's now ready for the car radio accessory, and "when can we get a slide scanner???".  So I think it was a hit...   I selected it over the alternatives because of the added flexibility (I'm not locked into a particular source for music downloads) and its versitility.  It's not the smallest on the market - and that may detract for some who what to carry it in their pocket or on their belt - but, being able to take our entire music collection along anywhere, show photos, and watch videos on something about the size of a couple of decks of cards, who's complaining...

<Title>Creative Zen Vision W 30 GB Review
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very excited to receive the Creative Zen Vision W in the mail.  As soon as I opened it, I charged it (be sure you peel off the sticker), and began to upload most of my music.  I was surprised with the speed of the uploads, which was so much faster than my old mp3 player.   The only video file I have uploaded so far took a while, because it had to convert, but I haven't played around with the video feature yet, so I can't comment on that.  The pictures take a long time to load, which can become frustrating, but the quality and sharpness of the photos is great.  The built-in speakers also sound very good, and I was delighted to hear how loud they actually were.  I like how the player counts how many times you have listened to a particular song, although it does not have a feature for uploading that count onto tracker websites like last.fm, which is disappointing. My only complaint would be how the menus go back to the very top every time you go back to them, rather than where you left off.  So far battery life hasn't been a problem, but the bulkiness and rather large size might be an issue.  I didn't realize the dimensions of the player when I ordered it and I got the 30GB so I cannot imagine what the 60GB looks like. The only other thing I want to mention is organizing the music you have uploaded.  It might be just my computer, but the little program that came on the cd takes a very long time to modify the tracks and always freezes.   Other than that, almost everyone who has seen it has been impressed and I definitely recommend this product.

<Content>This thing does it all, music, radio, movies, pictures, and can even be used as a storage device, and it does them all very well.  It is very portable, but still too bulky for your pocket.  Controling the device is very easy and intuitive, and I have yet to have any problems with it.

<Title>finally, an mp3/video viewer that is worth every penny!
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>And that is why after shopping around, with an always lacking array of abilities (never large enough screen or drive size or music loading flexibility) that was our commercial market for two years, i bought my first one!  Three hours after attaching the charger the internal battery was full.  Then i began to download my cd collection, and one hour later i had over 10 whole cds to listen to with over 26ish gigs left.  It was easy to navigate and enjoy the completion of said 'rips'.  I loaded my W with old MPEG's, and now everyone who will watch and listen to my band that i was in some 25 years ago can hear and see how much fun i had... then and now!  I can go ANYWHERE on the internet and 'use' their service for any music/movie/tv show i'd like.  This is a great tool/toy for the person who wants a clear full bodied picture and great sound, and does not need large buttons to change what they listen to every other moment, although the button size is easy to acclimate especially for one (myself) who never had any other button layout from which to compare, and then find fault... dig?  For me the button layout and size is worth the trade-off with increased screen size.  In other words, this maybe for adults and not children.  The reason i say that is because along with the beautiful screen (that four people who are not connected at the ear can enjoy... and yes, with a splitter for four sets of earbuds it sounds great still...) you need to be respectful with it.  Just like you paid for it and will pay to repair it if needed... not disrepectful like mommy or daddy pays your way!  So far, it really does play everything i throw at it!  I'm very happy with my purchase of a W rather than an M.  The W was just 20 dollars more with internet searching and coupon.  The speaker alone was worth 20, and there is SO MUCH more!  I have already used the microphone to dictate the beginning of my next novel.  I cannot wait to get an adapter for my camera's chip, so i can upload my one gig chip travel photos and videos... 30 times if i choose.  Which i'm sure will work like every other creative product i own... flawlessly!  Anyone with a negative review, is probably jealous cuz they own something else (boo hoo for you!), but this is only one man's opinion and i'm sticking to it!  Thanks for your time.

<Title>Super Duper
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a wonderful media player with a large storage capacity. I have a Sansa e-250 which although it is small, does not come close to the sound and of course all the added features which the Zen W has. I bought it directly from [...] and recieved a great discount off the Zen purchase when I joined [...] which was well worth joining anyway. Delivery of the item from Amazon was very fast. Bottom line: The combination of a super player and the [...] membership has left me very satisfied!

<Title>Great device!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got this for x-mas and  I haven't been dissapointed with it in the least I think the video quality is excellent for what you have and i think the software is very user-friendly. I have only experienced the player freezing up on me once and all I had to do was take the battery off and put it right back on. As far as the resolution on for pictures is concerned, again I think it is great for what you are getting. I bought the flash card adaptor in order to just take the SD memory card out of my digital camera and download directly to the vision W. I love this device and so will you!!!

<Title>Awesome Toy!
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Santa got me this little critter for Christmas this year, and he really thought this one out. It's just amazing and unless you are unpleasable, I can't imagine anyone not liking it. Easy to use interface, a ton of room and the bright, clear, humongous screen are a joy to behold.   Some will say it's a bit of a brick, but to get the big screen you got to accept a little weight. It's very well constructed, and has a metal frame, so if you are clumsy like me, you should be ok. Battery life has been very good, better than advertised. Transferring media is a breeze, either by the Creative Zen Vision Media Explorer, or drag and drop.   If I had to complain, I'd say that there isn't much after-market stuff available for it, and I can't tell from the Creative website if they are going to support it in the near future, or if they're going to let it die on the vine, which would be a shame. It's the story of my life really, every time I find something I really like, it gets passed over for the flavor of the month, i.e. Betamax, Sony Clie, 8-Tracks!   It would be cool if it had a docking station too, but other than that you won't go wrong buying this puppy.

<Content>This is a really cool player. A little bigger than I thought it would be, but that turns out to be a good thing. The screen is huge, and movies look fantastic on it.  There is more than enough space on it. Great value too, especially if you buy it in the states for use in Europe, or elsewhere.   Overall, a great buy. Go get one. God I'm so hungover.

<Title>customer service
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i bought my creative zen in april and in august it stopped working.  as i live in brasil the process of returning it for the warranty was somewhat risky via postal service and too expensive via Fed Ex or UPS. i did in fact send it via regualar mail service and it arrived safely.  the customer service folks were very good and sent me a new machine.  however due to a communication glitch, it was sent via regular mail to brasil and brasilian customs asked a US$120 to release it to me.   custom service assumed responsibility and shipped me another machine to a US address.  so i want to acknowledge that they gave their word and kept it.  job well done and greatly appreciated.   these are trustworthy folks!

<Title>Don't buy Creative Zen product
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought Creative Zen PMC in November 2005. It stops working last month because of the battery swelling up. I have to break the battery door to get it out. I am afraid that it will explode and contact the company.  Response from Creative:  Unfortunately, your Zen PMC is no longer in warranty. This product is ending it's service life and has been replaced with newer and more feature rich products. We are no longer maintaining PMC stock or accessories stock in either retail or repair channels.  The most that I'm going to be able to offer to you is a 20% discount on the purchase of a new product.

<Content>I love my Zen Vision W.  I have copied 130 short movies, 3500 songs, and hundreds of pictures onto it and still have 10 GB left to fill!  It is easy to navigate through the menus and has good sound.  I also like the built-in speaker for times when I don't feel like putting on my headphones.  The viewable screen area is only 3 3/4 inches wide, not 4.3 inches, but it is still impressive.

<Title>so glad i didnt get that other thing
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before the CZVW, I used a combination of my cellphone [512 MB] and a cd player to get musical entertainment while i walked, waited, washed dishes, settled down for a nap, etc.  It got to be a drag, because I found that I wanted every piece of music that I owned all on one lil thing.  I had my laptop, but it's terribly inconvenient.  When it came down to choice, I was leaning more towards the ipod, then I remembered reading something about Creative, Inc having a few products that are amazing.  It's been about a month since I ordered my CZVW, and I must say that it is the most amazing little machine I have.  It is everything I've ever wanted and I'd be foolish to ask for more.

<Title>Love this product!
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Zen for 7 months now and absolutely love it.   PICTURE: The picture quality is amazingly crisp and clear. The widescreen on this player really adds to the quality as well. When you convert a movie using the included software you will never lose any of the video quality in conversion. With this picture you are able to see a clear picture no matter what angle you have the player at. Another cool thing when you are watching a movie is when you pause, stop or shut off your player, when you turn it back on and go back on that movie it will be where you left off.   MEMORY: I have 27 full length movies on there, 1 one hour show, 92 podcasts, 249 songs and 185 photos and I still have 8739 MB of space out of my 30 GBs. It has a slot you can add a seperately sold attachment for a memory card reader, but I have no clue why you would ever need the extra space. I'm not sure if you could add photos using those cards or not, but I believe you can because there is a setting for copy from card.   SOUND: The volume goes up to 25 and is plenty loud enough when your in a room with not a lot of noise (I have 5 boys so quiet to me isn't the same as silence). When using headpones you will often need to turn the volume down because it gets extrememly loud. I've tried many other headphones and can not find any that compare to the sound of the ones that came with my player. While in the car I hook up an FM transmiter (Walmart for $20) and can hear the movies through the car stereo. This is a favorite for the kids to watch movies.   EXTRAS: There is a date and time setting, which includes an alarm. Under organizer there is a calendar that you can add events and scroll through years up to 2037! There is a tasks section seperate from the calendar as well and an address book. Also in the extras section is a removable device that says you can configure a portion of the drive to be used as portable storage. I have not used this feature though. Although not in the extra section there is a microphone setting that allows you to record voice. I have used this for things like lists and such and the kids singing, but not sure if it would do well with lectures and such since I have only done recordings close up. They worked wonderful for me. This player also has a FM Radio that uses the headphones as an antenna, which you must have plugged in for the radio to work.   BATTERY: The battery on this player has yet to let me down. Just the other not I watched two full length movies before it ran out and even then it didn't start out with a completely full charge. The AC cord that is included works great and you are able to watch the movies while it is charging. There is a lock on the power button that will save battery life while watching movies.   NEGATIVES: There are very few negatives I have found with this player. When fast forwarding or rewinding a video you can not see where the video is at to know when to stop. I've learned to pay attention to the minute and second counter when I do this. Another negative is when adding calendar appointments you must do this through your computer. You can not just go and add from your player. You can use the recorder section to remind yourself of the things you need to remind yourself to add. The only other negative is that it takes some time to convert movies for your player. I get it going on the computer at night then go to bed, so I'm really not sure the exact time it takes. When I first got the player we did one while waiting and it seemed like forever.   Not a single one of these negatives would deter me from buying this product and I would most certainly recommend this to anyone and everyone...and I do. I show this off to everyone I know and they are always very impressed.  My husband bought this for me for my birthday after doing extensive research. He uses the reviews on Amazon for many things he researches, so I hope this review helps someone else in their quest for a wonderful portable media player.

My first intro to creative mp3 players was the MUVO2 - 5 gb.  Loved it! I later wanted one that could play videos as well.  I saw this and researched.  I found it did all I wanted.  I mostly wanted it to hold data info if I needed, play mp3s, videos, and record voice.  This did it all.  Only a few things I am sad about, this item is that you must use the software it comes with so I was not able to plug into any computer to load information.  It's windows os only.  After I have loaded my info and played then connected to my computer I found it would place my songs in different folders that what I assigned, I guess I am still learning about my player. I am also not happy with the fact there are no accessories easily available in stores. I say get it if you find it to be useful.  I found mine to do as I needed   for now.

<Content>Since my husband is the hardest person in the world to buy a gift for, I was sure that before he even loaded one song, he would find something wrong with this present.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how excited he was with the Zen.  He has since loaded his entire CD collection, a bunch of pictures and also some TV shows and is still very happy!  Although the unit is larger and heavier than the well-known competitor's, the screen is so much larger that it's worth it if you are planning on using the visual aspect of it for pictures, TV shows and Movies.

<Title>Great product but handling is difficult
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative Zen Vision W 30GB is a great product! It is more than I expected when I purchased it from the net but operation of this product is little more difficlut when compared to other media players. i.e. the buttons are little hard, button spacing is too less, the silver button-rim with arrow keys does not allow very smooth operation. however, with the lapse of just a little time, things start getting better. Screen width & clarity is amazing!   It has only CF card reader. No other cards work in there.   It is is HDD based player so HD sometimes makes low clicking/cracking sounds!  It has a DC charger and and also keeps recharging while you connect to the PC for data transfer/sync.  Last but not least - the thickness of the player is too much! It is like little more than 2 iPOD Nanos!!!  If you are planning to buy a wide screen media player, I recommend Archos 100GB. However, for lower budget this could be the best choice!  Booom!

<Title>Preparing for the widescreen world
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife initially wanted an IPOD for Christmas so she could listen to music. In looking at some of the IPODs in the Apple store she then saw the video IPOD and commented that if she had that she could store pictures and videos of our grand childred to show to her friends.  She commented on the small size of the screen.  In another store we saw that there were other alternatives to the video IPOD.  The sales person in this store commented on the limited file types supported by the IPOD and described the difficulties of translating videos to a format that the IPOD could use.  In researching the many alternative players, I purchased the Zen W because it supported more file types for video, pictures and audio than the IPOD.  I have put a lot of her music CD's on the zen, many of the pictures of the family and some of the videos.  In addition, I have purchased several videos for us to watch during our airline travels.  The picture and video resolution is great and the quality of the audio is good also.  Getting files from the PC to the Zen is a little more complex that I thought before purchasing the device.  This is more of a complaint about Windows Media Viewer.  For MP3's and picture files, I found that Windows Explorer was much simpler and efficient.  Also, I could organize the files on the Zen using explorer.  Videos were another matter.  The purchased videos from Amazon could not be transfered with the Windows Media Player but were very easy using teh Amazon Unbox application.  It took more time than I expected to transfer non commercial video files than I expected.  Also it was difficult to understand that some videos could be put on the Zen but were not viewable in Windows Media player.  My wife is very pleased with the Zen and likes the larger screen and the resolution.  This is good and bad in that the larger screen means that the device is not as portable as the IPOD.  However, I realized this in my selection.

<Title>Great Purchase
<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you want to carry every media file on your computer with you at all times, this is the way to go! With the 4.3 in. screen you have absolutely NO problem wathcing movies or anyother video wherever you are. This is also the only media player i have ever seen with an external speaker which makes showing off everything ive got even easier. I suggest this player for everything except if you want music while you jog or work out etc. It's far to big to fit comfortably in your pocket, but once you get used to all the other great features it has to offer that wont even be a problem anymore. Another thing i like about this product that i havent seen with anyother player is that you can delete media off it without connecting it to a computer. the microphone works great and i've even recorded some of my band practices with it to show my friends. the best part id say is that you dont even have to use the software given to you to put media on the zen. for example, you cannot put media on the IPOD without ITUNES, you cannot put media on the ZUNE wihtout the ZUNE software, but wiht the zen you can sycronize it to multiple different programs, windows media player being one of them (thats what i use, its easy to use and works great). you can even open your media player as a folder and put media on there with a drag and drop method. i do, however, suggest installing the creative software because it automatically converts unplayable video formats to work on your zen! GREAT PRODUCT!

I was looking at portable DVD players, but was glad to find something that had a screen bigger than the ipod video and capable of storing data.  This is perfect.  I don't have to worry about lugging around DVDs.  I can also listen to music and the radio.  This completely blows away a portable DVD player or an ipod video.

Once i plugged it in my PC it was recognized as an external HDD.  transfered all my videos and mp3 in no time.  The video qulaity is impressive and the sound quality is the best of all the mp3 players i owned (i owned no less than 10 different players... so take my word)  Additionally, i programmed my Harmony Remote control to operate the Zen and i am using to watch my videos in my big screen from my couch, a feature that i did not know about.  The screen size if excellent... at least good enough to watch while exercising on a cross trainer or in a plane.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND

<Title>Good device but false advertising
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The main reason I bought this device because it is advertising that it can play MPEG4-SP video. It DOES NOT do that and it will display a message saying the content format is not supported. I did a research on this problem and it is apparent that a lot people who bought the same device have the same problem. In order to play your MP4 contents, you will need to run the software Video Converter that come with the package to convert to wmv format. It will take me DAYS to convert all my mp4 files to wmv format. Converting a mp4 file depending on the quality of your encoding, it takes hours to convert a single file. Other than this problem, overall I am satified with Zen Vision W player like a lot of reviewers have mentioned. I have yet encountered any other problem.

<Content>I love this thing!  I bought it originally for a trip about 6 months ago, along with a new portable dvd player.  The dvd player crapped out immediately, but I used this all the time- on the plane and after arrival when I wanted to watch some TV before going to sleep.  The screen and sound are fantastic!  If you get the battery extender you can keep this device charged with AA batteries- a great thing if you don't want to carry another AC cable.  I still use it nearly every day to watch videos when I miss my favorite shows- I can watch while riding the bus!  It is a bit bulky but if you are careful with the machine it should last you a good long time.  No bouncing around, it does have a hard drive and that will eventually die if you jerk it around too much.  Must haves with this player are a screen protector, a nice case (the Kroo leather case has a stand and a clear vinyl screen protector incorporated into the case) and the powerstick battery extender/charger if you are away from home a lot or are going on a long trip.  The earbuds were okay, but I don't like earbuds so I got a cheap $15 pair of folding headphones, those worked fine.  The Vision W was absolutely essential while I was on the plane- no worries about changing discs, more videos than I could ever watch, and easier to carry than a DVD player and a stack of DVDs- and the battery lasts over twice as long as most DVD players, or longer if you have the battery extender.  I got at least 3 full charges out of the same 4 AA batteries.  Helped keep me sane during the long delays at the airport!

<Content>This product is so great with stable and excellent performance. I tried Archos 605 WIFI before I got zen.  But Archos is a disappointment with faulty battery.  Also it needs extra money to buy some plug-in. I returned it.  Zen is a much better choice.  I am glad with Amazon's service. Also excellent!

<Content>I bought this mainly to record my vocal lessons - most recorders cant handle the high notes and the recordings get all scratchy on the top notes.  I'm very pleased with the quality of the sound reproduction on the zen - the recordings are very clean and full sounding.  I'm also very happy with the battery life and the screen resolution.  Overall i'm very satisfied with this purchase

<Content>I bought the Creative Zen Vision W as a ift for my wife. She is not electronically inclined but once it was set up and she saw that she could view movies, save our child's pics and listen to music she fell in love with the device. These are just some of the functions. Its wide screen is awesome for viewing movies and video and it has multiple uses that will keep you entertained for years.

<Title>Best portable video Divx player
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everything you throw at this baby will play nicely. I've tried everything, MPGs, xvid, Divx, it always plays perfectly and without a glitch. I never had to convert anything I got from the net. I only converted my own DVDs (into Divx). The plus side is that all the videos look very nice in the screen, even those that don't look very good on the TV. The screen is large enough for the watching to be pleasant.  The small loudspeaker makes it ideal to use it with your kids on car trips or, like I do sometimes with my 4-year old, when he is eating.  It is a life saver, if you, like me, had to go thru 5 hours of flight. I just watched 5 episodes of Heroes.  No, it is not a small ipod to take to the gym. It is more an alternative to a portable DVD player, with the advantage that you don't have to convert anything and you can carry 30 full-length movies or 80 TV episodes in it.

<Title>Great Device - Two Shortcomings
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased mine about six months ago. The compact flash card reader was a key feature as I wanted to backup pictures from my camera when traveling. I found it could download a 2GB card in about 10 minutes, which was fast enough for me. It has served me well for playing music and storing pictures.  I apparently wasn't paying enough attention when I purchased it to realize that it isn't Mac compatible. So I was pretty sad when I found out that none of the software would run on my mac. I ended up getting XNJB so I can transfer my pictures and load my music from iTunes. I don't have the right software so I haven't been able to convert a video to play on it. I can't use any of the other features either since they don't have any Mac software.  I just recently discovered a serious flaw in the hardware. I purchased a cable to connect the audio output to a Mackie SRM 150 powered speaker to use during puppet team rehearsals. If you generate any static electricity from walking over a carpet and then touch your Zen it will crash and rebuild the system. This has happened to me several times, even when I'm careful to touch the Mackie first. It takes very little shock to clobber it. The first couple of times it happened I didn't even realize what had happened because the shock was so small that I didn't feel it. When I contacted Creative they suggested I purchase a different product. Not much help there!  The bottom line is that it does the two main things I wanted (mp3 player and picture backup). I just wish they had some Mac software and that they would have avoided the grounding issue when plugged into a powered system like a mixer or speaker system. I haven't lost any data from the crashes yet, but it concerns me that I might.

<Title>great mp3 player!
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As an ex-Ipod owner I have to say I am impressed with the Zen widescreen. The picture is beautiful and the sound from the internal speaker is impressive coming from such a small speaker. The one really great thing about the Zen is the removeable and replaceable battery. The battery may not last as long as the Ipod but it can be replaced unlike the Ipod which has to be returned for service. The controls are easy to use and the interface is easy to understand. I had mastered the controls after just one day of usage. I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for something more than just a mp3 player.

<Title>Does the job quite well
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been usuing this player for around a month now and use it in a work setting some of the time.  I have to be careful to touch something before picking up the unit or it goes into a reboot mode that lasts for about 5 miunutes.  Pictures look great and music sounds good.  Haven't figured out all the uses but can get around now pretty well in pics and music.  Big and heavy but since I carry a man-purse (purchased in Italy) it isn't much of a probem.  Hard to find peripheral items.  I do like that it comes with a wall charger.  Much faster and simple.  Itunes rules for equipment but I like the access to my tunes which I get by not having to purchase from apple.  Spent half an hour trying to convert something from itunes so it would be accessibel on my player.  It might have just been me but I like straight and simple.  Price is great and I have most all my music and pictures in the player and still have a few gig left.  I have over 500 cd's.  Amazon had best price at the time but shop around.

<Title>You'll be better off buying a PDA.
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to use a PDA (iPaq hx4700 + core player) to watch video on the go, but it would crash on me now and again.  I figured I would buy a PMP as I thought it would be better suited to the task. I was wrong.  1.- The screen has poor detail, ie you can see lines when viewing video like it's interlaced, my ipaq screen is MUCH better. Also even though the screen is supposed to have more colours, my iPaq displays a more uniform image. -1*  2.- When u forward video you can't see the video!, u forward the time slidder, and then have to wait 10 seconds for it to start playing again. This happens when u even forward it 2 seconds. So if you were to forward the video 2 x 2 seconds u would have to wait a total of 20 seconds before it started playing. So u can't scan video, u have to guess where the scene u want is. -1*  3.- I get a low battery warning 1.10hrs before it runs out! so basically u'll get a low battery warning every 2 minutes when you still have 25% left. -1/2*  4.- Big and bulky. Twice as heavy as my iPaq with (8gb storage). -1/2*   I live in Australia, and the Zen cost me just as much as my iPaq and it's ONLY plus point is storage.  So by itself the Zen VW would score 4 stars, but comparing it to my iPaq hx4700 it scores 2 stars.

<Title>Big and Beautiful
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this media player as an alternative to the ever-popular ipod, and as a previously satisfied customer with Creative products from their great sound cards.  So far, I am very pleased.  Since 80% of the market is ipods, I'll pit this player against them.  The thing you will read most is, "It's too big and bulky" or "Too heavy".  It's what the ipod lovers fall back on when they have no other ammunition against this media player.  They're just jealous because the beautiful screen the Vision W has is well...as big as their entire ipod.  It really is.  The Vision W is about an inch longer, half an inch wider, and 50% thicker than your average ipod.  I think it's the perfect size.  It will fit in my pocket, and carries well in your hand.  The buttons are small, but I'd rather have the screen take up 85% of the side of the media player instead of the buttons.  The screen is equivalent in size to the sony psp, and looks much better in quality than the screens on the ipod.  It's perfect for watching any video without losing details, like you do on smaller ipod screens.  The internal speaker is suprisingly loud, and is great for sharing with friends.  Speaking of sharing, it's possible to share files with friends on the zen, unlike the ipod.  When you put files on your computer via iTunes, they are locked in a vault transferable only to your iPod.  It is a HUGE hassle to share music or video files with anyone using iTunes, necessary if you have an iPod.  With the Zen, you are freed.  Drag-and-drop copy/paste works just like an external hard drive, and it supports most file formats.  The few files you need to convert for playback is easily taken care of with creative software.  Cliff Notes: PRO's: -beautiful, large screen -good battery life, considering above -flexibility of supported file types and file transfer/sharing -internal speaker?! -sound quality you only get from creative -good FM tuner -loads of other random features -"wow" factor from everyone who sees it  CON's: -transfer speed is relatively slow -you won't be trendy because you don't have an ipod

<Title>Some challenges
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This first Zen W had its hard drive fail at the 1 month point.  Amazon replaced it promptly with no hassle.  The new one works magnificently.  Movies are great.  The Zen software is worthless for movies, though.  It will not convert movies we own like Pirates of the Caribean.  When I contacted Zen on how to do it, they indicated it was ILLEGAL....and the DVD was copy protected.  However, a product called M2Convert-Zen did the job with no hassle.  Great hardware - lousy software.

<Title>Excellent product : Creative Zen Vision W
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I looked first at the ipod due to its popularity , but found this player during my searches on Amazon. The player looks attractive and yes its big. I did not find the size uncomfortable, it can be easily taken on travel journeys , though not as a pocket companion (probably fits better in a laptop bag)  The best part of-course is the screen , thats what you notice first. No other player I have seen matches the screen that this has. Therefore this becomes a primary Video Player , and is not best suited for music etc use.  Having said that , you can store tons of video , music and pictures. I found the music out of headphones quite good , but the speakers on the player are not loud and dont give good beats. Additionally the FM Radio only works with headphones (since it uses the headphones as antenna). Also i would have expected the music player software to be a little more jazzy (showing some graphics when the music plays). It simply shows the name of the song as of now. Video playback is excellent and controls are adequate and easy to operate. FM Channel search is not 100% , it misses some of the FM channels, which can be manually set. The photo's can be stored in folders , and album format. One can view photos , rotate them , zoom in etc. Quite basic controls for the photo section.   I would have loved a Touch screen here , also i would have appreciated a docking station. Both of these are missing. The keys on the main player , are OK , but not too comfortable for my fingers.   All in all , i like this player. Quite a good player , and yes , it certainly matches upto the ipod.

<Title>WOW!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Simply said, this is the most amazing product out there. After searching and comparing for weeks, we decided on the Zen Vision W. It does everything we need it to do. The ease of use is a plus if your entire family is not electrically savvy. The quality of the videos is almost perfect (depending on the source). And the Creative transfer software is incredibly unintrusive on your PC.  The only cons I have run across so far are that it is a little bulkier than other video players out there (closest in size to a PSP). And they don't have an AV dock for it. (Though they do have an IR remote). First day out of the box, my family loaded it with 22 Divx "Dora the Explorer" episodes, and headed out for a road trip. Not having to constantly change out DVD's for my kids was worth the cost of the player immediately.  I have shown this player to three of my friends and their families, and two have bought one already. All in all, this thing is great. To sum it up, If you are debating between this and another player...Don't! Just go with the Zen Vision W and I promise you will not be disappointed.

<Title>Awesome little machine!!!
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product for a photo tour to use to store my pictures.  It worked great!  I had read a review where they had a problem with the Zen recognizing the CF card.  I had that happen once, but I just had to take out the card and retry after shutting the device off and never had a problem after that.  I was able to load over 5000 photos in large format and had plenty of room to spare.   The manuals don't tell you much, but I like to play with things to figure them out and I'm not a "techy" person and had no problems.  Using the software I was able to load my music collection and movies before I left and it was simple to do. Everyone on the tour thought it was a really cool device.  And when I told them the price, they couldn't believe it. My only grumble would be when you want to view the photos from the stored files, it's a little slow.  But using the slideshow option worked great.  I was able to review my photos and zoom on them to check the quality.  If I didn't like it, I was able to delete it right away.  I liked the fact that I could rate my photos so if I wanted to show one that I really liked, I could find it easily.   I had looked at much more expensive photo storage units, but because this one offered more features and cost considerably less, it got my vote. Great product, great price, and it does what it claims.  What more can be said?

<Title>The Best Mp3 Player I Ever Bought
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative Roooooocks!!!!!  Before i bought this wonderfull mp3 player, i read A LOT of reviews here in amazon.com and other sites, [...] I have to say, until the date nothing of what happend to them, has happend to me, no freeze screen, no freeze during transfer, some people said that the video transfer was extremly slow, until the date i have uploaded to my mp3 a total of 10 videos, all of them of a size of 40mb to 60mb and the total time i have to wait until the videos where in my mp3 where about 15 to 20 min. Well here i go with the pros and cons i found of this player (comparing to my previous mp3 player Creative Zen Xtra of 30gb and Creative Nomad Jukebox of 6gb)  Pros: - Beautiful widescreen. - Excellent resolution. - Easy to handle trought menus. - Amazing sound with headphones. - Amazing quality of pics and videos. - FM Radio. - Pretty good microphone recording audio. - Calendar and contacs to syncronize with outlook. - Got the feature to select a space of the disk so u can use it as an pendrive (i think is that, havent tried yet). - Use your pics to put a background. - Compact Flash card slot to transfer your camera pics direct to the mp3. - Built in Speaker. - Firmware Upgrade.  Cons: - No EAX - A litlle bit big and heavy (But i have no problem with that, i prefer quality instead of quantity). - Have to be very carefull with the screen, i highly recomend to buy an LCD Screen Protector, and also an case. - NO Radio Recording. - The built in speaker is not very strong in places with a lot of noise, in quit places is very good.   Well thats it, i hope you found this review helpfull.  Sorry For Bad English!

But in reality, it is not bulky and it's design is not good. If you see Apple's product then you will find them far superior then this creative one. This creative is not as per my expectation.

<Title>Probably the best available
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned the Vision-W for about 8 months now.  I use it almost everyday.  I have traveled with it overseas, and use it around the house as a Video player and MP3 player.  The Goods: * Easy to navigation, good user engineering design * Great sound! Toss the included headphones and attach a Sennheiser PX-100 and you'll hear things that even Creative didn't imagine this puppy could produce. * Not flimsy. Solid, a bit heavy, and big, but feels like it won't fall apart.  As I've mentioned, I've traveled with it quite extensively and it really holds up to the bumps and bruises. * Easy to add/edit to your collection.  You can use the supplied software, or just use Windows Explorer and in most cases just drag and drop.  * Video display is gorgeous.  'Nuff Said. * Locking and unlocking display is super simple with a flick of the on button.  When listening to Audio, you can lock and the display will go black, for further power savings. * Cables provided to hook up and play video directly to your TV/Monitor. It looks gorgeous there too. * Recharge with provided power adapter and with USB cable. This is great for airport stops.  Your laptop is plugged in, and your Vision-W is recharging with the USB. * Accepts Compact Flash cards to upload audio, video, and photos (although you can't play directly from the card, you have to download it to the player first). * Easy integration with Zencast for podcast management.   The Bads: * 30GB is not alot by today's standards * Does not fit easily in pocket * Doesn't play all video formats, and conversion from FLV to a pocket AVI format (using the supplied software) takes _forever_.   Wishes (For next version): * 160GB to match the Ipod Classic. * Play all video formats without clumsy conversion. Especially Divx and FLV (which are currently not supported) * A bit lighter...  All in all, this is a wonderful player, and i have tested some of the competition. If you want to be 'trendy', get yourself an Ipod. If you want a clumsy interface, get an Archos. If you want the best out there, with the caveats mentioned, get the Vision-W.

<Title>Discontinued Creative Device!
<Date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Terrific Music & Video Device that suited my need for the additional compatibility with Audible Books. I also wanted to use it for travel photo storage & this has a CompactFlash port built in for file transfer.  I really wanted the 60GB version but Amazon didn't carry it at the time of this purchase.  I have since found out that the 30GB version has been discontinued & replaced with a new (slimmer?) 60GB device! Also be aware that Creative Customer & Tech Supports can be MOST OBTUSE! I tried to find out if SDHC cards are compatible with the optional adapter & what is the highest capacity CF card that the device would read/write but got a frustrating run around.  Finally, after 5 emails, determined that SDHC is not compatible & no straight answer on CF cards. If none of this is of issue for you, then the device will suit the music, video, audio book necessities very well!

<Title>Simply Good
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great MP3 player with great sound and good equalizer, and the other features like radio and the excelent quality of video display are things to enjoy! Also, the fact that accepts several video formats is a plus. The software is very good and easy to use.  Only Cons - the buttons could be more modern fashioned... make it look very old style! -the earphones are very... very common? -may be the size sometimes make it not very portable and it's something to care about.

<Title>Was Shocked
<Date>Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me tell you, this was hard.  The Zune had tons of accessories readily available and had all those slick interfaces so the choice was hard.  Finally I read all these reviews and took a chance.  This thing is big, thick and bulky but worth every single ounce.  Once you figure out the video techniques and such this little item becomes a gem.  Loads of cool extra's that work nice, which makes me wonder why the Zen is so low selling in the states.  We have two now, and aside from the difficulty video transfer (which any video unit makes difficult), and its size; this little bad boy is well worth the $250.  In fact..we would have paid much more.

<Title>Customer service
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product may be okay but the customer service is not bad it is HORRIBLE. First of all I purchased another unit as a gift to my friend who is technically retarded. So I wanted to have it charged and ready with some downloads. Now the bad news in detail 1. You can't synch one unit with the other unit, in other words you have to treat the second unit as totally independent. It does not synch, it transfers what you have on your player 2. I could not use their software to transfer my wvm files that I had on my computer. I had to use windows media player. The music worked but the video did not  3, To transfer a dvd I had to convert it to a divx file (4 hours) and then transfer to their conversion software another three hours. 4. I spoke to three different people who were either not informed or arrogant or both. 5. They must have an egg timer in front of them because they convey that they have little time for a new customer. 6. When I had any problem they want you to do a software update which would mean losing all the stuff you have downloaded. Two more hours 7. The battery on the new unit was not charged in four hours and the only way that I solved it by switching batteries. Most people would not have an extra unit.  It is also heavy and slippery 8. This product is not for a person who is not technically knowledgeable. I will give it to my friend who will probably not use it. Buy an IPOD

<Title>I Love Creative Products
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far so good with this product.  I've only had it for about a month or so, but it is a very neat device.  It is a little larger than I thought it was going to be (not ideal for jogging!!), but the picture is beautiful.  This is actually my second Creative device.  I did have the Zen Vision M and it ended up freezing up on me.  I don't think it is indicative of Creative, just a bad coincidence.  So I bought the bigger version and it works great.  I love the speakers it has, the FM tuner, and the ability to watch movies on a decently large screen.  I should have never gotten a portable DVD player because this things takes care of the movies and the player.  I'll keep this updated to anything that happens with it, good or bad.

<Content>If you're looking for a mp3/video player, this is it!!  Great image and video quality, external speaker a plus(although it's tinny sounding), video out, audio out, good software, affordable, etc.  I searched all over for the best deal (including ebay) and amazon was the cheapest.  30 GB is big enough for me....I put A LOT of music on, some pics, some video and still have 16 GB left.  Battery life is good if you're not using the display all the time (set it to "lock" to conserve power while listening to music).  STOP READING THIS AND GO BUY IT!!

The picture is amazing and the size is just right for watching on the airplane.  It is a chunky unit, but the size doesn't bother me.  I use it when I work out at home too.

<Content>Picture is very impressive and has nice, big screen to view pics; sound is great, but that's what you would expect from Creative Labs. Well made, good quality--all in all we are very pleased. Bit big compared to IPOD, but does so much more, and is compatible with all of my file types in sound and video, including all my downloaded movies.  With the 30Gb harddrive, I can use for camera transfer storage, watch movies, and play lots of my Mp3s...great travel partner!

<Title>Es el mejor reproductor port�til integral y completo: m�sica, video, fotos, radio... 
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Desde que tengo mi Creative Zen Vision W  me siento extremadamente satisfecha y hasta sorprendida. Este reproductor casi no se ve, al menos no en mi pa�s, por eso me parece necesario hablar de �l.  La letra W significa widescreen,  por eso �ste aparato se impone a los dem�s en el mercado porque su pantalla esthecha para disfrutarla, estespecialmente bien preparado para ver pel�culas.   Mide 35 x 85 x 25 mm y pesa 258 gramos, posee carcasa de magnesio de alta calidad. En Contra: es un poco grande y pesado en comparaci�n con otros m�s compactos, pero el peso es cuesti�n de costumbre y a cambio de ese peso y tama�o se tiene muchas otras ventajas �muy competitivas! La cuesti�n es conocer cu�les son esas ventajas.  Su pantalla TFT mide 4,3" y muestra el formato 16:9 �Es panor�mica!, es brillante con resoluci�n 480 x 272 px - se puede ver casi desde cualquier �ngulo- y posee 262.144 colores.   Tiene Zoom que se puede utilizar con cualquier contenido y adaptarlo a la pantalla panor�mica. Y se puede poner cualquier imagen como fondo de pantalla.  A favor: Tiene salida de TV y el paquete incluye una conexi�n AV que permite visualizar las im�genes 720 x 480 a todo color en televisiones de cualquier tama�o.   Se pueden ver en su pantalla o conectado a un televisor presentaciones de diapositivas configuradas con mi m�sica favorita, videos y pel�culas en formato AVI, DivX 4 y 5.3, XviD4, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4-SP, WMV9 y Motion-JPEG.   Posee una ranura Compact Flash que con un adaptador permite leer casi todos los tipos de tarjetas del mercado, lo que permite incluir las fotos que tomo.  En contra: las tarjetas de memoria son Compact Flash en vez de SD, es necesario un adaptador para leer tarjetas SD.  Tiene  grabador de voz y un micr�fono incorporado que incluye niveles de volumen mostrados en la pantalla para obtener la mejor calidad de grabaci�n y posee 8 ecualizadores.  Tiene control de seguridad del volumen para que nunca pase de cierto nivel - no es recomendable usar el m�ximo volumen al igual que no es recomendable para ningun reproductor port�til llevarlo al m�ximo de su capacidad de almacenamiento: 30 Gb.  Tiene Radio FM con la posibilidad de presintonizar 32 cadenas por si no quieres escuchar la m�sica que le haz metido.  A favor: el reproductor puede ser escuchado a trav�s de auriculares o a trav�s del altavoz incorporado en el frontal- esto no lo tienen otros-  o conect�ndolo a sistemas de altavoces.  La bater�a es de Ion-Litio con una autonom�a de 13 horas para el audio y 4,5 horas para el video.  A favor: la bater�a es extra�ble, lo que significa que si se da�a no pierdes la inversi�n del reproductor, sino compras otra.  La interfaz es amigable y f�cil de operar en poco tiempo se domina. El manejo del dispositivo resulta f�cil y c�modo gracias al pad direccional y los botones justos y necesarios para cada acci�n.   En contra: son botones, son duros y a veces se quedan pegados, hay que tratarlos con amabilidad porque pueden da�arse.  Se conecta al PC a trav�s de un puerto USB 2.0 para una transferencia de contenido m�s sencilla y r�pida, y puede conectarse tambi�n a trav�s del soporte opcional. Viene con el programa de usuario instalable en PC patentado ZEN para acceder a m�sica, im�genes y v�deo.   Soporta  casi todos los servicios de suscripci�n y descarga de m�sica y archivos hablados.  Tiene Organizador que proporciona calendario, tareas, listas de contactos y sincronizaci�n con Microsoft Outlook.  Ofrece configuraci�n de fecha y hora m�s posibilidad de distribuir el espacio de disco extra�ble para almacenamiento dedicado.  Posee un reloj despertador musical, distintos colores y lenguajes para una mayor personalizaci�n.  Otros accesorios opciones incluyen un adaptador Compact Flash, protector de pantalla, funda permanente, cargador de viaje, conexi�n remota e IR remoto que pueden adquirirse de forma separada.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IF4TPY/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-5665043-0630868">Creative Zen Vision W 30 GB Widescreen Multimedia Player (Black)</a>

<Title>I Love Zen
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I looked for a very long time to find just the right MP3 player for me.  I read all the reviews and did comparisons and researched everything I could think of.  I wanted a digital photo viewer, an MP3 player (or even better WMA files since I've got my ENTIRE music collection ripped to my Windows Media Player and really didn't relish the thought of having to convert them all to another format), and if it could play videos GREAT!  In the end, I decided the the Creative Zen Vision W was for me.  I am SO GLAD I chose the Vision W.  Although I sometimes wish I had gone for the 60GB LOL, the 30GB has plenty of room for my 5000+ songs, pictures of my kids, and some videos to boot.  The wide screen makes a big difference in viewing as well.  The external speaker is only mono, but it's perfectly adequate for those times when you don't want to use headphones.  The only downside is that the radio will only play if you have the headphones plugged in (they act as the antenna).  All in all I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.

Long battery life for video playback. Hard to find decent accessories like cases for the W. Much of the accessories Creative sells for the W is overprice junk.

<Title>Zen Vision W 30 GB Drawbacks
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Overall a very good product, but...the following makes it so problematic.  1.  CANNOT rearange your folder structure once you downloaded a file/folder from a certain computer. It might be because that helps with the sync-ing of the files? If so, just ask me if I want or not to keep the folder sync-able and let me mess with it. The way it is,if I download pics (from my computer) from Susie's 2nd birthday and then I download more pics from Susie's 2nd birthday from say my son's computer, I CAN NOT COMBINE THE FOLDERS or move all the pics in a new folder. What were they smoking over there when they wrote the software for this thing? I hope a new set of patches will fix this. 2. FM radio: Can not listen thru the little speaker - just with the headset...Bummer. Yes, you need the headset as antenna, but it should be possible to select "headset / speaker". Like Sangean radios do. 3. Unexpected totally: Zen Vision cannot read/play AVI's. So it has to translate them to... whaterver. The quality of the same video straight out of the camera looks great on a 32" TV - give it a 10! The same video out of Zen gets a 6 - barely. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  4. Now that I got it...what do I do with it? How many people can I bore to death by showing 10,000 pictures of 2 yr old Susie? Or 2 hrs of cute videos of her...So before you pluck $300 or so, think about it!  GcB

<Title>High hopes. Guess I lucked out.
<Date>Wed May 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product as a replacement for my dead iPod that was only about two years old. I had exceptionally high hopes for the Zen, considering its many functions and usefulness for airplane trips, etc., which I especially intended to use it for.  Problems started from the beginning when I first turned it on. It immediately started on Recovery Mode and took a couple of hours to reboot to the normal screen that it was supposed to start on. Then my next problem was that when plugging the player into my computer to transfer files, there was a problem recognizing the player!  After a while, my player did work. However, it was very slow and had to be restarted many times due to freezing. There were also many difficulties when trying to load videos and DVDs into the Zen. I emailed Technical Support and got all this shpiel about having to download a bunch of codecs and conversion and whatnot that I am not really familiar with (nor do I think any average person who just simply wants to watch videos and listen to music on occasion while on the go), and decided to scratch the whole idea of ever putting entire movies into my player.  Finally, only after about a month of purchasing the Zen, the infamous "Firmware Problem" screen showed up every time I would turn my player on. The simple solution was only to reload the firmware that you could download from the Creative website. No matter which USB drive I plug in my player to reload the firmware, yet again the player was not recognized at all; therefore rendered completely useless and virtually impossible to fix it whatsoever. Again, I emailed Technical Support for help and they told me that the only thing left to do was to send it in to get fixed. Well, my warranty ran out, and fixing it would cost a whopping $137 - not worth it.  To end this story, I got out my old iPod again, dropped it on the floor, and discovered that it started working again after a 3-month-long coma.

<Title>Excellent Player for the Money
<Date>Fri Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player for my wife. I have a Creative Zen Touch that I bought a few years ago and have always been happy with the quality of Creative's MP3 players. The picture quality of movies and pictures displayed on the screen far surpasses my expectations. The screen is very easy to see unless there is a lot of natural light (e.g. in a car in bright sun light). The quality of movies/pictures when displayed on a TV using the provided A/V cable is also very good, if not a little dark. Overall an excellent player and very good value for money. I'd buy it again. Oh and the customizable themes are a nice touch.

<Title>Trouble with photos
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a photographer I bought the Zen to use as a means to store my digital photos while on the road as well as using as an MP3 player for long plane rides. The music side of it worked great.I just went to Latvia from the US and the plane ride was 11+ hours. The battery lasted the entire trip and the shuffle play worked great. The music quality was good but not great. My main trouble was with the photo storage. I downloaded the first days photos directly off the compact flash card. The download time was adequate. I have a Canon 5D camera which is a 12.1 mp camera. The files are quite large so I was happy with the download time. My main trouble with it is that after the second download session the unit stopped accepting the Compact Flash card. I don't know what happened. As a result I had to buy a couple more cards in order to take all of the pictures I needed to take. Altogether not a pleasant experience.

<Title>Exceeds my expectations
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zen Vision W primarily to download movies to the device and watch them through my regular television or while traveling.  It works flawlessly.  The screen is gorgeous.  I cannot believe the quality for a 4.3 inch display.  It's very similar to the PSP.  The video quality through the television is much better than I had expected.  It looks better than my video iPod.  I can see no difference between this and a DVD.  The battery life is excellent.  I watched a 2.5 hour movie, with some pausing, and still had at least half of the battery life left.  The menu is intuitive.  It did not take more than a couple of minutes to figure out how to navigate through the menus.  My only real complaint is that you apparently cannot have the device plugged into AC power when it is hooked up to the television.  It causes the video signal to be scrambled.  But given the low battery usage while watching videos, it's not a problem.  You could probably watch two full length movies on a single charge of the battery.   A complaint I would direct at Amazon is that you cannot transfer rented movies from Unbox to the ZVW (or any other device, for that matter).  This is not clearly spelled out when signing up for Unbox.

<Content>Pros:  The large screen is nice because I have a lot of pictures to show off.  It's bigger and heavier than the competition, but I like this.  (Whether or not it's true, it seems more robust to me.)  It plays multiple music formats, which is a big plus.  It has a removable battery.  It's not an Ipod.  Cons:  Accessing photos is slow and cumbersome.  It will not play Quicktime videos, and the included video conversion software doesn't work.  Accessories are very scarce.  The included headphones are junk.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.  I would buy it again.  I'm not a child and I don't need hip electronic toys.  This is a useful and fun device for me to enjoy and share with my friends and family, not a statement of my coolness.

<Content>I just bought this used off e-bay, but in new condition. I love it! I didn't want to get an ipod, just cause my friends have had trouble with their video ipods, and I never really liked the ipod... This is so much more of a media player. Uploading is so easy and the display is clear, great for watching movies while on the plane or on a long car ride. Theres so many more features than the ipod, like the radio, and it has the nice widescreen and internal speaker so you can listen to things without headphones. I think it's a great product for the price, I got mine for 195. Definately worth the money. No regrets here.
