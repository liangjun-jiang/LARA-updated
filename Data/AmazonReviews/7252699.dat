<Content>An excellent item. The only drawback is that the system does not receive radio signals very well without something plugged in acting like an antenna. When the antenna or the power cord are plugged in reception is good but bad otherwise.

<Title>LOCKS UP!!!

<Content>I'VE FOUND THAT IF YOU SCAN TOO QUICKLY THROUGH SONGS THE UNIT LIKES TO LOCK UP. PLUS MY RESET BUTTON WONT WORK. OTHER THAN THAT, AWSOME DEAL FOR $45.

<Title>JUNK!!!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you take a magnificent piece of hardware and put horrible software, what do you get?  JUNK!!!  The HARDWARE construction of this product is OUTSTANDING!  The SOFTWARE is absolutely USELESS!!!  PRO's: - Sound quality is AMAZING for coming from such a small package.  Speakers are only about 1.5" in diameter, but deliver the sound of a large boombox!  (Almost seems like the Bose cube speakers) - Size is incredibly small for such a huge-sounding device (7" W x 2" D x 2.5" H) - Stylish with a clear-on-white body finish (very Apple-ish style) - Battery life is very good -- It has always lasted through lengthy cook-outs (Labor Day, etc.) and is a great way to bring big music to a party without wires. - Carrying case looks like it will take a beating and protect the unit.  CON's: - Software is HORRIBLE!  It requires that you install their version of Musicmatch.  No other way to get music onto it.  Even then, you have to jump through many hoops to get it to work -- VERY FRUSTRATING!!! - 256 MB of memory - Radio reception is terrible (can't get ANYTHING, even with the antenna) - USB 1.1 takes about 30 minutes to load the full 256 MB with music - Sporatic crashing (must be reset by jamming a paperclip into a rubber nub in the back) - Ruberized door on back has cheap snap-shut clips that break off within a few uses (back panel is always open now)  Once you've suffered through the painful music loading process, you will swear never to change the music on this thing again!  However, with only 256 MB, you will soon be tired of what seems like 10 songs over, and over again.  To sum it up, the concept for this unit has great potential -- but not the way it's implemented!  Sound is great and awesome for BBQ's, beach, etc.  Philips needs to make it compatible with other software products and allow track drag-and-drop onto the device.  Windows Media Player will NOT work on this.
