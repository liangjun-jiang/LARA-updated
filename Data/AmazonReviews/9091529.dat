<Title>Better than 
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>[...]it's exactly the same functionally and cosmetically as the Apple iPod Shuffle, except that there's an HP logo beneath the Apple logo on the back.  [...]  Your enjoyment of this player depends on how well you understand iTunes...if you know how to create playlists and such you'll find this quite a different listening experience.  One star was deducted for lack of display and EQ settings, but the focus is on simplicity, and the random nature of the unit doesnt really require a display anyway...but it would have been nice.  Overall its a pretty cool gadget with a better company's support system behind it.  Pick it up soon, as of this review HP and Apple have decided to part ways and once these are gone, they're gone.

<Content>I own a 20G HP ipod...well own is a relative term I think it has spent more time at Hp then with me.  I realize this is a different item, but I would like to warn everyone.  My original Ipod which I received Dec 2004 broke in March, and was sent back, due to it continually skipping through songs. I received another one from Hp which lasted until...November 2005.  That one just crapped out and showed me a file with an exclamation point that meant..the Hard drive had crapped out..so once again I sat on the phone with HP for hours doing what they asked me to before they would agree to service it.  So I again sent it back.  Well now on my third Ipod in 13 months and guess what???? It too is broken.  The click wheel wouldn't work, it froze on certain songs and the computer didn't recognize that it was plugged into it.  So after spending hours on the phone with HP for the third time, they offered another refurbished replacement.  After I continued to complain they told me there was nothing further to be done because none of the problems were related.  I did ask how that had any relevance considering these were three differenct ipods two of which they had sent me as replacements..they had no answer.  Only that if I had yet another problem, which I am confident I will..then they will try to offer some other trade.    And you can forget about getting an extended warranty they will only give you an extra 30 days from the time you get the new one.  Buyer Beware!!! I love my IPOD it's just unfortunate that I have had such a crappy time with its actual perfomance.

<Content>HP put me through the ringer on this one.  The did send me a replacement but it didn't work either.  They kept us on the support line for hours.  Faxing, shipping, etc etc. Then wouldn't refund the $80.  It was a Christmas present for my son for God's sake.  Unbelievable company.  It never worked from the get go.  I will never buy an HP product again.    I don't even want to give it one star.  NO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!
