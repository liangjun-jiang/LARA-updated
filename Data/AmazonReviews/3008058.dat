<Title>Forget the negative reviews.  This thing is brilliant
<Date>Wed Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay, first of all let me say I am a VERY critical first class gadget whore.  And this thing is amazing.  The screen resolution is not amazing...but honestly, if you are watching a well encoded Divx or Xvid file you will not notice at all!  The battery life is very good...just over four hours for me.  Using it in hard drive mode could not be easier.  If you download tv shows from the internet ....or want to copy your DVDs over....it works amazingly easily and looks great.  The 7" screen is a completely different experience from anything you've seen before in portable media players.  The device is not pocket sized...but it actually is surprisingly small and handy.  It won't fit in your pocket...but, when in it's case, it is just slightly larger and heavier than a paper back book (though MUCH thinner).  My ONLY complaint about this device is the docking device to plug it into the TV.  There is no place to plug in an RF cable...so if you are on the road plugging it into a TV involves either a DVD or VCR.....or an RF modulator AND a System Switcher...which sort of defeats the purpose of it's portability.  But that is a relatively small complaint considering.   I LOVE THIS THING>...for $300...it's a steal.  Macros

<Content>I use this product extensively throughout the day for music, news and movies.  I record movies at night, the business news before I awake and music from my satellite provider.  I listen to satellite radio in my car and watch bloomberg news with my morning coffee at work.  Then, in the evening, I have additional entertainment options with my menu of videos.  I have also had the pleasure of sharing vacation photos on the big screen television.  This last feature is possible because of the docking station that totally integrates this DVR with the satellite and TV.  The included remote essentially controls all actions!

<Title>***  AWESOME  ***
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item for myself with my Christmas bonus.  My brother turned me on to Archos a while ago.  He bought his wife a unit that just displays pics and plays music.  While exploring their site I came across the AV700 and realized that this was the one for me!!  Since it's more costly, I've waited til now to purchase - it was soooo worth the wait!!  I love this thing!!  I've downloaded movies, music, pics and also DVR'd TV shows & movies.  I use mine mostly to watch stuff and you can easily view your downloads or DVR's on the screen.  The initial set-up of the different downloads (music, pics, movies, dvr) is not the best, takes a few times of going over the directions (which are minimal at best) to get the hang of it.  But once you've mastered them, it's very simple.  Also, it was great that it came with all the accessories needed.  My husband was so impressed with mine, that he had me go back online and order up one for him!!

<Title>AV700 Beats a Laptop or Portable DVD Player
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used a laptop and portible dvd player to view videos and prefer my AV700 to both hands down. The unit is about the size of a paperback book. It turns on in seconds. The screen in no different from the LCD on a laptop or dvd player. For convience, it is unmatched. On a Windows computer with XP, the unit is recognized as an extra hard drive making it easy to drag and drop video and music files. During playback of a movie, you can easily "mark" where you stop and the unit can return to that point when you it turn back on. I keep about 30 movies on it at any one time and still have room to spare. The unit works seamlessly with Amazon's video download service. When transferring a file, Windows will tell you if the file is not compatible with the unit and refer you to Windows Media Player, which will convert and download files for you. All in all, using this is a "no brainer". It's easily the best gift I've received in years.

<Title>nice player
<Date>Tue May 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had a very good experience with the playback on this player.  The sound quality goes down when you use headphones that adjust volume on the cable, so I would recommend using headphones that don't. Only issue I have is that the 700 uses a different size power cable than every other model and I could not find a replacement on the archos website (which isn't the easiest to navigate) and calling on the phone wasn't very effective either... I guess the company is geared to the advanced users, but geeks lose power cables too right?

<Title>What a great Device
<Date>Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I absolutely love my Archos AV700.  I used to own the Creative Portable media center, which is a huge pain compared to the archos.  synching video to this player is a piece of cake and takes 1/2 the time that creative does.  you can also record directly on to the device from your cable box, VCR or DVD player, which you cannot do with any of the other devices.  The picture is not as good quality, but for all of the benefits, it is well worth it.  The system runs like windows with folder type organization.  I highly recommend this device!!

<Content>The player holds alot of room. I started to put movies on the sound is pretty good.  The graphics slow up a little bit sometimes.  I wish it was a little bit more portable.  It's about time Archos came out with the games.  When are the games going to come out?  The gear for this player is expensive.

<Title>so far so good...
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought an archos about 5 years ago from Gateway and returned it in 2 days.  I was waiting for something like the AV700 that would actually work, unlike the first one I bought - which I bought predominantly for my digital photo collection.  The archos is well made, solid, and easy to use.  dragging wma and mp3 files was absolutely no problem and I transferred 7gb of digital photos without a problem.  HOWEVER....at least out of the box, I couldn't get my digital photos which had voice memos' to synchronize, nor could I get my .avi files from digital camera to go over.  In fact, I still can't figure out how to copy and transform a video whether from email, digital camera, or a DVD burned from a camcorder tape on a Philips DVD recorder.   A call to ARchos didn't help a bit.  There have been some criticisms of their tech support; i've emailed twice this week with no response; at least the phone tech answered.  I've tried some things, upgraded some apps and will call again, but unlike the seamless .jpg and .wma transfers, the video is elusive.  I would probably buy this again, but I would definitely by the 100GB version, and will withold the final 2 stars of my rating until I see if I can ever get video to work. joe

<Title>This thing sucks.
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife bought one of these.  First the good: it performs all of the tasks required moderately well.    The bad:  This thing is really expensive.  This is almost as much as a laptop, and more than most used laptops with a dvd player.  Also, for the cost of this, you could buy a dvd recorder and a portable dvd player and not worry about transferring anything.  The biggest drawback is that you are at the mercy of your cable/sat. to put something worth recording on.  Again, you can record rented dvds, but with a portable dvd player you would still rent and take it with you.  This device has compatibility issues with Directv branded receivers.  If you have other digital gadgets like an ipod or a laptop, this thing couldn't be a bigger waste of money.  Please consider Amazon's great deals on DVD players.

<Title>Maybe for movies, not for photo collection
<Date>Mon Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yes, it is a fine bit of engineering, with smart feel and very fast to write and transfer, and fairly intuitive.   My intention was to have it a storage space for all my digital photos so I can drag them around and show to family and friends. Well, it is good ONLY if your digital photos are of the quality produced by a cell-phone in 2003. The problem is the screen: pixellated, cheap-looking, and while it is OK for moving pictures (esp. high-contrast ones that they have running on it in shops as a demo), any photo upwards from 50k in size will look cheapened. You can plug it into TV and the impression is better then, but who wants to do that?   If you think it will be anywhere approaching a portable DVD player or a laptop screen, forget about it.   The upside of photo-viewing is that you can zoom in again and again and the quality will not suffer on the screen, because it is the reproduction, not the actual resolution that is letting you down.  I will also use it as an MP3 player for my travels.   Battery life is poor unless you are not using that screen, which is not surprising: 7 inches will eat any battery pretty quick.  I would not recommend it for any other use apart from the intended one: viewing films.

<Title>Archos AV700 DVR
<Date>Fri May 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Excellent device for capturing video,music,photos, etc.  Records programs easily from a television, VCR, & satellight receiver. The included conversion program allows one to convert previously recorded programs for play within the AV700.   AV700 is also compatable with ULEADS Video Studio 10plus, recording program.  Ulead has a batch converter, to gather programs , convert them transfer for viewing to to the AV700 (using the widows WMA format).  LIke wise Nero's mpeg4 (nero digital) is not compatable with the AV700.  The AV700 is easy to use, excellent visual clarity and the external speakers are mediocre (but useful if headphones not plugged in).    Yahoo's offered TV listings work great with the AV700 for presetting video recordings automatically!  I have seen several other competitors 4" viewing screens, which in my opinion are way to small for viewing.  The AV700 screen is a nice size for viewing without eye strain.   The games offered are just ok.  I recommend this device.

<Title>Fantastic for people that travel alot
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I travel back and forth to South America quite a bit and purchased the Archos to help me pass the flight time.   Since I travel in economy class I have a hard time opening the screen on my laptop, plus the battery life is very short.    This unit is small enough to watch in the tight confines of an economy flight seat.  Battery time is actually quite good.   I get about 4-5 hours from the unit.   The variations depends on if I am watching movies or pre-recorded shows from my TIVO.   The unit seems to eat up more battery as I am forwarding through the commercials from the pre-recorded shows, which of course is not necessary with movies.     The screen is vibrant and easy on the eyes, especially when watching it for 4-5 hours like I do.     TV programs are easily transferred from TIVO to the unit, however, the recording time is real-time.   In other words it takes 30 minutes to transfer a 30 minute show.   You can also transfer movies ripped into an .avi format to the unit, which I often do.     I love this thing!!!!      In comparing this to the IPod video, this unit is much better for several reasons:  Battery life is longer (The IPod Video only gets a couple of hours when watching video), file format is easier to accomodate and it is great not having to convert videos to the Apple mpeg format, and the screen is much bigger.

<Content>I am a flight attendant and for years I saw my international passengers using this device. I kept looking at all the stores in the US and could not find it. I bought mine the first month they were out here and LOVE it!!  I copy my DVD's from Netflix the minute I get them, send them back and then watch them at my leisure. I record all the tv shows that I miss while I am out of the country, and watch them while I am in hotels around the world.  And, who needs an IPOD? I have all my favorite songs, radio programs and podcasts all in one convient place!  I really like the simplicity of using Media Player to coordinate all my podcasts and music downloads too!  I can usually watch videos for 4-5 hours before recharging and I am impressed with the ease of the recharger. With the optional adapter plugs you can buy for the unit, you can use it anywhere in the world without having to use a converter.  It is so popular at my house, that I came online today to buy one for my husband too!

<Content>I download movies and mp3 to take with me when I travel. I also load my audio books onto it. To load a video  (avi) you use the sync tab on your window's media player. I also use a neat program called Pocket DVD wizard which can change my video to Archos compatible and I can drag and drop them into my video file. I like the bookmark feature for my audio books.
