<Content>Pros- -amazing battery life, seldom needs recharging. -overall design is attractive, innovative, sleek, smooth, slides in and out of my jeans easily, small enough to not even notice. -suprisingly great sound from the speaker, you wont believe how loud this ultra thin speaker can get!  RARELY ever distorts. I use it in the bathroom in the moring, in the kitchen when cooking, bring it with me when I travel, I can tote it from room to room, INCREDIBLY convenient and looks great. -its not another i-pod like EVERYONE has. -GREAT interface/screen -love the photo options, screen savers -FM RADIO!!!! this is great since the gym now uses radio signals for their tv's. -Alarm clock, it wakes me up big time, looks great when im in a hotel with the clock display and speakers open. -Headphones.... best I've ever used, very little soound pollution to others, very comfortable rubber ear-inserts, I actualy forget I wear them as compared to other headphones that after wearing them for a bit your ears would start to hurt.  I'm now hearing things in my music that I had never been able to hear before. OH, and the headphone cords are just a few inches longer than a normal pair (which is great for me since I like to tuck the cords thru my shirt and into my pants pocket, and Im taller).  CONS- I dont love the software included, thats my one major beef.  I cant play a song that's on my player to remind me weather I wanted to keep it on there or not. There are a few other weird software features that I wish it had. But it works fine.... could be eaiser.  I wish it had more screen savers or ways to download them.  I'd rather have spent more and gotten this with a video option but its not yet available.  Accesories- not many yet available, but I've actualy never needed any.  
<Overall>5
