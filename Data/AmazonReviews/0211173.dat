<Title>Warranty Alert
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product comes with 90 day warranty and 1 year limited warranty. If you want a copy of the warranty, it's on the installation disc. My player quit functioning after about 4 months. The limited warranty is practically worthless. Creative charges your credit card if you want to talk with customer service after 90 days. E-mail support is free. They require the model #, which is not printed on the product or on the documentation. The model # is on their website, but Creative makes it difficult to obtain support. Creative sends form email instructing you to update the firmware. Before updating firmware you must back-up your music. The firmware update also removes the FM recording feature. It did not fix my player. If you return product for warranty service, Creative charges a fee for diagnosis and handling plus any added labor costs to fix the player. Bottom line, if your player breaks down after 90 days, it is probably not worth the time and money to obtain warranty service. I will not buy another product from Creative Labs. Try a quality brand.

<Title>Zen Nano Plus:  A Very Decent MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For a purchase price of slightly less than $[...], the Zen Nano Plus offers some really nice features--assuming of course that 1 GB storage is ample for your needs.  The unit comes with a case and clip, suitable for either belt-attachment or to the included arm-band, headphones, adequate software, and an AAA battery.  The FM digital tuner is really awesome in its ability to accurately scan for local stations, lock them in with presets, allow for recording capability, and to provide incredibly clean, excellent sound from low to high frequencies.  Battery life varies, depending upon settings and use, and I don't regret investing in a couple of rechargeable NiMH 1.2 v 1000 mAh batteries instead.  The unit is well-built, the control buttons and scroller/select are well-placed, menu navigation easy, although the display numerics and icons might require reading glasses for some.  Other features & applications are very good, and this unit is significantly better than most MP3 players in its price range.
