<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again.  As a 40 gig iPod owner, I love the shuffle.  Its the go anywhere, do almost anything, store more than music mp3 player. Battery life is great, storage capacity is more than the stated 120 songs, and the sound is INCREDIBLE! ...as is the price.  I used it while excercising and there were no skips.  Easily fits into your pocket and weighs less than a set of keys! The shuffle will fit perfectly into your busy lifestyle. P.S. The required installation software can be a bit of a problem if you already have iTunes on your computer.

<Title>A non-iPod-user's review
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a compact, flash-based mp3 player, the shuffle fills a niche in the market.  Apple's greatest contribution to the mp3 player market was the aesthetics of their players: love it or hate it, you have to admit that the iPod looks unique, and most people (like me) will go as far as saying it looks pretty good.  Before everyone and their neighbor's dog owned one, you could pull out an iPod and make the room stop.  The shuffle continues this tradition.  Apple's sleek, simple design hides a fairly powerful little flash-based player.  It's tiny (although not the smallest player on the market, despite what their ad people may say), feather-light and on the whole, very trendy looking.  The 512 memory is just about the right size for what I suspect is the primary target market for these players: people looking for a small, durable alternative to their iPod for short trips, work-outs, etc.  Other pros:  -Simple, intuitive control interface  -Easy to interface with pretty much any machine  -iPod users can use all their .AAC format music  -No, seriously, this thing weighs next to nothing.  Cons:  -No external LCD.  Apple had to sacrifice SOMEthing to make this product as small and lightweight as it is, and the LCD screen is the first of these things.  While not a problem for those intimately familiar with their music collection or those not picky about what they listen to, many users will definitely not appreciate the inability to easily navigate the songs contained on the player.  -Terrible battery life.  Much like the iPod compared to its competitors (e.g. the Zen Touch), the Shuffle has less than 2/3 the average battery life of comparable features (meaning with no LCD screens).  Again, Apple had to sacrifice something in order to make the product as lightweight and small as it is, and this shouldn't be a problem for the majority of users, as the shuffle seems to be geared toward short trips.  -Like the iPod, you must interface the Shuffle with iTunes.  Now before the pro-iPod army comes and kills me, let me explain: I have nothing against iTunes, it's a great program (as evidenced by Microsoft blatantly copying it with Media Player 10), but I personally despise being forced to use any one application with my hardware.  If Apple had made the Shuffle drag'n'drop compatible, it would have been a much better purchase.

<Title>Sexy, small,  white iPod Shuffle - I like
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own an iPod.  I never felt like I need all the storage.  I would be fine with 120 songs, therefore I ordered my iPod shuffle as soon as it came out.  When I got the package at home, I was in love.  Even the packaging is sweet. I loved the smell of the packaging, the sexy flirty display in the box and ultimately the size.  But wait, how about the sound and the music...  I Love it.  I synced my iPod with iTunes (I only have 40 songs) and listened to it in shuffle mode and WOW... the sound is amazing.  I have found the end of my portable music player search.  Not only does it sound great but its a head turner.  Everywhere I go, people want to touch it, feel it, listen to it.  Stay away!!!  I have to fight them off with a stick.  Now, I walk the streets of New York, shuffled...  Now I drive Shuffled, heck, I even go to the toilet... shuffled.  I'm all shuffled up.  Lets face it, you add songs to your playlist that you love, not bad songs but great songs, and the shuffle feature is awesome.  Its like it picks the perfect songs to follow... Its a virtual dj...  Now, stay away, cause this shuffle is mine.  Till death or technical issues, do us apart.  Yahhhh!!!

<Title>uhhhhhhhh, NO!
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a confessed musicaholic. I could sit and download for hours. But, why would anyone buy this flash memory player when there are other ones with more features AND a display? I will stick to my Iriver any day. The inline recording feature that it has is remarkable. It really is cd quality. Not that I want to rip off the music industry, but with this feature you can record an album, for instance, off of AOL for nothing. It really is cd quality when you record like this. This IPod can't do that. I think the hard drive Ipod is a brilliant idea, and maybe someday I will get one. But for the money, you can buy another flash memory MP3 player, with a display, with a radio, with voice recording (some may find that useful, I don't) and the inline recording. And they look better. Whats with the boring white? Naah I'm not sold on this.

<Title>Don't be taken in
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content> Don't believe the Apple hype or the ranting by Apple disciples. Comparably-priced players have a ton more features - a display, FM-tuner (great for the gym), voice recorder, replaceable battery, folders to organize tracks on the player, equalizers, shuffle functions, great ease of use, and on and on... And this player is plagued by the common Ipod problem - when the battery dies the player becomes a paperweight. Steve Jobs once said that the only thing flash players are good for are to sit unused in the back of drawers. Well, his company has made one that will fulfill that prophecy.

<Title>Deserves the 5 star rating, reviewing it for what it is
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>No, it doesn't have a display. No, you couldn't get at 512 MB player with a display for $99. The Shuffle breaks new ground in flash memory players not only because it is an equisite player (you gotta hold one in your hand and be baffled at the big sound coming out of such a small piece of plastic), but because of what iTunes has done with it. The Autofill function is awesome, and perfect for what the Shuffle is. I didn't want to take my 40 Gig to the gym for fear of dropping it... the shuffle is fantastic for that. Plus, I can listen to audible books on it and quickly get to them by just starting at the beginning in non-shuffle mode.  This really is just a phenomenal product, and I haven't had any complaints... on the contrary, I'm surprised at everything that I can make it do without the screen. Seriously, I don't miss the screen with this thing. You won't either.  Small, light, inexpensive, impressive performance. What's not to like?

<Content>This is my FIRST time buying an Apple product.  Mainly because they are waaay too expensive.  But the Shuffle is great.  I use it mainly at the gym, or out running.  My Zen Xtra is way to big while lifting weights.  With this puppy, I don't feel like I'm carrying around a tape player that weighs like a brick.    I don't recommend if you're a hardcore music listener.  Casual music listeners/runners/weight lifters will love this.

<Content>This product is not revolutionary by any means as some people would have you believe. It's all hype. There simply are better flash based mp3 players that are equally as small. Have a display, great battery life, shuffle function, fm radio, voice recording, excellent sound quality, and look pretty, and have more codec support, but don't come with all the hype. Creative Muvo TX fm is priced similarly, small, and is much better in my opinion, and also prettier.Don't follow the sheep.

<Title>People Just Don't Get It!
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just because the Shuffle doesn't tailor to your standards doesn't mean it's going to be a failure. The Shuffle is the ideal mp3 player for the active user. When I go to the gym with my iPod mini, I still notice the weight in my pocket and the harddrive is subject to damage when I move. Also I never look at the screen. This is why I got the Shuffle. I don't need a screen BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW WHAT SONGS ARE IN MY MP3 PLAYER! And for 100 bucks you really can't go wrong.  Only Apple could pull off an idea of making the Shuffle's most obvious "weakness" (no screen) and turn it into it's main feature (Life is Random).

<Content>The shuffle works nicely.  Itune is not user friendly.  The battery dies after occasionl to moderate use for a little over 1 year.  What kind of battery do they put in the shuffle.  Normal Rechargeable battery last way longer than that, at least 2 to 3 years minimum.  For a great company and an expensive product, they sure know how to short-change the customer.  Horrible.  Yeah, I'm done with Apple.  That is why monopoly is not good for any company or business.

<Content>It should be 4 1/2 stars but I will give it the benefit of a doubt. I love it.  It is intuitive, very thoughtful and simply designed much like an Apple computer.  But sometimes it would be nice to have playlists or a viewer. 512 MB is about the maximum I would down load into one without the ability to quickly find what you want to hear. I have purchased 2 refurbished Shuffles with no problems for the last 2 years. Just remember to disconnect it the way the instructions tell you to.

<Title>A Poor Introduction to Apple Products
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's not much more to be said about this product.  It does what it advertises.  And with the newest iTunes, Windows support is better and not as completely annoying to install compared to a year ago.  But this cheap player doesn't really have much to offer.  You are locked into using iTunes to "organize your media" which is very annoying for Windows folks.  I guess this is "personal preference" as most people are willing to jump on the iTunes bandwagon.  Other than the software annoyances, the player itself really doesn't impress.  Battery life isn't that impressive compared to most other flash players.  From what I hear, the battery also dies within 1-2 years AND its not user-replaceable.  The biggest problem for most people is that there is no navigational display because Apple wanted to save money on manufacturing.  That's inexcusable.  The headphones that come with it are terrible and should be replaced immediately with something more comfortable/better sounding.    The manual and website are confusing even for the technologically inclined.  The website is terribly managed and you have to walk through several screens before getting to wherever you want to go if you're looking for technical support.  Don't expect to get much help there.  All-in-all, if you want to "look cool" and do the ipod thing, this isn't the player for you.  You probably will want an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EP4TWQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-4646271-3591145">iPod Nano</a> instead.  If you're a Windows user and you want a good, cheap mp3 player, save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this one.  As cheap as it is, its not worth it.  iAudio makes some good cheap players that act as a USB Mass Storage device instead of using proprietary software, but you can also sync it with whatever as well.  Frankly, I don't know who this player appeals to.

<Content>The iPod Shuffle is really a pretty good value for $99. It is small, and to the point. You'll want this if you use the Apple iTunes Music store. If you don't, or aren't interested in trying it out, or are commited to a *shiver* Microsoft Windows Media store, then maybe look at other stuff too.   If you do like iTunes, however, the Shuffle is small enough to bring anywhere, and the added capability of using it as a 'jump drive' is very convenient.

<Title>sold out!!!!!
<Date>Tue Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in the Apple Store on the first day of sales for the Ipod Shuffle.  I would say they were sold out in 5 minutes or less. Apple should have manufactured more of these before their release.  The Apple store I went to had maybe 50-80 Ipod Shuffles for sale. If you thought about the purchase for more than a 30 seconds --you most likely lost out. Most of the purchasers were previous Ipod owners who wanted something smaller/cheaper/more durable. A regular consumer had very little chance of getting an Ipod Shuffle. At least with the Ipod Mini they were in stores for the first few weeks.  The day wasn't a total loss however.  I purchased a Mac Mini with the 512mb memory upgrade which I am very happy about.   The employees did a great job of handling the 200+ crowd. After the first 1/2 hour it calmed down greatly.  Nice store + knowledgeable salespeople.

<Content>I understand Apple is trying to set a "random" list revolution with the Shuffle, and I've purchased one, but I realize there are many times I wish to be able to see how much further to go forward to play what I want.  I can't memorize a 100 song playlist.    I don't know where Apple is going with this, I'm going to return my Shuffle for a Sandisk 512, which is now lower in price and has a screen.  I don't know where Apple is going with this...I wouldn't buy a car without essential gauges and I'm certain you will find it cumbersome at times with the Shuffle.  I don't recommend this product.  I'm sure it has great margins for Apple though.  I need the screen, and you will find you will too.

<Content>I say that this mp3 is great, but only for some things.  I already have a 4th generation and ipod mini, but i bang them around a lot, so when i heard about this new one, i pounced on it.  People can complain about it not having a screen or a radio, but who cares, i never use the radios that i do have.  And as to it not having a screen, i know what songs i am putting on it, and i am only using it to practice for basketball with.  So to sum it all up, get this if you have a larger player, and want a smaller one that you can bang around more.   But if this is your first mp3, i would pass and get a different one.  Also the battery life is very good, i can easilly get about 18 hours out of it.  Overall great player!!

<Title>Superb replacement flash player and complement to iPod
<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the iPod Shuffle as a replacement to my flash player (256MB).  I have a 3rd gen iPod and use a flash player when jogging and at the gym, so my comments are from that perspective.  The lack of a display is not an issue for me, due to my usage of the player.  Prior to receiving and using the Shuffle, I was a bit concerned about the limited ability to navigate to different songs on the Shuffle and the shuffle aspect of the player.  However, after actually using it, I am sold on the shuffle aspect of the player.  Initially, I allowed iTunes to load the Shuffle randomly from my music library; but found that there are a lot of songs that I don't care to listen to when exercising.  So, I started loading songs using the 'drag-and-drop' method.  Once loaded, I switch the Shuffle to play random and I'm good to go !!  I'm only listening to songs I chose to begin with, so random is nice.  Although, playlists are nice; it is extra work to create them.  I left the player on all day yesterday to test the battery life and the battery charge light was still green after 8 hours.  This is the point at which my old flash player (powered by two rechargeable alkaline AA cells) would need a fresh pair of batteries.  As for the sound quality, it's excellent.  Just as good as my 3rd gen iPod and old flash player.  My only complaint about the design is that there is no 'reject' button.  Although the Shuffle has a 'next song' button, I can see the utility of a reject button in addition to the next song button that would mark the song for removal on the next sync with iTunes.  This would make removing songs that I did not want on the Shuffle easier and 'refreshing' it with new music from time-to-time easier.

<Content>This is a really awesome player.  Although it was a bit confusing at first, the iTunes iPod import software was very easy to use.  Comes with a full charge so you don't need to wait 4 hours to use it when you get it.  Extremely tiny!  it's even tinier than the ones in the pictures on the web.  I would say this is a little more than 2 inches tall.  Lanyard cap is very secure.  Left earbud doesn't fit very well, but still sounds great.    Overall, this thing is great.  The no screen is not a problem because unless you have thousands of songs, you should know all your song's titles.  Also, the shuffle feature is great.  It's full of surprises.  You never know what will come next.    A++ player.  This will set the benchmark for all over flash players to come.

<Content>Why do people buy bad products like the Shuffle and then try to justify their purchase with dumb reasons? I like to get my money's worth when I buy things, and to me a portable music player that has no display so you can't even skip to the song you want, is pretty close to worthless. I recommend the Sandisk 512 or 1GB MP3 players, or heck, ANY other Mp3 player that has a DISPLAY, as a better alternative.

<Content>I've had it for 2 weeks now and I love the shuffle.  Seems like most of it's critics are people that don't own it.  This is my first apple product.  The battery life is awesome.  You get 12 hours and most importantly, it's rechargable so you never have to buy AAA or AA batteries.  If you are the type of person that sits with your MP3 player to pick out each song, this is NOT for you.  If you are a person that likes MP3s as background music to other activities, then this is a GREAT low cost solution.  In some ways, it is actually superior to the original iPod.  It's got a better battery life, is smaller and is lighter.  Listen to people that have one, not other people that just seem to hate apple.

<Title>a nice intro to the world of iPod
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought one of these for my mom-ever since she saw my blue iPod mini, she's wanted an MP3 player that can hold a lot of music but is small enough for her to workout with.  So when I saw the shuffle at a store, I figured she'd want one. I was right, she did want one.  It looks really cool, it is about the size of your thumb and all.  I had to help with it as Mom works and all and is unfamiliar with MP3 players.  It has a few subtle differences from my mini, including its lack of display.  We had to get used to the Autofill option, that was something that did not pop up when I was learning how to use my mini.  One of the other major snags is that Media Player would not let my mom export her songs into iTunes-she has to redo her music library, which is a pain.  She does like the Shuffle, but I get the vibe that it will only have a constant use until Mom can get the necessary funds to get the green mini.  Overall, it was okay, but I really do like my mini iPod better, and so do my parents.  It was a good starting point, however, and excellent introduction to MP3 players for my parents.  My parents are not computer illiterate, they just haven't caught on to the MP3 player movement yet-they prefer playing Legends of Camelot, which was the other reason my mom likes the Shuffle-it charges while she plays Camelot.  I give it four stars because it is fairly easy to use, but not as nice as its bigger counterparts.

<Content>After having my friends whine on AOL and chats about how cool their new iPods  were they got around X-Mas,I felt cheated. I am a lover of MD and MP3CD. An iPod was not an option do to price and well...I saw this coming I guess. So patiently I ignored those Apple comercials with  U2 and dancers in black shadows.  And rant I did about how iPod doesn't have this or that my MD has or iTunes this and iTunes that for two years! Now finally with this lower price and average storage for my taste,I can say to my friends out there "look what I got!"  It's so tiny. My stick of gum looked big. But it's really slick to use. I put nearly a day and a half MP3's and simular files together for my meditation rutines,and it played for almost a day! I do wish it had more power. iPods lack this feature. They should look into 56 and 72 hour playback like HI-MD then I'd rave more. Sadly too my Realmedia files were useless too! Made me a little nervous,but it still plays most formats. For the price you can get two,but well..iPod is that price isn't it? I'm enjoying using this player it's cute. Apple just look into the battery issue and make peace with Real,that issue is just pitiful.

<Title>PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the worst and I mean WORST Apple product I have ever used! I bought one with my money because I was replacing my dead 3rd Generation iPod. I liked how small it was, and since I only needed 512 MB, it was a good buy for $99 in May 2006. But then only a month later, I was listening to it on the bus and it died suddenly. It wouldn't turn on, but Apple gave me a new shuffle. Once again it died and it wouldn't come back to life. I got a pink nano for Christmas and that is way better than this piece of trash. I don't reccommend this iPod to anyone!

<Title>This iPod is overrated.
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPods are a great line of music players, and I respect that. Sadly though, I was anything but impressed with this iPod. Apple tries to trick people saying "Oh yeah, random is the new order." Anybody who's smart knows that they just said that [...] as an excuse for no display. This would be a great flash-based MP3 player if only they had a display! It's so annoying when you put an album on your iPod, find out about a song you like and then want to know who does it. Then you look down and say "Oh, silly me. I forgot! I don't have display! But that's alright...random is the new order!" Even the new iPod shuffles don't have displays. The iPod shuffle though, is a pretty good player overall. The battery life is decent and the iTunes software is incredibly easy to use. The ear buds have very good quality, and the unit itself is very easy to use. It doesn't need batteries either, but this can also be a con, because it means once your lithium-ion battery dies, then you have to either buy a new iPod or pay [...] to replace it! A radio would have been nice, along with a voice recorder and equalizers. 2 of my family members have Scandisk Sansa M230s that have these features and cost only [...]. The iPod is a great player, but consider other brands as well. Also, I filled this thing up in an hour (not kidding). I get bored of music pretty quickly, and this thing can only hold 12 albums. If I could go back now, I would definitely go for a 30 GB video.

<Content>I have had my shuffle for two years now and have dropped it a thousand times. it still is running. It may not be the ipod video, but it does rock. My songs fit on it and i still have room for more.

<Title>does what it says
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It does exactly what it says it does (thus 5 stars) but IMO get a Nano instead as it's only slightly more expensive, has many more features yet still gives you the same shuffle feature.  This is a great answer for your parents or grandparents though who want to listen to music while they take their morning jog or walk though because it really is easy to use.

<Title>Ka-Put!
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this two Christmas's ago.  Even though iTunes can be temperamental I loved having this! I primarily used it when I went to work out.  One day, I'm at the gym and I turned it off for a couple minutes to talk to someone.  I go to turn it back on and two lights just flash back and forth.  Then iTunes doesn't even recognize it! It says it needs to be restored.  So I clicked "restore" and then it says it's unable to restore due to an "unknown error."  I look into sending it to Apple to get it fixed but it would cost as much to buy a new one as it would to get it fixed!  I just couldn't believe it was go kaput just like that.  Not to mention Apple's has the worst navigation on it's website.. you have to click through seven pages just to get a simple question answered!

<Title>defective product
<Date>Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was shipped to my 10 year old granddaughter and the charger only held a charge for under 1 month.  Please replace the charger.  It was her birthday present and she is upset.  I don't blame her.
