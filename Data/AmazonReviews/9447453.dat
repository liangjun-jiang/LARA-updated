<Title>Do NOT buy this product!
<Date>Thu Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Creative Labs Nomad II MP3 player. Do not buy this product! I initially bought this unit because it had &quot;name&quot; &amp; several good reviews.  You can imagine my dissatisfaction when the actual product arrived &amp; did not live up to expectations. Ok, the first Nomad unit that I received was a total failure. Nothing worked. The rechargeable batteries could not be recharged, the &quot;docking station&quot; was &quot;FUBAR,&quot; and the player simply did not work. OK. Trust the company.  Send the unit back &amp; get a new one. Did that. Got a new unit. Guess what? Worked for four hours &amp; then stopped, shut down, quit, for no identifiable reason. Frustration. Conclusion. Do not buy this product. For whatever reason, design, quality control, whatever, this product is FUBAR.  It is totally unreliable! Do not buy it! Do not waste your money!

<Content>Player is great and sounds pretty good with a different set of headphones. I also like the docking station. The software is easy  to use and performs all required functions. I like the ergonomic arrangement of the controls and the overall size. I do not like the cheezy vinyl case that comes with it.  It has no openings to access controls, no belt clip, and closing the flap requires disconnection of the headset. Recommendations for Creative Labs: Get a case that can be worn and that allows access to controls (in leather). Get a better headset.

<Title>Sweet MP3 player!
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>Since the day that I got my Rio 500 stolen, I was on the internet looking for new MP3 players.  I came across the Nomad, and I was stuck on it right away.  This is because it comes with a docking port that I hooked up to the USB port on my computer.  While the batts are charging, you can upload/download sounds to and from the Nomad.  This is very easy and fast for me, ..., because I like to download music at the last minute ... .   By the way, the download/upload time is fast!<p>Another thing that I liked about it is that it came with a voice recorder and an FM radio with 32 presets.... . ... .<p>Another attraction to the Nomad is the sleek looking style and color.  One thing that can get annoying is that the buttons are on the sides, but I don't think that that is a problem, since the button locations are easy to remember.<p>... .<p>         MY ADVICE TO U:  BUY THE NOMAD, IT ROCKS!

<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I spent some time doing some research before I decided on buying this product. For the money, features and quality from the reviews that I read, this was it! I'm with USAF in Saudi serving my country, I keep myself occupied by skating and bike riding and always do it with music. Carrying a CD player or tape player is always too bulky.  I had to have my wife order the MP3 from England, have Amazon ship it to New York so her sister could send it to her and in turn she would mail it to me here in Saudi....it finally got here (2-1/2 wks)and so far so good. I was very, very impressed with the size, loading the software was a breeze and getting the files to download to the player was even easier, great sound, enough base for me and plenty of feature.  We get three stations here and no problems at all, crisp clear. I would recommend this to any one interested in getting a good value for money MP3...two things, the headphones are very nice, but the sound they offer are worst then a $5.00 headphones, the carrying case is a joke and definetly needs a belt clip, either on the case or the player itself, I put it in some glue from the inside got on the buttons, so they were sticky for awhile. Big plus....docking station with baterry charger, be careful not to force it when putting the player into the charger. It uses Flash Memory, not Smart Media like it's advertised...

<Title>Ideal
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>There is little to complain about.  Being a college student who is always on the move, I couldn't have asked for a better purchase than the Nomad II MG.  Just about all the specs have been mentioned already at one point or another, and they're clearly quality.  The two things that make this player stand out are the docking port, which recharges batteries (great money saver), and the taken-for-granted fact that with the included software you can rip straight from CDs to the device with no intermediate step.  The equalizer is as effective as the one on a PC MP3 player, and the style can't be beat.  The lousy included headphones can be overlooked; come on, if you're buying an MP3 player, you're an avid enough music fan to already own a quality pair of headphones.

<Title>What can i say, But It
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>So I broke down, and decided to spend some money on something i thought i would use. I never realized how much! Walking a mile to work each day used to take for what seemed forever, and now it's nothing. I always knew what music could do, but never realized how easy mp3 music could be.  You really can't go wrong with this player. I was leary of users commenting on bad radio reception (i'm in the new york area too), but this wasn't the case. The head phones (with my long hair) are perfect, and make the player easy to throw in my pocket.  With a 128 mb card in addition to the 64 mb internal, i can walk for miles or take a 4 hour plane ride before hearing the same song twice.  The recording feature is handy, and is also fairly good quality. The technology is beautiful.<br> Good job creative labs, you guys rock.

<Title>Good for the casual user, but not the serious music listener
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>According to many reviews, the Nomad II MG blows away all other portable MP3 players.  Sure, I'll buy that.  But compared to MP3 playback on my home computer, it sounds terrible.  It has a low frequency rumble that drowns out any quiet moments, even in high bitrate, LAME-encoded MP3s.  A friend of mine with the same model has confirmed this.  Furthermore, the sound reproduction seems to be a bit &quot;thinner&quot; than what I get with my home computer, even when using aftermarket, digital reference headphones.  (The headphones they provide are TERRIBLE.)  The interface on the Nomad is probably the clunkiest and most counterintuitive I've ever seen.  It's hard to pick the unit up without pressing a button (they're on the sides).  I've already accidentally deleted a song, and so has my girlfriend.  The included software is extremely unstable (under Win98).  I've had it crash many times just browsing available MP3s, and others have complained of this as well.  The software should simply be a conduit to the device, but the Creative people have tried to make it do too much, and they've made it very user unfriendly and filled it with bugs in the process.<p>I suppose the Nomad is decent for use during exercise or on the train, but if you consider yourself a semi-audiophile I recommend you do not buy this product.  Wait until the technology matures.  Most studies find that near CD-quality is about 256kbps.  The Nomad will only hold 30 minutes of music at this rate, and will reproduce it with distortion, all in a confusing little package.  I don't think that's worth [the price]; do you?

They are just jealous about this product. Maybe they don't even have a mp3player at all. or else they are still using 286 computers.. All most every sentence they write about &quot;nomad2ma sucks&quot;  is all wrong! Maybe they are spies from other mp3player  companies.

<Title>Trouble In Nomad Land
<Date>Mon Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>First MP3 player RCA Lyra 2.  Hated it. Cheep quality and sounded funky.  Returned it.  Bought the Creative Nomad II MG.  Loved it, at first.  After one week the left channel started making strange noises.  Sent it back for repair as they assured a `new' unit would be sent to me as soon as the bad unit was received.  Creative had it for twenty-three days and returned the same unit with no explanation.  Still bad.  Called tech support, again.  They said they would send me a refurbished unit.  I wanted a new unit, as the one I had was only one week old when it started having problems.  They assured me `refurbished was better than new as it had been thoroughly tested.'  I fell for it and they drop shipped me a `refurbished' unit.  Disaster!  Scratched, did not work most of the time, locked up, and would not work at all with my 128MB media card.  Shipped everything back to Creative.....  Two months later and I still do not have a working unit.  I am not alone in this, as I have read other reviews on Amazon.com and other places.  Past thirty days so I can't get any money back.  Don't waste your money on this one until they have the bugs out.

<Title>Read the reviews: This thing [...stinks]
<Date>Sat Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Even if it didn't have chronic defects, the Nomad II MG is poorly designed. It comes with a protective leather carrying case that (1) can't be clipped or attached to anything and (2) doesn't provide an easy way to access any of the buttons on the unit. I ended up taking scissors to my leather case to make it slightly usable.<p>The buttons are located on the sides of the unit, where most people usually grab the unit. This results in frequent accidental button presses.<p>A couple of months after I got mine, I had the battery-clip problem that others have described. It was easily fixed with aluminum foil, but honestly, battery clips have been manucatured for decades without much problem; why is it such a recurring problem here?<p>Finally, after a little over a year of use, my docking station isn't acknowledging that the unit is docked. Therefore I can neither recharge the unit nor change the songs. The player is now useless to me. <p>From reading the other reviews, it's obvious the problems I've had with mine aren't an isolated case. So if you want a well-designed, well-manufactured, reliable mp3 player, DON'T buy the Creative Nomad II MG.

I purchased another one, and that one stopped working after about thirty days.  I would steer clear of this frail product.<p>(P.S.

<Title>The other reviewers aren't lying.  It stinks.
<Date>Tue Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I owned this player for about 5 months before its cradle stopped functioning.  There are two main faults with it that lead me to advise against this MP3 player.  <p>The first is its poor design.  All of the function buttons are located along its sides.  In order to hold the thing in any natural and comfortable way, your fingers have no other place to go except over the ultra-sensitive function buttons.  The slightest change in pressure will activate any button you are touching.  You'll find yourself accidently pausing, stopping or (worst of all) DELETING a song as it is playing very often unless you adopt the incredibly annoying practice of locking the buttons whenever you aren't using them.  But unlike some other players, this also locks the volume button- which means you'll spend lots of time unlocking-changing volume-locking-unlocking-skipping a song-locking.  Ugh.  <p>And why any designer would put a one-touch delete button right near your general function buttons is beyond me.  Make sure you memorize the layout of the buttons, because it absolutely stinks to delete a song when you just wanted to pause it and there is no second chances once you hit the extremely innocuous and sensitive delete button.<p>The second drawback of this player is how often it seems to break inexplicably.  My player is fine, but if I want to use it anymore I'll have to get a new cradle.  My cradle just decided to stop functioning one day.  It wasn't jostled or banged around, it wasn't dusty or submerged in soda- nothing.  I'd chock it up to bad luck if I hadn't gone on the web the next day and found dozens of unsolved breakages involving this player and its cradle.<p>This unit is slick looking and tiny, but not worth the trouble.  Look elsewhere for your MP3 player needs.  You can do much better.

<Title>Still working after 2 years
<Date>Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Felt I had to add this after reading all these reviews.  I got my II MG over 2 years ago and it still works fine.  Only problem is the display sometimes flickers on and off, but if you tap it it comes back.  I use this for the gym, travel and in my car.  I've dropped it numerous times and gotten it wet and it still works fine.  I have deleted songs accidently as others seem prone to as well, and agree button placement was poor.  Overall this player has been great, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Creative product.

<Title>This little thing works GREAT for me!!!
<Date>Wed Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've been using the Nomad 2 MG for over a year, now. When I first tried to install the software, I had some problems with the docking cradle not seeing the player. I was suspicious that it had problems with my computer hardware (motherboard, etc.). When I tried the installation on another computer, everything worked great! Shortly afterwards, I replaced that original system with a faster one and the software works fine, now, as a matter of fact, the files just FLY to the player!<p>I take that MP3 player with me on rough mountain bike rides, snowboarding, running, commutes to work, and (sometimes) while I'm at work. I've dropped it numerous times, but still I have had NOT ONE SINGLE PROBLEM with it, yet. My cradle has not broken- maybe I'm just lucky. For those who have none functioning cradles, there are updated drivers online for free- that could solve some of your problems. Admittedly, I have deleted a song or two, because of poor button placement, but if you're capable of learning, you're not going to do that more than a few times, at best.<p>For the price and the performance, this unit ROCKS! With its capabilities to expand to the 128MB card, that's a lot of songs! Get this MP3 player! It's totally worth it!

<Title>Really great device
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I purchased one of these about a week ago. I must say, I am very happy with it! The sound quality is tremendous, it has a great form-factor, and the manufacturer is very intelligent! I was having a few problems (the pause button wasn't working very well and there was a lot of background noise when the devise wasn't playing anything); but after a simple firmware update, these troubles (and more) were solved! There are, however, 3 problems (the reason why I didn't rate this 5 stars):<p>1) Like many others have said, the headphones are really, really bad. However, this wasn't a problem for me, because I already had better headphones that I was planning on using.<p>2) Again, like others have said, the case is really, really bad. Not only is the device mostly useless, but also the leather exterior and the vinyl interior are attached by very weak glue. By the time I realized this, it was too late - now some of my buttons are sticky. They really could have put more work into this aspect.<p>3) The 64MB of onboard RAM isn't very much. It is certainly better than the other Nomad II (which has no onboard RAM), but it could be more. I have had to purchase an extra 128MB SmartMedia card, which has solved this problem.<p>So, as you can see, none of these problems are monumentally bad, and all can be resolved. In reality, nothing listed above could merit not purchasing this MP3 player. Its size, functionality, and programming are well worth the [$], plus roughly [$] for the 128MB card. <p>P.S. On the subject of the NiMH battery (as mentioned previously), the device is programmed to detect how much of the battery has been charged when it is set into the cradle. Somehow Creative has found a way for a NiMH battery to act as a LiIon one. This definitely isn't a problem.

<Title>Second Best gift ever
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I received a Silver MG for my birthday, and this was the best present i've ever been given (Next to Allman Bros. Tix).  The unit is very chic and very light, and i've gotten used to the buttons being on the side quite nicely.  The headphones could be a lot better, and they pull my hair -- or my beard when i have them around my neck. But i've experienced no problems either with installation, downloading, ripping, or with the design of the hardware (some people mentioned that their battery contacts were faulty).  As far as remotes go, i know you can get them from the Creative website, but i've no qualms about reaching into my pocket to change modes or volume.  (The thing is only 18 inches away from your hand at any given moment -- WHY is a remote so important???)  The &quot;pleather&quot; case that came with it was worthless, as others have mentioned, and sometimes i have to try a couple of times before it succesfully docks-on, but overall, i love this unit.  Perhaps by the time mine was manufactured, the company had worked out some of the bugs mentioned in some earlier reviews.  I also got a 64MB memory card, which gives me plenty of tunes to carry to the gym or on my commute to work.  I don't think i'll ever need much more than that, nor will i need 32 preset FM stations (32!).<p>Gimme a better carrying case, perhaps with a belt clip and some holes for the buttons, and a better set of 'phones, and it's perfect for me.  FWIW, i'm a novice at MP3's, and this is the really the only unit i've ever really seen/used, but i've had nothing but success with it.

<Title>Outstanding!
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This Mp3 player exceeded my expectations!  The USB connection via the docking station, combined with the rechargable batteries (which can be replaced with non-rechargables when taken on long trips or if your rechargables die on you) blew my mind after having the Audiovox MP-1000 (serial port.. &lt;yawn&gt;)  I also purchased the Viking SmartMedia 64Mb card, which worked perfectly.  The FM tuner is okay, it can pick up all local stations in mono, but only one or two in constant stereo.  I believe the Creative website said it has something to do with the headphones (the headphones are part of the antenna).  The only other problem is the carrying case, which doesn't cover the lcd screen with anything (not even clear plastic), has no belt clip, and also covers all the buttons (meaning you have to take it out to change anything).  All in all however, I'm very pleased with this product; the bookmarking features, preset and user treble and bass settings, voice recording, and overall sound and look of this Mp3 player make it one of the best!  I'm very pleased with this product, and I think most people will love it too!!

I use mine primarily at the gym, where it's solid state, light weight, and small size are all much needed.  I keep it in a neoprene case, and it has withstood 5-10 drops with no problem.  The USB hookup provides VERY FAST transfers.  The only problem I have had with it is that sometimes it will lock up on a certain song if it does not like the filename or the tag (caused by length or foreign characters, like .  Battery time is very good (circa 5 hours on a 30 minute charge), and batteries can eventually be replaced with much higher capacity batts.  Definitely worth the (somewhat high) price!

<Title>Makes me very happy
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>My Nomad 2 MG arrived today. I've been using it all afternoon, and can report: I ordered the limited edition version of this product- the only difference is it has 256MB of internal memory (4.5 hours of mp3s) instead of 64MB. With the standard SmartMedia slot, that's expandable to 384MB, which is good. I'll list the great stuff and the bad stuff... The bad:<p>1. The instruction manual is limited: there're no installation instructions. I'm not a newcomer to installing hardware on my PC but it was tricky. The software installed easily. 2. the pouch is tacky and there're no holes for buttons, no clip, and the hole for the screen exposes it to damage. The wired remote solves the button problems, however... 3. ...but a 'mode' button is absent from the remote, meaning you have to work out the combination of buttons to change the mode, or take the player out of the pouch to change from, say, mp3s to FM radio. 4. Supplied headphones are crap: plasticy, low sound quality, huge<p>The good:<p>1. With good headphones (I have a mid-range Sony pair), the volume is so good you can deafen yourself with it. (That means it's loud, and many players suffer from being too quiet.) 2. My SE model stores just over 4 hours of music, and the batteries last for about 4 hours too. How nice. 3. The docking station, once installed, recharges the batteries automatically, and you can play music while it's charging. It's also small and light, and coming on holiday with me this summer. 4. recordable FM radio! 5. 4 hours of (fairly good) voice recording! 6. Unlike the Creative Jukebox, it's not the size of a brick and you can run with it without skipping. No pun. 7. It looks better than any other mp3 player, and it's literally the size of a deck of cards.<p>It does support WMA but in my opinion, WMA isn't what it's hyped up to be: there's a small difference in quality. I recommend mp3s. WMA format doubles the storage capacity, though. Choose. Hope that helps!

<Title>mp3 players are NOT made for the gym
<Date>Fri Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>This applies to the Iomega HipZip as well. I had two of those and one Nomad II within the span of 3 months this past year. I carried them to &amp; from work &amp; to the gym every day. Though I never dropped any of the players, the HipZips both stopped working in a couple of weeks. The Nomad lasted longer but did die after three weeks. I finally washed my hands. Disappointed cause I'm seeing in the reviews that all the 6gb players aren't recommended for &quot;sports use&quot; either. Isn't as if I want to play football with them in hand, but being able to jog on a treadmill would be nice.<p>One guy from mp3 devices.com tried to make me feel as if it was my fault and said, accusingly, &quot;You should be able to throw these against the wall &amp; they'd still work.&quot; Ya, right.<p>I won't buy another portable mp3 player until the technology improves.

<Content>My wife bought me this player in October.  In January the player failed to turn on.  I called customer service and was surprised to find out that something over $400.00 comes with only a 60 day warranty.  I sent it in with my $20.00 for repair and was told it could not be repaired.  Their explanation of what was wrong was it would not power on (It cost me $20.00 for this technical expertise?).  They would not repair or replace this unit.  This player sat on my desk for 2 months was never dropped or damaged by me in any way.  I will never ever buy a creative product again and caution anyone from wasting their money.

<Content>I basically bought this because it was the smallest MP3 player available with the most memory and SmartMedia expandability. I was also looking at the Sensory Science Rave, but that one was not available anywhere, .... The Nomad MG was *very* similar in price and functionality.<p>I required SmartMedia expandability because that's what I use with my Olympus digital camera. Smartmedia works well (including 128MB SmartMedia) for both functions, and I can have both music and photographs on the card at the same time -- using the card interchangably between the two devices. <p>I love the small size -- it's about the size of a deck of cards -- and the fact that it comes with 64MB. With the 128MB smartmedia, I can get a total of 192MB on this device. The sound quality is great, it can record from FM radio (another nice feature) and it can record voice and play it back at different speeds (great for lectures!). Also, it came with high capacity NiMH batteries, which is a plus. Upgradable firmware is also a plus.<p>It has locked up on me a few times for no apparent reason. Once I had to take the batteries out and put them back in to get it to reset. However, this doesn't happen often enough to be too much of a bother. <p>The on-screen user interface needs some work -- for example, once a song finishes scrolling by, you can't go back and see the title of it without stopping the song and restarting it. This is frustrating when you have it in your pocket while listening, then want to see the song/artist that's currently playing. <p>The hardare interface leaves much to be desired, and is the reason for my 3-star rating. With a better hardware interface, this unit would easily receive 5 stars. The buttons are on the side, and it's difficult to remember which ones do what -- especially if you're just reaching into your backpack to change a song. Many buttons are multi-funciton, and to access some functions, you need to press a button for at least a second or two. You may find yourself running for the manual to figure out how to use some of the more obscure features.  <p>Also, because there are buttons on both sides, if you hold the player in your hand both your thumb and some fingers will be resting on buttons -- press a button with your thumb and you might also press one on the other side as well. Also the "delete" button is placed right next to the "Next" button, although there is an "are you sure?" prompt. (There's also a "lock" switch that guards against accedental button-pushing.) Finally, the round stylish screen (though unique and actually higher resolution than normal) is very small -- I'd prefer a larger square screen, even if the resolution were lower. <p>If you want an very small SmartMedia-expandable player with excellent features and excellent sound, and can tolerate a poorly designed hardware interface (as I can) then this is the player for you. Buy it for its functionality, not its interface. <p>I hope this helps you with your decision!!<p>p.s. The "leather" case is a joke. I don't think it's actually leather, but even if it were you might try it once but it'll quickly get tossed away -- see, I almost even forgot to mention it! No belt clip, poor accessibility, etc, it's rather useless, which is a shame, because the face and corners of this player will wear with use.

<Title>Stick with your name brands
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought a silver one for myself and a blue one for my girlfriend at the same time.  I worked fine first few months.  One day my girl friend's Nomad 2 MG stopped working.  And after few days mine stopped working.  Out of warranty (...).  Moral of this story is stick with your name brands like Sony whose been making portable audio players for forever.  Creative Labs makes pretty good sound cards but they don't know a thing about making a portable box that is durable.

<Content>I purchased my Nomad II in December of 2000.  In October of 2001 it died on me.  I threw it away and purchased an Intel player.  Beware of Creative MP3 players.

<Title>Great features, if it works
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2001
<Content>I bought this unit about 6 months ago but have only been able to use it for half that time, due to repeated battery/dock station failures.  And, as previous customers stated, the customer service (is bad)(not to mention it's a long-distance number).  After the warranty runs out(3 months!!!), they charge you a $20 "diagnostic" fee on top of the cost to repair it. <p>I did like the features and look of the unit, but it's definitely not worth the hassle of the shipping and long-distance charges to get it fixed.  I'm moving on...

<Title>low quality
<Date>Wed Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have had this mp3 player for just a few months and have already had three problems with it.  first of all, it wouldnt play any mp3's, that problem was fixed after a 45 minute hold on a long distance phone call.  then the spring contact in the battery case snapped off (while the battery was in there and the case was closed). i replaced that with a small piece of paperclip coiled into a spring.  this time the up volume doesn't do anything and i am typing this review as i wait on hold to talk to creative (it's been 23 minutes so far).  this is not what i would expect for [money]!!!  dont get it!

<Title>still works fine
<Date>Wed Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've had mine for over 2 years now and it still works fine.  I wanted dependability and that's what I got.  I'd give it five starts, but there are only 2 things I didn't like: 1) The vinyl case is ridiculously unsuited to the unit.  You can't access the buttons without taking it out of the case.  2)  The headphones weren't that great.

<Title>Great Features, Poor Ergonomics
<Date>Tue Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Purchased the Nomad about a year ago and it's worked very well.  Sounds good, no problems with software, small, lightweight, and compact.  Radio is a nice feature.  Memory expansion worked as it was supposed to (added 64MB).  Only major beef I have is that the button layout is TERRIBLE.  It's very easy to accidentally hit a button when you grab it, since the buttons are all on the sides.  Also makes it impossible to operate with one hand.  A remote is an absolute necessity with this player.
