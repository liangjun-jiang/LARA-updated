<Content>Unfortunately for me, my mpio was caught in the wash and is now ruined. But that was my fault... so for the past few hours I have been trying to find another mp3 player, i even considered an ipod but quickly changed my mind. This mp3 player was wonderful and i am going to buy it again. It is compatible with windows media player,which most people that own a windows computer have, it also plays video and music and it has photos and i have yet to find another mp3 player with all three that is as cheap. It also downloads songs very quickly and downloading them from WMP is very easy. Also if u us bear share or limeware songs automatically transfer to WMP(windows media player) so its not a problem to get songs or videos on ur mp3. I would recommend this for new mp3 users like myself. unfortunately it is very hard to see the screen when you are outside, and the headphones suck (the latter I have heard however of many mp3 players) this was my first mp3 player and i loved it and i will most likely buy another one, if i can't find another mp3 player that can play video and music and has a photo viewer that isn't $300  
<Overall>4
