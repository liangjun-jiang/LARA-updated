<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>What nobody has mentioned yet ... SOUND!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This isn't going to be long and boring because everything good/bad has been said so far. Good - size, flash memory, photo ability, etc..  Bad - I got black and it scratches VERY easily! I only had it 2 days and from carrying it in my pocket, the front looks very scratched like I had it a few years already.  Also, don't know why they put the headphone jack on the bottom ... and so far there's no belt clip for this.  Only a lanyard headphone or an armband.  I need a belt clip for the gym.  Anyway, the sound ...  I only listen to my players CRANKED!  Every MP3 player I've ever bought, including my previous 3 ipods, I listen to at full volume.  So, just to test, I got my 6 gb ipod mini and put it side by side with my new Nano.  I started "Walk" by Pantera simultaneously on both players and took my best pair of headphones going back and forth from one player to the other.  Well, the new Nano BLEW AWAY my 6 gb ipod!  Noticeably louder, deeper bass, and my favorite, much sharper and higher treble!  I hate to admit it, but it makes my 6 gb mini sound like crap. (Hello ebay!) I can't comment on the battery life yet at that volume, but I'm sure it will be much shorter than the 14 hours they say.  But if you buy this player for no other reason ... buy it for the SOUND!

<Title>I love it
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my iPod Nano for about a week now and I really like it.  My first impression of it was how small it was.  Small enough but not to small, they struck a good balance with the Nano.    The screen is a very resolution so it can show more information than the larger screen on the mini, not to mention that it's also in color.  The sound quality is great and it has a very good range of volume levels.  This player is another good one from Apple and an improvement over the mini.  My only problem I have with Nano is that any finger prints shows up on the black surface and the shiny metal back.  The black surface is very easy to scratch. But overall a great product.

<Title>Simply Brilliant
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my nano for a week and a half now and am loving it.  It is so tiny that I can carry it in my wallet - but it is still sized well to hold comfortably in the hand.  The sound quality and output is excelent.  The black does show fingerprints and scratches easily, but it just looks way to cool.  It is comfortable to use and the screen (though slightly smaller than the other ipods) is very crisp and easy to read.  Navigation with the clickwheel is just as easy as the larger ipods.  And I actually like the headphone port on the bottom better than on top (and I don't use a lanyard) - it just makes more sense-it takes some getting use to, but once you do, you'll love it just as much as you like everything else about the Nano.  This thing is super durable and you don't need to worry about breaking it.  Some complain about the price, but really, it is an excellent buy - you're paying for:  4gb of flash storage (the 1st flash player anywhere near that much storage), the tiny size, the color screen, and the flatout beauty of this thing.  No other player comes even close.  Just buy it!

<Title>Using I-Pod Nano with USB 1.1 Macs
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the nano from my local Fry's electronics.  4gig, black.  I'm using it with a 1Ghz Powerbook G4 15" 10/10/1000 ethernet, DVI, but NOT USB 2.0...  which poses a problem because the Nano does not support sync via firewire.(although it can be charged over firewire)  The lack of firewire, my only real complaint about the nano, and aside from that, there is very little to find fault in aside from an overly bright screen (see below).  I've overcome the lack of firewire compatability by upgrading my laptop to USB 2.0 through the purchase of a $24 USB 2.0 PCMCIA card from Fry's.  For about the same cost as what I would have had to pay for the firewire cable anyway (if it were useful for anything other than charging) I have a PCMCIA card that provides compatability in addition to fast USB for external hard disks, etc...  The mac (osx panther) recognized the card immediately, without the need for drivers, etc.  Sync was very very fast, transfering complete songs in less than 1 second per song in many cases.  FAST transfers.  Fry's had numerous models of cards, some with Firewire and USB 2.0, other's with just firewire, and still others with only USB.  I purchased the least expensive, USB 2.0 only card that, only on the back of the package in fine type did it mention macs... and it works almost perfectly.  (note unplug the card before closing the powerbook lid or it won't sleep, and won't wake up the monitor, forcing a restart... this is the only issue I've encountered)  Regarding the Nano.  Small, stupid small, almost too small...almost.  Click wheel works great, volume is powerful, songs are accessed immediatly with no delay (flash memory).  As there is no hard disk to be scrambled from impacts, it is able to take minor drops without issue.  And when it does fall, the thing is so light that it almost always falls softly.  Syncs are very very quick using USB 2.0.  (I frequently wipe all the songs and re-upload rather than poke through them when I want to make changes.  Uploading about 3 gigs of music takes around 30-40 seconds at most)  The unit is light weight enough that I often pick it up by the headphone cord with no fear of it unplugging and falling.  The stock earbuds sound great, but hurt my ears after extended listening.  I currently use some foam earbuds I already owned.  Others have no problems with the ear buds, so I think it's just dependant upon the shape of one's ears.  My only other complaint and I'm sure it can be overcome with a firmware upgrade, is that the white LED back light is blindingly bright at night.  When in the car using it, it actually almost hurts to look at it.  When the back light turns off, it does so by quickly fading out, so the capability to vary brightness is there, and needs to only have a menu option added to control it for low light use.  If I had to think up anything else wrong, I would say it the black moel shows fingerprints and smudges too easily. (but it looks sooo good in black)... but really, disregarding the lack of firewire which I'm sure would have added size, and since mose people already have USB 2.0 anyway could afford to be sacrificed... If the best complaints I can come up with are "a screen that's too bright", and "shows smudges", then this one is most certainly a winner.    -Jason

<Title>not perfect, but as good as you are gonna get for a while
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>style is everything as far as the ipod nano is concerned.  i went out and bought a 4gb black the day it came out, not knowing that it would be in such a short supply in later days.  after playing with it for a couple of weeks, i would say that it is the best mp3 player to date, all things considered.  yet, it is far from being perfect, and i don't ask for much.  i just want a recording feature, like a lot of the low end cheap mp3 players, but no ipod nano doesn't come with recording feature.  otherwise, ipod nano is the perfect companion to my 60gb ipod, which is getting heavier and bulkier by the day.

<Title>THE biggest revolution
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Steve Jobs said the nano wiould be the biggest revolution since the original iPod, he wasn't kidding. The nano is the most impressive thing I have ever held in my hands. I was really into this product from the start, but certain aspects of the player never hit me until I actually held it.  The day I got mine, my jaw droppped. How could something so small be an iPod? Well, after using mine, I know this is by far the best mp3 player I have ever seen.  I wont go into the specs, as other reviewers already have.   But I will state some things that are wrong with it.  First, I was somewhat disapointed to hear it was USB 2.0 only. My old iPod was firewire, and since I have a mac computer, I never really ever used 2.0. The time to load music was noticable. While takes my 3rd gen Ipod to load my entire library only about 5 minutes, it took my nano about 8-10 minutes to lload only 800 songs. Its not that big a deal, but still...  The other thing is not really that big a deal either, but it is something i found wierd about the player. The headphone jack is on the bottom, instead of on top like it had been for 4 years. I mean, its not the end of the world, I just find that choice very odd.  One other thing a lot of people have talked about was value. Yes, this little guy is somewhat of a rip off. Why not just pay $50 more, and get an iPod with 5 times the space? Again, it comes down to "cool" factor, something the Nano drips of.  However, these "flaws" would by no means make me change my mind on my purchase. This is still THE mp3 product on the market. I bought mine becuase I love apple stuff, and my old one was dying on me. Im glad I bought this thing.

<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great unit.  More memory than you could possibly need, plus the added bonus of picture viewing.  I've had this one since March 2006 with no technical issues, and I have heard that the new ones that come in different colors have problems so it's too bad they don't make this one anymore.  The menu is easy to navigate and finding the song you want is simple.  The do it yourself on-the-go playlist is great so you can change and add the songs you want to hear.  Great player, definitely buy a cheap wall charger and/or car charger for this because the color screen chews up the battery life.

<Title>What the shuffle should have been!
<Date>Sun Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is exactly what Apple should have been working on instead of the Shuffle.  I've purchased several Shuffles for myself and my family, and absolutely love them.  But, I have the same compliants as everyone else, no screen, small capacity, different accessories from other iPods, etc.  The nano addresses all of these concerns without sacrificing the sound quality that first drew to the Shuffle.  The nano's small size, vibrant color screen, standard iPod connector, long battery life, and large song capacity make it the most attractive option in the iPod line.  The lack of moving parts inside improve the sound quality, battery life, and durability of the device (it uses solid-state memory like the Shuffle, instead of a micro-disk like the larger iPods).  Additionally, the color screen, photo llbrary, and built-in Podcast support are welcome features.  The nano does suffer from the one drawback inherited from it's larger cousins - the device is beautiful, but the case tarnishes and scratches easily.  I'm looking forward to purchasing the iPod nano "tubes" to cover and protect my nano once Apple releases them.  Overall, the best technology value I've encountered in a long time.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute.  Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil.  In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle.   Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces.  Weight is another jaw-dropping figure.  The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.    Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable?  Don't be!  The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable.  Why?  The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player.  The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.    Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.  The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.  Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic.  It features a nice resolution, and color.  You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music.  There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.    Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.    Color - White is the traditional iPod color, but this black iPod nano is proving to be incredibly popular.  Just note that the black is more likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>I didn't think it was THAT small
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is the gutsy move by Apple to replace their bestselling iPod mini.  What will previous generation iPod and iPod mini owners think of the nano?  Pros:  * Flash memory, not hardrive based which means no moving parts and no skipping or momentary delays when selecting a new track  * Incredibly thin.  The commercials don't do it justice, you have to feel it to believe it  * Sexy new black option without including Bono worship  * Lots of new features, a world clock with all sorts of timezone, a screen lock to keep out iPod leeches, and a stopwatch.  * Lovely color screen  * Built tough, will survive all sorts of drops.  The exception is the scratching on the Lucite.  You most likely won't bend it sitting on it.  Cons:  * Shows scratches much more readily than the iPod mini's brushed steel look.   * Fairly expensive for the capacity.  2 gigs for $200 and 4 gigs for $250, a bit disappointing for those who were expecting a 6 gig flash release from Apple  * Screen is too small to show detail in pictures  * No firewire port  * No TV outlet for showing off pictures yet  * So thin you might leave it in your jeans... through the washer and dryer cycle.  I highly recommend buying the iPod nano, especially for iPod mini owners.  Its great for gym and travelling and other bumpy rides.  I also recommend getting a case for it so you don't get it all scratched up.

<Title>Sets a new bar for music players
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have always been a loyal creative customer till now. Apple has redefined the mp3 player space, with this release. A 4gb flash player for 250 dollars is a really good deal, considering other vendors currently sell a 1 GB flash player for 120 bucks. Samsung has provided a sweet deal to Apple, allowing them to price the player at such aggressive terms. The biggest surprise of this player is the nice lcd screen that comes with it. It is very sharp and very clear. Apple should update the ipod nano, to allow it to host video clips on it. Nano has an included solitaire game , that is very sharp and clear on the LCD screen. Nano will shake up this space, and will quickly become the defacto king of music player space. Though in the long run, there is no reason, why cell phones will not have 4 GB flash chips to hold the songs, video clips etc. I bought the black nano, which interestingly was shipped directly from shenzen, china. I recommend the white nano instead, as the black color shows the fingerprint imprints very easily. Highly recommended. Apple should have included a case with it, as it is so small, that U can lose it very easily.

<Title>VERY cool...but not for everyone
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 80% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.  ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $50, you can upgrade to a Photo that has 5x times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is--it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.  Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their petite size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300.  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>Apple iPod Nano Review
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this iPod nano 4GB Black on September 8th and I recieved it September 12th. I was expecting Apple not to discontinue the widely famous iPod mini but I guess they did. Rumors and speculations said that Apple was going to make a 8GB mini with a color screen but in the end they discontinued the line all together. The nano isn't perfect though. The gigabyte to price ratio is horrible and the battery life isn't that good. The 2GB nano is $99.50 per gigabyte while the 4GB nano is 62.25 per gigabyte. Much more than the iPod mini's. The battery life is rated at 14 hours. I got up to 16 to 17 hours which is good but my friends said their new iPod mini can get up to 23 hours! The design is sexy but, the smudges and scratches attract a second after you peel off the protective paper. The mini had a case that didn't deter any real scratches and smudges. You have to buy a case for this iPod while you didn't have to for the mini.  But, it's a fresh start with the iPod line and it's right now my personal favorite. 4GB holds around 1,000 songs, I have 939 songs (on various qualities, etc.). It comes with the iPod CD with iTunes 5 (the new one). iTunes 5 is nice cosmetically (Apple changed it a little bit) but, there is no major change. There are color choices with the nano: Black or White but black is a little bit better looking (but shows smudges and scratches more). The prices are $199.99 for 2GB (500 songs) and $249.99 for 4GB (1,000 songs). The screen lock is pretty cool I have to admit, I just set up my code and if someone tries to use my iPod, the iPod screen will be locked out. Another thing which is nice is the thickness. It's the smallest iPod in depth (.27") but it isn't the all around smallest iPod. The pictures are small but, this isn't a picture viewer to be honest with you. You should buy the accessory to put the pictures on our television instead. Another problem I have with this iPod is the accessories that come in the box. It just comes with the iPod nano, headphones, USB 2.0 cord, iPod CD, Manual, and a dock adapter. iPod has really been cutting back ever since they released the 4th Generation iPod but, atleast that came with FireWire while none of the iPod's now do. All together, this iPod is beautiful but if your a power user (like me) you will not like this so much. The iPod mini has some advantages over this one but, this iPod has advantages over the mini too. So, if you're getting a new iPod and you just have about 400-900 songs, this iPod will be perfect for you.

<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.   Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.   Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is the best value. It is only $50 more than the 2-gigabyte model, so you get twice as much storage, for only $50 more. Don't forget you can also backup important files to your iPod, so you may find some extra space valuable. The 4-gigaybtes is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color, and the white-colored iPod Nano will match many other Apple products. However, the black iPod nano is an intense and sleek finish, beautiful in person. It might show scratches and fingerprints more easily, but it looks so great that it may be the most popular color choice of this new player.   Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.   Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>Nano vs Mini - not bad tradeoff
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>BACKGROUND: i currently own: 4gig Nano, 30gig Photo, 512mb Shuffle... Use PC & Mac... Note, I am NOT recommending the 2gig Nano @ $199.  =======  BOTTOM LINE =======  BUY THIS NOW IF: (1) need a `exercise' music player, (2) this is your second iPod, (3) don't need over 2-4gigs of music (500-1000 songs) (4) if you're NOT willing to wait till the holidays (Nov-05), cuz most likely you'll get a price drop... and a 4gig Nano at $199 is a NO BRAINER PURCHASE...way beyond 5 star rating, MORE LIKE 7 STARS!  WAIT TILL HOLIDAYS IF: (1) want to get the absolute best deal, (2) this is your first iPod, (3) you are buying this as a Christmas gift.  ***Keep in Mind***: 4gig Nano will most likely drop in price to $199 during holidays, while a newly introduced 6gig Nano should be $249 ***NEXT PRICE DROP DURING HOLIDAYS 2005*** nano 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $14/hour battery time &lt;highly recommended> nano 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $18/hour battery time &lt;recommended>  ===== VALUE ======= PROS: (1) size - amazing! (2) weight/portability - amazing! (3) color screen, (4) faster interface - due to flash memory, (4) unbelievably cool looking. CONS: (1) @ $249 for 4gigs, more expensive than Mini for storage and battery (per-gig and per hour battery), (2) No significant new innovation other than size/appearance, (3) no FireWire - slow updates, (4) no iTalk, iTrip, or any top-connecting accessories that use remote control port.   NOTE - CURRENT PRCING:  nano 2gig @ $199 =  $100/gig OR $14/hour battery time nano 4gig @ $249 = $62/gig OR $18/hour battery time mini 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $11/hour battery time mini 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $14/hour battery time  ===== DETAILS ======= 1) SIZE/WEIGHT: Simply amazing... you can see for yourself...I really cannot convey to you how much `coolness' is packed into this tiny lightweight package... Super thin... about half the thickness as the Motorola RAZR.   2) COSMETIC CHANGES & SCREEN: Color screen is smaller than other color models, fonts smaller, click wheel smaller, still scratches and smudges like the rest... headphone jack is on the bottom (a good thing) and still displays album art... screen resolution is clearly less than the iPod Photo  3) PHOTO QUALITY: Not very good, still syncs w/ my iPhoto and Adobe Elements... but pictures have less resolution when I compare my 30gig iPod photo and the Nano side-by-side. PHOTOS ON MY TV: Not available.  4) MUSIC: Really no improvements here... but no steps back either.  5) USB 2.0 UPDATE TIMES: Slow for initial load (full capacity)....normal FireWire iPod on Mac is about 1 second per song (no FireWire use on Nano) ...USB on Mac is 2.5 seconds/song... USB on PC is about 2-3 seconds/song... longest test was PC formatted Nano, updating on a Mac = 4-5sec/song!!! ... hopefully Apple will soon enable FireWire connectivity for Nano.   6) BATTERY LIFE: Didn't really run above spec in my tests: ~14hrs w/ no backlight.... 10hrs31min w/ backlight set at 5 seconds...and normal amount of navigation.   7) FUNNY QUERKS: (1) No FireWire updates, but seems to charge via-FireWire, (2) Screen "washes out" when viewed at an angle... same for the iPod Photo or Mini, but not as severe.   ===== SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX =====  A) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE: In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing photo albums automatically, etc..., you need to purchase or own iLife (iPhoto specifically) 4.03 or better.  If you have PC, you have to buy Adobe Photoshop Elements.   B) SLIDESHOWS: without the TV-output capability, there is no use for this on this iPod... sux.    D) ITUNES 5.0: Cool new feature is ability to create `folders' for your playlists... if you have too many playlists, then this feature is great... but the navigation does not translate to your iPod Nano... you still have to use a million playlists on the same scroll column.   E) NO AC ADAPTER: You must charge from a powered USB 2.0 port... note, most USB 1.0 ports are not powered, nor does a 1.0 port update your songs.

<Title>It would be five stars were it not for iTunes
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wonderful design. Aesthetically appealing. The quality of the sound is excelllent. Size is amazing.... the screen is wonderful... the list goes on ...  HOWEVER..... in order to do anything, you have to go through iTunes, and there's no direct mapping of ripped files and folders to transfer... Album covers are not automatically retrieved like MS Media player.

<Title>Before you take the plunge ...
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love the iPod. Always have. At home, we have five, including this one: the 4GB iPod nano black.  Before you leap, realize two things: (1) this iPod is extremely fragile compared to other iPods, particularly the tough-as-nails iPod mini (a drop of a couple of feet onto a linoleum floor took out the screen); and (2) the black version gets scratched very easily, and shows scratches far more than any white iPod I've owned (after a day and before dropping the damn thing, it already looked awful from scratching -- and it was treated with kid gloves).  Okay, if you can live with those caveats, and invest in a durable protector (we bought the arm-band holder, which does a lousy job of protecting the iPod nano)--none of which are out yet--then this new iPod is truly an amazing bit of technology. It's tiny (it feels even smaller than the photos suggest), has great sound quality (better, I think, than any other iPod I've owned), and the display is gorgeous (even though tiny).  For me, the mini (now defunct, but bargains still abound) is the better choice given its sturdiness. I'm not up for museum-relic care for my electronics, which would certainly help if you own one of these.  Another beautiful, functional gizmo from Apple.  Just know what you're getting.  Some websites claim the nano is sturdy. I can tell you, from first hand experience, it isn't.  So, you be the judge. (Sure, the thing still played, but replacing the screen will set you back at least $90, and, even on the web sites in question, the screen broke.)  (Oh, and if you see someone taking shots at the iTunes software, don't believe it. It's the best music software out there, and its integration with this--or any--iPod is a joy.)  __________  Follow up ... Apple has admitted a problem with some of the nano screens and is doing the right thing: replacing the units with new ones. BRAVO!

<Title>Is it fragile
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Anybody worry about breaking this one can go &lt;A HREF=http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=932>Here&lt;/A> and read their review. A quote: "At this point we were astounded that the iPod nano was still working properly, albeit with a broken display. Because we had honestly expected the iPod nano to break by this time, we were forced to depart from our planned schedule of destruction and try and run over it with the car. Surely, we thought, it could never withstand the crushing power of German automotive engineering."...

<Title>CLOSE TO PERFECTION
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>WOW!  Everyone who has seen my black 4G ipod has ordered one, even those who hated ipods for no reason.  This is an amazing engineering feat, I have no idea how they fit all that in to a player the size of a credit card.    It's got a beautiful color screen, syncs with your outlook contacts and calendar, stores photos, games, clocks, and best of all it's got iTunes.  I really don;t see how they could improve on this besides maybe getting a protective coating on the black nano.  It does scratch real easy.  And contraty to what was posted, you can get 2 lines of free laser engraving when you order from the apple store online.  Also, the battery lasts plenty 14 hours, who wants to carry around bulky AAA batteries around all the time.  I think the competition might just have to close shop pretty soon.

<Title>Amazing technological leap doesn't even look real!
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You have to physically handle and hold the new iPod Nano to believe it is real. It is approximately 1 ounce in weight, so almost unnoticable on your person - whether it's in a pocket or an armband. The small color screen is stunningly brilliant in brightness and color definition.  The black iPod shows fingerprints more prominently than the white version - but ooh la la, it is most sexilicious to look at! I'd personally love to see one of these in red as well.  Because they are so new, third party vendors haven't had much of a chance to make cases and other products for the Nano.   There are only a handful of already existing products out there that are already compatible with the Nano...  Available FM Transmitters: Forget the iTrip and those of that ilk - current versions won't work with the Nano. Your choices for now are the Belkin (which is buggy) and the Monster iCar Play Plus. The Monster version isn't cheap, but it's an integrated charger and FM transmitter and is one of the best out there.   Available Cases: The Apple branded armband - looks like a glorified bandaid in the case, but looks decent when you wear it Apple branded Tubes - good luck finding one, most Apple Stores still haven't gotten any in stock Apple branded iPod Socks - designed for the older iPods, they work fine with the Nano - but can cause minor scratches  Available Speakers that Charge: The JBL OnStage - fits fine, sounds great The Bose Sound Dock - is visibly off-center, but fits fine, sounds freakin' awesome Altec Lancing's IM3 for full and mini - fits but sound is lackluster Klipsch - sounds great... Nano is greatly dwarfed, however by such large equipment... akin to building a superdome around a book of matches.  By the time you read this review, 10 other vendors will have probably already submitted their patents and copyrights to lawyers for new gizmos.  Apple has announced that the new configuration of how the Nano connection is set up will be the NEW standard for all forthcoming iPods... this will help vendors make products more quickly and without quaking in their boots that by the time they get something to market, it will be outdated - and should encourage lots of new development like we have yet to have seen thus far in the iPod accessory industry.  The Nano adds a World Clock, a stop watch and a combination lock to the "extras" menu. The famous silver back collects scratches and fingerprints exactly like its counterparts - but this is a known - get a case to protect your investment. Contrary to what another reviewer posted, the Nano is not "fragile" - far from it. There are no moving parts - so you could probably use this as a hacky-sack for an hour without fazing it.   At least one consumer has published their own abuse study of the Nano, running it over with a car and throwing it from a moving car at 55mph before finally rendering it useless after a 40 foot drop onto cement. The screen makes it a tad more vulnerable than the shuffle... but it's a sturdy piece of industrial art.  My less than perfect rating is for the following:  1.) No firewire support - even if you have a dock connector to firewire cable, you won't be able to use it - it is USB 2.0 only. What is Apple thinking? Hello! Remember your loyal Mac users who prefer FireWire?  2.) Sole earphone jack is too close to dock connector - using a splitter probably precludes charging it at the same time.  3.) No extra jack or connector on flipside so remote can be added while it charges... so if and when the vendors make recorders, remotes and other goodies for the Nano, you won't be able to use them in tandem with a charging solution.  4.) No bluetooth. Why is this an issue? More and more items are becoming BT enabled. One application I can think of right now is a Nano finder. The Nano is almost weightless and very thin - if you misplace it, how are you going to find it? If it had BT and you had (for example) a Nano finder on a keychain, clicking it could send a signal to your Nano to make audible clicks. Just an idea. This review loses a star for the other reasons, however, not this one... but come on, Apple!  5.)Still no way to get custom logo engraving via Apple unless you're a corporation with a large order... third party vendors are now doing laser engraving so you can put photos of pets, kids, yourself, your logo, etc. on the back of your iPod - but Apple offers no such solution. Considering that stamps.com allows you to make your own legal US postage with a photo of your pet, and they are able to prevent porn and other objectionable imagery through, there is no reason why Apple cannot make this accommodation.  6.) Limited (still!) photo capabilites. Compact Flash cards are like diamonds - the bigger they are, the more they are per carat (or rather, per MB). The iPod Photo camera connector connects a camera just fine - but not to the Nano! There is no explanation for this - it still uses a dock connector, but won't work w/ the Nano. The camera connector isn't that great to begin with, because you can ONLY use it to connect an iPod to a camera, not to a compact flash or multi reader... so if you're out in the field taking photos, you can't take them until your photos download and you waste your battery in your camera. If you could attach a card reader to the connector and download photos for storage on your iPod while simultaneously shooting more photos with your camera using a different card so you can swap without losing precious shooting time. Camera connector shortcomings notwithstanding, it doesn't work with the Nano. I know I already stated this, but I'm still frustrated.  The part of me that loves Apple's innovative technology and design wanted to give this incredible gizmo 5 stars - but there is still overt room for improvement and I know Apple can do this!

<Title>The Black Lacks?
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just go the iPod Nano today, and so far I'm loving it! The whole thing looks surreal (to amazing to be real). The Nano plays like a dream. The controls and menus are the same as the original iPod and the iPod mini. The player is so small too, smaller then the pictures lead you to believe! I only have two really big complaints.  1) The black does show every minuet scratch, and scratching it is not hard. I haven't scratched mine yet, but a few of my friends have. I am going to try keeping the temporary clear plastic cover on the front of the player. Hopefully the scratched will only be on the plastic and when the Nano Tubs come out I can just peal off the plastic and slid it in. I think Apples decision to release the Nano Tubes 4 weeks after releasing the iPod Nano was a really stupid one!  2) The Black iPod nano comes with WHITE EAR BUDS!!! The ear buds are the same ones you get with all the other iPods. I mean come on, if you are going to make a black iPod Nano then at least make the ear buds match. It kind of ruins the whole black look when it has this white wire coming out of it. Everyone that has looked at it said, "What's up with the white buds? They don't go!"  It's easy to operate and fun to play around with. The thing does feel flimsy but I haven't accidentally test its durability yet so I'll have to get back to you on that one. Over all I do like my iPod Nano, I just wish I could protect it from getting damaged.  BEWARE THE BLACK IPOD NANO HAS WHITE EAR BUDS!!!!!

<Title>GREAT ITEM
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm sure many of you out there have ipods...it seems like everyone walking around these days has one. So as many of you that have them, most of you probably know how easily breakable the mini's and regular ipods were. The new nano's however has no movable parts, but still functions like the regular ipods. and because it only weighs 1.5 ounces, you can catch it by the earphones, so it will never clatter onto the ground and break (as did mine). Apple controls over 80% of the mp3 player market -normally, that is something which is impossible to hold on to. But introducing this item, they might have even strengthened their hold on the market. In fact, apple is so sure of the nano, that they are discontinuing their best selling product -the mini. Maybe there is a reason why everyone you see walking down the street is listening to an ipod. To see it, is to fall in love with it, credit cards -beware. [...]

<Title>Nano needs materials rethink
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have just arranged to return my black nano due to the amazingly soft plastic that covers the front of the device.  This material scratches even when wiping with a soft cotton t-shirt.  The result is a device that looks as though it has been abused and neglected.  I had only peeled off the protective cover and wiped the grease marks away when I noticed the first scratches across the whole length of the front.  Damned annoying.  Apple have an issue with this device and they need to fix it.  Why should I be compelled to nuy a case that makes the player larger than it needs to be and why can't I put it, naked, in my pocket as advertised by Mr Jobs or wear it next to clothing?  My advice, go and look at a display device in a store and make sure it is one which has the protective cover removed.  You will love the size and the screen and the weight but you won't buy one.

<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This ipod is by far the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.  It scratches soooo easily, it makes it look a year old after the first week.  It is ridiculously small, i almost lost it twice, why is it so small?  its so impractical.  A few other points, you can only charge it when your computer is on, which sucks if you or going on a vacation or something.  The earphone slot is on the bottom, which almost forces you to buy the ipod earphone accessories that apple sells, as well as the case and probably the dock as well... -.-  If you are going to buy this, don't count on the initial $249 being the final price. you will have to pay 30 for the cases 40 for the earphones and another thirty for the dock.  altogether it will be $349 plus tax >:( not good.  look but do not touch!!

<Content>I just got back from a trip to Europe and I must say I love almost everything about my nano.  The battery lasted the entire 12 hour journey with room to spare.  The size is terrific for travel--no larger than a small stack of business cards.  Sound is great and the flash allows for near instant response and mega durability.  The only negatives are that it scratches a tad easily and I wish the screen was a bit bigger or it had video out...next version I hope.  All in all, I'm really happy I bought my nano.

<Title>Get This Instead of The Nano!!!
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will try to make this short and sweet. This is about the Sansa E200 Series Mp3 Players.  The ipods can't even compare to this...   -Superb mp3/wma playback and features  (includes custom eq,album art,playlists)   -FM radio (includes radio recording with pause and resume function)   -Voice recording (with pause and resume function)   -Picture viewer  (includes thumbnail view, indivdual view, slideshow with song playback)   -Video playback - don't worry about any problems because the videos are SUPERB quality  (includes video converter,play/pause,fast fwd./rew.,depending on what video you put on the player,they can be either fullscreen or widescreen)   -1.8" screen! (almost double the size of the ipod's)   -colorful screen and menus (who wants basic white like the ipod's)   -battery life (average of 20 hours)   -replaceable battery (in case it dies/doesn't work, you can get a new one, unlike the ipods)   -scroll wheel (works very wheel, and it's large enough to use)   -other buttons (don't worry about them being small,they're just the right size)   -ways to put data on the sansa (can be windows media player or by dragging and dropping files onto the sansa's drive/folder)   -size (about same size as Ipod Nano,but a little thicker so it's easier to hold in your hand)   -price ($150 for 2gb Ipod Nano, $160-$190 dollars for 8GB VERSION WITH ALL OF THESE FEATURES!!!! Even if they both did the same things,you get 4 times the memory for about $15 more!!)   If you don't know what mp3 player to get, get this one, you will NOT be dissapointed.   NOTE: the only con is that the Sansa may get finger-printed because it's smooth/glossy.  NOTE: if you take care of the Sansa, it willl NOT break or scratch.

<Title>Frustrating because of ITunes software and support
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can only load music into the Apple Ipod Nano through your computer on a program called ITunes. Loading the software onto your computer can be a major problem. I downloaded it and it refused to open. Apple's literature and online "support" was useless. Simply stated it is not user friendly, it does not tell you what to do in plain English. As usual a GOOGLE search with a few key words produced a number of boards loaded with people with the same problem. Thank goodness these people are kind enough to post solutions. In this case it has to do with the fact that the ITunes software has to operate with another program, a player called Quicktime. If both of these programs are not properly installed you will have a problem. The solution seems to be to first remove both programs entirely, restart your computer, and then install Quicktime (alone without ITunes) first before installing Itunes (alone without Quicktime). That's how I got it to work after 2 hours of repairing, installing, uninstalling, etc. Another problem is that it will not work (that means WORK after installation) unless it is installed and operates with "administrator privileges" meaning that if a child is using it they must have "administrator privileges" on the computer.  Second problem- After you finally get ITunes to run you learn that once files are downloaded onto the Ipod Nano the only way that they can be removed is through Itunes with the Ipod connected to the computer. You cannot delete them directly from the Ipod. Again instructions and support are not user friendly. They tell you to look somewhere on the screen (they are not specific) for the Ipod icon to start the delete process. What they don't tell you is that it only appears for a limited time upon the initial connection of the Ipod to the computer. If you don't find it before it disappears, you must disconnect and reconnect for it to reappear again, there is no way of just bringing it up on the screen again. And the deletion process is far from simple once you find the Ipod icon.  Basically this thing is nothing more that a portable computer jukebox. The process of loading and changing songs in it shouldn't be so difficult.

<Content>I have been waiting for years to get an iPod, and since my recent purchase of the nano, I am extremely content with it. The features the iPod offers are limitless and I can finally carry around my music without switching CDs or waiting for a song to come on the radio. This is one of the best things I ever purchased in my life and I am completely not exaggerating!

<Title>Fact - iPods Do Not Play Mp3s!
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't really feel like going into a lot of detail about the problems I had with this horrible product, since I'm sure all of the iPod-attics will rain down thier bizarre cult-like craziness on me, but here goes anyway.  The first set of problems came when I found that you can't just plug the player into your computer and drag and drop files onto it - like every other mp3 in the world.  You are forced to use iTunes, which changes the file format of the mp3's into a special Apple file format.  This angered me, as one of the reasons I bought the thing is so I could transfer the mp3s that I loaded onto it onto all of my friends computers.  But that's not possible thanks to Apple's insistance on changing my mp3s into thier own speacial file format.  This led me to the realization that marketing this product as an mp3 player, is false avertising, because it does not actually play mp3s.  Next, after deciding to do what the iPod told me to do, I had to update the software 10 times before I could get a song to play on it.  I tried to call customer support for help at one point and..... let me just put it this way, there is no customer support.  After many hours I got the thing working and got some songs on there.  At this point I was actually excited about the product, because I was under the impression my problems were over.  After a couple of days the battery started going dead after only 1 hour of use, even when fully charged.  Grudgingly I called Apple back and, after waiting 2 hours on the phone, was authorized to send it back for a replacement.  When the new one arrived I had the exact same problems setting it up that I had had the first time.  10 days later the unit stopped working all together and would not even power on.  I am still in the process of trying to get another replacement and I'm beginning to think that I'm not getting one.  This has been an absolute NIGHTMARE!  Never buy anything from Apple, they suck and they are crooks!

<Title>What i've been waiting for.
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought an ipod nano at Best Buy, a 4gb one that costs 250$. I bought the insurance and bought the holder so it wouldn't break. It looked awsome and i was ready to jam! I hooked it up to my comp, loaded on about 500 or more song and a few pictures and started jamming, it rules. When u played a song u could look at the album cover, play games, or look at pictures u put in there. It was the best ipod yet. But then i realized it is fragile. Without a case if u drop it on a carpet it will scratch it or might ever crack it. But i always keep the protective case on. With the case this thing is the best ipod yet, and it holds just the right amount of songs, 1,000 songs. All in all i think its awsome. I highly reccomend it to any one who wants to update there ipod or wants an ipod nano, but make sure u BUY! the protective case or u will end up breaking it. If u want something cheaper get an ipod mini 6 or 4 gb, they are still good and are very sturdy.

<Content>I always envied the size of the mini, but I enjoyed my album art too much to make that trade down. Hauling the 20GB around was cumbersome when I just wanted to run a quick errand while listening to music. With the nano, I get the lightweight and album art. It's so perfect that I didn't even wait to sell my 20GB before purchasing one. I couldn't wait.

<Content>This is gorgeous and beautiful piece of art to look at but there's a major flaw: it scratches too easily.  It scratches easily when in a pocket with nothing else and eventually makes the screen unreadable in short time.  Look up discussions at the Apple support website or ipodlounge.  I recommend waiting until the second generation on this one.  All the best.

<Title>Great device
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>[...]  The nano scratches no more easily than any previous iPod.  I have had mine for a couple of weeks and have yet to see a blemish on it.  If you take care of your iPod, it will take care of you.  Keep it in a safe place, store it in a case or a cloth bag of some sort when you aren't using it, and clean it occasionally with a microfiber cloth -- these are the steps I have taken to keep the various iPods I have owned clean and blemish-free.  Common sense will keep it (and all of your electronics, for that matter) healthy and easy on the eyes!  An example:  Two nights ago, I was sitting on my couch with my laptop in front of me and my nano plugged into a USB port to charge.  It was wrapped inside of a cloth Sony Minidisc bag at the time.  My dog, an 8 pound Yorkie, decided that now would be an awesome time to play.  She hopped up on the couch and severly trounced my new iPod.  Her weight and her claws, however, did no damage to the iPod because it was inside of something designed to protect it from such things.  If my dog couldn't damage the nano while it was inside of a thin cloth case, then I have a hard time believing that someone managed to mangle their nano's screen by leaving it in the pocket of their blue jeans or a cotton hoodie.  At any rate, this is a fantastic device worthy of the name iPod.  The sound quality is wonderful, the screen is sharp, and the click wheel makes it instantly familiar to anyone who has used an iPod in the past.  Thanks to the flash memory, photos and music load quickly, and the menus are snappy.  I have not been disappointed with the nano.  Highly recommended!

<Title>Save the waiting and your money,buy an iPod photo or mini!!!
<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod nano no longer than a week ago, it is amazing absolutley fantastic, its a beautiful piece of machinery.... but it sucks. Its great in sound quality, etc but the second day i had it the screen scratched, im ok with that I was pretty pissed but i got over it. The 5th day i had it it scratched the screen again. And the final straw was when the screen cracked completely and ruined the whole thing. this was because my cat jumped on the table it was on and it happened to fall off. So great all my money is gone to waste, i demanded a refund and got my money back. I went out and bought an iPod mini. Ill wait until I know for sure that these nanos are gonna be safe to walk around with. All the iPods are superior in holding up with a little abuse. But when you make silly mistakes like leaving in on a table that happens to fall apart it really makes you angry because you wish these things had some durabilty... The only reason im not completely panning this fragile electronic is because it looks good, it sounds good, and the battery is ok. On the other hand its as fragile as an eggshell. How can you carry that around everywhere? Stick with the iPod Photo or Mini for now.... you'd wish you had when your nano turns to a scratched up cracked mess.  Wait a year or so I say.   By the way.... that tv ad for the nano where the hand is playing around with the nano with his fingers flipping it around, is bs!! If that dropped your screwed, so I dont reccomend you do what the hand is doing in that ad!!

<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you are pondering whether or not to get the Nano...JUST GET IT.  It is worth it.  Everything about it is better than other mp3 players out there.  Yes it scratches, but you can always buy a case.  With the case, the Nano is still small.  Sound is good.  Extremely easy to use.  Expensive, but well priced when you consider its capabilities and its the first of its kind.  Ignore the negative reviews, this is the best that is available.  I would only not recommend this if you had over 5 gigs of music.  Even so, this is still a good product if you can narrow your songs to 1,000.  Again, there isn't anything else better than the Nano...

<Content>Why would I want anything more? It holds 1,000 songs. Ever thought how long it would take you to listen to 1,000 songs? I can store millions on my PC and change the Nano's content when ever I need to. If I want to watch video I will watch it on my TV. This versatile little item takes a lot of licks, holds more than enough music form my purposes and is extremly light. Best of all I can plug it up to noise cancelling headphones when on flights, my car stereo and my sound system at home.  My only concern is how to get the battery changed when it needs to be. But I guess the Apple Store will sort that one out when it comes time.

I've got 2 iPods and 1 mini and they are all scratched.  Even the two that came with the old slide case that Apple used to put in the box.  Fact is, if you buy an iPod it will get scratched.  End of story.  As a matter of fact anything you buy that will be a portable item will get scratched.  Don't believe all of these people when they tell you it is fragile.  One person complained it broke when it fell of a table.  Well DUH?  There was an idiot a few years ago mad because he dropped his 17" Powerbook off the table on its power cord and broke.  I want to drop these people on their heads and see if they break.  Maybe I can take them to the hospital and trade them in for something a little more durable.  An anvil perhaps.

<Content>NO STARS! MINUS SEVERAL BILLION STARS ACTUALLY. The demand for smaller and smaller devices has finally come to a dead-end. This product is way too fragile for the consumer market. Indeed using it as displayed in the advertising will get you a damaged Nano with Apple saying - 'Yes, well we may advertise people putting in their pocket, but we never expected anybody would. I'm afraid keeping the Nano in your pocket is considered abuse of the product and therefore *NO* WARENTEED replacement or FREE REPAIR is available. DON'T buy it or any other Apple product until they stop screwing the public like this.

<Content>This is a cool device. You will love it for the featues and the size.   I told myself I wouldn't mind the scuffing and scratching that comes from everyday usage, but I became upset when I decided to wipe the unit clean using my breath and my cotton t-shirt (like I do frequently with my sunglasses) and ended up with scratches all over the screen!  I've owned cell phones, pda's, and all kinds of electronic portable devices, and I have NEVER seen something so succeptible to scratching! It's only been two weeks. I can only imagine how bad it will be after a year.  To the skeptics out there who own one, try it!  If you get this unit, be sure to apply some sort of protector or the screen will be illegible in a few months of everday usage.

<Content>Interesting...I love this thing. It kinda fit with my lifestyle. I have one MD player and it's kinda too big for me so i think my next MD or MP3 player should be sth small.I was gonna buy MINI but when i went back to apple weasite again i saw a new little creature NANO and i fell in love with it :). 1000 songs are kinda a lot for me. If i would like to listen over tnan that, i'd rather stay at home with my stero :)   - fragile : i guess so... smaller things always more fragile than biger things:). I'm a dog lover as i know smaller dogs also more fragile than bigger dogs ..Same as Ipod :). when we accept to deal with it (Adopt a small dog or buy a Nano) just carefully use it i think it wouldn't be a problem :). A golden rule for using any electronic devices  "DON'T DROP IT, IT'S TOO FRAGILE TO BE DROPPED" :)   - Scratch so easy: i'm kinda think it depends on each individual. So how easy of scratching is depends on how careful the user is , as well.  Relax & Enjoy the innovation  Have fun....Love dog & Peace (^_^)V

I recieved my iPod nano today; From me not even touching the box i knew it was a great product. The box is a simple very small box with a picture of it on it. All the accesories are in it and the Nano. The Nano is smaller then you'd inmagine from the pictures. The sound qualitly made me dumbfounded, its just beutiful, vivid and rich. The screen quality is great not as good as a PSP's but very good. The only downside is probably that when you transfer photos from a PC all the photos have to been in one folder or it will write over the old ones. Im very happy and recomend it.

<Content>This was my first mp3 player.  I sort of waited and watched things develop.  No complaints.  I like the size, sound and user interface.  A few things to remember when buying an ipod - the purpose of this player is to sell itunes, it does not support drag and drop of mp3 files from your hard drive.  You must use the itunes software to load your mp3 rips on to the ipod in order for the ipod to recognize them.  Also the size (at least of the 4 GB model) is a lie.  You only have 3.7 GB of free space for music/pics and other files.  Great player if you don't mind having to use itunes software.

<Content>I love the ipod.I've had an iphoto for a while now and its great. I got a "nano" expecting the same quality albeit with a little less memory and bulk.It works but after only a short time 4(days)it looks like its been through a war.Despite treating very carefully the thing is covered in marks and scratches.I disagree with some of the other comments listed here where people ask what do you expect.I expect after four days that something I pay over $200 for looks relatively unused.I'll be returning mine.Hopefully I'll get my money back.Don't get me wrong, I love ipods but this is a disappointment....at least the screen didn't crack as a friends allegedly did.

<Title>Great Technology But Handle With Care
<Date>Wed Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased an Apple 4 GB iPod Nano several months ago. I paid a little more than $[...] for it retail, and received it a week after placing my order.  The first thing I noticed is how truly small this iPod is. They aren't kidding when they say it's small. Actually, it's about 1/2 the height of a new pencil. Because of its small size, it can be difficult at times to navigate through the various menus. Not to say it's an extremely difficult task. Just more so than with a regular sized iPod.  In addition, the small size of the Nano makes it very fragile. I wouldn't recommend carrying one around in a pants pocket. I also wouldn't recommend dropping the Nano. It's very fragile by design. In fact, there are times when I try not to push too hard on the face for fear I'll break the product. In addition, the face scratches easily, so it's best to keep it protected at all times.  As for the technology, I'm very happy with the amount of songs the Nano can hold. I've been adding a few songs a day since I purchased it, and still have 2GB of free space remaining. I'm currently at 1.5 days of continuous play. I'm guessing I could probably get 2.5 or 3 days out of it when full.  I'm also happy with the number of accessories currently available on the market for the Nano. I had no problem finding an FM transmitter so I can listen to it in my ride.  Aside from these good things, there is one big problem with the Nano, and iPods in general. It's the iTunes software. I've had numerous problems synching my Nano on a PC based machine. Several times I had to reset my Nano because the IPOD would not release from my machine after releasing it via iTunes. And heaven help you if you fall victim to Auto Synch on an already fully loaded iPod. Manual is always better in my opinion if you value the music you've stored. I also have found the big brother component of iTunes to be troubling. But that's an entirely different story.  As for the Nano, I'm happy with mine. Unfortunately, I'm overly protective as well due to its fragile design.

<Title>great innovation from apple.
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this was overall the best mp3 player i've owned.  It was easy to navigate, had a relatively long battery life, color screen, and more.  It worked great together with itunes.  The only drawback was fragility, but it was nothing a good case couldn't fix.  PROTECT THE SCREEN! if you don't, it will get scratched and maybe broken, pricy to fix.  A great line of accessories, also.  The new line of 2nd generation nanos have new and better features, but i'm sticking with my 4 gig because it is tired, true and still going strong after a year.  Make sure you read the instructions for valuable info on how to reset and other much-needed things.  Also, one last thing.  If you have just switched to itunes seven and it prompts you to download new ipod software, make sure your songs are backed up because it erases them.  Have Fun!

<Title>Piece of junk
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband bought me the Nano for my birthday. It has never worked properly. The second it is unplugged from the power source, it goes to sleep and cannot be unfrozen until the battery drains completely, usually a day. This is apparently so frequent a problem that it is the #1 troubleshooting topic on the Apple support site. The Nano cannot transfer from mac to pc, despite the USB hookup. Customer service is virtually non-existent.  On-line support consists email suggesting articles to read.  The end.  I decided finally after six months and 20 days to send the thing back, something I did not want to do because my Nano is engraved. Because I crossed the six month line, I have to pay $33 for shipping and handling because it has to arrive in THEIR box. The disclaimer page removes virtually all responsibility for anything needing repair and includes (starts off with) the promise to charge $100 for diagnostics unless a miracle occurs and they think the problem is actually on their end.  If they actually fix the problem without charging me $100 or more, I will eat my Nano..

<Content>Yes, it's shiny, and may show scratches, but this is not an object you throw around?  right?  I love this version, and I've bought 3 others as gifts.  I prefer this one so it will fit into the iMac extreme/neoprene sleeve.  The one you can wear on your arm or wrist during workouts.  I was worried the 2nd generation version was too thin to stay in the armband.

<Title>Worst MP3 player out there
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: Good-Looking  Con: The entire IPod  I have never owned an ipod, and i still know just by the specs that they are horrible. You can only use files that you have paid for and downloaded from itunes. Period. This would still be ridiculus even if Itunes was a decent program. People give good reviews for these ipods simply because they havent tried anything else, because the ipod is so popular. Every part of the ipod is terrible and i would reccomend any 20 dollar MP3 player over it. I doubt you'll listen to me as there are so many other good reviews out here, and youll probably be very pleased with it until you see another non-Apple MP3 player in action.

<Title>Be Careful
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently ordered a silver 4GB for myself and a black 4GB for my husband.  The silver one has the new case which is much sleeker, lighter, and has curved sides.  The black one is in the old "body style".  I think Apple must have had a bunch of these laying around and decided to use them for the supposed new generation. Since silver is a new color, this was not an issue.

<Title>Great Item
<Date>Tue Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am enjoying my new black iPod Nano a great deal, and I wish I'd been able to get one before now.  The sound quality is excellent, and the iPod itself is relatively easy to use.  I have a little difficulty reading the screen because my vision is poor.  However, I am usually able to make out the menu items even without glasses, and the click wheel is very easy to use.  My husband and I had some difficulty with using iTunes.  We didn't know that we needed to create separate playlists for the two of us, so all of my song choices were also copying onto his iPod when he would update it.  We have pretty much decided to look for a Dummies book on iPod use so we can have a clearer idea of how to use iTunes and how to transfer songs from CD to the iPod.  Overall, however, this is an excellent product.

<Content>On Feburary 10 2007, I will have had my Ipod Nano for approximately one whole year.  Not once have I ever dropped this thing (I bought the protective case the same day) and I have never experienced any real problems out of this product.  My one and only complaint is the lack of battery life.  Why after 10 and a half months am I only getting about 2 hours of battery life out of this thing?? I refuse to send it in for a battery replacement so that the same thing can occur once again next year.  I think that I will just purchase the Zune which has so much more to offer than the Ipod and I will advise all others to do the same. Besides, Microsoft rules over Apple anyways!!

<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was real excited to open presents on Christmas morning and find the one thing I wanted... an iPod! All in all I love it! But here are some things you need to keep in mind: It's small and fragile- I love the size, cuz I can put it in my purse, no more crappy CD player! But I highly recommend getting a case as soon as you get it. Earphones suck- This may just be me, but I can't stand those ear buds. With the soft covers they came with, at least it's tolerable. If you really can't stand them, I would recommend using your own earphones that you're used to. Battery life is short- The battery life is only good for about a day. If you're like me, you'll use it up every day! I would recommend charging it every night. Well there you go. It's a great product, you just gotta take care of it!

<Content>Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a "vendor quality issue". Apple finally admits it.  So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars, I say call yourself lucky that your's isn't one of the duds, and ask that you apologize to those you flamed.  To those stuck with the broken units, get back with Apple and demand a replacement for the DEFECTIVE product.  I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option.

<Title>iPod Black Nano Is Sweet-But the Scratches...........!!!!!
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received my black iPod nano (my first ipod or anything Apple) six days ago, September 22. Let me tell you, this little baby is sweet..but as a first adopter, I think I may have got hosed on the casing.   I put this in my pocket, with nothing else in the pocket like keys, change , etc., and wore it around town a few days (of course, showing off a bit). By the end of the second day there were scratches all over, deep ones, on the black casing, and worst of all , the screen. Also on the back silver casing.   I was distraught, but fortunately found some blogs that told me to use Brasso (NOT other polishes, which did not work). The Brasso made it new again, no damage! (note-don't use it on the spin wheel).  FYI, KEEP THE PLASTIC COVER THE NANO COMES WITH ON AND USE IT..I THREW MINE AWAY LIKE A FOOL!!! This will help until you get a case.    Besides the problems with the case (I will defintely buy a new case soon, I love it!! I have had it go FIFTEEN HOURS with no charge! I have about 600 songs on it, my contacts, and calendar.  Here are some suggestions:   * Everytime I sync the calendar/contacts, it adds another duplicate set of contacts. I need to figure this out or maybe it is a built in flaw.  *Having the calendar sync is nice. Built in alarms also.  *Have not done much with pics, but plan too.  *This is my first ipod, I am sure others have similar features, I love the ability to look up songs by ALBUM, ARTIST, RECENTLY PURCHASED, RECENTLY PLAYED, TOP 25, GENRE, etc. Nice feature.  * Volume is good, when played real loudly some minor distortion.  * Color screen and 4gig flash is awesome!   *Recharging via USB is a breeze! Hint: I bought the Apple power chargerto hook into outlet via USB, if you are are the road and don't have a computer power source you need this. NOT included in package.     All in all , I am pleased, with the size, battery life, color screen, and features. Just wished Apple had used some good material on the casing.All in all, four stars, if you wait until Apple corrects the casing, or use the soon to be on the market cases, you will be fine. I have also heard the PDA clear screen protectors work.

<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best.

<Title>Great little MP3 player
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my Black iPod nano since last Friday and I have to say it is fantastic. I was skeptical about how nice the screen would look being so small but it is crystal clear and beautiful. Pictures and games show up really well with great detail. Putting songs and pictures on it through iTunes is a little annoying because I was so used to my creative zen player being able to drag and drop everything easily.  Its size is just amaizing and is perfect for when I go jugging. I bought a pink armband and it works really well. Navigating the menus is very easy and the shuffle songs feature works really well. Most other MP3 players I have had tend to repeat the same songs but with this one it is very random. Excellent little device, I can't wait to see what else apple comes up with.

<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Im new to iPod having got on just fine with my Archos Mp3 player for the past 4 years - so this review is not from an 'iCult' member who thinks Apple can do no wrong.  The size and weight is undoubtably the biggest selling point - it does feel great to hold in your hands and you can't help admire the design.  No adapter plug is a huge let down - having to charge it via the USB cable is a hassle.  What's the point of having a 'go anywhere' MP3 player if you have to lug a laptop around with you to charge it??   Sure you can shell out another $30 for a plug from Apple, but shouldn't an adapter be included for this price?  Another hassle is the reliance on the iTunes software to upload tunes/files etc onto the nano - I guess you iPoders are used to this, but with my Archos I could just plug it into any computer with a USB port and drag files onto it without prior loading any software   Plus - Small size - Lightweight - Good sound  Minus - No adapter plug!!   - you need the iTunes software to put files onto it

<Title>Nice Upgrade from iPod Mini
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As soon as Apple introduced the iPod Nano it caught my interest as a small, convenient MP3 player perfectly made for air travel. Because of its 4 gigs of memory and smaller size, the Nano can be easily slipped it into a shirt pocket, play hours of music, and be forgotten. Despite the fact it was fairly evident that scratches could be an issue due to the glossy surface, I purchased the black version since it matched my Etymotic ER4P earplugs and cord. When the Nano arrived I left the original clear film protector on the front of the player and purchased skin covers until something better could be found.   The sound produced by the Nano is excellent, it is very difficult to tell any difference from other iPods. The Nano has also perfomed equally well with iTunes, music downloads, and the computer interface. However, there is one performance issue that has been troubling, and that concerns battery power. The Nano is advertised as having 14 hours of battery strength, yet after three weeks of use it appears to have the same power range as its predecessor the iPod Mini. That issue has been a rather significant disappointment so far, but hopefully the battery will become more efficient with usage. Overall Apple has done quite well with the new iPod Nano, just treat it gently as you would with any other electronic device and it will meet most expectations.

<Content>This nano is one of the smallest players on the market today. Despite the small form factor, at 4GB the iPod nano holds more than any other flash player out there, and comes in a package nearly a third the size of other MP3 players with the same storage capacity.  Pros: Slim; intuitive; under-rated 15-hour battery; vivid color LCD; rich sound; games; now works with Outlook; skip-free; fast write times; no need for partitioning to use as USB Mass Storage Device.   Cons: Non-replaceable battery; no FM/voice/line-in recorder; doesn't replace 6GB iPod mini's storage capacity.  Verdict: Slim, stylish, and fully loaded, the iPod nano is a great deal for a flash-based MP3 player.

<Content>The nano is definitely the way to go. I've got room for 1000 songs - who needs anymore? I just put my favorite songs on there and am up to 175 or so (as of 11/9/06). I think the black ipods look more elegant than the white ones, plus they seem to be less common. :D Which is good.:D I love the size and the simplicity of the process. Of course, it's NOT the ipod to watch movies on because the screen is so small, but even the video ipods have smaller screens. If you're gonna watch a movie, watch it on a TV.   Everyone wishes for an everlasting battery, but this battery is not bad. Mine is relatively new, and I've heard that the battery juice goes down with age, but right now I'm very happy with the life of the battery. I don't use the ipod for hours on end - I DO have a social life.

Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze.  Im so pissed at this thing because im all exicted to finnaly listen to some music and get amped in the gym and the dang thing freezes. For the money i spent on this thing it shouldnt happen

<Content>.. or any album, (e.g. many Dance, Classical or Progressive Rock picks) where the tracks run together seemlessly. In other words, NO GAPLESS PLAYBACK. Instead you get a split second of silence interrupting tracks that should run together without any disturbance.  Completely unforgivable for a 5th generation product from the Market Leader!  Bad Apple!  Gary  P.S. The MP3 format has a flaw which means some silence is always present at the end of a song. But the popular LAME encoding method for MP3s embeds a value containing the proper length of the track into the file so that the decoder can tell when the file should be cut and the next mp3 in sequence should start playing.

<Title>Going for my third Ipod
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So.. I bought a Nano. took it with me to work, was waiting in a doctors waitingroom while I opened it. Its amazingly small and light. I was a little shocked to read that there is no AC adaptor, and a little annoyed that there is not even like a demo song on it or anything. An hour, and several games of solitare later, the back has one fairly major scratch and a lot of fingerprints, and Im thinking of returning it, but wondering if that scratch will stop that. I leave the plastic protective dealy on the front, and take it home. It took me about an hour to master the itunes dealy, and I get some music on it.  At this point, I plug in my oldschool koss headphones that I love, and am immediatly blown away by the sound. about 20 minutes later, I discover podcasting, and realize even If i return the nano, Im going to have to get something to replace it(this being my first non-cd mp3 player). So I gave it a few days, slung it around a bit. More scratching, but it didnt realy flex, so I figure its probly pretty durable. Im loving it, but wishing I had a 4 rather than a 2 gb.  after a week, I take it to work with me, intending to take it jogging after work. But when I pull it out, the screen is missing about half of its lines, in the middle. And, the volume control dosnt work. click wheel does, but no volume, and its stuck on blast. It was wrapped inside of a folded handkerchief, which was inside of the cloth bag I got with my oakleys. Dont know what happened, but now Im thinking "well sh*t". I am out $200.   I took it back to the store, and they were gracious about the return(thank heaven), but persuaded me to get a second one. that was this afternoon. I got home, and decided that I really want the 4 gb, not this second 2. And I want to avoid the scratching issue, so I will try the silicon nanotubes. Since I hadnt even opened the second one, I will be returning it first thing next week, in its sealed package. I can wait for a 4 gb to be available.  I ordered it(my third nano, a black 4 gb) direct from apple this afternoon, with a set of the "nano tubes". I learned with the first one... When it arrives, It will be staying sealed in its package untill the cases I ordered with it arrive. Even then, I will be leaving the plastic cover on the front, inside the case. And I will be finding a hard case for rough travel and storage(when its gotta go in a backpack, or when I am road tripping). I think a nice soap holder will fit perfectly. Yay cheap, eh?  I think the screen thing will be biting apple in the arse. I also think that they really should look into a more durable scratch resistant coat. you cant proof it, and I like the mirror finish, but a little bit of work on this would likely yield big for the product line.   With that said, I am loving the idea, and the product. I will have an use an Ipod Nano, probably for as long as the product line Exists. perfect size, shape, etc.  My only 2 regrets are that there is no FM, and that I can't get a U2 Nano. That would make for a truely kick behind product combo. maybe a future version. I would easily shelled out 2-3 times the cost for a scratch resistant, radio recieving, U2 Ipod Nano.  Oh.. and someone needs to push a little on the availability of the nano Accessories. 4-6 week wait for some of that? no good.  Buy a Nano. Try a Nano. Im not just just the president, Im a member(now)

<Title>where is the volume for my hard rock?
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>ok, i am a bit disappointed with the scratches, considering i have even made sure there is absolutely nothing else in the pocket than the black nano. but is it only my hearing or is the sound very low? even when its turned as loud as possible its still very low. and i am aware of the "soundcheck" feature. but is it possible that it turns all the songs at a similar low level as the one it used to measure to begin with? On the plane to Riga last week it was impossible to hear music through the noise of the engine. and thet surely never happened with my sony discman. or is the american apple so scared of being sued for messing up peoples hearing that they are acting as "parents" and put the max volume at a safe level.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Tue Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP-3 type player.  I chose Apple because I felt it was just easier to use with the iTunes as opposed to Napster. I love my Nano. All of it, the iTunes, the Nano itself is so easy to use.  The music quality is excellent and the size is almost impossibly small.  I've heard that the glass over the color screen is susceptible to cracking if you're not careful, so obviously, I'll be careful.  I love the random shuffle, the different playlists, the genres, artists, etc., all the different categories you can play with.  I've had this for 4 days now. I was reluctant at first to get one of these. But the convenience of storing all of your CD's, selecting which songs you want and never having to fuss with changing the discs is just so nice.  I bought the splitter cable and can hook it up to any  stereo system.  The 4GB model just seemed more sensible to have given that I've already loaded 500+ songs into it and my CD collection is relatively minimal.  I like the flexibility of adding more if I want to and not worrying about the space.  A really great buy.

<Content>the real question when you are picking out an mp3 player  - is not what brand you want. duh, you want apple!   -is not what kind of ipod you want.  You want a nano. the newest, the slimest, the coolest.     -its not if you can deal with scraches or not.  If you are buying an ipod, use it for function, not fashon.   The real question is  What color do you want!  White  Does not scrach as easy  looks just like a real ipod!  white can go with your wedding dress!  Black  sorta scraches not like you care looks cool, black is very sleek idunno, black is different for an ipod  Yah, i hope my review helped a lot of people with the same problem as i had.

<Title>Nano - 5 Stars Apple - minus 5 Stars
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Being the only person in the family without an ipod I decided to buy a nano when the black ones became available so today while wandering the local mega mall I stopped at the Apple Store and picked one up.  As a first time buyer/user I was very disappointed by the lack of documention for the itunes software and the lack of a case or at least a clip for the nano.  The itunes software instaled easily enough even if it took a dog year to load but I was surprised when I played my first mp3 file using itunes and it has so much processing lag that it has an echo making it unusable to listen to even mp3 voice files. This problem cannot be blame on my computer as both windows media player and winamp work perfectly.  Also the itunes software is not intuative. It took me five minutes to figure out how to get mp3s that were on my laptop onto the nano and I'm still not sure exactly what I did to get the files to load on the nano. Guess I'll have to ask my daughter.  I was also disapointed by the lack of a case. Steve Jobs is ripping off his customers. It wouldn't have cost Apple $0.25 to have included a small cloth bag to keep the nano in or for $0.50 they could have included a plastic case. Guess I'll have to build the altiod case that I saw in a ipod forum till real cases become available.  There also is no clip. This is a real short coming as the nano is so small that it will easily slip out of your pocket and there is no good way to keep your nano secure when using while working out at the gym.  That said the nano is a 10, no question. Apples greed though tempers my enthusiasm for the nano.

I no longer have to carry a bulky cd case or get pissed because my cd started skipping or drop my cds or keep switching cds everytime my mood changed, ahhh, i could go on and on. I bring it everywhere, especially to work so I can listen to my micheal jackson when someone starts yelling at me! At first I was skeptical that I'd spent too much money on a music player, but then I considered all i've spent on batteries and replacing my cd player or buying cds. This is well worth the price. AND It's a perfect way to ignore people! I'm just trying to control myself so I won't start dancing like a buffon in the streets...I sing at the top of my lungs when i'm alone though, hehe.

<Title>Very cool... great sounding and every accessory you could ever want.
<Date>Sat Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my Nano a couple weeks ago for just under two-hundred bucks. I have the black version. I also purchased Sennheiser CX300 earbuds to upgrade from the decidedly vanilla sounding earbuds that come with the Nano. In addition, I also picked up a black leather Belkin folding case to protect my investment. I really couldn't be happier with this purchase, as a musician and a music lover in general. The sound quality is actually quite superb. In my opinion, I think it's best to encode MP3's at high variable bit rate since this player will show the flaws in lower encoded music. I'm just beginning to get comfortable with the Itunes software. It still seems overcomplicated compared to most flash drive players. It would be nice if you could simply drag and drop from your PC or laptop to the player, but it's not an option. Reading the help files will help you to understand how to use the software feature functions.  The Ipod itself has many features including a contacts list, timer, many EQ presets and more things that I can't remember off the top of my head.  I hear that the 8gb version will be or has been released now. I guess for the extra 50 bucks it may be worth it to some people, but for my money and to remain within my budget constraints, I decided to spend that money on the headphone upgrade which was well worth it. The Sennheisers are better than the stock earphones - Hands down. They also play much more efficently requiring less power from your IPod which also increases your battery life. If you can find a set, pick them up, it's well worth it. The battery life for the Nano is rated for 14 hours, but if you tend to play with it a lot and skip around playing different tunes from different playlists, you will burn up your battery quite a bit faster than that.  The IPod is much smaller than it seems to appear in pictures and is also very thin. You could have this in your pocket and easily forget about it so be carefull not to run it through the wash!  The desirability factor is high with this player, everyone wants one these. IPod has instant name recognition and you have to make sure you don't leave it laying around or someone may just slip it into there pocket and now you're out a couple hundred bucks and you'll need to reinvest in a new one.  Overall an excellent player. Very sexy and stylish with excellent sound quality. If you can afford it, get one. Or steal someone elses if you're slick enough.... just kidding. But seriously, this is well worth the money for anyone like myself who can't stand to be without music while on the go. You can also purchase an FM transmitter to allow you to play through any stereo that has an FM tuner, that way all stored music is accessible and can be amplified whether you're in the car or at home and want to listen to your tracks over your home stereo system. Like I said, get one. You'll be happy you did.

<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nifty little device. The only advice I would give about it is to go to Apple's website to order it, because you now have the option on their site to get a Project RED iPod.  A number of companies are participating in Project RED by donating a percentage of their profits towards the purchase of anti-retroviral drugs to help fight AIDS in Africa. The Project RED iPod is also bright red, which also stirs awareness for the cause, as I believe red iPods are otherwise unheard of.  So, yeah. Get an iPod, listen to your tunes, download my band when our album comes out. And, while you're at it, do something good for other people (apart from Apple's shareholders, who I'm sure are doing just fine). Support the cause.

<Title>NANO excellent despite software problems
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my new Apple 4 GB iPod Nano Black in most respects.  But clearly Apple clearly has a problem with these devices unexpectedly going into "Alvin and the Chipmunks" mode (unintelligibly high-speed playback).  This is the second one in a row I've had with this problem.  And I've seen a lot of feedback on this in their forum.  I think the problem is in the software, and so that holds out some hope that Apple may have a fix for it.  In the meantime, I just stop and restart when that happens.  I mostly listen to audiobooks; and the iPod nano is otherwise great for this purpose.  In particular, I exploit very frequently the ability to re-position myself (down to the second) within the current book at any time.  That's an invaluable feature that I haven't seen on any MP3 players.

<Title>Can't beat the design!
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I resisted the dark side for years, but someone special bought me a black 4GB Nano as a gift and I'm a convert.  The form factor, ease of use, and reliability are unmatched.  Really, it's hard to imagine comfortably using anything smaller than this.  Of course, having "only" 4GB is a trade-off because it's not going to hold your entire music library.  The only major gripe so far is the weak accessory support.  The Tubes aren't out, the lanyard headphones are sold out, not much in the way of screen protectors yet.  Things to realize: (1) yes, it's fragile, so don't sit on it; (2) it's so small that the risk of losing it is considerable; (3) USB 2.0 is a must--according to the manual, 1.x may not work and Firewire is good for charging only.

<Content>I purchased an iPod Nano 2 weeks ago. When I brought it home, I had forgotten something. A case to protect it. I had to call the Apple store to ask if they made a case and they said, "No we don't. We are coming in soon." Why is it taking so long for Apple to create a case? My iPod isn't scratched yet because I left the wrapping on it. If you buy a product that is so fragile and scratchable, wouldn't you want to buy a case? Come on Apple, make a case already. P.S. Keep the wrapping on your iPod, so it won't get scratches. Take the wrapping off when you buy a case.

The Zen Micro is awesome and holds much more music and is not real big either. Everyone talks about how cool these are. My friend has one and I convinced him that he wasted his money. Well, I think they suck because they don't deliver. Anyway, if you want to look at pictures (which is what a computer or camera is for) or want a small player that holds very little music, here you go. If you want something that is worth the money, buy a Zen Micro.

<Title>Highly Recommended with one big caveat......
<Date>Sat Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just received my Nano from Apple and was very impressed at first sight.  Of course the design is great, since this seems to be Apple's highest priority with it's products.  I skipped on buying any of the previous iPod versions since the third generation model of the original (just before the "click-wheel" was introduced).  I was waiting for something to justify spending so much money on so little memory (my cd collection is HUGE so 4 GB is a drop in the proverbial bucket) and I decided this was it.    I love practically everything about this product.  The screen is great and I haven't had the problems others have reported (although I'm treating it with kid-gloves).  I have left on the protective plastic film that comes on iPods until I can pick up some sleeves, and this has prevented any scratching.  In fact, everything on this is great except for.........THE MAJOR PROBLEM----  Transfering songs is amazingly slow because it doesn't support FireWire.  Perhaps i'm spoiled but the USB connection is so noticeably slower that I have cannot give it a full fledged 100%, gotta-go-get-it recommendation.  I guess it's okay if you don't constantly fill it with new music, but since I do, I tend to care about this issue more perhaps than others.  I'm hoping this can somehow be changed in the future, but until then I'll still use my old, big iPod for traveling when I need to take a lot of new music and files with me and my Nano for going around the city (NYC) casually.  Other than that, the black Nano is probably the coolest thing i've purchased in the last year.  I just hope they don't try to make it any smaller because then no one will be able to read the screen.

<Content>I have heard so many complaints about the scratching, the lack of storage, and the lack of accessories. The only justified complaint I can see there is the scratching issue. Apple should have used a little bit more tough of a polymer coating. That's ok, and I'll tell you why. SPECK CASES. No one has ever heard of this company, and its ridiculous. They make the best cases for any iPod, including the nano. www.speckproducts.com thats it. Check it out. Back to the iPod, its beautiful. The flash memory is amazing, seeing as it can handle alot more bumps and bruises (If you have a Speck Case). About the complaints of not being able to hold enough songs, well, i sorta see your point, but its not that bad. 1,000 songs should keep you satisfied till oyu can replace some. Another  idea, stop downloading the entire CD!! Just get the good songs, not all the fillers. It is totally worth it, and get the 4GB. BUY IT! lolb

<Title>Amazing technology!
<Date>Tue Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First the good, then the bad.  After using this for a week I still cannot believe the incredibly tiny size!! I know it's hardly any shorter than the iPod Mini and not that much narrower, but believe me... the thinness of the device REALLY makes it feel small and it is incredibly lightweight. I can have it in the shirt pocket of my SILK shirt and it isn't even noticeable!  As for durability, I haven't had it long enough (or tried dropping it) to find out, but I read an online review of the iPod Nano recently and they put it through all kinds of abuse and it still worked. Anyway, even though it is so tiny and lightweight, it actually still feels like a well constructed, solid, good-quality device. It doesn't feel cheap at all.  Just so you know... THE SCRATCHING ISSUE IS NOT A PROBLEM anymore. I was told that it was just the first run of iPod Nanos produced that had this issue. The one I bought is fine. I've been carrying it around for days now and there are no scratches. There are, however, a multitude of fingerprints all over it (they are most noticeable on the silver back) but no scratches yet (knock on wood!) At least the fingerprints are removable!  Now, I can't really comment too much on the battery life because I never use it for more than a couple of hours before I connect it to the computer again (and of course, this charges it). But just as a test I tried setting the screen backlight to "always on" and setting it on repeat play, and it still took several hours to drain the battery. And I usually have the backlight turned off (set so it only turns on when I hold down the menu button) because the color screen is actually still reasonably visible under average lighting conditions (like on the bus, etc.) without using the backlight at all. This should extend battery life significantly.  But... there are a few things I don't like about the iPod Nano. First of all, I find that if I use any of the EQ effects (especially Bass Booster), over half of my songs are distorted. And I know that this is not a result of the MP3 files being ripped improperly because they have always played fine on any of my previous MP3 players (non-iPods), with various sets of headphones. I bought a 20GB iPod about 2.5 years ago which had this same problem so I took it back and decided not to buy iPods for a while. When I bought the iPod Nano I was assuming that they would have fixed this problem by now, but I guess not. But, since I REALLY love the tinyness of the iPod Nano and can't resist it, I've decided to live with keeping my EQ effects "off" to avoid the distortion. I'm going to see if I can get some better headphones with more bass.  Another thing I don't like is that the iPod Nano cannot play regular AAC files that were created with another program. It will only play AAC files (.M4A) that were either purchased online through the iTunes store, or ripped from a CD using iTunes. This normally wouldn't be such a big deal except that I had prepared the AAC files ahead of time. Since I had to wait a couple of weeks for a 4GB iPod Nano to be in stock, and I had read that the iPod Nano could play AAC files, I spent a lot of time converting all my 128kbps MP3 files to 64kbps AAC files (so I could still fit most of my music collection on the Nano). After all this work, I discovered that the iPod Nano couldn't play them and am in the midst of re-encoding them from CD. And to make matters worse, since all my original CDs are in storage since I moved, for each album I have to burn an audio CD-RW first, then label all the tracks manually and rip it again through the iTunes software. I would think that for any previous iPod owner this probably won't be an issue if you've already got your AAC files, unless you want to change to a different bitrate. Personally, I can hardly notice a difference in the sound quality between my 128kbps MP3's and 64kbps AAC's, so having this option is a definite plus for me.  One thing to keep in mind if you purchase an iPod Nano: it will still cost you more money after you buy it! First of all, the battery will only charge through USB or an optional $30 accessory adaptor so you can plug it into the wall. So, you're either going to be spending $30 to buy the adaptor to charge it from the wall outlet, or spending more money on your monthly power bill for having to keep your power-hungry PC turned on all night while the iPod Nano charges off the USB.  Other minor problems: - volume can only be adjusted from the "now playing" screen (a dedicated volume control wheel on the side would be nice! - you need to connect it to a PC (and leave PC on!) to charge it - most songs have distorted sound if you use the EQ effects  Anyway, it's still a good player and I still can't believe how TINY IT IS! I still recommend it as long as you can get past the minor shortfalls I mentioned above.

<Content>I have the IPOD 30GB Color. I've managed to fill it half way. That's around 5000 songs. I became very paranoid that I'd lose it somehow via theft, dropping, etc. 5000 songs took me a long time and the thought of losing it has been on my mind for a while. My salvation arrived in the form of the NANO. My new 4GB nano is my traveling ipod, my cutting the grass ipod etc.  My 30GB is now a permanant part of my home computer audio. I've backed it up and thus the collection stays safe. With the NANO I decide what I want to listen to and transfer it over from the 30GB (you need a utility to do this) or copy over some CD's. The NANO is really tiny and with the memory being flash instead of a hard drive, less moving parts makes it more crash proof. It's a great product at a great price. Apple delivers once again.

<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the black one and got a few scratches on it.  I jog every weekend for about 25 minutes each morning.  Condensation got under the screen and it's not covered in my warranty.  It still works but for this price, unexcusable.

<Title>Itchy and Scratchy
<Date>Tue Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I am walking to work, listening to music on my iPod, all is well.  But to adjust it, I must get it out of the protective cocoon I have devised.  Just like so many other folks, I proudly handed my new iPod to friends and family the first day I got it.  Then I looked at it -- Ugh!  It looked like I dragged it along a sidewalk for a mile by the headphones.  I went to Decalgirl and got some skins to cover it -- but too late.  It is not ruined but....  How does Black Nano work?  Well, the synching with iTunes, etc., works fine.  And the sound is OK but I agree with others that anyone interested should look seriously at the Mini.  The Mini is tough, has loads of accessories (including cases!), and works well.    And finally -- when is Apple going to ship a complete product?  For $250, the Nano should come with decent headphones, a travel/home charging kit, and, most of all, a protective case.  If Apple had any sense they'd throw in $10 worth of iTunes songs as an intro to that service.

<Title>What a great invention
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Remember the days when you actually had to carry around a big bulky walkmen and all the cds to go with it? Well I do and let me tell you I dont miss thoughs days one bit. This ipod nano is great and lets you carry just about every song you own and is super small and portable. I carry it just about every where I go in the store in the car, I mean theres no place this thing cant go. The only complaint I have about it is that the battery doesnt last for 7 or however many hours it says it does, your LUCKY if you get 2 full hours of continuos playing. But other then that this is great and totally worth the money only if your a major music listener. And I highly recommend you getting a protective case because it is fragil and scratches easy, and you would want one that protects the entire body of the ipod including the wheel and screen, otherwise you'll be sorry. But the ipod is a great divise and I've already gotten my moneys worth out of it and I'll be using it for many more years to come.

<Title>One of the best inventions yet
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After a lot of years of using a cd player, it is quite nice to carry something as compact as an ipod/mp3. It is amazing what technology has managed to do.  For anybody wishing to buy an ipod I would certainly recommend it, you might pay more for it than any other mp3 but it certainly comes with some great extras, like the itunes program where you can look up songs and then download then for just 99c each. Now when you look at buying an ipod the only question is how many songs do you want it to hold and what do you want to do with it, like listen to music or watch movies on it. Now the only other question is are you ready for an ipod.

<Title>Didn't work 
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>While this is a great invention- when it works, it was very disappointing that the IPOD shipped was totally defective and had to be replaced. This required a trip to the Apple store over 60 miles away after ruling out it wasn't a problem with the computer.  The only explanation, sometimes there's a bad one.  But, This was a new purchase after the initial IPOD my daughter owned died after little over one year of use.  It seems that the quality and longevity of the ipod is not there.  For the price, I would expect the ipod to last longer than 1 year and this defective item doesn't inspire confidence in the product.

<Title>Fantastic
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I will never buy a CD again.  This black nano is a watershed moment in my music listening career.  20 years ago I bought a huge CD player for a hundreds of dollars and could only get very few CD's at record stores.  For much less I get so much more with an IPOD Nano.  Totally intuitive design, flawless execution.  I reccomend this for anyone who is a music lover.  I especially dig the Nano because I can run with it no problem as it weighs only a few ounces.  I feel bad for people who are still carrying CD players around the lakes that I run around on a regular basis.  They all should have this product.  It is really fantastic.  JVD

<Content>I got this not knowing anything about IPods so when it arrived I was really lost but after reading the directions carefully, I finally got it all figured out!! I love having the ability to just upload any song I want and go!! Couldn't do this with a CD player, unless you bought the whole CD and brought all the CDS with you! This IPOD is for anyone that loves to exercise, easy to take with you and makes time go by faster! I think you MUST get a case to protect it, it is very delicate... Only thing I don't like is how you control turning the volume up and down, the buttons are so touchy

<Title>Wonderful!
<Date>Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is such a lovely piece of equipment, i've owned this for like 8months now and i think i can review it fairly. This device has accompanied me in the worst conditions and it has never let me down, it looks great, sounds great, and most of all is so tiny and light u don't even feel it in ur pocket. I've jogged with it i've ran with it its really great. The only withdraw with it and this is why i'm giving it a four star is the battery, i wish the battery would stay a little bit longer than it does. They say 14hrs on the apple website but that isn't true if u count the time u waste searching for a particular song or changing from one album to the other or one artist to the other it'll end up like in 8hrs. Also i wished that apple would supply more accessories with it. Like come on? why doesn't it come with a decent protective case and a power adapter? it just isn't fair. A piece of advice if u are buying it, get a protective case it'll save u so much trouble, it'll break ur heart if it gets scratched, there are plenty of nice cases around the web.

<Title>Terrible Customer Service
<Date>Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my 4 GB iPod nano less than one year ago (it is still under warranty). However, recently, the screen does not show up (even though it does light up). I called customer service and I received an email and followed all the steps to restore my Ipod. Unfortunately, it did not bring about any changes. So my phone call was then directed to a manager named Janet, who I had to wait for half an hour to speak to. I explained for something that costs 250, it should at least last more than a year. I did not want to have to deal with the hassles of sending my Ipod back and receiving a receiving a refurbished Ipod that is only under warranty for another 3 months. Although, I am under warranty, it still costs 30 dollars to have it shipped/serviced for that "new" refurbished Ipod. The other option available is that I pay 59 dollars to have the product under warranty for another year (and then the shipping/service to have it fixed is waived). But what I'm saying is, "How can a customer have faith in a refurbished product when a brand new product could not last an entire year?" Janet, the manager, said that this was the only option for me, even though my Ipod was still under warranty. The "warranty" that they advertise is apparently, up to them to decide on the spot (they get to use their discretion). I was then placed on hold again for another half an hour, only to be directed to customer service to have them tell me to go to a website to process the return myself anyways. I have lost complete confidence in apple products and apple customer service; had I not invested so much in my Ipod I would thrown this Ipod away a long time ago.

<Title>Slick!
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The black iPod Nano is perhaps the most slick portable music player I have ever seen. It looks far better than its white version, but it does scratch easily. If you want a good and sleek music player that lasts long and continues to look good, I would suggest wait till its accessories come to the market (most importantly, durable covers similar to the ones for the Mini). I would think they should be hitting the market fairly soon. However, if you want a new toy to brag to your friends about, get it now before every other person is seen with it! (PS: For those who own a Bose sound system for the iPod, you'll be glad to know that the Nano is compatible with it...you don't need to spend anything extra!)

<Title>The Perfect Replacement For Your Mini
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>With the Nano's release I saw the perfect replacement for my aging iPod Mini.  I'm rarely this pleased with purchases.  Simply put, this iPod is superior in every way.  Prehaps most importantly is the Nano's weight and size.  Looking at pictures doesn't do it justice, you have to really hold one in your hand to realize its true size.  I found the lighter weight was a noticable improvement over the Mini when I'm out running.  Additionally the battery life is superior and the screen is sharper and brighter (not to mention being in color.)  While I had read some warnings about the ease of scratching the screen I've yet to have this happen.  Additionally the price of these Nano's is higher than the Mini's they're replacing.  Overall another excellent product from Apple.

<Title>iPod nano, A hit or horrible product?
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned an iPod mini for about 5 months now, and when the nano came out I was considering selling my mini on ebay and then buying a nano. Thank's to my friend buying one that he dropped on carpate and haveing it break in half and another person I know do the same thing but have the screen only stop working I decided not to. The iPod mini is durable I dropped mine on brik pavers and it only has 3 scrates and it works perferct and it wasn't in a case it dropped because it fell out of the belt clip that came with it. Try to find an iPod mini somewhere, and save yourself. But if you do go with the nano I'm not to blame for the horrible design flaw when your's breaks.  P.S.- I forgot go to somewhere with them on display you can see that the black scrates easily so get white I you decide to ignore what happend to the people I know.

<Title>Durable Flash Drive, Great Design
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Nano is great, I absolutely am a huge fan of it.  With flash drives manufactured by Samsung, it offers great durability.  So no more spinning components, as your data is stored in its flash drive.Of the old i-Pods that break, it is mostly due to a burned out hard drive.  Flash drives will certainly offer us people the durability.  Some testers have gone as far as dropping it out of a 2 story house and also dropped it out of a car going 30 mph, and while it did away with the screen, the drive was still intact and running.  As far as scratches, I would recommend keeping it out of your pockets (especially your back pockets, if you were to sit down, that would not be good!), away from any objects such as keys and coins.  At 1.5 oz., it is not exactly a tank, but also not brittle.  Also get a plastic clear cover (with screen and scroll coverage) to avoid any scratches, after all, you will be viewing great quality color.  I would recommend getting a cover ASAP. Check out www.decalgirl.com for a great selection of plastic covers, they are only a few dollars.  I would recommend a clear one if you want to still "look" at the beautiful nano.  I usually wear it around my neck, as its real light (fits great in a shirt pocket), and what a better way to floss your newest Apple toy. Industry sources have noted that Apple bought out Samsung's overstock of 2 and 4 gigabyte flash drives, and rumor has it that Samsung is manufacturing 16 gigabyte versions as we speak.Be sure to look out for 16 gigabyte nanos in the near future.  Bravo to Steve Jobs on another great creation, "I am truly smitten."

<Date>Mon Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I won this device in a trade show drawing and after a week of use I remain only maginally impressed.  Pros: - almost cresit card size - decent interface, click wheel in nice. - Parchute game is cool - pictures and album art on display - compatiable with (book tapes)...via clunky interface with itunes  Cons - Apple iTunes is no where near as good as windows media 10, and if you have an Ipod you are married to it. Windows media lets you choose dozens of music stores... with iTunes your stuck paying apple the highest prices. - no recording capability!! - no FM - can only charge battery with USB port without buying a $49 wall charger. - really really fragile. - no support for Napster's subcription service (big drawback)    If I were shopping for a small MP3 player I would consider a Creative or iRiver model over the Nano. Better yet the discontinued 5GB Rio Carbon has been selling places for $99.
