<Title>Creative Support Sucks
<Date>Sun Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have one of these, and i am on my 3rd time trying to get it fixed. the hard drive has issues. first one locked up completely no warning. the replacement, stopped playing, then the replacement for the replacement right out of the box from creative wouldn't even power up and i can't even get them to send me a replacement for the one that was bad that they sent to me.  on a good note. i can say that once u figure out how the software works it is a very good player to have. lots of songs held, but when it crashes better have backups cause u r going to lose everything.

<Title>I would give it 10 stars if given the option
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Creative products is by all means the best i've ever experienced. I could be a spokesman for them if given the chance, lol. The Nomad is very easy to navigate at your thuumbs disgresion. I love the fact that it's compatable with all media programs. WMP, MusicMatch. But the best to organize and sinc music is real player. If you don't want to spend a lot of money and want quality over looks then this is the product for you. the only bad thing about this wonderful gadget is the charger port. I couln't stress this enough; you have to be very careful in handeling the charger. because of the type of por it is after prolonged use of continued charging the port will come loose. It doesn't have a docking station which would help eliminate charging it through the little port. If you are going to invest in this product I would try getting an extended warrantee with it. Other than this, everything about it is awsome especially the ease of creating a playlist. I no longer have it because again the port broke off after a while. I bought a crative vision m for my wife. I only have 3 words for it. Ipod killa, ok that's 2 words but i made my point, lol.

<Title>Fragile software & physically.  Customer service is a plague.
<Date>Sat Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought it for the raved-over sound ("better than iPod"), but came to regret it...  Owned a 20 Gb Zen.  Customer service will not even accept your call without a credit card number up front, after 90 days.  Their website suggests firmware updates for any/all funky behavior.  But this locks up the unit permanently.  Can play it; just never again can add songs to it, or alter existing playlists.  Creative knows this problem and will not fix it.  Foolishly, I then bought their 60 Gb (same model as the 40 Gb here; just more memory).  Worked a couple months, then froze up unrecoverably.  Several weeks of wading through an amazingly unavailable, incompetent and utterly unconcerned "customer service", I got the same player back, utterly untouched; totally dead.  Several more weeks slogging through the same hours on automated call centers, waiting to talk to a human who doesn't even listen to you describe your need, and is aggresively incompetent, then weeks waiting for them to repair and resend a refurb, ...  and it is a totally nonworking and dented refurb.  More weeks and the same exacted dented refurb is sent to me again, utterly unworking.  MANY more weeks and I finally receive a refurb that works.  Total time wrestling with this utter incompetence: 7 months ! ! !   Though this all started within the initial paltry 90-day warrantee, this quickly dragged on beyond it, and I had to buy the rather expensive 1-year extended warrantee early in that fiasco just to be able to get them to accept my phone calls at all.  Now I have a player that gives that great Zen sound (true enough), but can't take even the slightest justling.  They aren't kidding when they say "don't wear it even walking."  It resets nearly every step.  That is utterly no exaggeration.  I found wearing it in a just the right "fanny pack" allows me to wear it lifting weights, provided I make no sudden moves. But clip in to my short's waist band, and it reset every 10-30 seconds.  Not fun.  Many reviewer gush over the "awesome" software.  It's o-kay.  But it lacks some obvious capabilities.  Like their own file manager cannot move files between folders without Zen losing track of them: they still show in your library, but clicking on them finds nothing and so Zen goes at random to another song.  You have to re-"import" every song moved this way.  A major pain in the but, if you move a large library to an external hard drive.  Also, you can't sort your on-screen display in a playlist by any of the columns (like song title, album, artist, year, style, rating. etc.).  Makes for a lot of manual searching.  Slow and boring.  Also, there is no way at all to keep track of which playlists you have added a song to, except to manually scroll through every playlist and manually look for each track among all the tracks in that list.  Would it be so hard to have a feature that shows what playlists any given track has been added to?  What I am holding out for, is a flash memory player with at least 16 Gb.  Sony recently came out with an 8 Gb.  These are extremely robust versus jostling.  But I need at least 16 Gb, if not 30-60, for my library.  And I didn't buy a high end MP3 player to compress all that CD quality sound down to some crappy little file size.  When one of the big boys finally make a real player, I will pay whatever they want for it.

<Title>"doesn't care less" after sales service + faulty equipment = disaster
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm just trying to be concise and objective, because I can't believe i got screwed twice with Creative. Bottomline is: - their product are priced lower than competition (price/ Mb is attractive), they seem decent with no shiny options, like the kind of equipment you want for your buck. - their product are fragile and faulty. And it's not this particular one (with movable hard disk parts), I own another Creative Muvo c100, and they are reboot with no reason, or freeze. - their software is so painful to master, with little tricks to make it work if you spend litterally hours on it... - and the worse is... their after sales service. People, trust me on this, your Creative piece of equipment will break, other 3 guys (out of 3)in the Office had issues with their Creative: battery, software incompatibility with other softs, movable pieces, cheap buttons, plastic box, screen... Their equipment looks cheap because it is cheap. No other reason. They could compensate this drawback with a good customer service, but I guess they don't have the bucks to serve the US market correctly. The Reps I talked to are decent guys, but they have no policy, no means to do anything. It looks like you talk to a Postal service chief in the 1950's eastearn Europe. in my case, after giving 15bucks for premier postal service, $25 bucks for Creative to look at my Jukebox, they requested 118-143 bucks (depending on the rep i talk to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) to repair their faulty stuff. In order to get that information, it took 20 days, around 30 emails, 3 phone calls over one hour. This is pathetic. Think twice before you want to spare some 50 bucks over an Iriver or other decent mp3 players.

<Title>Newest Firmware Upgrade Destroys Player
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's that simple. The newest firmware upgrade for this player halts mid-install, not completely installing. The player will not start, Windows will recognize the player, but because there is not a complete set of firmware on the player, Creative's own software will not recognize it (thus not allowing me to run another firmware upgrade on the player). Do not buy this product.  By the way, I'm not alone with my complaint. The creative forums are plagued with complaints of this.

<Title>A Reliable Product from a stellar company
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To begin with, I really do not recommend that anyone buy this product now (unless you can get it really cheap) because there have been so many advances since this came out.  I have had mine for almost two years with absolutely no problems.  I love this player.  Around the time I bought it I could get the most memory for it for the lowest price.  Yeah it was bigger and not as sleek, but it was definitely the right decision.  In general I feel that Creative as a company is superior.  All their products are well priced and of high quality.  So if you are going to buy an MP3 player go with Creative over Apple.  The Zen Vision M is cheaper and better overall.  Just go to c/net to look at the reviews.  While the 5th gen iPod scored slightly higher (.3 of a point)on the site review, the user satisfactory rating for the Zen Vision M was nearly 2 points higher.  Take your advice from the owners.  Creative does not disappoint.  And while Apple may be the giant, I feel that unless you want to conform to society go ahead, but Creative provides unique and better choices.

<Title>Dead after 1 year 5 months
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My wife & I bought two of these for Christmas in 2005 and loved them (our first MP3 players). Mine died 5-28-07 (5 mos out of warranty) and Creative's attitude is "so sorry, too bad, pay us for service, including online support or just fix it yourself." Read the postings on the Creative forum before you buy ANY of their products - CAVEAT EMPTOR. They have posted a firmware "upgrade" that frequently destroys the player. Woe be to the owner who hasn't  backed up his ripped files. I have, and am shopping for another player, but it won't be made by Creative, I guarantee. We still own 2 Zen MicroPhotos (8 GB) and her Zen Xtra still works, who knows for how long? BTW, Creative's software is junk; you would be much better served to buy Notmad Explorer.

<Title>Caveat Emptor - Buyer Beware
<Date>Fri Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Please Don't buy this product unless you plan on working pro bono as a tech for yourself on behalf of creative. The Player will eventually freeze up and attempts to fix officially using creative updated "play for sure" firmware software will "destroy your player for sure". Simple. I just wish i had read a little about this before attempting to upgrade the software and i might have salvaged what little was left of the player. The good reviews are simply from people who just haven't heard trouble with their products, It's not a question of if but when. You've been warned.

<Title>The Worst Technical Support Ever
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Zen Touch 40 GB MP3 player a year and a half ago. When it was working, it was relatively easy to use although the touch pad took some getting used to. The problem started when I decided to upgrade the firmware from their website a few weeks ago. As soon as the firmware upgrade was completed, my player died and I have been unable to revive it. When I e-mailed technical support I was told that since it was out of warranty, they could not help me either on the phone or even by e-mail unless I paid $19.00 an hour. When I explained that the problem did not start until I loaded THEIR FIRMWARE FROM THEIR WEBSITE, and that they should bear some responsibility and help me, they continued to insist that since the player was out of warranty, they could not provide technical support unless I pay.   My advice is if you buy Creative's products, sign up for a warranty, or never ever ever upgrade the firmware. Personally, I will never ever ever buy any Creative product again.

<Title>worried about the headphone jack problem?
<Date>Fri Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>According to nomadness.net, Creative Labs fixed the problem (that being, of course, the faulty headphone jack) -- shipments of new, corrected Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra players have been in stores for a little over a month now.  There are two ways to tell if you have the fixed Zen version.  #1. If the package you bought it in was heat-sealed, then you have the correct version. Heat-sealed means that it takes a lot of manpower plus knives/scissors to open up the package. The plastic is literally sealed together, not just glued together like with the old version. (You may want to pick this up at a real store instead of amazon.com, because you'll be able to see the package for yourself before buying. That is unless Amazon can confirm details about the package.)  #2. If the carry case for the Zen has a hole for the display. The older faulty version does not have this case, as you can tell from some negative reviews. So, if you put the case on the Zen and can see the display, there's a good chance you have the fixed version.  Hope this helps some of you.

<Title>Nice upgrades from 3 months ago
<Date>Wed Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a 40GB Zen Jukebox only 3 months ago after filling my 20GB and giving it to a friend.  Unfortunately, I recently lost it on a bus and felt lost, disconnected without my constant music library.    When I researched my new purchase, I was pleased to see not only a lower price but also a couple of upgrades from just a few months ago.  Notably, two of my problems about my last Zen were fixed:   1. Headphone jack was loose, causing sound problems with certain speakers/headphones.  Seems to me the included headphones sound better than the last ones, even though I prefer to use higher quality headphones.  2. the case now has with a view window, like the 20GB did (why they built the last 40GB version without a view window is beyond me).  This enhancement sounds minor, but it makes the difference between using the protective case or not.  With the pop-off front casing, the case is a requirement -- but without the view window, you have to take the case off to see what you're doing.  If you already have a unit without the view window, I'd recommend contacting Nomad to either purchase the new case or hopefully get it for free.  I LOVE this product.  Reloading my entire 5000 song library was a snap, running the process overnight and waking up with the entire library restored!  I love that I can use my WMA, MP3 and WAV format files and transfer between work and home computers.  Back to happy!

<Title>Very good value
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had mine since February 2004.  I chose it after a lot of research and based the decision on price/value and sound quality.  I held off reviewing it since I heard they were fragile and I wanted to see if it would hold up.  It has, with no problems.  (I broke the belt clip, but Creative sent me a replacement for $10.)  It's probably not something you want to take jogging with you, or drop onto a hard floor, but if you're reasonably careful it's not going to just disintegrate in your hands.  It works great and sounds great (with decent headphones, not the buds they give you with the player), and nearly my entire music collection fits in half the available drive space.  The battery life estimate is a little high for me, probably since I have a lot of higher bit rate files (160 Mb/S wmv's and 192 Mb/S mp3's).  But it's still fairly realistic.  My only complaints are:  1) the horrible PC software that comes with it - if you buy this player, buy Notmad Explorer from Red Chair Software and use it instead; and 2) the black plastic rocker switch thing that you use to scroll through lists and make selections feels flimsy and cheap.  Overall, I like it and would recommend it unless you know you're going to be rough with it.  The user interface is said to be inferior to the iPod's, but this player costs about $150 less than the 40 GB iPod.  ($125 less if you take my advice and buy Notmad Explorer.)  I'd rather buy the Zen Xtra and use the savings to buy more music.

<Title>This is NOT the old 40Gig Nomad....
<Date>Thu Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I think that several reviewers are confusing this player with the last generation 40 Gig player. One reviewer pointed out the differences in the packaging and the protective case between the two earlier, and that reviewer was right on the money.  This model is shipped as described by the previous reviewer, and has the latest firmware installed. Mine is too new to give a long term report on, but it seems to be a top quality unit so far. The USB 2.0 port is awesome fast. I dowmloaded 1700 MP3 and WMV files to my Nomad this evening without a hitch, and each batch was completed before I could select the next batch. Very fast compared to the old USB standard.  The controls and layout are great. I don't know if there is a difference between new and old, but even the selector wheel has a good feel to it, and I have not had a misfire when selecting a menu item with it. I do agree that it would be nice to have an audio tone to go along with button movement, but it isn't a showstopper.   The included carry case is very well made. It will probably protect the unit from shock well enough to allow it to survive a fall. Some complained about the plastic structure, but it is built to be as light as is possible, while still maintaining a solid feel. I like it.  The software isn't the greatest by any stretch, but it does work, and I was able to transfer music and data without resorting to the manual. There are other packages available for Windows that do the job in a more intuitive manner for only a few bucks. There are also a number of free packages available online that allow you to use your Nomad on a linux system (for those of you who have grown tired of the Windows nightmare). Also keep in mind that the entire OS (firmware) of the Nomad is writable, and there are people working on their own enhanced versions as we speak.   One more note. The ipod has a problem with connecting with more than one computer. I suspect that is a built in hurdle to prevent people from sharing music, but it doesn't help those who use several computers during their work/play week. I was able to transfer song files between multiple computers with the Nomad without any problems. The latest version of the firmware (as shipped) also correctly displays track information for Russian tunes in cyrillic font. It's a small matter, but it can be important to those who enjoy Russian music.  To sum it up, the newest version of the 40Gig Nomad is light, has a great control layout, solid construction, and the headphone jack seems to be as good as any I have used. I think it's a great player, and for the price, it can't be beat. The earbuds that come with it seem to please many reviewers, but I think ALL earbuds are awfull. I have a collection of them now, and they are all junk. Even the ones offered by name brand audio companies. Buy a good set of Sony or other ear hugging phones for $20, and enjoy music in more quantity and quality than you have ever heard before.   Did I mention that the Nomad comes with Creative EAX as standard? Those of you who have an Audigy sound card in your computer know what I'm talking about. It can be used in selective fashion, and sounds just as good as the PC version. There is more than meets the eye with the Nomad. It might take awhile to master all of it's features, but you will be enjoying fine music from the very first battery charge (lots of classical music and EAX demos built in).  This is an amazing player. Even with a total of 2000 songs loaded, I can still rip a DVD movie to an ISO image at a friends house using a free prgram lke "DVD Shrink", download it to a data folder on my Nomad, and burn the disk on my PC when I get home. For that matter, the Nomad can hold several DVD ISO images at any one time.  Someone mentioned that they didn't like the fact that it wasn't weather proof. Neither is the ipod. Then again, with a one quart Zip Lock plastic bag, and a drop of glue, you can make both players beach proof in a few minutes. Just puncture the plastic bag enough to allow three inches of the plug end of your headphones inside. Seal the puncture with a drop of glue, put your Nomad or ipod in the bag, plug in the headphone jack, zip the bag, and let it rain all day.  A good set of light headphones only costs $20. A Zip Lock bag is about 10 cents. Use your imagination here. You can walk in the surf without placing your Nomad in danger.  Aside from the minor complaints about the software, the only other thing that bothers me is that the max volume should be higher. It's not bad, mind you, but it doesn't allow the head banging levels that other MP3 players deliver. This is a minor complaint, and can probably be fixed at the firmware level in the future. Meanwhile, I am happy to report that using a generic cassette adapter, or an "aux" input port on the latest car audio systems will geive you enough CD quality music to make a trip from one coast to the other and back withought being forced to listen to the same tune twice.  That's it for now. If my opinion changes because of problems with the Nomad, I will update this post in a heartbeat. Meanwhile, it gets 5 stars without hesitation...     Update... It has been Months since I wrote this review, and my Nomad is still a constant companion at work and play, It has been dropped, used, and abused. The early problem with the headphone socket must have been fixed, as my headphone jack has been ripped out of the Nomad countless times, and it still works as new. This update was posted on July 2 2005.

<Content>I had the first generation 20GB Nomad Jukebox for almost two years, then the headphone jack went out. Luckily, I purchased it at BestBuy and had the 2 year product replacement coverage. (I had seen the reviews about this fault and poor customer support from Creative) I instantly, received a voucher for the replacement and got the Zen Xtra 40GB. It has worked fine. The sound, ease of downloads, software, file management system all work good for me. The battery is good also , I usually get 10hrs playing time with a 3 hour charge. The car adapter kit works excellent, my moderate quality car audio system pumps a real nice sound with this model. Generally very satisfied.

<Content>Keep this in mind! There are two different versions of this, one released in September of 2003, and one released in June of 2004. The newer version has fixed many of the problems described in reviews, so make sure the reviews that you're reading really pertain to that player! The largest fix, among many, is the headphone jack. Though you will see a couple of negative reviews, they are for the OLD version, and those people posted on the wrong page :-)  Have a wonderful day Andrew
