<Title>Just too finicky.
<Date>Sun Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got one and installed the programs. Since then all I got was errors and requests for updates. I had 600 songs and it deleted 420 of them ! In the end I sold it and stuck to my Sony discplayer with a 1gb disc. No problems - great sound.

<Title>own 3 and buying another
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first got one of these so that I could take my music with me when I travel. Love the functionality of it, and I'm not locked into the Ipod nation. I have mp3's and wma's on this unit, as well as downloading all types of podcasts. My kid's kept borrowing it, so now this is the birthday gift of choice. Just getting ready to buy another one for my 15 year old.  I use Media Player 10 with the play for sure for managing all of the music on the player. Another big plus is that it will sync with my outlook software, so I always have access to my contacts list. I don't even bother with the Creative software, because it works so well with the microsoft media player.  My daughter has an IPOD mini, and she has to use the apple software. Also, the battery is replaceable on this unit, where on the ipod it is not.  A great deal. Two thumbs up.

<Title>Wouldn't recommend this product
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this Mp3 player for my birthday 6 months ago and it has broken twice.  The first time it broke the sound would go in and out because of the fact that the headphonejack was poorly connected.  I tried using other headphones with the same result.  I sent it back and got it back about 2 weeks later, but i had to pay for shipping.   Then recently the sound was going in and out again, then one day when i pulled it out of my purse i saw that the top had fallen off because it had only been glued on and the on button fell off because of this.  My cousins on button on his also broke.  From what I've seen they don't put a lot of work into making quality products.  Personally I would recommend a Sandisk because they are pretty good.

<Title>I Pod Killer
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had no luck with MP3 players. I've a Rio, Phillips,I Pod Nano. The all have draw backs. Some don't play all formats, some only can down load from sertain sites. And some just don't work at all. Until a got my Zen. It take down loads of pictures and plays all the misic I need while traveling. It has a strong FM radio with good range. The only thing they need to do is fix the back plate and lessen the sensititivity controls. Other than that it was easy to use and FUN to have.  The "Q" from Jersey

<Title>frustrating product
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>when i first got this player, i thought it was great, and  had more features than an ipod. then i realized the  player is extremely incosistent and frustrating. All the connections are cheap... more than half the time i would leave the player overnight plugged into an outlet to charge, and in the morning it would not be charged at all; after a couple of months the headphone jack had a poor connection so my sound went in and out, and the usb connection was also poor, so i constantly have to plug the player  in and out for my computer to recognize the player as connected so i can upload songs.  after the headphone connection went from bad to worse i mailed it to get fixed since it was under the one year warranty. I had to pay over $20 for shipping and insurance on it, and didnt have my player for about a month, when i got it back they had replaced my player with a refurbished one. well that one didnt work at all.  when i called them to talk about it, they said I am not under phone service warranty , and i would have to give them my credit card # and pay $10 in order to discuss the problem.  they blame the problem on my computer, saying all my 6 usb ports must not be working and that is why i can't upload songs to it. yet they  dont seem to understand that i dock my digital comaera to the usb ports, as well as my boyfriends ipod, and there is no problems with the usb connection. they just cant think that their product doesnt work. so now after spend $200 on this product i have no mp3 player, and it has been so frustrating that i prefer throwing it in the garbage I guess i should go get an ipod, because there is a reason why they are so popular.

<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>very good quality, it's a bit tricky to figure out how to charge at first, but once you get it, it's very easy. the touchpad adjusts sensibility so you just have to get used to that. oh yea, i bought a battery charger with mine for occassions where i am not near a computer, it was only like $4 well worth it. overall, it's a good product, in my opinion it beats an ipod with extra features and you don't have to follow the whole "ipod fad"

<Title>Excellent alternative to the ipod. 
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player should be purchased just as often as the nano but doesn't. i'm not sure why this one is way cheaper and more durable, plus you can use subscription services that are way cheaper than itunes. I found the sound quality with the speaker to be better than expected.  The software included was alright but i'll probably use wmp most of the time. I was pretty amazed by the microphones quality. the fm transmitor doesn't work great.   The screen was much better than i thought it would be but i probably wont use it much for pictures cuz it is still so small.  My only complaints would be that I couldn't figure out how to get my computer to recognize it for an hour. But eventually it just worked so that was ok.  The foam on the headphones came off to easily and I lost one foam on my second day of use. Luckily the haedphones aren't uncomfrotable w/o them. still they shoulda come with extra.  i found the controls to be insanely sensitive at first but now i've gotten used to it.  It is lame you cant play music and look at pictures.  It should to be easier to change the volume while looking at the menus.  Thats about it.  I would really reccomend it especially at the low price

<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My creative Zen Micro Photo player is the best electronic player ever.  I like everything about it. I like being able to listen to the radio and recording it. I like listening to my music, and being able to put my photos as my background. It did take a bit to get use to how sensitive the controls were, but now I have all the buttons down. So far I have had no problems putting any music on it. I saved up and bought this with my own money, well worth the cost. It is a really cool mp3 player! I like it much better than my friends iPods.

<Title>be sure to use the right charger!
<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>this mp3 player is great, but i had to return my first one because i screwed up the battery.  one thing to remember, when you first get it, CHARGE IT FIRST THING!  if you don't, this will cause your battery's life to be short and messed up.  and also, if you are like me and aren't able to stick to the computer for 5 hours for the thing to charge, buy a wall charger.  but you MUST use the CREATIVE ZEN official charger!!!  believe me, i used an A/C to USB adapter like the ones on sale here, but after more than 24 hours, the battery still wasn't full!  and also, the machine sucked up the little juice it had within 2 hours.  so i thought something was wrong with the machine, but actually it was the charger.  when i plugged in the official charger, the battery charged faster (only 2 hours or so, way faster than computer charging!) and there was the characteristic blue "glowing" that i got when it was hooked up to the cpu.  with the old charger, there was no glowing.  i think that this glowing only works with the official charger or the computer, maybe there's some special creative technology or recognition in their chargers.  so make sure you don't make the same mistakes i made, though AMAZON's customer service was great and sent me a new player via UPS AIR!  wow!  so make sure you use the creative charger since even though it is expensive, sadly, it is the only one that'll work.   other than that, the player itself is pretty great.  some things i think brought it down was:    A) the voice recorder.        it takes so much navigating and buttons and menus to start and stop it.  and when you play your recording back, you have to crank up the volume to almost maximum to hear.     B) the software        i have to admit, it is kind of frustrating at first.  especially mediasource (one of the two programs on the installation cd) , which i don't think is useful for anything besides playing music, which i could use windows media player for.  but the other program, media explorer is good.  i generally use mediasource for fixing and renaming the ID3 tags.     C) the fact that you can't listen to songs while viewing photos.  and when you do use them for screensaver, it's not so nice because you can't see the words real well anymore.       D) the earbuds do kind of hurt and the foamy things do come off.     but other than that, it is great!  but you should buy a case, even though it is pricy.  you don't want to scratch the screen or anything.  the player is very solidly built.  it's mostly metal, and the front looks sturdy and you won't have to worry about fingerprints, unlike the ipod.  and the connections are fine, don't worry about what those other people said!  my computer had no trouble recognizing it!  no cheap stuff.  i like the texture and the feel of it, and the lighting is really cool.  the screen is great, good color, not like LCD (you can see from all angles!), BUT i noticed once i was in the sun, you can't see the screen as well.      overall, great player for the price!  and 4GB is plenty of memory, i filled in about 100 songs and about 150 photos and i STILL haven't filled up 1 GB!!!  i don't know how you can fill this, let alone a 8 GB!  so take my advice and buy this!

<Title>Overall good player, with a few quirks
<Date>Fri Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After coveting this player for the past year and a half, I finally bought my 4gb microphoto used (and apparently abused) from eBay, so I've seen it at its worst. The entire back of the player was covered in white paint, the screen had several scratches, the edges had paint chipped off, and it was sold as-is because it couldn't be installed as an MTP device on the computer. Still, I'll try to give an objective review based on the qualities of the player and not just the appearance and my disgust towards the previous owner.   After doing my best to nurse my player back to health (a format in recovery mode quickly fixed its problem connecting to the computer and nail polish remover got rid of the ridiculous paint), I set out to test its features. I  was impressed from the start. Here are the pros and cons:  PROS: -The blue glow around the edges and underneath the tactile buttons. I love the look it gives to the player and I never tire of it. Sometimes I turn the player on just to look at it! -The additional functions. The FM tuner and microphone are definitely pluses to the player and do their job well, although I use the former more than the latter. I don't use the calendar all that much and don't plan on using the contacts feature much either, but it still is a good thing to have. -The scrollpad. Yes, I know this is a huge annoyance for some people, but honestly, I can't say that I've had too many problems with it and it beats the slow navigation of click buttons. I just set the scrollpad to the lowest sensitivity and I've been fine with it. -The sturdiness. Although mine obviously has a lot of wear and tear, it still works fine. I wonder what the iPod nano would look like if it had undergone the same treatment. -The intuitiveness of the music menu. It has multiple options to enjoy your music such as a search function, a lookup artist function, and even a DJ function with an "Album of the Day" feature if you feel like being random and mixing up your tracks. -The removable battery. This is a huge plus because I don't have to worry about replacing the battery if something were to happen to it as opposed to having to send it back to be replaced for a hefty charge. Good move, Creative  Now for CONS: -The sturdiness comes with a price. It's pretty clunky and heavier than my other mp3 players. I don't mind too much, but with the silicone case on it can feel like a small brick. -The OLED screen isn't all that clear or bright and pictures can look pretty blurry -The major complaint for most people: you can't listen to music and browse photos at the same time. I really could care less because I don't usually do that anyway, but I admit this was a pretty big blunder on the part of Creative. -The durability of the hard drive. I don't plan to take this player out for a jog for fear the hard drive will crash, apparently a problem with some of these players (just take a look at the Creative forums and you'll see what I mean). I don't think it would have hurt to use flash memory instead. It definitely would have reduced the weight and clunky feeling of the player.  Overall, this player's great. With great care it should last a pretty long time and you won't regret purchasing it. Try to buy it in good used condition on eBay, though. It's definitely not worth the price new because I bought mine for around $40 and it works like a charm despite cosmetic blemishes. Hope this review helped!

<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got mine for $119 new from amazon. I have to admit after my ipod nano suffered some injuries and later kidnapped, I decided to try a different player because there was a problem with ordering a replacement. It's a good thing too. It player music just as well as a nano, you can use your pictures for wallpaper, it has radio, recorder and other little features, that I honestly don't use, but hey thats a lot more than my nano did. Did I mention it was cheaper too.

<Title>A Great Buy!
<Date>Fri Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is amazing. I have purchased it before, about a year ago, and it worked perfectly until it was, unfortunately, stolen. A few months later, I decided to purchase it again! The touch sensitive effect is really neat, and for those who need it to be more or less sensitive have that option to change in the settings on the actual mp3 player. I also love the photo aspect of it, you can zoom in on pictures and have different sharing folders, and even change the backgrounds. You can personalize it with different color pallettes and types of backgrounds - I love it. The battery life is really good too, and it doesn't take very long to charge up - about 3 hours is my guess. Also, you can purchase more batteries and use them for long term mp3 player use without charging, unlike my other ipods which I had to use them sparingly on road trips because they come with only one internal battery. The headphones are really good quality, and have the ability to be LOUD or soft. Another neat tool is the FM radio, if you ever got tired of your music or just wanted to hear a radio station wherever you are. Oh yeah - a great thing - it's really hard to break. I'm the type of person who ALWAYS drops and ruins things like cameras and phones, but this Creative Zen has proven itself to me. I've dropped it various times, and it's still working. I decided to buy a rubber case for it - that is really neat too because it's extra padding and virtually indestructible. All in all- the Creative Zen Micro Photo was cheap, durable, and all around a great product. I strongly recommend!

<Title>seemed great at first.....then broke.....
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I thought this was a really nice mp3 player when I first got it.  But the more I use it, the more I hate it!!!  Half the time the buttons/scroll are way too sensitive and the other half of the time they won't work until the tenth try - very frustrating. I do not like the whole menu setup in general either.  It seems to have too many steps to do things.  I hated it even more after I tried out someone's ipod nano.  The ipod made this seem even more bulky and heavy.  Sometimes the USB won't work either.  It won't charge or my computer won't recognize it to download music until the third try.  Then to top it all off, right in the middle of it playing music it just froze!  No matter what I did it stayed frozen, I couldn't even get it to shut off.  Then like an hour later the screen went blank yet the "on" switch was still lit up.  The creative website showed how to boot it in format mode after removing the battery.  This seemed to work but now ALL of my music and data are gone so I have to start all over again.  This happened after just minimal use too!  I have read that others keep having this happen a lot after the first time.  And what's more.....I would have to pay $25 just for them to look at it because it has been more than 90 days.  That is ridiculous!  It's their issue to resolve, I didnt make it malfunction.  Needless to say I will be asking my husband for an Ipod for Christmas! (and throwing this one in the trash)

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first mp3 player. I did not want to buy an ipod.  So I read many reviews,on many brands. Creative Lab came on top. I will say, the ear buds stink,they could of made some that fit in human ears.  There is a slight background buzz when the display is lite and only when the volume is very low.  The battery issue,that many complained about, I have not ran into that problem. From what I have read,it is best to drain down the battery to it being dead for the first 3-5 times. Then charge as needed.  I installed about 500 songs,and I used only about 30%. Which is not bad. Accesories is a little hard to come by. I did find on Ebay,a silicone case with a belt clip. That I ordered.   Overall the size,and weight is great. For the budget minded. Good for the money

<Content>Bought this 4 months ago and find it far better than ipod.  On price and functionality, ipod just doesn't compare.  I've had no problems with the battery as others seem to have. However been careful to push plug firmly into it when charging. I found out the hard way that if the plug isn't all the way in it will show that it's charging, i.e. glow blue, but not actually charge. Also this player allows you to download music from many different places, many of which are far less expensive than the ipod site.

<Title>Best MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a really great MP3 Player. It is very easy to transfer music, create playlists, and load photos. When you view a photo, you can zoom in on it, make it your wallpaper, and a lot more. I have 130 songs and I haven't even use 1/2 a gigabyte. The only thing that's not so great is that you can not view photos when you are listening to music. It just pauses the music and goes to the photo menu, but this is not a big issue. I love the touch pad on the bottom. This MP3 Player includes a rechargeable battery, a pouch for the ZEN, giant earbuds, a USB cable, installation CDs, and the MicroPhoto.  This is by far the best for your money.

<Title>An amazing MP3 player, but..
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player itself is simple and easy to operate, and I love all of it's features. Some buyers say that the pad is too sensitive, but all you have to do is turn down the sensitivity and it's not bad. The buttons/triggers to play, fast forward, rewind, menu and back are all heat sensored- similar to the LG chocolate cell phone and most of today's MP3 players. It's perfect for what I need in an MP3 player  &lt;> I charged the battery for the recommended 5 hours before turning it on. For some reason it doesn't seem to hold it's charge for very long (only a max of 4 hours of play time!). I also bought some after-market chargers, which aren't from Creative, to try and keep it charged. THEY DON'T WORK. I have two different brands, and they NEVER charge it all the way. The only successful method I have had with charging is with the original USB cord that attatches to the computer that comes with the MicroPhoto. I'm going to buy an official Creative wall charger and official car charger, since those are most likely the only charges compatible with the Creative MicroPhoto Zen

<Content>As many people who have bought this player don't notice is that you can turn the sensitivity of the touch pad down. You go to settings and navigate your way through it. Also, when hooking it up to the computer, it has to be charged or the computer will not read the player. The radio works well if you are in an area where you can get a signal, (some people don't even know if they are in an area where you could get the radio and so they complain if it doesn't work.

<Title>good for audiobooks and podcasts
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>On the recommendation of NetLibrary I purchased the Creative Zen MicroPhoto mid-January 2007 as my first MP3 player.  It has ten bookmarks.  Used mostly for listening to downloaded audio books and public radio podcasts, it works fine.  The software makes transferring files and ripping CD's easy and includes a simple-to-use web based automatic software update feature.  The four gigs is more than enough storage for my use.  Being a hard drive based unit, it needs to be treated more tenderly than a flash drive unit.  Mine fell out of my pocket and reset to the beginning of the track.  The touchpad is very sensitive even after adjusting to the lowest setting.  Performance of the FM tuner is adequate for a tiny receiver.  I don't use the photo viewing or the contact manager features.  Nor do I use the included earbuds as they are too big for my ears.  Overall it fits my needs nicely and I recommend it to others looking to play audio books.

<Title>Creative Zen Micro Photo 4 GB vs. Philips HDD1630 6 GB
<Date>Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative Zen Micro Photo 4GB:      Pros: *OLED Screen (fades out, to conserve battery life.)  *Very clear pictures, which can be used as your background in many different colors. *Can delete songs right off of your device; don't have to hook up to computer to do so *Nice design, to fit in your hand comfortably *Blue Glow *Good voice recorder  *Good FM Radio *Good Volume *Themes *Alarm (Have to have head phones in your ears)  *Can change how sensitive the player keys are *Comes with it's own software    Cons: *Have to charge to computer (sometimes you can easily forget to charge) *No Album Art (not really a big deal for some people) *Pretty sensitive key pad *Sometimes has it's moment when has to re-build it's library or freeze and you have to hook up to your computer to fix (and if your not at home to hook up to your computer, or you don't have an extra battery with you, this could be a problem if you really wanted to listen to your music, or your in a real noisy place)  Philips HDD1630 6 GB 	 Pros: *Album Art *Holds a good amount of music *Good price  *Pretty nice design *Has dedicated keys, for volume, menu, view, playlist, and power *Can use plug to charge, instead of always having to hook up to the computer  Cons: *Slow processor  *Can't delete songs right from your device,  you have to be on your computer *The volume can't go that high compared to the Zen *Only has two different themes *Small Album Art *Stays lit up as long as you have it on, which isn't good for the battery power *Doesn't come with its own specialized software, so you have to use other programs to try to make your playlists, which can be pretty difficult at times, unlike with the Zen. *Scratches and smudges pretty easy *Radio volume is horrible for me (overall volume basically) *Photos look pretty crumby  compared to "Creative's" *May be pretty difficult at first to understand how to add album art, because for some reason it only comes up for some artist and other you have to add yourself *Display isn't really that impressing *Small Screen  Overall I hope this helps you decide which player you'd think is better, if you have any other questions let me know!

<Title>Good player....but.....
<Date>Thu Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player has everything that people state, EXCELLENT sound quality, awesome song grouping (on the computer, kind of tedious if u try to do it on the player), photo storage capabilities (even though you can't listen to music while veiwing photos, which is really kinda dumb) and the best shuffle feature i've ever witnessed. Its just like what the other guy said, it picks the most listened genre and then shuffles into a song that is close by to that and mixes it in. I have almost my whole compt. library of songs on here and i can shuffle the entire list and i won't be disappointed. The earbuds are kinda odd, so i got some other ones from phillips, however the ones that come with the player aren't bad, they just tend to tangle real easily. The screen is great, shows the song, artist, and album (if you have all that info). You can even sync the player to Microsoft Media Player 11 and it'll make sure all your songs are updated with the proper media info and whatnot. Very good. The radio also is pretty decent as well, no problems there.   Now the cons, DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT UPDATE THIS PLAYER!!! Until creative comes out with a new patch, the updates WILL MESS UP YOUR PLAYER!!! Before I updated I went to the indoor track and ran like crazy with no problems. After I updated I WALKED to classes and the player would then stop and come up with the problem "rebuilding library". I'd wait for it to do this, and then play again, and it would then come up AGAIN and AGAIN. DO NOT UPDATE THIS PLAYER!!! The keypad is kinda sensitive but you can control that a bit, or just use the hold button which is what I do.  Sometimes when i turned the player off it would turn on randomly, but that again was after I updated the thing. Like i said DO NOT UPDATE. They might state on their website that it will "make things run faster and better" or whatever. Yea thats true for when it works.   All in all its a good player and i fully recommend.   *Edit* 6/28/07 I actually take back most of what I said...the player is good, if you want a CAR MP3 player. I actually regret not getting an Ipod over this, and if I could return this item for one I would do so in an instant. Like i said, it works great as a car MP3 player but I can't go running with this because it'll freeze up, and with all the Errors and other problems that have been popping up on this thing, It really isn't worth it....

<Title>OK Product - Horrible Warranty and Customer Service
<Date>Tue May 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product... Good: OLED and good sound quality.   Bad: The touch pad is overly sensitive, horrible menu design.  Player died after 6 months.  The company... Good: Not much. Bad: Horrible warranty, "could care less" customer service.  Don't be fooled.  The warranty period is NINETY (90) DAYS!!!   After 90 days you have to pay a "diagnostic & handling fee" which is "at least $25" (Creative Lab's words, not mine) regardless of the reason for putting in a warranty claim.  Many other players have a ONE YEAR PARTS & LABOR warranty, anything breaks and they fix / replace the unit at NO COST.  Avoid the Creative Labs "could care less" attitude & expense and go with the more reliable and better customer service available from Apple / iPod.

<Title>More Zen for your buck
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this little guy for just about 3 months now and am loving it to the Nth degree! It is light and compact, weighting in at just about 5oz, I believe.  The interface between my computer and the Zen has been flawless, though the only way to charge the Zen is by installing the software onto the computer you are using.  This is a slight downfall in that if you are visiting friends, and forgot to bring the disk with you, you may run out of battery life.  However, the battery is removable in this particular Zen, so if you happen to purchase a battery charger that fits this little guy, then you should be good to go.  This was a selling feature for me as I like to travel quite a bit internationally, and finding a random computer that doesn't cost $3/min to use to charge my music player can be a toughie sometimes.  That, and the fact that it is black with pretty blue neon lights.  What can I say, I am color oriented.  I have not had any trouble navigating through the options, thought to be perfectly frank, I have not really explored too many of them either.  I have not tried to load up any pictures as I bought this primarily for the music purpose.  The earphones that the item came with are not too bad.  Not the greatest, and they do make the music a bit muffeled, but in a pinch they work just fine. I also bought the armband and have decided that it was worth the $6 so far.

<Title>Very Disappointed
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player was unusable.  In the beginning it would freeze up and we would have to remove the battery before it would reset.  After a few times even that didn't help as it would get stuck and read loading library and freeze.  Eventually it wouldn't even charge up.  This in only 2 weeks old.  We have had a Zen Micro 4GB MP3 without the photo feature for about 2 years and have never had any problems.  I suppose the photo technology has caused some glitches in the photo model.  We have returned the photo MP3 for a refund and our very disappointed.

<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Love this player!!  Dang, this little thing is loud!!  I've coupled it with my Shure E3c headphones, and it's pure bliss.    The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the sensitivity of the touchpad controls.  Thanks to the person on here who pointed out that the sensitivity could be adjusted, but even set to the minimum, just a touch against my chest while in my shirt pocket was enough to interfere with play.  Some kind of "lock" switch would be nice in future models.  The controls aside, I'm loving the ease of adding songs and photos, also the blue, backlit glow is very cool!  This is a great player, and at $130.00, it's a great buy for 4GB of sonic goodness!

<Title>Move over Ipod!
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this Mp3 player! Don't think you have to buy the new Creative Zen V or even the 8gb MicroPhoto.  If you don't need 8 gb, settle for 4. It hold 2,000 songs anyway.  You can't go wrong with this price either.  You can only get a screenless-1 gb for this price on an Ipod.  Don't worry about it coming out a year ago either.  It is just as high tech as any other mp3. This one works so well.  It is really easy to access all of my songs and they can be organized in so many ways to my liking.  The screen is beautiful and the pictures come up extra clear.  You can put plenty of songs on it, and it's small and easy to use.  The glowing blue light is desirable. The battery and charging cord all work fine to me.  I would advise getting a different charging cord, so you don't have to connect it to your computer all the time.  The headphones work great, and it was really easy to get this to work on my computer.  It works with almost all song programs and even has one of it's own.  Files transfer onto it in a breeze. Some other features that may not have been mentioned on this page are it's FM radio, sound recording, organizer, contacts, schedule, date/time, and etc.  It is a little bit of everything rolled into one. I have very few complaints.  The only thing that bugs me is the touchpad.  It is a little sensitive and sometimes gets bumped a little, but you get used to using it after awhile.  It is also pretty sturdy, so you don't have to worry about it falling apart. Just to help any new customers, when you first get this player, charge the battery fully first.  Also, the USB cable takes a little force to get it into the player for the first time. Buy this Mp3, I guarentee you will be satisfied.

<Content>I ordered this as our sons first MP3. It was hard to figure out how to use at first, the touch pad was too sensitive.  Even on low sensitivity it is still somewhat touchy.  Our son can operate it better than his Dad or I can.  We don't have the patience to deal with a supersensitive pad that we keep flying by our choices with. Needless to say, our son LOVES it! The store we bought it from sent it right away and they had great customer service.

The last mp3 players I have had you would use a standard AAA battery. I even bought rechargeable ones to save money. This one can only be charged through your computer using the USB plug included with player and the battery dies all of the time. I listen to it while I am at work and I need to charge it everyday. Other than my battery "issue", I absolutely recommend this product!!

<Title>Holds Music Well But That's It
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this about 3 months ago instead of buying an ipod. At first, I loved it! It had great sound and held a lot of music for a lower price! Sadly, I learned the hard way that Zen's break very easily. Two of my friends had Zens and they both broke. With me, first, my computer wouldn't register it so I couldn't download any more music. Then, the battery got over heated and it wouldn't turn on for two days. Now, for some reason, it only plays the back ground music and I can't hear the singer any more. So, if you're the type of person who will be very paitent and gentle with the Zen, then go ahead and buy it. I don't reccomend this product to people who would listen to it 24/7 like I did, or the battery will get over heated. So, I'm just warning you, as great as Zen's are, they are EXTREMELY delicate and break easily!

<Title>This is my first mp3 player...and good sound/poor manuals
<Date>Wed Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I saw the online reviews and that was how I came to buy the Zen.  I cared more about the sound than anything else and one great thing is: it's cheaper than IPOD and that it has a FM radio /though it's not great.  I spent 1 whole day figuring out how to use the thing and there is zero information on the manuals: all it shows is the buttons and what they mean.  I still don't really know how to use the ZEN and when I upload things I usually just reset the whole zen and then reupload it again.  It's really annoying but besides that it's great.   Also there is ZERO accessories for the zen micro in stores. So if you want to put up with few accessories/or expensive ones on the net (the recharging station w/speakers is $130) then the zen is for you.  The music quality is great sounds like the computers.  The ear buds though stink and I hate them so I bought a sony one to use instead.  The sensitiving of the pads pissed me off initially but I got the hang of it (see other reviews too).  But all in all it's decent not "wow this is the best ever" but worth it then again I haven't bought an IPOD and don't know how great th at is either.

<Title>DONT BUY IT
<Date>Thu Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the item and loved the sound, everything. Then I viseted Creative's site and found out there was an firmware update program. I downloaded and run it. The program finished normally and displayed a message saying that the player would restart. The player didn't restart and didn't work anymore. Searching the Web I realized that the same thing happened to many other buyers. I contacted Creative and their solution: they sent me an RMA number and, if the 90 days period was expired, I would have to pay $25. That's incredible. Creative's firmware update program broke my player and I would have to pay if I wanted it fixed!!!! This company isn't what it used to be. So choose another product from a better vendor.

<Content>If you are looking for a well rounded MP3 player, this is it!  I use mine for 2 purposes, downloading e-books and exercising.  With 4GB, memory is not a problem.  I have downloaded all my music and still have 45% memory left. (which is perfect for e-books)  Strapped to the arm, I run and exercise without any problems.  The controls take a while to get use to because of the sensitivity. 75% of the time it does the opposite of what I want.  Patience helps in this area.  But that is the only problem I have had with this player.  For the price and the memory, that is a small problem.  The software that comes with it gives you a choice of download options.  The yahoo music disc, has step by step voice and video instructions which helped.  I use Media player because each time the player is connected to the laptop it updates any music I have added since the last sync. To explore or organize music, Zen Microphoto media explorer is the easiest.  It is very similar to Windows Explorer.  I've not bothered with the photo downloads, being a professional photography, this part seems a bit cheesy.  Besides, I'm listening to music or an e-book, not stopping to look at photos or share them.  I recommend the DLo protective sleeve, clip, and strap.  Mine works great and the armband is the most comfortable I have used.

<Title>I recomend the microphoto!!!
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My first mp3 player was lame,the RCA lyra. Microphoto meets all my expectation. Not to big, fits easily in your pocket or your palm. Depending on the quality of the tracks, it holds about 1600 songs. The touchpad was very cool, no obnoxious button clicking to bother anyone. Screen is bit too small to properly enjoy photos, but wallpaper part works ok. Navigating is easy and fun while listning to your tunes and the am/fm recording is useful. The blue glow thats on the navigation pad and outline is very....coool The battery life, with leaving the screen and glow off, lasts about 12 hours, regular usage, such as letting the screen and glow go off and then turning them back on to switch songs and doing it frequently gets you about 3 hours.  Recharging it was annoying. It has to be plugged into a usb port on your pc. This one time, I went on a trip with my family. I kept having to borrow my brothers laptop to recharge it and after about an hour his laptop goes into hybernation mode and my microphoto won't charge.  So to fix this problem, I got a regular AC adapter so I can charge it from the wall. You can get one at Wal-Mart for 23.98. I know its expensive, but its worth it. This thing is like scratch proof. I've had mine for about 6 months and I've taken it everwhere. From home to the car to work and all the way to Japan. This thing had been through alot and won't scratch. Minus the few small problems, I give the Zen microphoto 5 stars.

<Content>This is an awesome MP3!  I researched MP3's extensively prior to purchasing.  I originally purchased the Zen Micro for my son for his birthday and had to have one for myself, so I purchased a 2nd one.  It is very user friendly and easy to maneuver, even for an old gal like me.  The color screen is a plus with excellent quality color.  The touchpad seems a little sensitive initially, but both my son and I adapted quickly.  The size and weight is just right and can be easily carried in a purse or pocket.  I would recommend the leather case with the belt clip for running, walking, etc.  And the adaptor is an easy way to recharge without having to hook up to computer and much faster recharge.  Overall, this is a great player and I would not hesitate to buy another one.

<Content>Caution. Creative used to have great support. Now, 60 days of phone support. I have a 9 month old ZEN Micro. It will not start, if I plug it in, it appears to charge but never completes, If I turn it on while plugged in i get to the Creative boot up screen, it goes blank and never completes the boot up. Useless junk now. I cnnot find my original receipt, (who can). I cannot be returned, and I cannot get support on it.  I will be returning my perfectly good running Vision M with receipt, as i cannot risk this device breaking down too.  I have always hated Apple, I am a PC guy, but an Ipod will be my next MP3 device.

<Title>Nice lil mp3 player with photo storage
<Date>Tue Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros:   Small and portable, large capacity, nice screen options (backround options), 7 EQ modes + Custom 5-band EQ, xtra bass option, smart volume option, date and time, lots of play back option(ie, DJ mode, most popular, playlists, etc), screen is crystal clear, slide show feature (for photos), attractive styling/design and lots of playback options (Shuffle, repeat, Album of the day, track once, etc).  Cons:    Can't play music while in photo mode,  owner's manual not helpful at all, the earphone buds that come with it is very bulky, hurts and doesn't fit well in ear, The calendar feature is useless (it can only sync with Outlook Express), battery life is about 8 hrs non stop, controls are very sensitive (minor problem).  The major thing I wish this had is password protection.  I don't know if other mp3 players have this feature or not, but this doesn't and I really wish it did.

<Title>Complaint
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the player last October and used it for two months. As I was trying to charge the battery, it overcharged, and the player is damaged.  At first I thought the battery was damaged, and bought a replacement battery at Fry's (in California) but it didn't work. Since your recommendation is to contact the Manufacturer, I sent an e-mail message to Creative Labs, got automatic response saying someone will review my message and contact me.  As you guessed, I never received any reponse from them. I liked the player for the sound and the functions.  I would be very happy to get a replacement even if I have to pay for any charges. I am not sure I will receive any response from you but hope someone from Amazon will respond. Thanks.

<Title>A Zen-like experience
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A great item, this Microphoto is. Works great, pretty intuitive. Software from Creative makes this product easy to use. Holds a bunch of songs and photos all at once. I wish it  had a album screen shot but the screen is too small for that anyway. You can choose any of your photos or theirs for the backround, but I don't spend anytime staring at the player. One caveat though, the Zen back is white and the leather case I bought for it has stained the back piece of the player. Sadly, the player had been stolen :( . I guess I'll buy Creative again though. This time a Creative Zen Vision W :) . Gotta watch my TiVo stuff wherever I am AND listen to music.

<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Love it.  The sound is great and its easy to use.  I know 3 other people that have a Creative Labs MP3 and an iPod.  They are now trying to sell their iPods on eBAY.   Touch pad is sensitive and bigger than the iPod. The ear phones are also  somewhat bulky. Its great at the gym, car, and in your house.  The FM player is great for those times at the gym where the TV's need you to tune to a certain station.  The accessories are harder to find than for the iPod, but you can find the EQ online.  I have the Creative portable speaker system.  It has amazing sound.  I would compare it to Boise.

The sound was the most important thing to me, and this has it.  The downloading from the computer is super easy, as well as the everyday use of it.  I give it an A++++

<Title>Great little player -- Very good for electronic Books!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little jewel was just what I wanted and much more.  I was looking for a MP3 player that had bookmarking capabilities.  My local library has books that you can checkout and down load.  The Creative Zen was one they recomended, because of the license capability and the bookmarking.  It works great! As for the "light" touch it requires, you can set the sensitivity so it isn't bad.... I got use to it with a little practice and patience. It has a lot of room, most of my book downloads are under 1GB, so I can have several going at a time and there is plenty of room for music and pictures.

<Title>What a deal
<Date>Tue Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Wow Why bother with an ipod!??!?!  This has all the best features and then some.  $160 for 4 gb and excellent features or $150 for a 1 gb nano?  It's just too cool.  HERE ARE SOME THINGS I HAVE ADDED AFTER OWNING IT FOR A WHILE:  The sound quality of this mp3 player is BETTER THAN MY COMPUTER WITH WINAMP AND THE EQUALIZERS.  Definite audiophile player.  I like using the Sony EX71 headphones.  Good bass and clean sounding.  I use the vocal preset with the bass boost and it sounds infreakingcredible.  IGNORE WHAT THAT OTHER GUY SAID.  I got a silicone case for $7.  The headphones are good if you actually wear them, but I prefer my noise-isolating headphones.  The USB cable is actually 1'6", not 6".  Read the instructions and you will be able to charge the battery.  The shuffle feature has got to be unique.  It doesnt pick random songs exactly, it picks ones that lead well from one to another.  For example, it does a couple of the same genre or artist and then goes to another.  Either that or I have strange, strange luck.

<Title>Good Product...cheap accessories
<Date>Fri Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am sure that this player is good, but because the accessories that they send with it are soooo "cheap" and flimsy.I couldn't even charge the battery to use the player. The usb cable that comes with it is about 6" long and didn't work in the usb port.The so called headphones are very uncomfortable to put in your ears and I am kind of glad I couldn't charge the battery so I didn't have to use the "headphones" A product is no good if the parts you need in order to use it are bad!! Not worth the money. I was very dissappointed. I bought it as a graduation present for my neice and we couldn't charge the battery to use it.This manufacturer should put more thought into it's accessories.

<Content>I was really surprised after i got my zen micro. It is really good, and i love it.  But....... The touch screen is too sensitive and the battery is not as long as long lasting as they say(that is why this is 4 stars) But it is a really good product. I love it and it is WAY better than the Ipod. This is truly an ipod killer The photos are also really clear and you can set them as a wallpaper. This is a really good product.

<Title>Terrific Product, Great Price
<Date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research before opting away from an IPOD and am very happy with my purchase.  Especially at a savings of about $100.  Creative's downloading software is very easy to use; making loading songs and albums on this quick and easy.  The sound is great and its got a number of great features such as the FM Radio (which although not powerful is nice to have) and a scheduler.  This is not to say it is a perfect player.  The battery life is far less than the 15 hours advertised.  I'd guess its about 7 or 8 hours.  The touchpad is sensitive, but after using it for a few weeks I've gotten used to it and its not quite as frustrating as it once was.  And as others have noted, you can't look at the photos and play music at the same time.  These minor quibbles aside, you can't go wrong with this player.  Especially now that Microsoft and MTV have just launched their on-line music service URGE to compete with ITunes.  Highly Recommended.

<Title>Creative Zen Microphoto
<Date>Sun May 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 4 gig Zen Microphoto is a really good MP3 player. Everything is easy to set up on the computer and it's all fairly easy to understand. I like the sound quality and the awsome color screen. The only things that are bad about it is that you can't look at pictures while the music is playing (that is annoying), and the battery life is pretty bad. They said it was like 15 hours, but i doubt it would reach that unless it was left on pause with the screen off. The real battery life is like 5-8 hours. Overall it's a good player, though i would advise that if you got one of them you get a spare battery so if your battery runs out you have another one.

<Title>WHEN GOOD COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First I must say, I don't own this MP3 Player and that is part of my point in writting this review. My point is: I am now in the process of trying to find the right MP3 player to buy, and I don't want to become apart of the IPOD NATION. This one was high on my list. It is well under 200.00 has a great screen  and lots of great extras to boot. So why did they miss out on the basics so badly, namely not showing cover art for your music and not being able to play audiobooks??? Those are TWO MAJOR things that I want. I tell you,finding just the right mp3 player is not easy.

<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The data socket and/or cable on this player was of such poor quality that no connection could be made. No charge no data no detection NOTHNG! A replacement cable (mine) would charge the unit but again no data or detection. Wasted three hours of my life before sending it back to the MFR. Notice now that they are selling refurbished units which to me means tons of returns. My "black" unit was mainly white with a black front only. Zero stars!

<Date>Tue Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ok people so i always read this reviews before i buy something and so heres how it is: this mp3 player is great for this much money, the sound quality is wonderful the battery life is great and the blue glowing light never gets old either. its easy to set up and put all your music on and doesnt take long. the headphones and case that come with it are good quality. why buy an ipod nano for the same price whith one GB when this is four times better?! the only thing i would say was to get the one that plays videos cause its only like ten dollars more but still this is a great product.
