<Title>The coolness of an iTouch without the ridiculous price.
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This 2GB Touch Screen player is awesome. It has an mp3 player, a video player, an FM radio which can be recorded from internally and saved to memory. It reads e-books, has flash games on it and comes with every accessory you could imagine. It comes with a wall charger, car charger, charging cable, stylus, earphones, cleaning cloth, carrying case and screen protector. Apple would sock you for at least $20 a piece for those accessories. Once I added a 4GB SD card, I was ready to go with an awesome 6GB media player for a fraction of the price of the 8GB iPod iTouch. There isn't Wi-Fi wireless store capability on this unit. Since there are only 3 cities with Starbucks ready to broadcast, I don't think I'll miss that wireless music download thing much. Even if I had the iTouch, I don't live in one of those 3 cities. Also, you don't have to use iTunes... AT ALL.

<Title>Don't hesitate-buy this one it's fantastic. 
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item is so easy to use and works with a touch to the screen - no pushing hard.  Great sound.  I've converted 4 movies - great viewing.  Easy as pie to transfer music. Long battery life with a crystal clear big screen. This is puts the ipod to shame!!  Better price, more features and fantastic price.

<Title>Okay

<Content>I don't know where you guys got all those accessories?  Mine only came with the player itself, a usb cable, a wall charger, earphones, and a stylus. So I guess I was cheated.  Over all it doesn't work too bad.

<Title>Very Disappointed for Christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ordered this for my twelve year old daughter for Christmas. We got great service from the company I ordered thru and it was even delivered before the delivery date they gave me. My daughter was very excited when she opened this but soon her excitement turned to disappointment! Although the sound is pretty good and it is set up so an idiot could download music the construction is very cheap! Within days of having this the silver band around it fell off and when you press the music button it brings the games up! Eventually if you play with it for awhile it will bring up the music but sometimes it only will play the first song repeatedly! Haven't had the courage to try any of the other features yet. I guess I learned a lesson at my daughters expense...You get what you pay for!!!!!!!!

<Title>Not worth the money
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Software is poorly written.  Not only is the software in Chinese only, the CHinese characters did not display correctly on PC (running XP).  Have to guess what the  buttons are since they all show ??? instead of Chinese characters.    Sound quality is poor compared to ipod.  There is no playlist management.  Screen is not responsive.    For reading books, only text files can be used and  language setting has to be changed to view Chinese text.  Video is OK but need to be converted with the software provided, which does not install properly.  When it is finally installed, it does not display Chinese characters properly so you have to guess what the buttons are for.  It is better to get a ipod.

<Title>Good Product for a Great Price!

<Content>I have had this MP3/4 player for a day now and, so far, I am very impressed.  This is my first gadget of this type, so I have no basis of comparison other than borrowing friends' IPOD's.  With that being said, This thing is Awesome!  The menus are very easy to navigate, the sound quality is great with the provided ear buds, and the Video and Picture quality are pretty good as well.  The screen is pretty big and the picture is clear, but at some angles the picture reverts to negative image.  For the Cons;  The music cuts off when trying to view pictures.  You can listen to music while playing the Tetris Game and navigating the menu, but not while viewing pictures.  You cannot listen to Music while charging either.  There might be some updates or upgrades to the software / firmware available to fix this issue, but as it stands right now, this is somewhat annoying.  The Case feels thin and almost flimsy.  I would not recomend putting it in your back pocket or droping it.  The worst thing I have run into so far is the included software.  It does not auto-load, and there is no general setup or installation application, and therefore, each feature has to be loaded individually.  Some features do not load at all.  Over all, I am very impressed with the player.  Since this is my first go at this type of gadget, I was not going to spend a lot of money, for obvious reasons.  I am very impressed with the function, sound and picture / video quality.  I am not impressed with the construction quality or sotware provided.  I would recomend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive video / MP3 player.

<Title>Very Bad Product
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Product looks good in the website, but in person it's like some cheap mp3 player that you can buy at flea markets for $5... or even something you can pull out of a cereal box. It's poorly built; cheap snap on plastic material, has no camera as stated; false advertising, sound quality is horrible, touch screen does not work well; better off using buttons, the manual is useless... this thing is not worth $70. Put your money towards an iPod touch.
