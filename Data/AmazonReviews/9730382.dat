<Title>ERROR NO FILE!!
<Date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player about a month ago. I was using it and all the sudden my music stopped.  So I looked at my MP3 player and it said that there was no file. I took it and I turned it off. Then I let it sit for about five minutes and then tried it again.  This time it worked, but like the last time, it said that there was no file.  I did this many times and it happened EVERY time. It was very annoying having to reastart it every five minutes.  I hope the company will correct this problem, but in the mean time, I am out an MP3 player.

<Title>A waste of money and time

<Content>I got this from my husband for my birthday, mainly for the purpose of listening to digital audio books.  I wasted many hours trying to download audio files, and then trying to get them to play properly.  The files would simply stop playing, and finally the unit began freezing up completely.  I ended up with a Samsung YP-K3 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGQ858/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5547313-1933548">Samsung YP-K3JQG K3 2 GB Slim Portable Media Player (Green)</a> and am very happy with it.  Downloading files is quick and easy, recharging is easy, and playback is great.  Whatever you do, don't buy this MP3 player.
