<Title>not worth the money
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>it holds a lot of information/books etc, and therefore makes a great reference if you are a professional, travel, etc.  Also, it is quite good at finding access to the internet.  Unfortunately, I didn't heed the warnings of others.  It's hard drive has broken after 6 months of use.  Now its a great paper weight!

<Title>great little machine
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have heard a lot about these things freezing up and dying, but thats only because something was installed wrong on it.  i have had mine for 3 years now, and it only died once, because i downloaded free solitaire games off the internet.  i reset it, and it works fine.  so convenient to be able to edit all of my microsoft office applications on the go.  i went to hawaii and took this with me, and was able to use the moblie manager feature to upload my digital cameras sd card onto it, so i could continue to take pictures.  the mp3 player has always worked perfectly for me.  the interent applications are fantastic.

<Title>Died and will not reset
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After a year, the Lifedrive froze while starting up.  I tried resetting, including several hard resets, which the unit would never complete.  A call to Palm Tech Support did no good - they want me to send it back for repair (at my own expense, since it's past the warranty period).

<Title>Mine also died and will not reset
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Lifedrive died after a year and will not reset.  I've tried the soft reset, hard reset and hard reset with the Lifedrive charging in its cradle.  Palm support is non-existent.  They gave a lame suggestion (the hard reset in the cradle) when I first contacted them and now they have not responded to my follow up message.  In addition the form on their website to request support has stopped working.  I have to say the address book was really handy and it was useful to be able to read e-books on the PDA.  However, I can't possibly recommend getting a Lifedrive because of the poor support and the danger of losing important data which cannot readily be transferred to a non-Palm PDA even if you have been doing regular synchronizations with a desktop computer.

<Title>Great product.  About robust as a 3 week old apple !
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Loved everything about this product, until I paid out my cash for it.  After only using it for a few weeks it must have took some sort of knock in my coat pocket (yeah, yeah, my own fault, yada, yada).  It's not like I was rough with it or anything but the device developed the "Click of death".  So it is no longer "bootable".  To be honest if the fundamental drive aspect of this device is that it is so vulnerable to shocks then I see no reason to trust my "Life" to it.  Yet another gadget in the Gadget Drawer Of History.

<Title>Skip this one...buy Palm TX instead
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I gave the LifeDrive a chance for a year.   It was my 2nd Palm device.   The old Tungsten E was more reliable.  Even though the Tungsten E would lose data once the battery drain, I knew how to work around it...use backup software and charge it every other day.  Once I knew how to work around the Tungten E's quirks then it became a reliable hardware for me.  I do not know how to work around LifeDrive's quirks.  The LifeDrive worked most of the time, but you always had a sense that it may not work one day and you are not clear how to fix it or prevent some issues from happening again.   Sometimes it would not come on even though the day before it was fully charged.   I had to charge it again for some reason.   My current problem is that when I turn it on I can only see my contacts and the WiFi screen seems to be in loop (keeps flashing on and off).   It will not let me use any other applications.  I reset it and nothing has changed.  I should have went with the Palm TX instead.  Palm owes buyers an apology for creating such an expensive item that is not reliable.

<Title>skip it
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When it works, it works beautifully, unfortunately the older it gets the less it works, at least that's what happened to me.  Mine lasted one year.  It was incredibly buggy and crashed out frequently from day one  (preinstalled Versamail was the biggest culprit).  It takes about two to three minutes to reboot every time it crashes out on you, and after a while I just hoped that it would turn on after a crash.  I installed Iambic's Agendus, which I've used various versions of since my Newton and the Lifedrive didn't like it at all.  It crashed and rebooted left and right because of it.  The internet browser has a bug that doesn't allow you to download anything like patches.  You'll get an error message saying that your harddisk or card is full.  The last I heard the Lifedrive has been discontinued and there are no plans of a v.o 2.0.  Which is a shame really, as they had the makings of a nice piece of equipment had they worked on it a little more.

<Title>The first steps towards real convergence.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good or bad, this marks the beginning of the microDrive convergence into PDAs and cellphones.  Yes, South Korea, China, and Japan have had microDrive PDAs for awhile now, but this is the US debut of real storage, and a definitive shift away from HotSync to a more-generic external drive model.  Think about that for a moment.  Even Microsoft PowerPCs don't support a pure external drive model of synchronizing.  This allows you to just connect to a central data store (via Bluetooth, WiFi, or USB) and bring your MP3 files over.  Or Word documents.  Whatever.  It's not the data storage that's most impressive here, it's the final surrender of Palm's HotSync methodology.  That's the big news here.  Of course, this device represents a compelling upgrade for older PDA users.  Storage at near 4Gb means the iPod mini or Zen Micro are less attractive electronics, by virtue of their single-function purpose.  The OS has been ramped up, and it still runs most of the legacy Palm apps (you will find that more and more apps are not migrating, though).  The extra treat of Bluetooth and WiFi radios means you can use a Bluetooth keyboard, connect to a BlueTooth cellphone, maybe stream music to your Bluetooth BMW.. or use WiFi to stream to a WiFi stereo system, receive that stream and playback, grab MP3s from your basement machine, and so forth.  I can see this being used as a web pad in most homes, allowing for some web browsing, some MP3 playback, and more importantly, remotely viewing another PC on a home network (maybe to shuffle music playback or check email).  Of course, having WiFi or Bluietooth in a PDA is not groundbreaking; having both isn't either, but it's impressive and long overdue.  The sum of features makes this a worthy addition if you're looking for a new PDA, or if you want something much more than an iPod mini or Creative Zen Micro.  However, if you hang on a few months, maybe to Q4 2005, Nokia will have a cellphone with a 4Gb (maybe 6Gb by that time) microDrive, and then the electronics landscape changes forever, because no one will want "just an MP3 player" ever again (unless they really don't want a cellphone or handheld computer).

<Title>Wrong product..  wrong time.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wrong product..  wrong time.  	Consumers of US have been offered new electronics products almost everyday. But how many times we look at them and say, "I want that!" PalmOne's LifeDrive is not going to make you say that, either.  Major features of the product: * Palm OS 5.4 * Intel Processor * 4G HD * Wi-Fi 802.11b * Bluetooth 1.1 * USB 2.0 * Big color display * Support for Microsoft Documents * Voice Recorder * Camera Companion Software * MP3 Player  This is not impressive.If PalmOne wants to be ahead of the curve, they should have added Wi-Fi 802.11g. Bluetooth and USB 2.0 are pretty much necessary and they are good there. 	 Lets do a quick comparison of this product,  PalmOne Treo 650: $400 (And lot cheaper with cell phone service annual contract) Features: Cell, PDA, Camera, MP3 Player, SpeakerPhone, Bluetooth, 23MB Nokia 6620: $350 (less than $100 with annual plan)  Features: Cell, PDA, Camera, MP3 Player, Speakerphone, Bluetooth 12MB  Why am I comparing with cell phones? Because we have to have one and what is missing in them is the big hard-drive. For that, I am not going to buy LifeDrive. I will rather just a get a USB drive/firewire drive for 50 bucks which I don't need to upgrade or something, or better yet, an iPod which is an excellent USB Hard-Drive (iPod Photo fo 30G $349) 	If PalmOne is thinking that this device is going to fill the gap between your office computer, home computer, camera, I think they are wrong. We need little more integration like combination of a Nokia Cell,  PDA, Apple MP3 player, small Sony camera, Big Hitachi Hard drive. And all of this still should be bigger than the Palm Treo.  Bottom Line: I wouldn't waste my money on this. I am sure something more worthwhile will come before end of this year.

<Title>On the mark
<Date>Thu May 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This PDA is exactly what the Tungsten T5 should have been (integrated Wi-Fi, voice recorder), and will probably drive the latter out of existence.  One cool feature that the other reviews haven't noted is that the LifeDrive can be used as a photo-dump, enabling direct transfer of data from a camera's SD card--something that the iPod Photo (unbelievably) can't do without additional hardware.  True the 4GB can't compare with dedicated photo-dumps (the Epson P-2000 has ten times the storage), but it's still more than enough for a photo-intense vacation.

<Title>An honest look at it all...
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me preface this review by saying that I did in fact order mine - it should be arriving any day and I look forward to posting a very honest review of this palm handheld.    I just had to post this review to combat those many bad reviews on this item.  It technically is not available yet and will not be released until the 30th of May.  To all those WinCE users out there - stop complaining about items you don't even use!    Now I have a long history of having palm handhelds - from my first Palm V to my current Palm Tungsten T3, I have a good viewpoint on their company's evolution (albeit slow).  I recently left Palm for Sony's CLIE TH-55 which I thought was the best all-around PDA available at the time.  It had everything I could ever want, and more!  I decided to stick with Palm since Sony was leaving the market and purchased a Tungsten E which I was sorely dissapointed by.  Long gone was the metal for PDAs from this company, as seen by their recent trend with the Tungsten T5 (plastic, plastic), and their new E2 (plastic again).    I sold my Tungsten E and purchased a T3 the moment the T5 was available because that perhaps was one of the larger dissapointments in Palm's history.  Well, here were are with them satisfying our needs with 4 GB of storage space, Wi-fi, bluetooth, and USB 2.0 (yes, it has USB 2.0 unlike other's reviews).    So why did I order this item?  I plan to have it replace my USB flash drives, I look forward to checking my email wherever I am at work or in my house with the wireless networks.  Heck - even when I'm waiting for food at Starbucks or Panera I can leech onto their free Wi-fi.  Battery life?  I'm hoping its better than what I get with my current T3 - though nothing beats that Sony CLIE I had thus far in the battery life comparison.  I'll post an addendum to this review once I've used my new LifeDrive for a month or so.  Keep an eye open for my updates!

<Title>Good start, but not perfect yet.
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Lifedrive one week ago to replace a sony Clie.  The following comments are based on one week experience. Pros: 1.  New lifedrive manager software which in most cases obviate the need for hotsync.  This is truly revolutionary. 2.  Larger hard drive.  Finally we are catching up with the rest of the world.  You may be able to replace your iPod mini with this more versatile handheld. 3.  Good voice recorder.  I just got back from a meeting and recorded one whole days worth of talks from the back of a room with 60 people and record quality was quite good and no software bugs were noticed.  In addition to the time allocated under your voice memo section, you can directly record to your hard drive allowing you to record more stuff. 4.  This machine can store an enormous number of powerpoint presentations.  This is a big plus for if you do any teaching e.g. quick review of a topic with a med student before a surgery. 5.  Nice metallic finish.  Looks better than cheap looking T5.  Cons: 1.  Poor battery life.  After a whole day of heavy use, the battery dies without warning. 2.  Repeated powering down of the hard drive causing a few second delay in opening new applications.  Annoying as hell!!! 3.  No way to customize turning off the screen after a short period of inactivity.  If you play chess on this machine, it becomes annoying.  By the way, Hiarcs chess engine runs quite well on this machine(Downloadable for 39.99). 4.  Adobe reader formats most documents well, but some with complex formatting turn into incomprehensible amorphous text. 5.  Price.  I don't understand why a piece of cheap looking electronics made in china should cost this much money. 6.  No integrated cell phone or camera. 7.  Some applications don't run on this device.  I signed up for audible.com membership to get a $100 rebate.  But so far I have been unable to make the audible manager recognize this device and download audiobooks to this device. 8.  It is very disappointing palm decided to put the cheaper and slower WiFi.  I suspect their next device will have the faster version. 9.  Size.  More bulky than other palm handhelds.  Not a true shirt pocket device. 10.  No headphone provided.  Why can't they throw in a $10 headphone for this $499 device.  I am using my old sony clie headphones which works fine.   Overall, 4 stars.  I am sure I will find a lot more annoying problems as I use it more.

<Title>Nice try, but...
<Date>Sun Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Palm is on the right track here with the LifeDrive, but they don't quite pull it off, and when you spend five hundred smackers, you want a convergence product that solves all of the little nagging issues.  Like an iPod mini, the LifeDrive has a 4GB hard drive, but attaches a fully-featured PDA to it that includes WiFi but no phone as yet (maybe in LifeDrive 2 or Treo 1000?). You can do all the classic Palm functions, plus for the first time decent video (other Palms just don't have enough memory).   The device has a beautiful, large enough screen, and finally somebody has figured out how to automatically download camera memory, turning the LifeDrive into an effective memory bank. (Too bad they figured this out AFTER flash memory prices cratered.)  But if you want real video or even significant photo storage, the 4GB just isn't enough. Battery life is weak, at under 10 hours. And the size is large, significantly bigger than an iPod maxi. Overall, it's not bad for a first try, like the original 5GB iPod. But before this becomes a killer, must-have device, Palm is going to have to:  1) Up the GB level.  2) Up the battery power (new batteries being developed by Toshiba hold much promise).  3) Upgrade the sleekness of the machine. 4) Improve the software package so it will better sync with your pics and movies. That is the beauty of iPod photo -- the syncing with iPhoto and iTunes is a joy, versus a cumbersome loading process. 5) Consider adding a wireless TV dock so that LifeDrive (or more likely, LifeDrive2) can double as a DVR. How cool would it be to be able to record the Sopranos, take it to a friend's house on your LifeDrive and play it? There are ways to do this now through your computer, but it's a bit cumbersome. 6) Cut the price so regular folks can afford it, not just doctors and lawyers and techno geeks looking for the latest toy.  Overall, first adopters will ignore the glitches and glow over the best attempt at a video/photo/PDA yet created, but savvy regular shoppers will wait a year for LifeDrive 2, or, more likely, for a video iPod, which could be headed your way by Christmas.

<Title>Very Glitchy
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I recieved this LifeDrive, the first thing it required me to do was to reset it. I did, reluctantly, and when it began to start up again, it would "No notice" reset itself again. I was forced to hard-reset it in order to begin using it. This happened to me many times, including when I was in a meeting. Now, it won't even boot up. However, when it was not glitching, I found it very satisfying. It had an endless supply of memory, and I could store whatever I wanted-even if it wasn't compatible with the Palm OS-via the "Life Drive Manager", or "Drive mode". The graphics were superb, but many times I was not able to experience it fully because of the noticable lag. Another thing I noticed was that soft resetting it took longer than a Windows machine to boot up. There are many superlatives about this product, but wait a while for the firmware to be upgraded, because the OS included with this program is very glitchy.

<Title>Nice first take
<Date>Wed Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the LifeDrive for a few weeks now and I absoulutely love it.  The complaints about load delays are way overblown.  It's not as snappy as the t5 but we are talking seconds here to swap between apps and as they get cached, there is no delay.    Pros Beautiful screen.  Not quite as bright as the 650 but much  brighter than the t3.  The color is better too.  Built in Wifi is easy to configure and along with the browser is very fast.  PocketTunes works really well as an mp3 player.  Much better than the Real one from the t3  Versamail is a good email app.  I do wish it would load office docs into docs to go though instead of using its viewer.  Drive mode makes it easy to walk up to any pc and transfer files at USB2 speeds.  Hardware button to toggle between landscape and portrait modes.  Battery life seems good.  It's not as good as a dedicated media player but this unit does a heck of a lot more.  I like the power slider where you can lock the unit to "Off".  i cant tell you how many times i've taken my t3 out of the bag and it was on.  Cons The mp3 player skips in the background when loading off the hard drive.  I hope that PalmOne can fix this with a patch.  The video player should play a wider variety of formats and palm should provide software to convert a DVD to mpeg at the lifedrive screen size.  I wish pocketTunes would play unproteted AAC files.  It's a nice codec and much leaner than mp3.  for ~500 they shoulkd have just put 64mb of NVRAM in the unit instead of reserving a portion of the hd for storage.  Would have made the battery last a lot longer.  There are a few minor warts but overall i'd say it's a terrific first attempt.  Five stars for breaking new ground with a convergent device and getting it mostly right.
