<Content>I got this player for my kid and it is great.  It plays video and MP3.  You can also organize the files into subfolders so it is easy to use.   I highly recommend the player to anyone that is looking for a great deal on an awesome player!

<Title>Batteries Do NOT Last.
<Date>Fri May 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bought in Dec 05.  Have had problems with the batteries after about 2-3 months.  Can't seem to get it to play over 2-5 songs without it shutting down due to low power.  It's my understanding that the batteries are non-replaceable.  I guess these units are disposable.  I really enjoyed this unit, I bought a second one in Jan 06.  Both now are pretty much useless due to battery problems.  Both units seem not to charge from the wall charger that came with them.  Both only charge from the USB port on my computer.  Cheap thrill for friends, not real practical for use.
