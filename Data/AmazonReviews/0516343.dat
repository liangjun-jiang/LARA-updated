<Title>I like it, but I'm not impressed.
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this 16GB Sansa View for my wife as a Christmas present.  To make it an even better Christmas present I loaded all of her music, some choice pictures, and a few memorable videos.  At first I was very satisfied with the View.  It initializes fast and picks-up at the same screen that I shut it off at.  Media transfer is super fast!  The scroll wheel works great, in fact, I approve more of the View's physical wheel than the iPod's tactile wheel.  The screen has amazing clarity and resolution isn't a problem.  However, in opposition to these features that I liked, I did encounter a few disappointing glitches with the View that has me wanting to return it and try another brand.  Perhaps I just got the one bad egg out of a hundred; but I'll inform anyone who wants to read on of my experience.  The music loaded just fine with one exception; I had to use a rear USB port to do it.  For whatever reason my front USB port wouldn't identify the device.  I have only one complaint as far as the View's capibility of to handle music.  It doesn't have a method (as far as I know) to allow you to quickly scroll thru the Play/Song/Artist/Album List.  Your only option is to scroll and scroll and scroll and scroll until you get to the bottom.  A minor inconvenience.  The pictures appeared to load just fine.  After loading the pictures I could go to the Thumbnail gallary and view all the pictures.  Choosing a picture would display it in landscape view.  You turn the player sideways to view the pictures and the controls even rotate to make navigation in landscape mode easy!  Sweet feature.  I had no problems until after running the first slideshow.  All of a sudden two of the pictures became an unsupported media type and no longer showed up as a Thumbnail; they showed up as a generic Icon of a camera?!?!  Another major problem will be mentioned below with the Video section.  The videos loaded fine as well.  With the screens excellent resolution I was extremly satisfied with video quality.  I watched all of the videos several times and I knew that my wife would really get excited once she saw how clear they were displayed.  However, she never got to see them.  I got everything loaded about two weeks before Christmas.  I made sure that the battery was fully charged, then I boxed it up, and I wrapped it.  Come Christmas morning my wife fired up the View and I just sat back in eager anticipation of her to stumbling upon the preloaded music, pictures, and videos.  When she went into the pictures menu she asked me, "Why can't I see the pictures?"  I asked, "What do you mean?" while snatching the View out of her hands.  During the two weeks that the View spent under the Christmas tree it somehow lost the ability to display pictures and videos!!!  Instead of the picture/video it displays the title of the file.  With videos it'll play sound but no picture.  I downloaded the latest firmware and that didn't fix the problem.  It does the same thing with any new pictures/videos that I load also.  In the end there are just too many unacceptable aggravations for me to want to keep this MP3 player.  Barring any firmware miracles, I'm going to return this and try the 16GB Zen.

<Title>A Serious Contender
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me preface this review by saying that all the necessary legwork needed in order to maximize the use of the Sansa View or any other player that I would have decided to purchase - Windows XP updated, WMP 11 updated, all music properly archived, named, categorized, and tagged with album art, and ditto for photos - had already been done.  That said, the View gets five stars from me on work ethic alone.  All I did was plug it into one of my front USB ports with WMP open and running, and before I even realized what it was doing and stopped it, it had already found ALL my music & pictures without me giving it any direction whatsoever and had synched over 6 gig (more than the entire capacity of my previous player) worth of data...in less than two minutes!    Now, I stopped it because like most people I'm sure, I didn't want to sync everything, nor do I believe everything would have fit on it anyway.  But since it was such an eager beaver, I decided to toy around for an evening with what it had already loaded onto the player, and I'm basing much of this review on a comparison to my previous player (Philips GoGear HDD1630, which I still own and still works well...on AC power, that is).  The View is the same width as the GoGear, but almost an inch longer and about 1/4" thinner.  The screen is more than twice the size of the GoGear, and takes up half of the front of the entire unit.  It shows pictures and album art with as much resolution and clarity as any high-end digital camera on the market.  Sound quality is superb for both audio files and the FM radio - much more volume than the GoGear but without losing any clarity -  but I actually like the GoGear's earbuds a little better than the ones included with the View.  Scroll wheel, menu and enter buttons are all on the face of the device (where they should be), easily accessible from many angles and finger sizes, and properly tuned for sensitivity.  Speed of data transfer has already been covered.  :-)  And after an entire evening of intense scrolling, pressing, skipping, entering and holding, I barely knocked a dent into the battery life.  Menu navigation is a bit clunky and will take some getting used to.  I was accustomed to the GoGear's style of menu navigation, and so far I still like it better.  If you're accustomed to iPod menu navigation, you'd probably like the View's better.  The biggest annoyance so far is that the 'Now Playing' screen will sometimes freeze after returning from the Menu screen, and you can't do anything with the player until it catches up to itself (15-60 sec.).  But that may have been entirely due to my trying to do too much too fast.   You'll have to rely on someone else's expertise for the video features.  I don't believe I'll ever warm up to the idea of sitting and watching something on a screen this small.   At the time of my writing this review, the 16g View was 30 bucks cheaper than the 6g GoGear when I purchased it in Jan. of '06.  But even more impressive is that it's 15 bucks cheaper than an 8g Zune and 10 bucks cheaper than an iPod Nano.  You do the math.    A high-quality set of eardbuds, a protective cover of some sort and a car charger (or maybe even just ONE of those three), And the View would run circles around the aforementioned players.  I know nothing is ever perfect, but I think people would be willing to pay a bit more for some included accessories rather than hunting and paying for them separately, especially when you condiser how much bang for the buck this is.  I think the View has all the potential to snatch a significant share of the digital audio market.  If you're like me, on your second or third digital audio player purchase (which many people are by now), I'd give the View a serious look.  If this is your first DAP purchase, same advice...but do both the homework and legwork first.  4.5 Stars

<Title>Great product
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought one of these to replace a failed Toshiba 30gb hard drive based MP3 player.  A solid player, with a bright and big screen and lots of battery life (thanks to it being flash based).  Syncing up was a breeze like most modern mp3 players. No complaints with this model.  It is a little bigger than I expected (in terms of length), the depth of the model is perfect.

<Title>Okay for audio doesn't play video properly
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have a lot of experience with these devices.   Ipod Video units, Creative Vision M, other sansa players.  The good: this player is smaller and lighter than Hard Drive based players, it is expandable too, with micro SD Flash RAM.   You can drag and drop to and from it.    Not tied to itunes or other software.   You can use it with rental music stores like Napster (requires use of WMP).   It can hold a lot of material, especially for a flash based player.   It is affordable and simple to use.  The bad: the interface is not near as smooth as the ipod, Contrary to specification it will not play back my video files that the ipod will, this player locks up especially with longer videos.   I have encoded them properly at 320x240.    In addition it lacks the capacity to play 640x480 files (not supposed to to but would have been nice).   So it is really just a higher capacity larger form factor sansa MP3 player.    Too many issues with video to be worth while as PVP.   The rewriting of the database when you unplug it is slow.  That said Apple's new IPODS have been engineered with a new piece of firmware that cripples video unless you use their new docks that have an authentication chip in them.    I would recommend boycotting apple ipod products until they release firmware that no longer locks out third party cables and docks.   They did this without warning so an IPOD classic for example is not an actual classic because the ipod video units that it replaces work well with third party cables and docks and the Classic is designed not to!  So I will end up stuck with the Sansa because I got it for xmas and it was over the 30 day period when I received it and found the video issues but I am not happy with it.    My players of choice remain the Gen 5 and 5.5 Ipod Video units, they are not designed to allow moving music and video on and off like the View allows but they do work and with third party software you can transfer music and video from them to you computer.  I would not recommend the ipod nano because even though it plays video they put that same authentication chip in it.   Yes the View may not have a video out capability at this time, but at least Sandisk didn't purposely engineer firmware so you can't use older Sansa docks or third party products with it.

<Title>Looks great, decent interface, but terrible hardware and sofware.
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was really excited when I got my Sansa View. I'm a SanDisk fanboy. In the past SanDisk has proven themselves a very reliable company with solid products. As soon as I had my songs loaded up and began skipping through them I noticed my Sansa View began locking up, remaining unresponsive until I turned it off.   This was a big let-down as I was very happy to have a flash-based MP3 player with this kind of storage and advertised battery life. The battery life was not even close to the claimed 37 hours of music. After fully charging my Sansa it was down to half power after a few hours. The radio reception and audio recording were pretty poor in quality too. I'm returning mine as soon as I can. I'm not sure why this is getting such positive reviews, but my experience was not good. I haven't had an MP3 player this bad since I made the horrible mistake of buying a Sony.  This was a huge disappointment with me, my old 2gb Sansa worked great. SanDisk really dropped the ball on this one.

<Title>Seriously dissapointed
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>i have to admit that i was seriously dissapointed with my sansa view.  After reading about the sansa view, i honestly believed that it was a great product, so i bought 2 (one for me and one for a friend).  The main reason i picked the sansa was for the back up of the SanDisk brand name, which should be great.... after two days of use i was very happy with the device, but all of a sudden, the screen went black and it just stopped working.  you could turn it on and the blue ring would shine, but nothing else worked (buttons, screen, etc.).  on the other hand my friends device was working "ok", if it weren't for the fact that the screen sometimes wouldn't have a clear image (it would shake and unstable).  i wrote the Sansa support team an email, but i never heard back from them.  we decided to return the devices, and i'll defenitly never buy any SanDisk product again, other than their flash memory cards.

<Title>Best bang for your buck .mp3 player as of Jan. 2008
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is basically a refined and supersized version of SanDisk's e200 series .mp3 players, which were already pretty good.  I've had mine for about 2 weeks, here are some of my thoughts on it:  -Only thing I really miss is the tactile feed back (it clicked when you moved it) from the old selector wheel, but they've compensated for it somewhat by requiring you to move the wheel a bit more to highlight a selection.    -Make sure you update the firmware ASAP, its still very new so the default firmware has bugs, they've been quick to fix them though.  -Almost no accessories out for it at the time of this review.  Somewhat annoying as this thing attracts scratches as much as it attracts fingerprints, you definitely want to get one for it if you want to make sure it doesn't look beat up within a year.  I got the generic black silicone one that you see here:  http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Sandisk-Sansa-View-Silicone-Skin-Case-with-Armband/2916955/product.html, it protects the case quite well and doesn't block the buttons but doesn't protect the screen at all.  -Its bigger than the e200 series but its not huge by any means, actually fits in my pocket a bit better since its thinner than the e200 series was.  -It can play movies but don't bother getting it for that (I'd look at a Archos or something similar if you want to view your movies while you wait on a plane or something), the screen is still to small and it eats up the battery time quickly, this is still first and foremost a .mp3 player.  -Transfer speeds are fine, it took 20 min. or so to move about 3.8GB of .mp3's to the View.  Someone was complaining about how slow it was to move files despite having a USB 2.0 interface in one of these reviews, thats a common issue with flash right now. Its very durable and uses less power than a mechanical micro hard drive but it also has slower read and write speeds, so no matter how fast that USB 2.0 interface is it can only move data around as fast as the flash memory will allow it to.  Its a trade off that is well worth it IMO, especially if go running with it.  -You can move files/.mp3's to and off it just like the e200 series by treating it like a USB flash drive, no crappy media transfer software required!  However you have to put the View into MSC mode to do it first, note that protected (DRM'ed files, like Amazon Unbox, iTunes, etc.) files will not work, also it will mess up your .mp3 playlists if you go back and forth between MSC and MTP (they may fix this though with a firmware update...).  There is a "secret handshake" you have to do to get into this mode:  # Put the View into hold.  # Hold down the Left button (left side of the jogwheel) for about 10 seconds. You will see the screen black out for a second and then come back.  # Connect the View to the PC.  It'll show up as a regular flash drive (as will the microSD slot) in My Computer on winXP.  -You can't switch out the battery yourself like you could with the e200 series but the one that is built in should last a long time so long as you charge it properly.

<Title>Great Possibilities, Horrible Quality
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you are impatient and can't read the following...long story short...this product is of terrible quality and is cheaply made.  I had researched both this product and the creative Zen 16 gig player throughly prior to purchase and decided on the Sansa View because of its better SD card integration, superior battery life, compatibility, and user interface.  However when I received my product I immediately notice that the face plate was off center and there was a prominent overhang of a few millimeters that over time would most definitely result in the faceplate coming off the unit.  I called Sandisk and they gave me difficulty with an RMA so I decided to exchange it at BestBuy.  BestBuy, to my complete suprise, was actually very helpful exchanging the product and opening it up to ensure that I would be satisfied with the new one.  When they opened the box however we found that there was an actual crack running along the faceplate seal and you could see into the player.  Because that product was unsellable they opened up yet another Sansa View.  This time the faceplate was more or less centered but again it had a visible crack.  Although this crack was smaller it most certainly will grow over time until it splits open.  Clearly this is a quality issue on Sandisk's part as three out of three units had obvious defects.  Now I'm stuck with a unit that is going to break open in a matter of months.  Keep in mind Sandisk doesn't cover cracks in the faceplate because they will claim it is due to normal wear and tear.  Bottom line:  great potential as a product, terrible quality, don't expect it to last, buy at your own risk.

<Title>I had an e260, now I have this
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>So to anyone that owned the previous e200 product, this review might be interesting to you. Here are some things that they fixed form the e200.  -The record "feature" on the side of the unit is now a slider button and I have never hit it accidentally unlike on the e200.  -The wheel is much higher quality and it is also a "click wheel" so you don't have to deal with the tiny buttons around the wheel like on the e200. -Video is no longer .mov (yuck) so I think that opens more opportunities.  -It starts up MUCH faster!  Here are some things they didn't fix! -The volume levels are still all wrong to me. There is still a "normal" and "high" volume mode. Couldn't they just make the volume scale better?  -The player still randomly freezes. It freezes reliably for me when I do "recent tracks" or "play all tracks" and then skip through some songs. Hopefully they will fix this in a firmware release. -Sansa Media Converter 2 sucks about as bad as Sansa Media Converter 1.   And in general: -The battery life on my View is very unimpressive. I haven't been getting more than 4 or 5 hours if I had to guess. It's rated at 35! I might send mine in but that means I get a refurb back...blah -There have been some reviews that say the low end sound is a little flat. I haven't really noticed but I don't listen on high quality headphones or high quality car audio system.  -It should get louder even on the "high" volume setting, and it should get lower even on the "normal" volume setting.  -Why the need for a proprietary USB connector?? -The video feature is cool I guess, and it was something I thought about when I bought it, but just like on my e260 -- I never use it. You might want to be realistic with yourself if you're choosing it thinking you will use the video feature...  Overall it works really well as an audio player. If I didn't have a battery issue i would give it a 4.

<Title>If you want to play Audible Books, don't buy
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Having had much success with previous SanDisk products using Audible I purchased the 16GB View.  However, much to my disappointment, I found using the View for Audible unacceptable.  If, after listening to part of a book, you switch to a song or another book, and then return to the original book, the book starts all over again.  I contacted Audible who referred me to SanDisk who informed me that the device was designed that way.  Very disappointing to say the least.  Who wants to fast forward every time after returning to a book?  For full disclosure, the device does start up where you left off on a book if you power down; but if you at any time, while the power is on, switch to another song or book, you start all over on the original book.  This is not acceptable and the device is being returned ASAP!

<Title>iPod or Zune?  How about neither?
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For months I struggled with the decision of where to put my money on an mp3 player.  The search ended here and I'm quite happy with it.  Primarily, I didn't want to be handcuffed to iTunes or Zune's market place.  Another concern was the conversion of mp3 and .wma files.  Also I didn't want to have to deal with DRM music or additional software on my PC to learn or navigate.    This device does it all: music, video and pictures, plus it even has an FM tuner.  It syncs up through Windows Media Player's library and does a nice job.  I have over 2000 songs (and now growing) and the Sansa View loads in about one hour through a USB connection.  If I run out of room I can add a micro SD card for about $80.  If you're worried about disk space, spend another $100 and go for the Sansa View 32.  Get the extended warranty (two years) just in case.  For about $30 it's good insurance.  It's slim, lightweight and very intuitive to use.  I have called Sandisk's tech support once for assistance and they were quick to answer, professional, and they spoke English.  My friends who have other brands see it and they all are impressed with it.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with this one.

<Title>A little rough on the video sync
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Nice unit, but not perfect with the video (yet).  The media conversion program that automatically appears on the desktop with the first sync does not recognize the sansa view.  After going to the sandisk website and updating the firmware, reformating the sansa and downloading the new media convertor from the sansa site, I now have video on my sansa view. It may not all be Sandisk's fault.  The problem requiring reformatting only occured after trying to sync to windows media player.   Actually it is my daughters, and about an hour into working with her on the above process, she asked if it was supposed to be this difficult.  Hard to answer.  She did not understand why it would not work out of the box.     Unless Sandisk has this better put together, plan on a couple of hours updating the firmware............ and explaining to your daughter why it is new and doesn't work at first.  Other than the video grief, nice unit.

<Title>Truly an amazing mp3 player, twice the memory/half the price of an Ipod
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Having read some of the other reviews, I can see most of people's issues with this device are either: a) faulty product b) it's doesn't look/function like an Ipod c) video conversion/watching issues  To be honest, I've had none of these issues. It is exactly as I thought it would be (the size is clearly stated, so complaining it is too big is kinda stupid).  It's far more responsive than my last Sansa e260; has amazing sound quality (especially if you dump the headphones and buy the Koss 'Plug' - which are amazing); beautiful interface and very logical (if you want it too look/function like an Ipod, then buy an Ipod...); You are able to delete tracks (and not just when it's attached to your computer - which you're not able to do on the e260/Ipod); and it has a genuine Standby Mode that saves battery power and quickly turns back on from (it doesn't just dull the screen a little, which is pointless and energy draining). I've had faulty Sandisk products in the past and have been easily able to exchange them (the support have always been quick and helpful to me). It even has the headphone socket at the bottom now, which means you don't have to keep flipping it around to see the menus. Honestly, I think it's a great piece of electronics, and for the price (I got mine for US$160) I can't fault it. Overall, better sound, video and look than the e260 and Ipod, in my opinion. ps. Make sure you update to the most recent firmware (.06 I think) or you'll have issues RW/FW.

<Title>IPOD Move Over
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Most of my friends know I like to be different so I compared the Sansa View to various IPODs and went with the View.  Downloading is so easy.  I go to Windows Media Player and just copy my selection to portable device.  It's that easy.  My co-workers bring their IPOD chargers to work everyday and I charge my View once a week, twice if I listen to it eight hours a day.  The only downfall is that accessories are limited.  Best Buys only had one cover made for the View for about $35 and other stores didn't even carry that one.  Besides accessories being hard to get, I'm happy with the Sansa View.  -  JR

<Content>This player supports many different file types and has a long battery life. It is designed well, and the firmware is decent. It will freeze up sometimes but will output audio while frozen. This freeze is not very common and usually goes away in less than ten seconds for the most part. For videos, I was unable to use sansa media converter (it installed fine but there was something with vista that caused a problem I think, because I am unable to access the files in such a way where it works with WMP), but windows media encoder works fine (just use CBR video). Audio quality is great, and the battery lasts a long time (not sure if it is truly 35 hrs but I wouldn't doubt it). Supports .m4a files, I don't remember if it is advertised as such though. Would recommend, the expandable memory works without a problem, there is a small icon next to the files when viewing with the media player to differentiate the location of the files.

<Content>I have owned this product for a little over a month and it is very good with one very specific issue.  Copying video onto the View is a total pain.  You cannot just copy video, you must go through the approved converter.  That can take a very long time.  I have a very fast computer and the converter pegs the CPUs at 99% while doing a conversion.  It also takes 35 minutes to convert 20 minutes of video.  If you want drag and drop this is not the viewer for you.

<Title>Best Value Among Flash Players
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>In terms of features per dollar the Sandisk Sansa View is by far the most impressive offering on the market.  Though it may not be as sleek or as small as some of its more expensive competitors, it makes up for it with features and performance.  Pros: Massive amount of storage for the price. Expandability with microSD slot. Support (not listed in specs strangely enough) for non-DRM Apple AAC/A4C files; this means iTunes Plus and other DRM-free iTunes Music. Compatibility with more online stores than almost any other player. Amazing battery life when listening to music (more like 30 than 35.) Abundant features like voice recording and FM tuner.  Cons: Only 5 hours of actual battery life for video-playing. Casing feels less sturdy than some other players. Not many cases out there for it.  Bottom Line: I love this thing.  Great price, great features, good quality sound.  I strongly recommend this for anyone wanting more bang for their buck than offered by some of the more known brands.

<Title>Disappointed
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I waited a couple of months for the 16GB View.  When I received it I tried to insert 4 additional GBs in the additional memory slot.  The micro disk flipped out hit me in the nose and disappeared in my car. Those things are so small I never found it.  Turns out that the spring in the expansion slot was broken.  I returned the View for another one.  This time the problem was the battery which wouldn't stay charged for more than 1 to 2 hours.  This MP3 needs a lot of work.  I had the e200 series 8 GB for about a year and enjoyed it but the View is a waste of money.  Beware.

<Title>Great product and adding Podcasts
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got mine a couple of weeks ago and once I got the Firmware update it's been great! I also have the Sansa E280 (8Gig) and was very happy with it so I had high expectations for the view.  I really was disappointed that they still use the Windows Media Player to manage the media. I guess some people have no problems with the WMP but never seems to work correctly for me.  When I got my Sansa E280 I found a program from BakMyTunes called saCaster ($14.95 and worth twice as much!) that manages my music, lets me create and manage all the playlists I want, backs up and restores the media files and allows me to subscribe to and manage Podcasts directly.  When I got my View I contacted BakMyTunes support and found out that they already had a update available for the View and it's free to registered users!  The only negative I have for the View is that it doesn't support playlists created in the MSC mode. I hope with enough people complaining they will fix this.  For me this is Sandisk's best player yet!!!

<Title>don't do it.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the Sansa View mainly because of the 16 GB capacity, and found the operation to be rather confusing. The instruction "manual" is no help whatsoever, so I was left to fend for myself.  It took me an entire day to figure out how to turn the infernal thing off, and after the player froze on me, I decided that this was cutting edge technology that hadn't yet cut out all the blips.  I returned it, and  I'm much happier with the more compact Sandisk e280.

<Title>Great
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had originally purchased the 8 GB Sansa View elsewhere for $149 and I would have been able to purchase the 16 GB for only a little more at Amazon. So I did, for a family member because I couldn't pass up such a good price with free shipping!! The product is attractive, small, light weight and has very good graphics. I have a Rhapsody membership for downloads which makes using this device a snap. I hope my family member enjoys this item as much as I do.

<Title>Not perfect but a great bang for the buck!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Unfortunately the item I ordered from Amazon never arrived, so I got a refund and bought it locally. It's a good player, certainly not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do, and it does it quite well. I especially like the microSD slot, which means one can increase the player's capacity, theroretically up to 64Gb: 8/16/32Gb on the player (depending on the model), and up to 32Gb on the microSD card, although the card with the highest capacity available at the moment is 12Gb. For this price you can't go wrong, although the software is sometimes buggy. SanDisk releases firmware updates pretty often, though. So if you are patient, the View will get better by aging. :)

<Title>Do not buy this product!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm pretty easy to please, but I am very disappointed in the Sansa View (16gb).  One of the dumbest things I've ever done (in terms of purchases) is return a Zune I got for Christmas and swap it for this model.  It is easy enough to use, but it locks up a lot.  I use mine (as an MP3 player only) about 1 hour a day, and in that hour, it typically locks 3 to 5 times.  When it locks, I cannot adjust the sound or change songs for sometimes as long as 2 to 3 minutes.  This is not only inconvenient, but sometimes quite uncomfortable, particularly when it locks at higher volumes.  For $50 more, I wish I had my Zune back!

<Title>sansa view joins sansa e200 as the ipod killer
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>just as the sansa e200's with all their great features at a significantly lower cost than the apple ipod the sansa view does the samething thus  making this sandisk's double wammy blow to apple ipods when it comes to bang for the buck. and like the e200's, the view also does not require  you to purchase itunes thus making the e200's and view much more  economical than the ipods as well when it comes to music downloads.  basically the view is identical to the e200 with the only major difference being that the e200 has a 1.8" lcd and the view has a 2.4" lcd and well as the flagship e200 topping out at 8gb memory while the flagship view tops out at 16gb with a 32gb version soon to be released. other features the view's has besides holding songs are photos, videos, and has a fm radio, recorder, and memory slot for when you need more memory, again just like it's slightly smaller sibling e200. to sum it up, the view and e200 are basically identical twin siblings and both are ipod killers when it comes to bang for the buck and the only way to really decide which to buy is decide what you want 1.8" or 2.4" lcd as well as if 8gb memory is enough, remember both the e200 and view have a memory  slot for additional memory. finally, whichever you buy, e200 or view you're going with a winner and a ipod killer either way, i know because i own both and are enjoying them to the fullest.

<Title>Great deal, slightly immature product
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Overall, I've been very pleased with my Sansa View, and do not regret buying it. For the price, it's one of the best and largest-capacity players available, and the interface is comfortable and easy to use. However, the firmware (code that the device itself runs) is a little buggy, and you really want to keep the View in a protective case (especially if you store it in a pocket with your keys).  Pros: Great capacity of flash memory for the price. Excellent battery life (30+ hours). Comfortable size (fits easily in your hand or your pocket). Works across different OSes and programs. Simple and practical interface.  Cons: Firmware bug: sometimes won't leave hold mode until restarted. Firmware bug: Occasionally takes a few moments to update song display. Casing and screen susceptible to scratching. Uses proprietary cable for data/charging (USB to SanDisk dock).  The firmware is getting periodically updated, and is already good enough in general, but glitches such as described above prevent it from having a really polished feel (and a fifth star).  While I'm no audiophile and can't really compare audio quality well, I've been happy with the sound the View produces, especially with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IG66VS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-8687151-6120413">JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)</a> I bought to use with it.

<Title>Good player, bad firmware.
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The SanDisk Sansa View is a pretty nice player from a hardware standpoint. Its build quality is solid, it looks nice, and it has good sound quality if you don't use the stock headphones. Admittedly, it's nothing flashy, but it isn't meant to be - it's a low cost, high capacity MP3 player.  It has one huge failing, however, in the quality of its firmware. It crashes and, despite claims of long battery life, the player only lasts about six hours on a full charge with the latest firmware. Considering I purchased this player for work, that makes it virtually useless to me unless I feel like sitting in silence the last few hours of my shift.   I actually returned one of these thinking that the battery was defective, when in fact the players only manage about 17% of the battery life SanDisk claims. If you don't update the firmware, the problem isn't so bad. I managed about twelve hours on a full charge with the factory firmware, but it had issues with crashing that forced me to update it.  Anyone considering this player might want to give it a few months before jumping on board. It's not bad, but the firmware needs a lot of work. Needless to say, I'll be thinking long and hard before I purchase a SanDisk product within a year of its launch in the future...Then buying something else instead.  It saddens me, honestly, because I really like the player itself. Its simple design really is elegant, the screen is large and clear, and the navigation wheel makes maneuvering menus a breeze. If it could swing even half of the battery life that SanDisk claims, I'd be perfectly happy with the View, but it is very far off the mark. As things stand now, I'm seriously considering a refund to purchase a player from a different manufacturer.

<Content>I'll keep this review short. If you own one of the Sansa e200 series MP3 players and want to upgrade to something with more memory or a bigger screen then this is your best bet. It has the same easy menus and music transfer options as it's "little brother". My only complain is the new design... I liked the prototype of the Sansa View better (the original version was practically all screen). The same old design as the e200 series won't turn any heads when browsing through MP3 players at a store

<Title>I love mine
<Date>Wed Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've read some pretty negative reviews about this thing, but now that I own one, I don't know why these people are knockin it.  I don't think it is cheaply made, it feels pretty sturdy and it is indeed gorgeous.  I didn't really have to read the manual to get this thing to work.  I just plugged it into the USB port on my laptop and dragged and dropped my music folders and movies into the device.  You don't have to install any drivers to get this thing to work either.  I love how it displays the album art.  The earbuds it comes with are pretty crappy.  I replaced the stock earbuds with a pair of gunmetal black V-MODA Vibe ear canal headphones ($75.00 from Amazon) and this MP3 players sounds pretty damn amazing.  People have knocked this thing for poor audio quality.  You can't buy a 200 dollar mp3 player and use a pair of cheapo headphones.  Buy a decent set and I guarantee you will be impressed with the sound.  I am also impressed with the FM Tuner, I'm in Kuwait and it picks up the U.S. military AFN radio network with awesome clarity, my alarm clock radio hardly picks up the signal but my View picks it up perfectly and it sounds great.  The voice recorder works and I have fun recording myself saying absolutely ridiculous things.  Video looks great as well!  I have watched Bruce Almighty on this thing.  While the screen size is small, the picture is damn fine!  I can't comment on using a music service because I don't use one at all.  Inside the package comes with a mini CD that has some Best Buy Music Service on the disk.  This is the only thing on the disk, no drivers or anything, junk IMPO.  Another thing this player gets knocked for is that it is supposed to have gapless music playback, I really can't tell the difference so this isn't important to me, maybe to some it is, but I haven't really noticed if there is a gap or not.  If you have a bunch of DRM protected songs that won't work, I recommend purchasing DRM removal software such as soundtaxi or tunebite which will turn DRM protected music to non protected files.  I have used soundtaxi in the past and it works wonderful.  To convert DVD's into MP4, I use a program called CuCusoft Ultimate DVD + Video Converter and I make my own MP4 movies which I can then drag and drop into the View itself, again, the videos look amazing.  A couple of things worth mentioning.  The package does include a quick start guide, but no user manual.  Not even on the CD, the user manual must be downloaded from the sandisk website. I have also spoken with techsupport and they recommend that the optimal video size to use while recording video should be 480x272.  I have been using 320x240 so I will start using what they recommend.  There is also an unofficial firmware update going around but according to the techsupport person I talked to, they don't recommend using it.  I spoke with them on NOV 7, 2007 so if you flash to the new firmware, you do so at your own risk.  I will be waiting untill the firmware is officially released on Sandisk's website.  Sorry for the rambling, but this is an amazing MP3 player and is worth your consideration.  I love mine, and I use it the gym every morning.  I had originally purchased one from Amazon but it was backordered untill DEC 1, 2007.  Best Buy has them in stock and they are shipping.

<Title>Excellent.....Well Mostly
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Sansa View 16GB two weeks ago and I am mostly satisfied.  After downloading the latest firmware (.06A) I found most of the initial quirks have been addressed. First, you will notice the construction which is very solid and, despite those who think the Sansa View is ugly, I find it elegant.  The size is very appropriate, fitting easily in the palm, without feeling huge and not so small you will fumble and drop it (i.e.  Zen V!) Other reviewers have complained about the menu icons......This is really foolish since I did not purchase the View for it's "flashy" icons.  Look it...the icons are obvious and glide smoothly along the screen in conjunction with the rotation of the data wheel. The video functionality is very good.  I use a Neuros MPEG Recorder II and it works flawlessly.  I have had a bit of trouble with syncing videos with WMP 10, but I would sooner blame Microsoft not the Sansa View. The downloaded Sansa Media Converter utility is not the best software, taking a long time to transcode files and lacking a lot of file support but I have many applications for this so it's not a problem. Music files transfer easily with WMP with fast transfer speeds. (USB 2) It's important, however, to make sure that "one off" downloaded songs and such are properly tagged, otherwise they will end up difficult to find. The sound quality of the Sansa View is exceptional with no clicking, pops, or distortion.  Volume levels are easily able to get above noisy environments, even without isolation type ear buds.  The equalizer functions very well and your settings are held in memory.   Building playlists can be done with WMP or simply on the View.  Browse your tunes and just press and hold the center function button and the song gets added to the playlist.  Unfortunately, only one list can be assembled on the unit, although multiple lists can be imported with WMP. You can also drag and drop audio and jpeg files right into the Sansa View Explorer pane.  Non jpeg photos can be quickly transcoded with the Sansa Media Converter.  The Cons:  Presently, there is no audio bookmarking function for long podcast files or audiobooks.  (Bookmarking is available for videos)            Some video files within the advertised specs will not play.            Uses a proprietary usb cable            Virtually no cases available as of yet except one DLO case (which I bought) that is "hodge-podgy" and obscures the beauty of the Sansa View.            Although battery life is quite good, it is not as good as advertised.            The battery is not accessible and would require a factory replacement.  Other than these few cons, the Sansa View is a truly exceptional player.  I am banking on future Firmware upgrades that allow Audio Bookmarking and better Video File Support, as well as address a few other quirks and stability issues.  The hardware is excellent and obviously capable. Considering prices for the 16GB around $200. (the price of the 8GB Nano) you really cannot go wrong with this device.....and, yes it does support non-DRM AAC files from your present itunes collection. I'd say....."Buy it!"

<Content>If you're looking for a media player (music, video, or other) and don't want to pay out the wazoo for some iThing, then this is you're BEST bet!  Not only does it do everything that the Apple Pods do, but it also has FM radio and voice recorder.  Also, ya get more GB for your buck.  Compared to 8 GB in the Nano, you get double that for the same space, PLUS there's an SD Micro card slot to take that even further!  The audio sounds EXCELENT, and you can change the EQ to your preference, not just presets.  The video is crystal clear and fluid on a screen larger than the Nano.  No squinting on this screen.  I don't think I could've asked for anything better that this little player right here.  So, if you're wanting to get a Nano or other media player, you need to give this a serious thought.

<Content>I was already sold on the Sansa brand as I've previously owned an e260 (4gb) & currently have an e280r (8gb) and now the Sansa View (16gb).  You get so much more feature-wise with the Sansa and the price is better too!  When I first priced it on Amazon it was $200 but I checked back a couple of days later and the price had dropped to $175 plus you got a $5 credit toward Amazon MP3 downloads so that was it for me I knew I had to jump on it!  My only con would be the ear buds included with them but that wasn't really an issue either as I have the Bosein-ear headphones.  It just doesn't get any better than this!

<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are one of those people who actually care what you are buying from a feature, sound quality, and value standpoint this is your device.  Asthetically the Sansa View is very pleasing, very thin and light, with great controls.  Sound quality is excellent.  Storage is at least 2x what other players give you at a similar price point.  And of course the biggest selling point for me, you are not locked inside Apple hell which is a non-starter for me - and should be fore most people.  Who wants to build a music library, spend thousands of dollars and countless hours and then be tied to one device manufacturer for the rest of your life??  What if the next gen Apples fall behind a step or starts charging even more for their players?  I've had 2 iPods and they are good devices as well, but no better than this one (in fact missing a lot of features like FM tuner, sound recording, multi-format audio and video support).  And it doesn't hurt that this is the price of a Nano with 2x as much storage.

<Title>Big hopes. Horrible experience.
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For Christmas I decided that it would be time to officially launch myself into the world of portable MP3 enjoyment. Although my audio collection was quite extensive I always played my music selections from a desktop or laptop system, but it finally seemed time to enable my enjoyment of the media while "on the go". I began my research into the available MP3 players in early November, and after a few weeks I finally settled on the Sandisk Sansa View 16GB model. I was greatly pleased by the model's price-to-capacity ratio, and my experience with an 8GB display model in Best Buy was brief but enjoyable.  I wrote out my letter to Santa making sure to detail my good deeds for the year while playing down my less-than-admirable actions and eagerly awaited Christmas morning. You can imagine my joy to find the nice little package patiently awaiting my unwrapping that morning, and in no time I had the device unpackaged and juicing itself up to full charge via my laptop while we visited my relatives for the day's festivities.  At the end of the day I returned home to find the device mysteriously off even though the USB charging cable was still plugged in and the laptop still dutifully chugging away. This is where my troubles began, but let me start by listing the positives of this device:  The Good: * The Sansa View interface is intuitive and responsive. * The support for the USB Mass Storage class is appreciated. * The size to capacity ratio is currently unbeatable in the flash-based MP3 player market. * The integrated FM tuner is a major plus.  The good is why I purchased this device, and these points were all addressed in early reviews of the relatively new product. However, I have to question if the reviewers were given either incomplete prototypes or were given units which were specifically tested to function for the reviewers. Having thoroughly digressed now I return to the Christmas evening in question.  I pickup up the device to find the screen was on but blank and the controls were completely unresponsive - not a good sign. The device had apparently locked up. After some research I found how to hard shut down the device so I unplugged and rebooted the device. I confirmed that the device was indeed fully charged, so I once again plugged the device back into my laptop in order to transfer music. That's when strange things started happening again.  The device continuously rebooted itself while plugged in, but not knowing the particulars of the device's transfer methodology I let it sit until 10 minutes later when the device was finally recognized by my laptop and stopped rebooting. I browsed the device to the music folder and began copying over a sample 5GB of music to the device and observed very strange behavior. Although the device and my laptop are USB 2.0 compatible the transfer took roughly 30 minutes - far longer than acceptable for the USB 2.0 protocol. I tried on different ports to eliminate the possibility of a fried USB port on my laptop but observed the same behavior. Strangely enough the, device seemed to mirror it original connection issue as it appeared to lose and reestablish the USB connection repeatedly during the transfer which possibly caused the great delay in the data transfer. Strike one.  Once the transfer finally completed I had to reboot the device again as it had once again locked up, but once the database was rebuilt within the player all my music was there and I tried to enjoy the fruits of my labor by playing some music - you know, the reason the device was created in the first place. However, every single MP3 that I played in various formats - WAV, ACC, and MP3 (various encoding engines and bitrates) caused the device to crash after ~20s-30s of playback requiring a hard reboot. So the device is more or less unusable. Strike two.  I figured that since the device was relatively new that maybe there were a few bugs that needed to be worked out and may have already been addressed in new firmware updates. I browsed the Sandisk website to find that they did not offer updates for download, and only through the kindness of a forum member was I able to get the new update. But alas, t'was for naught. I needed to copy the firmware update to the device and reboot it to apply the update but at this point no matter which computer I plugged the device into no computer recognized the device. I could not apply the update which means I was basically out of luck completely. Strike three.  While browsing the basically user-run support forum I was alerted to an issue that I had previously not noticed - The device was split along the left side of the case! I could actually see into the device, and I could surmise that this defect would only grow through normal wear and tear. Strike four - you're very out.  I continued to attempt to get the device to work on various system and operating systems (Windows XP, Suse Linux 10.2, FreeBSD 5.0) but the behavior was the same on all systems. At this point I was now eight hours into the frustrating ordeal and begrudgingly packed up the device into its store packaging for a prompt refund. The sad part is that I really wanted to like this device - its features were outstanding. However, features are good and well but when they don't work it's kind of a moot point.  I am an Electrical Engineer by degree and a Computer Programmer by trade, and I can assure you that if my team released a product of this quality there would be one or more people left without a job.  Sorry Sandisk - You make great memory cards but I don't foresee myself ever purchasing an MP3 player again considering my experiences have bee mirrored by numerous other users on various forums.
