<Title>Zune is cool!
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an awesome device! My local store only had two left when I went in this afternoon and I'm really happy I got it. It's interface is really pretty and I love how you can really make it you by personalizing it. It makes my 'other mp3 player' seem boring!

<Title>could be perfect but,........
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not going to give a big review, just a few thoughts: 1. Make it a little thicker to give more battery life (this will piss off lots of people for me saying this). 2.Give me a stinking EQ! Give me a choice of having it on or off to use wi-fi or not. I don't use this feature myself so omitting the eq makes me seem unimportant. Also, a few people are saying that after they updated their zunes (1st gen) they still had an eq - BUMMER!!! 3.Allow me to use other programs to sync music and video to the Zune (I own 4 Ipods and you can use 3rd party software even w/them - though it never seems to work well w/it - ZUNE would be PERFECT!!!) Not the best personal review but just a few issues I have .

<Title>Better than I thought it would be
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been an ipod owner for many years. I always had a good experience with them, but when it was time to get a new player none of their offerings really matched what I was looking for. Yes, the itouch is beautiful, but 16gb for that price ... not gonna do it.  When I saw the second generation Zune was coming out, I checked out the specifications and decided it was time to "switch".  What I like: 1. Solid engineering; it is heavier than an ipod and a little bit bigger, but I kind of like the weight of it. I even feel cool having it because it isn't the same mp3 player I see everyone else has -- that is pretty superficial though.  2. The touch wheel is actually a nice interface. This works great even though you do have to adjust to it a little. Navigating through menus is easy and they pretty much nailed it.  3. The menu system looks and works great ... makes some other devices appear "dumb". I hate to say it is hip, but yeah it is.  4. FM Radio ... granted I am a sirius user, but I was surprised how great this feature works. I am sure I will get a little use out of that. My gym has TVs that run sound on radio frequencies, and I was never able to listen to them with my ipod.  5. It has a nice sized screen. This was a good middle ground between the itouch and the ipod classic for me. When I thought about the features of the itouch that I would actually get the most out of it was the screen. This screen seems to have a good quality and you will see my negative comments of it below.  6. Good price for the features.  7. Good sound quality and a decent pair of included ear buds. I have owned a lot of ear buds including some higher end models like shure e2s. I think they supplied a pretty good pair. Beyond just the ear buds I think I can tell the difference compared to my ipod, but that might just be a new user euphoria experience.  8. Can customize the background -- adds that personal touch.  9. Wireless syncing.  What I don't like: 1. Video quality is not bad, but it could be better. If the resolution was higher I think this would be a 5 out of 5, but it really shouldn't be a deal breaker; it still looks pretty good.  2. The zune desktop software isn't shabby at all, but it does take a little getting used to. I have noticed a few things that are lacking or not working great. This is one of those areas where, hopefully, we won't suffer for long if releases are distrubuted periodically.  3. I wish the wireless syncing was faster and there were more options of when to do it. My network is setup in a way that causes a couple of trips between systems, so I probably am adding some latency. It is a cool feature to add one song, podcast or even an album, but I would like some more automation added.     I have only had it for 2 days now, but I am really glad I decided to get this compared to the ipod classic and the itouch. Both of those players have their good points, but the Zune seems to really fit with what I want and need.  Great player - it is a good buy - I am very happy with this purchase. I would give it 5 out of 5 stars if it only had a couple of slight improvements. As another reviewer said - 4.5 stars if it was possible.

<Title>Good player but disappointing desktop software
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune 80 may be an excellent player, but you are forced to use it with the Zune desktop software. Unfortunately, this software, while user friendly, is a huge disappointment.   In this review, I will be comparing the Zune desktop software to the Ipod desktop software (Itunes) which, as far as I'm concerned, is still far superior :   Downsides :  * First of all, on Zune contrary to Itunes, there's no real song rating system (i.e. 1 to 5 stars). Instead, there's a "like it or not" system. That's not very useful when you want to create smart playlists.  * Speaking of smart playlists, there's no way to create one on the Zune software. You have to manually put the songs you want in your playlist, which is a pain compare to what I'm used to with Itunes. On Itunes, you can create smart playlists based on music genre, years, song rating, duration of the songs, etc. You are out of luck if you want to do the same with the Zune.  * Also, with the Zune software, editing a song information - particularly  adding an album cover - is an awkward process and editing multiple songs at the same time is simply impossible. The easiest way I've found to edit songs is to get into windows explorer and work from there.   * There's very few ways to filter your songs, albums and artists in Zune compare to Itunes. There's like 3 or 4 different filters in Zune, including alphabetically, compare to something like 30 on Itunes. (Edit : Ok, I just found like 15 hidden filters in Zune, so its not nearly as bad as I first thought)  * Finally, when you are playing a song on the "now playing" interface, you can't easily access the song information, let alone edit it.   Upsides :  * Nice layout, beautifully designed.  * User friendly  * Excellent sound quality.  * Can Sync with Windows Media Player  * Wireless Synching with the Zune player  * Wireless Synching with Xbox 360  For me, one word describes very well the whole Zune software experience: inconvenient. It's unfortunate because I really wanted to like it. The good news is that, contrary to the hardware, the software can be improved with upcoming patches.  Despite the flawed zune desktop software, I think the Zune player is still a very good choice. With good sound quality, premium earbuds, large display, nice interface and plenty of features you won't find on other players - like fm tuner and wireless abilities - the zune 80 is a great value and is hard to ignore.

<Title>Enjoying it more than I was expecting
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been quietly waiting for Zune to support WMA lossless playback. Just when I had given up hope, out comes the Zune 2. I am using it with Vista, and haven't had any trouble yet adding the software or getting the Zune to run. Even the wireless sync worked without complaint. I am impressed that after playing it for about a day I haven't heard a skip  even when it's churning through WMA lossless files that sustain 700-800 kBps. I suspect that with constant playback I will end up getting about 5-6 hours doing that, which is not bad.

<Title>Zune 80 GB possible iPod killer? Almost.
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The new Zune 80 is either hated or loved. I've read reviews mentioning it to be the iPod killer. While I think it comes close to contending with the audio player currently holding the largest market share, it misses out on a few points.  The headphones that are packaged, are great if you're used to those garbage headphones packaged with other players. However if you have quality buds/cans or what not, I would suggest sticking with those.  Let's look at the dimensions. The Zune, by dimension is rather small by comparison to it's now older (and lower capacity) brother the Zune 30. It's 2.4" wide, 4.25" high and 0.5" thick. Around 25% smaller than the original, it also sports a much larger 3.2 inch screen made of glass. That's something I found interesting. As far as I know, most players have plastic screens. The added durability and clarity of the glass screen is very nice.  Enough of the dimensions though, I'm certain that software questions are prevalent somewhere. The Zune software, which is NOT packaged with the snazzy box that the Zune 80 comes in, is downloaded from the Zune's website. It looks pretty, but I can't honestly say I enjoy using it. Yes, you can sort audio by Artist, Date and Genre, it also requires association with mp3s. As in, you MUST use it for mp3 audio playback to use the software. That gripe aside, the software is fairly simple to use, syncs well and while I had some problems on my laptop, I had no issues on my desktop, or several of my friends. (I was fortunate in that they allowed me to test my Zune and software with several different brands. My laptop is the only one that experienced any issues). While the software left me wishing it worked on my laptop, the Zune's GUI is very nice.   A bit simple, with large text, but still very nice. Scrolling using the touch pad was complemented on the GUI with a large version of the letter appearing as you scroll fast. Tapping the pad stops it, while pushing down on the pad select the song/album/playlist, etc. (More on the touch pad in a moment)While the screen shows a giant version of the current track's album art, and you can select a background image of your own there is one gripe. Where did the EQ go? Microsoft, please rectify this. I am not a hardcore audiphile, and my headphones work great (Ultimate Ears Super.Fi 3 Live) with the Zune, I do like the option of selecting my own EQ settings.  The wireless, which is used to sync with your computer if you wanted to, works great and the setup (going back to the software for just a moment) was simple. Unfortunately, if you leave it on and forget to turn it off, it will eat up your battery life like a hungry elephant. Just remember to turn it off, and the battery life is great.  Back to the touch pad. I feel this is the most innovative part of the player. It is not simply a touch pad, but tactile controls as well. Called a squircle, I had my reservations but it works amazingly well. The scrolling is great with the touch pad, and the faster you move your finger on it the fast it scrolls through the songs. Alternatively you could hold down the touch pad, which would also allow scrolling. The touch controls can even be turned off for those who prefer tactile controls, a definite plus for people like me who only used audio players without touch controls, although as I stated the touch pad is very nice, responsive but not TOO sensitive.  Of course, the audio is the most important part, and the audio quality is good on the Zune. Podcast playback works great in both audio and video capacities. The video, with that very large screen looks great, and after going through several different videos of varied genres look amazing. The Zune natively supports H.264 and mp4 video playback, just in case anyone's wondering.  As you can tell, the Zune has a great feature set, making it a great player. While the Zune can compete with the iPod and even possibly give it a run for its money, I think it would put it far beyond by making some additions with firmware updates, such as EQ. Other than that, it's a solid player that I think many people will enjoy owning. Keep it up Microsoft, and you may even get some of that market share back.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having had the original Nano(4gb) all filled up, it was time to upgrade.  I went to Walmart and BestBuy to get it, and neither had it, so I ended up going to Circut City.  The interface is gorgeous, and it was easy to switch  my songs from iTunes to zune..just click select all and drag them!  Definitely better than the iPod Classic.

<Title>LOVE IT!
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It was crazy hard to get my hands on one of these, but luckily Circuit City still had one available for a local pick up. I've been using it for almost 3 days now and I can say that it is far, far better than my 60gb video ipod.   It has everything I ever wanted and then some- great big display (although the video could be a bit brighter), great interface, light & sleek, no annoying DRM, customized background with a backlight dimmer (so you won't go blind in the middle of the night when trying to change an album), and a nice radio (lots of kudos here!).     One of the most interesting features is the wireless sync which is extremely useful if you have news podcasts since it will automatically download it in the morning without hooking it up into the computer. It's also extremely easy to set it up.  I have a Netgear router and it took me literally 3 mins to make it work.   I've waited a long time for an mp3 player like this and it was worth it! Beware though- this is a very different device than the new ipod touch. It targets a different kind of consumer so make sure that you know exactly what you want/don't want before making a decision.   _____________________________________ **UPDATE** Jan 30 2008   I wanted to write an update on my 2 month Zune experience.  I still think it's an excellent product, BUT the software that comes with it takes a lot from my 5 star review. If I could, I would give it 3 stars right now since I'm going nuts over it.  Microsoft should really be ashamed of putting such piece of garbage software out! Yes, they rolled out an update recently, but it still sucks. And yes, it looks pretty, but after you're past the point of 'look, a transparent pic of Michael Buble,' you end up biting your nails and cursing the world since ID tags are so screwed up AND there is no easy way to make them right.   Customer service is in India and they are just beyond useless. Msoft should fire 70% of them and use that money to actually SOLVE the problems  that the software has. Right now the only help you can get is from a couple of Zune forums where users help each other. Horrible, just horrible!  Also, what I find annoying is that I really have to be careful to press the button right in the middle. It is so sensitive that a lot of times instead confirming the selection it will go either right/left/down/up. I also get tired of having to click so many 'play' selections before actually playing a song from an album. It would be really nice if there would be an option to see all the songs from one artist at once instead of going from album to album.  You should also know that you can't make your own playlists from the Zune. The only playlist you can make is the one 'quick list' which kind is the generic Zune playlist. You also can't delete individual songs from it- it's all or nothing. I'm REALLY hoping that the next firmware update will solve this because it really really sucks.      External hard drive capability would be nice too, but I don't really care that much about it.

<Content>I love this player. You can connect directly from the player to your TV or through your Xbox 360. It is so easy to use. The software is creating some problems for the power users but I don't think most people will notice a problem. I also believe they will come out with some updates within the next couple of weeks to solve these problems. Everything else works very well. I really think that this is going to be the player to beat.

<Content>I bought the zune awhile ago (80GB) and i was shocked, before i buy the zune i heard some good reviews and some OK reviews, it's amazing how a touch of your own hand makes all the difference.  this device IMO is almost all pro's, it's screen is as beautiful as it could ever be (big screen) i love this device so much although there is one down side as i see it, you can not use the device as an external hard drive, so you cannot put any type of files on the device to move them to another PC, otherwise i have no negative stuff to say about the device.

<Title>Durable, High Quality, and Great Sound!
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune 80gb aka the Zune 2. I could gab for days about the features and specs, but the majority of die hard junkies have already doen their facts prior to its November release.  I got the Zune in November. The sound quality is top notch, so good that an Equalizer isn't even included! The headphones make for a dynamic listening experience as they are modified directly in our ear headphones, as appose to the the standard junk ear bud headphones. If you don't hear a sound difference you obviously don't have them in right. The Zune supports high bit rates but no FLAC (Free Audio Loseless Codec). Which really isn't a concern who'd want that much memory to be tossed away?  The Zune features not so much a revolutionary panel as the iPods click wheel, but a safe alternative. The squircle, this little addition enables touch sensitive option on the button below the screen or standard press.  The software is very subjective some adore the looks, and others mutilated by the mp3 file naming issues. Keep in mind many sources online and programs can fix this. The problem is Zune brings files back to their original state, meaning if you have a song that was originally not tagged properly, welcome it back.    I lost my Zune yesterday, being extremely paranoid over my loss I hunted it down, I've truly grown partial to it. I located it outside in the snow this after noon. It was covered in thick layers of ice and even after thawing processes finished it worked fully functional! The screen is an amazing screen at that, large holds great potential for videos and pictures and is nearly indestructible. Little feats like wi-fi aren't so great but are welcomed. I Highly reccamend the Zune 80gb for the price, quality, options, art and music enthusiast, consistent stability in high use, and storage size.    Being a Apple iPod fan for numerous years, I decided not to convert I'm not biased i just want my music (don't we all?), but to enable an broader  opening. My iPod was dubbed unrepairable, so after losing 7,500 songs and going onto my third iPod i simply wanted something more durable. iPods are still great try out the Zune or iPod if you'd like a great MP3 player, just remember the choice is yours not just our reviews.

<Title>Get over it!
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First let me say, I have no problem with my Zune, I had an 30 Gb version and upgraded to 80 Gb I have song that wern't bought from the marketplace and they all play.  I have absolutely no problems with the software, the first version did suck because you had to resync completely if you wanted to add like one song.  Also if you wanted to remove one song you had to go through a song and dance.  With the upgrade you can access your Zune like a HDD, just click on device and search thru the songs until you find the one you want to cull, them BAM! its gone.  As far as using it for storage of documents... WHO CARES!  You bought an MP3 player not a portable HDD!  If you want a back up of important docs spend 10 bucks and get a 256 stick and keep it around the house.  I read a review that said the screen was small and blurry, this thing has one of the largest screen on the market!  I admit that some of the other players have some cool features but the Zune is not as bad as people make it seem.  As far as playback onto your PC, why would you get a portable MP3 player, sync it with your pc, then delete the songs off and just play it thru the player?  You can just unplug the speakers and plug them into the headphone jack and there your go problem solved.

<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great player and in some ways it's better than the iPod. In fact, since iTunes sucks and Apple doesn't care, I'll probably never buy any player but the Zune in the future.   However, what I really don't get is why Amazon only has the 80 gb Zune from some company charging $150 over the prevailing price for this item. These Marketplace companies are getting worse all the time. I think I'll just start looking elsewhere for the best deals. Amazon's getting real lame, real fast.

<Title>Best I've seen so far!
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I was always an I pod person.  I had a first generation I pod and a the 5th generation video one so naturally when my mom bought the 80GB Zune I laughed at her.  Well it ended up not working well for her audio books that she likes to listen to so she gave it to me.  In truth I never really used my I pods.  Over the few years I had them all of my music got deleted off of I tunes 3 times so I got sick of trying to rebuild my collection so I just started listening to the radio and cd's.  With my Zune even if the music gets deleted off of my computer it wont get deleted off of my device.  That is such a help!  Really the only thing I don't like about it is that there are so few accessories created for it, everything out there is for I pods.  Overall the sound quality is great, it holds a ton of music, I love the radio feature, and best of all my music wont get deleted!  It's a great alternative to I pods.

<Title>Ipod killer
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The best bang for your buck.  Yeah the Ipod touch is cool but this bad boy is 80gb for only $250.  My favorite thing about it is watching movies.  I downloaded a program to convert my DVD's so they will play on the Zune.  This is awesome for when I am traveling on long bus rides.  I have about 500 songs on there right now and have 6 full length movies on there as well and I still have 70gb left.  If you are looking for a good program for converting DVD's to play on the Zune, use Cucusoft Ultimate DVD Converter it works great.  So if you are looking for a great MP3 player that you will hold a lot of songs and video's get the Zune 80gb.  I would also recommend getting a protective shield on it so it doesn't get scratched.  I ordered one from Invisible Shield.com and it was $25 for a full body shield.  The shield is guaranteed and if your Zune gets scrated with it on they will pay for a new Zune, pretty sweet deal.  Go out and by a Zune 80gb you won't be disapointed.

<Content>Everything went smoothly until I started syncing my library, and then it hung after only a few songs were loaded.  I tried everything listed in the error log, and things only got worse.  Customer support is what we've come to expect from Microsoft--which is to say--none at all.  After messing around with it for 2 hours trying to get some music on it, I give up.  I'm not a systems engineer and I shouldn't have to be to get a stupid MP3 player to sync up with my music library.  Microsoft should just stick to the other things they do badly.
