<Title>Fantastic Music Player
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great Music player.  I have had mine for two months, and I must tell you that this device is small, very thin (candy bar thin) and has a lot of memory space.  I put the micro memory 2gig chip in, and have 6 gig device.   Very roomy.    Lets face it, you can't beat the price.  As far as being rugged, I have dropped it several times, and have had no issues with it.  I think it is worth every penny.  Some techical notes:  In Windows Media Player, this music player will sync automatically.  What is reallly cool, you just drag and drop the songs you want into the sync window in WMP and click SYNC.  Easy.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE CRAPPY SOFTWARE!!  Have fun

<Title>Great little player

<Content>This is my first mp3 player and I love it.  The sound is very clear and the storage space is more than ample for the money.  If you only want this for music it can store nearly 1000 songs!  I'm not even sure I know that many!  I enjoy the fact that it charges from any pc via USB.  I read a review saying that the songs are only played in alphabetical order.  Not true.  All you have to do is push the menu button, cycle to the music library icon and select it, push "right" on the wheel, cycle to the artist name, push "down" on the wheel, cycle to the album you would like to listen to and push play.  That's all you have to do.  I would definitely recommend this product.

<Content>It was awesome to watch videos and stuff, the headphones that came with it sucked, syncing was easy with Windows Media Player, had great battery life, but the screen was too exposed and the scrolling wheel was a pain. I used it until the screen on it cracked and I got a Zune 30 GB

<Content>I bought my insignia 4 gb last year and I am pleased with its overall performance. I like how the controls aren't membrane based and I can feel a positive mechanical reaction when I'm selecting functions and songs on the device. The screen quality is pretty good for the videos loaded on it (faves are The Pink Spiders' "Little Razorblade" and Platinum Weird's "Will You Be Around?") However, I use it for the audio music. The songs transfer over just fine via the Windows Media Player (don't bother with the Rhapsody software if you don't have to). As for protecting the screen, I just use the clear vinyl skin that came with it. Plus, if I want to take it with me on a walk or something, I just use a cell phone holster I got at the mall for $9. I am an avid audiophile and need my tunes on a regular basis. The only thing I can't figure out is how to make the custom playlists. I tried it with the Rhapsody software, but it kept screwing up the order. Other than the gripe about the software, the device itself is a sturdy, well executed player.

<Title>THE most durable little piece of electronica I've ever owned
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok, so I've dropped my Nintendo DS (original) like a hundred times, and the darn thing's like a rock. Same thing with my Olympus Stylus. Even my laptop.  But NONE of them have ever survived a trip through the laundry.  My dh is often rather careless with things, and tends to forget to empty his pockets before washing his clothes. And one day, he forgot to empty my brand-spanking-new Insignia mp3 player out of his khakis. Sure enough that means it went through the full washing experience--hot water, detergent, and extreme heat and fumes from the dryer. That evening as I emptied out the dryer, I found my poor little mp3 player. At first I couldnt find the backing or the battery. But I was SOOO upset. The next morning, out of some inexplicable childish hope, I returned to the drier to search for the battery. I found it and the backing. Thinking that it wouldn't hurt to try, I went ahead and popped in the battery. I held my breath, hit the power button--  And nearly crapped a brick.  IT WORKED! Water, detergent, heat, fumes, and IT STILL WORKED!!! Not even a cracked screen! The ONLY thing that happened was one song got deleted. One.  So. Yeah. I love my little insignia.
