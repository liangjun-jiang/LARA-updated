<Title>Very Nice Player
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think this is a very nice MP3 player.  I received it for Christmas, yet I know how much it was purchased for.  It is a very good player for the price.  I like the radio feature on it...you can tune into local radio stations and it will even scan and save the stations for you.  The only thing I don't like about it is that unlike the IPod, you can't view the songs by title or artist or genre.  You just have to scroll through them one by one.  Other than that I am very happy with it and would definately recommend it to anyone, especially for this price.

<Title>Good Trainer MP3
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got this for my little brother who is 11 it's a good step up from his portable CD player but a lot less exspensive than an Ipod. The software and controles are pretty basic and I had him ripping and listining to music in about an hour. If your looking for a good middle man for kids that want somthing high tech but are to young to really take care of somthing super exspensive than this is a good choice.

<Title>Zen is good product, good price
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the second Zen we have purchased.  Obviously, it would not have been purchased if we hadn't liked the first one.  This was not purchased to replace a Zen, but was purchased as a second unit for another family member. Learning how to use the screen to rip/convert the audio files presented a slight "learning curve" (via some trial/error), but it's no different from any new application.  Besides, it couldn't be much worse than Microsoft product changes (to learn). Still, the zen would have scored a 5, for my purposes, if the documenation would have been better, with some examples provided.  After all, time is a precious commodity for most of us. Thanks.

<Title>Where's the bass?
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THE SOUND COMING FROM THIS LITTLE BLUE BOX. ALL HIGHS AND MID RANGE BUT NOT MUCH BASS AT ALL. EVEN WHILE WEARING MY $70. SENNHEISER NOISE REDUCTION HEADPHONES. BUT I WILL SAY I LIKE THE EASE OF OPERATION. ALSO WHY DOES THE LCD DISPLAY ONLY NAMES THE SONGS THAT'S PLAYING AND NOT THE ARTISTS? THIS IS MY 2ND MP3 PLAYER. IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE BUYING A THIRD ONE SOON.

<Title>Very handy and easy to use digital MP3 player.
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was one of the two players I purchased (The other being a Samsung YP-MT6X, also 512mb). I like both, and they were easy to set up immediately right out of the box.  This particular player is slightly slimmer, and uses a AAA battery, making it a very compact player. Easy to forget in your pocket. Not a bad trait at all. I haven't used the voice recorder, but I suppose it could be nifty in a moment if you had to remember a phone number or address or something of that nature, taking quick notes.  Things I liked.. Good Audio Quality Replaceable (AAA) Batteries Backlit Display Compact Reliable  Even though it's missing the radio tuner of my other MP3 player, I give it 5 stars anyway. It's a wonderful entertainment device. I hardly listen to the radio with such a small player, otherwise it might affect the rating.  For those of you who want a radio tuner, look for another device. Otherwise, it's economical, well-featured, and reliable for what it's designed to do...play digital audio files. The average listener doesn't need 5 gigabytes of storage, generally. If you just want to listen to some tunes on your break from work, this is definately something for you to look into. I recommend it highly.

<Content>I like the small size and removable batteries so you don't have put the device on a charger and you can change batteries on the fly. The only bad point is the fragile hook on the battery door and needs a special cord to download new songs. For the price it is great. I use mine while jogging
