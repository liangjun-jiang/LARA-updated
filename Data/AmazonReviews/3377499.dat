<Content>Great product.. bring a remote control, arm strap, easy to used, Nice usefully menu and software, it can turn of by it self, cheap comparing with an apple shuffle, i find the battery only take 8 hours playing it`s a less time for me :), but itsn`t a problem, I DON`t like the FM radio it`s poor you need to stay in a place to find a great fm station, but that it`s in my country, i don`t know if works better in your country. that`s the only i don`t like, everything it`s great...

<Title>Cool idea, but hard to use

<Content>The Swissbeat is a clever idea, combining a few useful tools with data storage and MP3 capability. The ability to separate the player from the tool holder is great for travel. However, the menus and single-button control are frustrating to say the least, especially for programming the FM radio. The FM is mono only, I've never been able to receive in stereo, even when signal strength is optimum.
