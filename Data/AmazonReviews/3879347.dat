<Title>The Best iRiver
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I made my purchase, I can only find the player in amazon markplace, ebay or warehouse123. Since warehouse123 provides 1 year warranty for my S10. I ordered from them and it took only 2 days to receive my player.   Packing: I enjoyed the packaging. It's a square main box with angled corner. Two more small boxes are inside. The S10 is put inside one box and the rest of the accessories are put inside the other. The packing did wow me as Apple's packaging does. iRiver included some plastic molds to hold the player to make it seem more professional. It's an incredible unboxing experience.   Design: The S10 is one of the most beautifully designed MP3 players I have ever seen. For the interfaces of most mp3 players, there are a few small buttons for navigation. The iRiver D-Click allow me to navigate the interface by pressing the four sides of the display itself. The button-less screen creates a very clean and sleek. Since there are no buttons to press, navigation is done through pressing the sides of the screen. Around the edges of the iRiver S10, you'll find the remainder of the controls. The S10 is actually very usable with one hand. It's simple and easy to control the player.  Sound:  It has excellent audio playback and recording quality. The stock headphones are not good enough. I wish iRiver could improve the quality of the headphones. I'm using the Audio Technica Ath-CK7 which helps me get the best out of the player. Sound quality is very good as is normal with iRiver players. It produces crystal clear sound as well as smooth and powerful bass.   Transferring music & Battery Life: I would prefer drag-and-drop over iRiver plus 3. I can simply drag and drop my music into the music folder. Since the player is 2GB only, I don't think it needs any music management program. I love the USB portion of the device. I can just plug my device into any USB port in a computer makes up for the 8 hours battery life and it only takes a few minutes to recharge your MP3 player.  My only complain: iRiver doesn't sell the S10 in Blue color. The sound is great. The player is packed with useful options; FM radio, voice recorder, many EQ presets and custom EQ settings. I find the navigation intuitive and easy to use. The cost is very good for what I get. I'm very pleased with my purchase.   P.S. I need to say thank you to Jenn in pocketables who provides a very detail review for the iRiver S10. I read her review before I purchased my S10. Highly recommend to read her review.

<Title>Best small player around
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's smaller than Shuffle, has a great looking screen, tons of features(FM, record,picture viewer,EQ etc), great no-look navigation with D-pad, and 2Gig is plenty to exercise with. It's so light that the earphones cord weighs more than the player. Sound quality is excellent.

<Content>The iRiver s10 sounds terrific even with my Etymotics! the screen is better than it appears in the pictures and the controls are very easy to use and intuitive. I've had it for about a month and can't imagine anything better.

<Title>Great!
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Although I buy lots of items from amazon.com, I never feel the need to write reviews. However, this product is so good and there are so few reviews for it that I feel I must add one.  Cons:  1. The screen-keys are too soft. You always press keys accidentally when its in your pocket. 2. The screen saver activates too quickly.  3. It is too small. I am afraid of losing my mp3 player, so I use bigger earphones just in case ;) 4. No case for the device is provided, so you must be careful with dirt + scratches.  These are minor issues, really.  Pros: Basically, in every other aspect, this device is the best. The navigation was so easy that it took literally seconds to figure everything out, without reading the manual. Even I was surprised with myself :) Sound quality is excellent, and the price is reasonable. Really worth the money.

<Title>Too Expensive to be Disposable
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Good:  Great design.  Even smaller than the really small I imagined both in size and weight.  Clix interface works great.  Five stars for design.  The Bad:  Battery life is more like 4-5 hours, even with energy-using options turned way down.  Using any less energy than my settings would make the screen completely superfluous.  Died after one month.  Awaiting RMA return.  One star for the all-critical ability to actually use it.  Conclusion:  Nifty design, poor reliability or too expensive depending on how you look at it.  If these cost around $5.00 each you could stock up on, say, a dozen at a time, keep a few of them charged at all times, and give them the toss as they died.

<Title>Nice Device
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This small MP3 player is excellent for the double O SEVEN in us who love small highly functional gadgets. Small sleek and an all around beauty this MP3 player will surely accompany you with music, photos and the radio for your entertainment. Or take a glance at the screen just to check the time or set the alarm.   Although one of the pluses of this MP3 player is size it is also a disadvantage. It can be lost of overlooked in the blink of an eye. It's so small you can probably lose it in your pocket.  If you can handle the pressure of keeping an eye out for this device at all times or putting it in a place where you can find it again then I would recommend this little doohickey. However if your day is busy and when you come home you just want to kick back and fall out then this device isn't for you.

<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the iRiver S10 2GB player as a Christmas present for my wife: executive summary, she loves it! While searching for which player to buy, my most important recquirement was that it would play ogg files, since I use linux at home, and I record my CDs to my hard drive in that format.  Secondly, that it didn't *need* Windows to be able to use it, and last but not least, that it was "cute" and sleekly designed. The S10 fit all characteristics, and for a very fair price. The only gripe I have about it, is that it is not properly recognized as a usb storage device (in linux) every other time I plug it in.  But this is something I'm currently working on, so it really isn't that bad.  I guess I'll eventually get to a software (on linux) or firmware (iRiver) upgrade that will fix this.

<Title>All around great player, beats the iPod Shuffle hands down
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned this now for almost a year.  Its not distributed in the US (at least not very widely).  The interface is intuitive and the display is vibrant.  Its tiny and light enough to not really need a case of any kind but an armband would be nice if it existed.  Supposedly iRiver is coming out with a wrist band style one but who knows.  The headphones that come with it aren't great, but do have a very handy holder that clips securely to the player.  I can go running with this easily by turning it around so the player is behind me.  The FM tuner is surprisingly good and lets me listen to TVs at the gym if I get bored with music.  A big pro for me is that it shows up as a simple mass storage device when you plug it into your computer.  Then you simply drag files to it.  Works like a charm in windows, linux, and mac.  No silly software or DRM requirements.  You can optionally use the iRiver Plus software to manage it, but it is not necessary.  Double bonus is that its also a 2G memory stick!  A few technical notes; Be sure to upgrade to the latest firmware to get access to better volume, battery life, and playback options.  Cruise the internet a bit and you can find software that will let you put custom backgrounds and interfaces on it (very cool stuff).  It will also enable you to use any of your existing playlists automatically.  Search for iRiver H3mod to find it.  Probably the best part of this player is letting people play with it.  Everyone is fascinated by this little guy.  Its a quality device with better features than the competing iPod Shuffle and an excellent display.
