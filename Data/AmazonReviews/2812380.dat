<Title>SONY LIKES SONY
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you have time to mess around with the software that SONY provides with this player then buy it. It is small, sounds good and looks good. I bought one for my wife "Pink" and thought she would use it but she still uses my old cheap one because it is easy to use. There are links you can go to to download a file manager for this product but it lessens your amount of songs you can store

<Content>This Mp 3 player is great... no doubt about it. It easy to use and has a cool screen. Sounds better than any stereo I've heard before. A little over $100 is a bargain!.

<Date>Wed May 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this walkman, watched the tutorial on the softwear before I even opend the product and have had no promlems whatso ever, except i bought it to use at the gym and apparently sony thinks everyone is right handed, so the left ear bud has no cord at all! but i got diffrent ear phones and i love it, the sound qaulity is great, and while the software takes alittle while to load everything, it isnt all that bad. But can someone please tell me how to set my favorite stations to the preset on the radio? This is a great little product and alot cheaper then the i pod and i like it alot better, the ipoddosnt even have the radio!

<Title>Wonderful player!
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this MP3 player.  It looks great and the sound quality is excellent. I have had no problems using the software that came with the player.  It was easy to install and use, and if I can use it anyone can.  It takes about 5 minutes to import a complete cd onto my computer.  I don't feel that is an unreasonable amount of time. The battery on this thing is amazing.  It is easy to charge and lasts forever. I have never owned another MP3 player, so I can't compare it to any other players out there. The only complaint I have is that the earphones that come with it are very uncomfortable.  I would recommend this player to anyone.  It is awesome!

<Title>not usable due to SonicStage
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.  I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1.

<Title>Great buy if you need an MP3 player with FM Tuner
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Plan to spend a few hours with the manual when you get this one...but after that its easy to use and reliable. The selling  feature for me was the built in FM tuner...to listen to TV at the gym. For all its features - both on the player and the computer interface - its a good price for all you get.

<Title>Stylish, easy to use, efficient battery 
<Date>Sun Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Super fast shipping from Sony. I got mine for $79, I don't know why they raised the price. Anyway I've had mine for a few days now and I'm completely satisfied, didn't have to read the manual, for me it was as simple as any CD player or walkman.  However, like most other people I did have some issues with the SonicStage software not accepting some of your files, but I just figured that all you need to do is convert your files to .wav Instead of .mp3 before you add them.  Look: comes in lots of cool shades, I liked the design much better than the ipod.  Battery: this mp3 player is supposed to have some kind of technology that allows you to enjoy hours and hours of listening time before having to recharge, which still takes a few minutes. I left mine on accidentally all night yesterday, and woke up with it still running, with more than 3/4 full battery.  The only other con I would say are the very awkward headphones, the right piece is twice as long as the left, but you can always get replacements.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

<Title>never much good; now defunct
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The screen tells me "memory error."  No one at Sony Tech Help can tell me why. One "analyst" actually suggested that I plug it into a friend's computer and see if it works, since it no longer works on mine.  I've had an Ipod for two months and it works great. This Sony has never been much and now it doesn't work at all and no one knows why!  I'm actually amazed by the stupidity of the whole thing.

<Title>pretty good for something that isn't an ipod
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i asked my fiance for our first chirstmas if he could get me something that will hold all of my cds. well he didn't like ipod that much and bought me this one and himself a blue one so we matched. i like it alot, the battery last pretty long for me, its small and light. i got water some how on it and it didn't get ruined, also i have the 512mb and i have over 170 songs on it. the down fall is if i didn't use his computer it would delete all the songs i already downloaded so i now have to use my computer and borrow cds of friends to download not just pop it in and down load. but i like it its pretty good for not being an ipod.

<Title>Good Quality product, but may need getting used to
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I initially was hesitant of buying "a" sony MP3 player based on all the other reviews. I will have to say getting used to the SonicStage program can take time. Some mp3 files might prove problematic to play on it (a couple of my files did not play on it). But converting to the OMG format and using those files really is not that big of a deal. It will take a bit of time, but you really have to do it once. The sound quality (earphones + playback) is just great. Moreover it is just beautiful. I have to say the OLED display is wonderful, and going through playlists and the like is with no problem. Long story short, it is "different" from other mp3 players because of no drag and play, but in my humble opinion it is not a deal breaker.

<Title>Great little mp3 player......Highly recommended!!!
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is true to the description. The battery lasts like forever and it is so cute. Sonic Stage is real easy to use unlike what others are saying. The only thing I did not like was the extended headphones. It should not have an extender. The length should have been like that anyway. I end up losing the extender. So that sucked but other than that, I love my sony mp3 player.   Must Buy!!!!

<Title>Confused
<Date>Tue Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This mp3 player is very confusing. They don't put any instructions in the box either. You have to download them, and it's almost 100 pages long. Who has time to read all of that? I've had my mp3 player for over a month and i still haven't put any songs on it. Well I had like 3, but I hit a button (trying to skip to the next song)and it erased them all. So it's easy to erase your songs without knowing it. When I first downloaded the songs, I was trying to play the next song and i hit the button and it just repeated the same song over and over again. VERY CONFUSING!

<Title>100% satisfaction
<Date>Thu Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've purchesed this item little more than a week ago (mostly because it was cheap). I have to say it works great, and even though everyone said not to use the software it comes with, I gave it a try. I don't know why people don't like it, it's very simple and easy to use. I'm not a comp. wiz, and still I set up the whole thing in no time with my fav music-also with the 5 free downloads it comes with, too. So for this cheap, it's a great deal. The earpiece of course is useless, but I've got great ones also from sony, so didn't care. So thanx Etronic!   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008JFCVU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-3686616-6018308">Sony NW-E505 Network Walkman 512 MB Digital Music Player with FM Tuner Pink</a>

<Title>About time
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say I was a little leary when I read the reviews of how bad the software was for this product.  Then I read farther and found out that on the Sony site they have a link to put a better version of software on the player.  So, I bought the MP3 player and let me tell you.  The battery lasts forever.  I dloaded the software.  Moved the songs by dragging and dropping.  And my daughter has loved every minute of it.  Not one single problem.  All this plus a neat screen.  I cannot beat the price.  Oh, by the way, I hate Ipod anything.

<Title>Great for working out
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item over 6 months ago and it's perfect for the gym. I've dropped it on several occasions and a couple of times in the water fountain. It still works like a charm. I am very very hard on electrical equipment when I work out. The down side is that you have to really get your music from Sonic Stage, which isn't great. You have to down load music into it and then down load it to your player. Other devises you go from the cd right to your player. It takes a bit longer than necessary. The other problem is if you lose that clip devise that holds the player to your clothes while your work out, it can't be replaced. So don't loose it!  The positives are that it holds a charge for a long time. I work out 5 days a week, 2 hours a day. I have to charge it once every month...maybe.  It also has plenty of memory and it can hold a lot of music. It's well worth it. It's really better than a disc-man and it's not complicated to use.

<Title>NWE 505 a questionable package
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item to listen to FM radio or music while running.  The wire for the ear buds are incredibly short, and so I clipped the unit to the collar of my tee shirt.  Sweat got on the case and the thing quit working within 30 minutes.  This seemed like a fluke, since the device seems to be made for working out, so I returned it to Sony.  At first Sony refused to repair or replace the unit, and wanted to refund the purchase price.  I refused and they shipped another unit, which quit working in a similarly short period of time under similar circumstances.  At this point I gave up.  Visiting my local Radio Shack later for another reason, I found that an FM radio with a two gig MP3 player (the NWE 505 has 512M) was available for about $40, cheaper than the NWE 505, without waiting for delivery.  Works great, without the hassle of the Sony MP3 software.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player, I have to say it's been a good experience. With patience I figured out the program that came with it. (my biggest concern after reading reviews)The battery lasts forever and the sound is good, although I think I have noticed a skip or two lately, and the ear buds are painfull and short, get some new ones. I think this a good product for the price and does a good job.
