<Title>Fake mp3 player!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got mine (blue version of this) from Sonystyle.com just yesterday. After playing with it for a few hrs here are my impressions.   First and foremost the mp3 playback quality is atrocious. 128kbps files sound like 64kbps or lower. Even my no-brand-name cheap mp3/cd player has better mp3 quality.   I suspect the codec/DSP in the Sony are still designed for their propreitary ATRAC3 plus format with a secondary mp3 support. In fact converting a mp3 file to Atrac3plus (with included software) sounded better than just mp3 file. Inspite of this hassle, it was still below mp3 quality from other players.   The battery life seems to be in line with the specs listed by Sony. No complaints on that front. The backlight LCD display is a nice bonus too. The size/volume is significantly more than the iPod Shuffle.  The user interface is more loaded than such a small palyer can withstand. As a result it more cumbersome and confusing than Apple/iRiver players.  In short this awkwardly named "mp3" music player is a step in right direction for Sony but is still below average. Price is right but not the quality.

<Title>Cool and easy

<Content>After looking at Ipod shuffle, I opted for the PSYC at a few bucks less. It holds more songs if you use Sony's ATRAC system and has more navigation options than the Ipod. The sound quality is great even on the supplied earbuds. The software is easy to use, though the translations from Japanese can be strange in the instruction manuals. It runs on a single AAA battery for lots of hours, no worry about recharging. It also looks a lot neater than Ipod and not everyone is carring one, yet. Great LCD display. All in all a good buy.

<Title>Excellent little player better than Shuffle
<Date>Tue Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wanted to buy a small, flash-based music player primarily for jogging and taking to the gym, so naturally I compared the 2 premier products out right now, Sony PSYC vs. Ipod Shuffle. The PSYC comes out on top in SO many ways.  1) LCD screen a huge plus for navigating through albums and artists. Shuffle has no screen. 2) Tremendous amount of features for such a little player, such as shuffle, repeat, browse by artist or browse by song, sound equalizer...all intuitive to use. By contrast, the Shuffle practically forces you to play your songs on random. Looking for that favorite album? Good luck finding it with the shuffle. 3) ATRAC3Plus coding allows you to store MANY more songs in 512 MB compared to Apple's AAC. 64 kbs in ATRAC3Plus provides excellent sound quality, even through stock ear phones. 4) 1 AAA battery = 70 hours! That means no need to constantly have to plug the blasted Shuffle into your computer to recharge everyday.   Sony has made an excellent product here, not to mention one that is very asthetically pleasing. You want substance AND style, get the PSYC.

<Title>Excellent little player with some quirks
<Date>Thu May 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>How much you like Sony's new flash-memory Network Walkmans is going to depend on what you use them for. I use mine to load seven or eight CDs onto for jogging, walking, and for my car. If you have a large collection of MP3s and other formats you want to load on and off of it, you might find another player that suits your needs.  Ripping CDs to Sony's ATRAC3 format at fairly low bit-rates sounds pretty darn good for such a small player, not to mention that ATRAC is a gapless format, which is excellent for dj-mix CDs, live albums, and so on. MP3s, however, occasionally crop up with some weird digital artifacts that I've noticed. It doesn't ruin them by any means, it's just up to you as to how good you want your MP3s to sound. Like other reviewers have said, though, the sound (regardless of format) is a little muffled. However, Sony was smart enough to allow users to adjust bass and treble levels on the unit (and save two seperate presets!). Cranking the treble to max remedies the muffled sound to a large degree, creating a very bright sound, if not exactly a colorful one.   Besides saving your own sound adjustments, the unit also lets you browse tracks on the player by "groups" (albums, playlists, etc.), which is very handy. Playback features are numerous, and let you shuffle songs by group, or every song, plus a variety of repeat options. The display is even customizable. One minor issue is the tricky hold/group slider and the sunken menu buttons on the back, but for a player this size there's probably not too much they could do. The rocking-faceplate buttons, hoever, are a neat trick. As for Sony's SonicStage software, at least it's semi-intuitive; I've seen a lot worse (ahem, Rio).  My 20GB Karma ruined me for features a lot of other hard drive (let alone flash) players didn't give you. Surprisingly, my little Network Walkman can keep up, with gapless playback, customizable sound, and excellent battery life, not to mention how cool it looks. Any one who is looking for a fun, inexpensive way to carry around some of their favorite tracks would do well to pick one of these guys up.

<Title>The accompanying Sonic Music Stage kills this product
<Date>Sun Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes, it's small, yes the battery life is excellent and I have to admit that the sound is not bad. That's where it stops with this product. One of the tricky things is when you have to slide the side button in the particular play mode of your choice. The slider button is extremely difficult to adjust. Here's the worst of this product: the accompanying Sonic Music Stage, which is the proprietary program from which to buy and download songs. The program is ATROCIOUS. It's search engine is primitive; for instance: if you want to search for a certain artist, it will come up with a list of songs that may have the closest term to the name, no artist however. So the only way to go is by song title. It doesn't end there: EVERY time I have bought music in the past year I had to wrestle with their internal downloading system. It SAYS it is downloading to your hard drive, but it is only 'pretending' while you sit and wait for hours. When you go to the help site to find out why it was not downloading properly, it kicked me off and I had to log in again, However, the newly bought songs had dissapeared and I had no clue where to look for them, so I had to go to their history site and sift through all the songs I had bought in the past year. Problem: because there was no date of when any of these were downloaded. The program also AUTOMATICALLY groups your downloaded songs without any rhyme or reason, instead of filing them as singles and letting the user decide what to group. Don't buy this product unless you want to load up on frustration instead of downloading music, no matter how computer savy you are. My next MP3 will be a nano ipod, and definitely NOT a Sony product.
