<Title>NOT a Nano!

<Content>WARNING: This is not an Apple product. The seller used a picture of a Nano to make you think that's what you're getting, but it's a cheap knock-off. Don't waste your money.

<Content>The product is a knock off and of very poor quality. DO NOT BUY ONE!!! It looks like an IPOD but that is the only thing they have in common. Very very poor replica.

<Title>Cable4less are criminals

<Content>Cables4less is located in California and sells cheap imitations. Their address is 1725 Nogales St. #108-7, Rowland Heights CA 91748. They not only sell cheap junk at expensive prices, mine arrived with everything broken and it was not during shipping since the package was fine. They obviously re-packaged one that was returned to them. I don't know how they can operate in the USA legally. My credit card company was notified and I'll be sending this thing back. Totally worthless junk.
