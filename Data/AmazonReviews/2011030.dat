<Content>This mp3 player is excellent. it's very small though. almost like the ipod nano size. except it's not as wide as the nano (the new one i mean). Umm? Otherwise it's a very nice mp3 player to have. but it doesn't come with a mini sd card.

<Title>Good little player
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Got this for my wife. Surprised at the screen quality - very good. Amazing functionality for such a small device. Two small complaints, however. The round copper color dial is just for looks, so navigation is through the five buttons on the front - one in the middle and two on either side. Do-able, but not as easy as the "joypad" most are familiar with. Secondly, the earbuds are junk - don't judge the sound of this player by the tinny sound that comes out of those earbuds! Overall, very satisfied.

<Title>OK alternative to the Shuffle
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this as an alternative to the iPod shuffle, and as such I'm not disappointed.  It has double the storage for $10 less and has a screen so you can scroll through and choose a song. It also has things the Shuffle doesn't have: FM tuner (fine), voice recorder (long start-time, not recommended for capturing quick ideas), picture storage, video storage (windows format only), can display text files (screen is cellphone size, kind of small to be reading a book). Battery life has been pretty good.  Two main problems I've encountered:  1) It adds small files that have to be deleted one at a time or they interfere with playing (these are not visible in Finder when plugged into the computer, this might be a Mac issue)  2) The internal clock resets every time you turn it on (no CMOS battery compartment).  I'm not disappointed with it, but I'll probably still get a Nano if they have a price drop.

<Title>NO GREAT DEAL
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>By that price (68.44), was not a big business. The keys of navigation very small and very close together, and are not light, which hampers their operation in dark environment ------------ Por ese precio (68.44), no fue un gran negocio. Las teclas de navegacion muy pequeï¿½a y muy juntas, y no estan iluminada, lo que dificulta su operacion en ambiente oscuro
