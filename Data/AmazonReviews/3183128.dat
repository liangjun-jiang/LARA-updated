<Title>Love it
<Date>Wed Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love swimming, but used to get bored doing laps.  This waterproof mp3 has been a boon--time flies in the pool. Make sure to get the new updated ear plugs---you may have to call the company.  The old ear phones used to slip out easily.

<Title>Waterproof MP3 Player 1GB

<Content>I purchased this product because I cycle and kayak and wanted a mp3 player that would hold up under adverse conditions, which this product seems to do.  However, it has several major disadvantages. 1.  Can only charge the battery with a USB cable and computer, thus making it difficult to carry on weekend camping trips and recharging. 2. I have used 3 different laptops all fairly new with windows 2000 or XPpro, and all computers have problems recognizing the player when you plug in the USB cable. 3. There is no play list manager, so you have to scroll through all songs to find the ones you wnat, with a 1 gig memory that is a lot of looking for a song, on a screen you can barely see.

<Title>NOT Waterproof 
<Date>Tue Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used this for lap swimming and was very careful to close it exactly how they tell you to, but it only worked for about 2 weeks before water leaked in and the mp3 player wouldn't turn on anymore.  While it did work, I loved it, but for the money, I would have liked to use my new mp3 player for more than a few weeks.

<Title>Oregon Scientific MP3 needs help
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a Oregon Scientific 120 and a 121 model, both are lacking in headphone department. They won't stay in while swimming. I tried the Freestyle audio and their head phones get wet and stop working. The only MP3 player that works like it's suppose to is the product by "Swimman" where they waterproof a Ipod shuffle from the inside, pared with their waterproof headphones that are like using bose ear buds under water this unit is a dream and highly recommended!!!!

<Title>Update vrsion (MP121) is vastly superior
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Oregon Scientific's newer version (MP121)is light years ahead of the original(MP120). Here are the improvements over this model: I swim a 1/2 mile several times/week and found this to be flawless: great sound, new, improved earbuds with ear loops really stay in place (during active crawl stroke)... no water in ear (added benefit for people like me who are prone to swimmer's ear). Bigger, easy to read screen with a much more user friendly menu interface (don't have to scroll thru all your songs...you can search by artist). I would strongly advise going for the MP 121 (also on Amazon) and give up the extra 1/2 gig of storage on this model in exchange for a much superior product. The only reason I give the MP 120 2 stars is that it has worked trouble free for over a year(I had a problem when I first got it, Oregon Scientific replaced it promptly)
