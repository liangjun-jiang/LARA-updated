<Title>Poor design and construction
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The headphone jack started cutting out after a few months. One channel is now completely dead.  The screen is easily cracked (my fault, but nevertheless....) and the battery cover is loose and feels like it will fall off.  I would not purchase this or the larger capacity (2GB I think) built with the same design.  Junk - worthless now.

<Content>For the price the c240 is great. It does everything I wanted it to do. It is easy to load and erase music.The FM radio gets great reception. I do not like the in ear head phones. I bought a cheap set of over the ear head phones. I also think it would have been better to put the head phone jack on the  end away from the neck cord. The cables keep getting tangled up. But those are very minor things for the quality and the price.

<Title>Not satisfied whatsoever
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I did a lot of research beforehand, not only looking at different sansa's, but different mp3 players. I was especially looking for an mp3 player with a built in FM Tuner, so I could listen to a talk show at night and also listen to music when it was done (all while working out). First off, the FM Tuner is a piece of crap. Not only is its extremely inconsistent with its clarity, but majority of the time there is to much static to even bear listening to the radio at all. Second of all, countless mp3's i put on it were read as "bad tracks." (all of these mp3's work on my ipod, and aren't protected or anything either). Playlists on this thing aren't worth the hassle. Plus, the only case I could find for this thing cost $30 which is what I paid for the player itself!  Bottom line, look elsewhere for a mp3 player, especially if you are ever going to use the FM Tuner. Keep in mind, you get what you pay for, this thing WILL play music, but is cheap nonetheless. Be careful. I never thought of myself as an ipod advocate, but i would definitely pay the extra money for one of those (a thousand times more reliable, simpler, and manageable).

<Title>Great Product!
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son really wanted an I-Pod Nano, but it is expensive. So,I researched for other MP3 players and found this one to very comparable and 1/2 the price. After receiving it, it was extremely easy to download songs, and my 11 year old son can do it himself. My step-son, on the other hand, did get an I-Pod Nano, and has had problems with it from the beginning, and it took him awhile to figure out how to download. Comparing the two, for my son, there is plenty of room for all the music he wants and then some, there is an FM tuner which the I-Pod does not come with, it has a very nice look to it, and seems very durable. I highly reccomed this product.

<Title>Not as user friendly as anticipated
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because I had read several reviews stating that it was great for a person just beginning to use a mp3 player.  I have an ipod and this is harder to use than the ipod, my daughter is constantly asking me questions if you can believe that. I thought she was supposed to know more about these things than I was.  The screen sticks all the time causing us to have to pop the battery out so we can even get it to shut off.  Downloading music is a snap but if its not a cd you already own the music sights you have to use charge monthly fees on top of the songs.  Its ok but well not ok she doesn't hate it just finds it to be bothersome at times.

<Content>If you're looking for an affordable MP3 player that gets the job done, just buy this one already and end your search.  This thing does everything I want it to. It's easy to use so I don't know what anyone else is talking about. I figured every single feature out within about 10 minutes of owning it and haven't looked at the user manual at all.  The color screen is a little cheap looking, but who really cares. This thing does everything an MP3 player less than $100 should do, and more.

<Title>great buy
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Comparing the price of other mp3 players(including ipod)with the same option this is one of the best. It is super easy to put your music on it just by drag and drop or by using Window Media Player(which automatic sync to the player and it is self explanatory from there). ALl of the option work great and I haven't seen any problems with it. It is suprising quick at loading or deleting music. The button take a little of getting use to so remember to read the directions on the CD they gives you. It also have a very smooth and pretty finish so I would recommend a cover for it if you are like me who hate when your stuff get scratch.

<Title>Everything is mising !!!
<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered one from ANTonline through Amazon.com . The MP3 player arrived on time. When I open the hard plastic, I saw there's empty storage space. I check the item list from online user guide. I figured Earphones,  USB Cable, Lanyard and 1 lithium ion battery (a replacement battery??). I called SanDisk but they asked me to contact the online retailer. I called the online retailer and the lady asked me to send an E-mail to their tech support department and wait. Then she HANG UP MY CALL! That's very rude.  In general, I believe this is the SanDisk issue because those items were missing in the brand new, sealed hard plastic container. SanDisk is able and capable to prevent this issue. Now they just push the responsibilities to the customer and the online retailer.

<Content>Sandisk support is aweful. The volume button broke after 2 months. They asked me to send in pictures. Took forever to get an answer. Called the RMA support several times. I got it was closed twice 4 hours before the stated time it was suppose to close. Then when I did reach someone she didn't have the password to access the email. Then they "determined" that it had physical damage and wouldn't honor the warranty even though there is not so much as a scratch on it. I will never purchase Sandisk again.

<Title>Nice Player, Hard to read display
<Date>Thu Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Sansa player is fairly simple to use, compact, and easy on the battery.  So far, I've got 31 1-hour sermons on it, and I could get another 20 or so.  My only real complaint is that the display colors cannot be changed for more contrast.  It is very difficult to see what is being selected, and that's not a good thing when trying figure out what's next while practicing poor driving habits.  It recharges its battery while attached to the computer via USB.  A different charging mechanism would be nice, but that's nitpicking.

<Title>Great entry level MP3 player
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting in the shadows for a long time during the whole MP3 revolution.  First I thought I wanted an Ipod; they seemed cool and my step-brother has one that he likes.  They're really expensive though...  So, hmm...    My sister wanted a Creative Zen player because it could directly upload CDs from a CD player...  But there's not a whole lot of information available on those.    I still hadn't made my mind up until my mom and I went out shopping for Christmas and got one of these Sansa players for my step dad.  I looked at his and it seemed like a pretty good device.  After the new year I started using a certain music program that was compatible with Sansa and found a c240 on Ebay for $30.  I figured, that seemed like a heck of a deal and a good place to start my MP3 journey.  Mine came in the mail a couple weeks ago and I've really enjoyed using it.  It's really compact, like a little candy bar.  I have a laptop where I store my music and transfer to the player, so I have little complaints about charging via USB or difficulty of loading songs onto the c240.  Also, I'm just interested in music, so I don't know much about having photos on there.  The album covers that show up when you select a new artist aren't the clearest images, so I don't imagine photos would look terrific on it.  But like I said, that doesn't phase my judgement of the product.  The sound quality is very good, the storage is excellent for the price and I look forward to adding more SanDisk products to my MP3 player collection in the future!

<Title>Its not perfect
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I brought this recently for the cheap price but i thought it could've been a bit better. First the Pros  1. Amazingly small. Taking this with you working out is no problem 2. Simple enough to use. Music is separated by Genre, Artist  and Album automatically. At least it was for me when i uploaded music from Muiscmatch and Windows Media Player. 3. Microphone very sensitive. Thats a plus depending on the recording situation. Ie: class  Now the Cons: 1. No real playlist editor on the go. There is a Go function, that you can place music in. And that will act as a playlist, but you can't save it and make another list. The only way to make a list is to do it from your computer and download it to your player. Which is good enough, but making a playlist that includes music that is already on the player could cause problems. 2. Photoviewer is basically useless. Only useful if your looking at scenery. (but this isn't anything big) 3. No instructions included, other than whats on the box.   4. For expansion it uses MIRCO SD cards. No option for Compact Flash size or even Mini SD size cards. An option for using normal size SD cards could of work without increasing size much.    Overall it is under a $100. If your using to just keep your self entertain on the subway or during a workout, it will do the job.  If you was going on a long and wanted portable music, i recommend getting a larger size one of at least 4 gigs. If your using this mostly as a recorder for class or whatever 2 gigs with a few MICRO sd cards should work.       Still better than buying an Ipod in my book.

<Title>Poor Design of Charging Plug
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old son and within 3 days it was broken.  The charger and download plug port is poorly designed.  Instead of the plug interfacing with a stiff card with contacts, the plug needs to slip over free-standing pins the thickness of a human hair.  If you are off by a 10th of a millimeter, you will bend a pin.  If you bend a pin you can't download or charge.  Without the ability to charge, the unit is worthless.  The design and screen are nice, but it makes a pretty light paper weight after you bend a pin.  Stay away from this unit, until SanDisk redesigns the faulty plug.

<Content>the interface is easy to use (compare to iRiver).    sound quality is okay.    the only problem is the battery.    battery will be overcharged.     i let it charge on the PC USB (similar to charing cell phone) and went to a meeting.    when i came back, i smelled a wire burned.    i unplugged the mp3 from the PC but did not try it right away.    later that day, i played the mp3.   the mp3 ran about 2 mins and then went totally dead/broken.    the only good part is that it was the first day i received the mp3.    so, i returned it.

First if you have a file called my_song.mp3 it gives it a random numerical name on the song list so there is no way for you to find it from a list. Second it is not easy to use it like a flash drive to drag and drop music. It works ok on one of my computers but not on another one. I recall reading this is one of it's issues. BUt for the price I am not complaining..

<Content>I reviewed so many MP3 players online, I missed one big detail when I purchased...this is a very small player. This was for my 9 year old for Christmas. I overlooked the specs that tell the size of the player itself. Very small player. Nothing wrong with that, just didn't fit the MP3 case I already had for it. Oh well! Not many choices for cases, but I did find a pink one that she wanted. All is well, the player seems to work well. As usual, no problems with Amazon delivery, etc.!

<Content>I purchased the Sansa c240 from another site on a closeout sale for around $40. I was looking for a replacement for a crappy, 5 year old 512MB Gateway MP3 player I had been using. My main criteria were:  1) Cheap 2) At least 1GB  3) Rechargeable battery  #3 was really huge for me as my old MP3 player ate AAA batteries like crazy.  For my needs this player was perfect. If you're looking for a solid MP3 player and nothing more this device fits the bill. You can use it to display photos but the screen is so low res I would not recommend it. I use it when I mow the lawn and when I work out at the gym. I've read other reviews complaining about short battery life. I don't know if they just got a bad unit or what but mine seems great although I only use it about an hour at a time.
