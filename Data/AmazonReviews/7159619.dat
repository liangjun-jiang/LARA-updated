<Title>No Good - Randomly Stops Playing - Going Back
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Player stops playing songs randomly. No rhyme or reason, just stops. You have to hit play twice and the song starts where it left off. FM radio works very well, it's too bad it has bugs. I am returning mine and will try a different brand.

<Title>Creative Zen player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just an absolutely incredible product.  As a musician it is what I was looking for.  It plays with excellent fidelity, records from the internal mike with clarity, records faithfully from the line in jack. Has enough capacity to allow me to carry all the info and music I need to and from gigs.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone wanting a reasonably priced recorder/player.

<Title>Great Music Player; Not So Great Video Player
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compared to the competition in its price range, this a very good choice for a music player.  It's small and light, and the interface is intuitive and easy to set up and customize.  The OLED display is visible from any angle, but is dim in outdoor lighting.  The display is not very sharp, so this is really not a good player for photos and video.  However, the audio is way above average once you replace the included earbuds with something better.  It has lots of EQ settings and a good FM radio, and the included Creative MediaSource Organizer software makes loading of tracks and set-up of playlists quite easy.  I listen to a lot of podcasts and was disappointed with the included Zencast software, but found that if you turn on the MediaSource "media sniffing" function it will automatically find podcasts in my iTunes library (iTunes makes podcast subscriptions ever so easy) and they can be readily dragged and dropped into the Zen.  As noted in other reviews, USB charging from a computer does take a lot longer than it should, but if you have a USB wall charger it goes much faster.  I don't think I would buy another one of these, but overall I am fairly happy with it for music and podcasts.

<Title>Is there a real user manual for this thing?
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, this is my first mp3 player, so maybe they're all this user-unfriendly. If so, let me know. There is a serious lack of information available for the operation of this unit. The user manual does not supply it. So you're left to figure it out for yourself. First of all, I'm able to download stuff, (except for the five songs I bought on Itunes for 99 cents each), so I'm using it. But you must find out by trial and error how to use the thing. I'm used to devices picking up where you left off when you stop it. But if you don't save your place in a book or podcast, if you don't unpause the unit by the time you're time runs out and the unit shuts down, you have lost your place!! Why doesn't it pick up where you leave off automatically? Are ALL mp3 players like this? If you're interrupted and don't have the 20 seconds or so to save your place, in a bookmark, you're screwed.  Next, to get from menu to menu, you must push the proper buttons in the correct order, which you learn by trial and error, and must press them for the proper length of time (!) or you can also lose your place.   You must also NOT press certain buttons or you'll lose your place. For instance, if you are listening to a book, and happen to press BACK on the tiny joystick, it will exit playing and take you to a previous chapter or even the start of the book!  I'm sorry, but I'm used to cassette players and CD players and I've never had to be so careful in pressing a button on a player before. Are ALL mp3 players like this?  And there is no help from the user manual. None. Not even online.  You're on your own.   This is only the beginning. I have no idea how to make a playlist. And there is no information on how to do so. Not on the Creative site. If someone out there knows of where I can get this information, please let me know. The menu system is clumsy and unfriendly. Everything about the unit is clumsy and unfriendly.   I may buy an apple ipod if I find it is more user-friendly, and just use this unit for....   I have given it 2 stars because at least it works, but I'm not happy with it.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Labs Muvo2 and loved it.  Unfortunately, the hard drive fried after the warranty expired, and I was infuriated by CL's policy of charging for tech support calls.  I swore I would never buy another CL product.  I did a lot of research before buying a replacement and considered the iPod Nano and Zune.  Finally, with my Christmas money in hand, I went to Circuit City, ready to buy an iPod.  I asked the salesperson which mp3 player he had, and he told me he had the Zen V+.  I asked why, and he said that, for the money, it was the best player on the market, and includes a radio, video capability, photos and a huge capacity for storing music files.  He was so enthused that I figured I had nothing to lose.   I brought it home, set it up and was amazed at how intuitive the software was.  I loaded ten CDs in rapid order and downloaded all of my music.  Within two hours I was groovin' to my entire Taylor Hicks download collection (I'm a Hicks fan, what can I say!)  The FM tuner picks up my favorite R&B station, which doesn't always come in even on the best stereo.   I highly recommend this little player.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! unbelivably better than the ipod... but...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is an awesome mp3 player, except it has a few problems...  Pros: brilliant color screen makes it easy to see what you are doing, even if you are using it outside where there is a huge glare  I dont care what people say about the stupid thumb navigation being too small... its fine. if I made the mp3 player, I would have chosen a different mechanism to scroll and stuff... but there is no real problem with it  Look at the size of this thing!!!! its TINY!!! its AWESOME!!!    Cons: i have had it for 3 weeks and it has frozen 4 times. 3 out of the 4 times, I very simply resseted it and it was fine, not really a problem unless you don't have a small paperclip.   Here's the big con you have been waiting for: one of the times it froze, I reseted it and it turned on again and it looked fine, until it froze again. OH NO! I repeated the process of finding a small paperclip and reseted it. IT FROZE AGAIN WITHIN SECONDS OF ME TURNING IT ON!!!! i repeated this process many times, but it was no use. I emailed the creative labs support thingy and they gave me a simple solution. Here it is if this happens to you. reset it, and when you turn it on, it will go through the regular startup screens of the creative symbol, and saying Zen V Plus. When it says the creative symbol, hold down the play button and a "recovery menu" comes up run the "cleanup" and then "reboot". it worked for me, so it should work for you.  last couple of cons:  video is bad because of the small screen  line in encoding is hard to use  Thats all for now!

<Title>Here's the Major Problem.........
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software doesn't work, the computer doesn't recognize the unit... .these can all be fixed.  I have had my Zen since October, and like everyone else I initially fell in love with it.  I really loved the fact that I could download all my 2-year-olds music to make car trips so much easier!  I loved the size, the Outlook sync feature, and the FM tuner.  However, it does keep freezing up when you disconnect it from a power source.  And this time putting a tiny pin in the reset hole to hit the hidden button won't do anything.  It won't shut off, and it's frozen on the beginning screen- it won't go anywhere else, won't hook up with the computer, and repeated attempts to reset are not working.  It's very frustrating to not be able to access the reset button- one reason I think I will be moving over to the tried and true Ipod.  Creative really needs to work on this major design flaw!  Don't buy this unless you want to be really frustrated!

<Title>Very Nice Little Gadget
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my wife after owning the 30GB Creative Zen Vision:M for a year. I am a fan of  Creative products and the Zen V Plus is another great one. It is really a neat looking player with a very nice looking display that is crisp. The navigation is simple to use although the little joystick is a bit tricky to get use to. I highly recommend this product both on style & function. One other bonus is that your music can be encoded using .wma format which can reduce the files sizes significantly (about 40% or so) allowing you to fit more music on it. My only complaint is that, as is typical with all non-iPod players, the accessories for the Zen V Plus (and Vision:M) are very limited and the provided software takes some time to configure properly to sync with your computer.

<Content>I first saw the Zen V Plus in Glamour Magazine, and thought, "interesting, I wonder how it compares to the ipod". My brother got it for me this past Christmas, and now I don't go anywhere without it. I love the size and how idiot proof it is...i'm not very smart when it comes to gadgets, but even the downloading cds on to it is childs play. The only downside is, the first time i used it, it froze on me and I had to wait for the battery to die to get it to work. Other than that, its great. And it hasn't happened since. Buy this product! Its worth every penny you spend on it.

<Title>Definitely one of the best MP3 players out there
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen V Plus after browsing through what seemed like hundreds of MP3 players, either flash based or hard drive based. I read reviews everywhere too and finally decided on this product. After a month of using it, I have no complaints whatsoever - all my music, videos, and pics are easily transported onto my player, and the sound is GREAT! I would definitely suggest buying a new set of headphones though; the ones attached aren't that great and probably won't fit your ears.  The FM feature is great too! Of course the reception depends on where you live and where you're located. But generally it gets good reception - unless you're in a cave or something.  The screen is definitely nice, and the menus are really easy to navigate. You won't regret buying this product!

<Title>Terrible Documentation
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Physically attractive, with many interesting features, the Zen suffers from serious limitations.  Most significant, the documentation is grossly inadequate and fails to set forth how to utilize many of the most important features. For example, nowhere is it seen that in order to enable the resume feature when listening to an audio book, you have to shut down the unit. And nowhere does it indicate how to shut down the unit. Scrolling ahead and back is also a problem. If not done very carefully, the unit freezes and must be rebooted. The earphone  connection is poor, often requiring jiggling to restore sound in both ears. The Ipod is a far superior unit. The only advantage of the Zen is its ability to use items downloaded from the public library. The Zen is a major disappointment.

<Title>Great Buy for 1st MP3, Great for Books & Music & More
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love my Zen V Plus 4 GB.  I wanted a durable MP3 for work outs/travel and this little guy has lived up my wishes.  I wanted an MP3 that would work for audio books as well as great music. The bookmarking works well if you have a 12 hour recorded book with no chapter or time breaks.  Music is rich and clear.  The FM radio was an added bonus that I use more than I thought I would.  Small screen is clear and bright with amazing resolution.  Downloading my Microsoft Outlook contacts was a snap.  The firm ware has froze up a couple of times but a hard reset with a small straight pin has never lost any data.  Only negative would be the lack of ANY kind of user guide.  I spent more time surfing for a manual than I should have.  If you just play with unit most features are found quickly.  Hint: hold down the back arrow and several bookmarking, play modes and creating play lists are avalible.  I hope this rechargeable battery last more that 2 years but time will only tell.  Great buy for the money spent(code for "I think iPods are way over rated for the price").

<Title>Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0917478-0089613">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.

<Title>Good player for audiobooks
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use my mp3 players for listening to audiobooks & podcasts, and I'm trying to find "just the right one".  I've been using this one for a month now, and it's turning out to be my favorite so far. As I've found with the many players I've tried, there seems to be no commonality to these things but the power switch.  This player works with Overdrive books from the library and books from audible.com.  I haven't tried Netlibrary, but think it would be good there as well.    Documentation provided for its use is dismal; you need to be willing to spend time and just figure out on your own how things work.  You can find help in the user forums here at Amazon, or the Creative forums.  An installation CD is included with the player with lots of horrible warnings: "DO NOT connect your player to your computer before setting up the software."  Interestingly enough, further along in the booklet, it is mentioned how to use the player with a computer that doesn't have the software installed.  Since I don't like to install all these specialty programs if I can help it, I've found this player will work just fine without the Creative software - Windows Media Player will work with it fine.  Overdrive and Audible each have their own programs that you need to get their books, and they will handle the transfers to the player.  Suggest you try with or without the special software and see which you find works best for you.  The player has a bookmarking function, something that is really necessary for audiobooks, not so much with music. The bookmarks, however, are not at all intuitive to use, and figuring them out took several visits to the forums mentioned above.  Now that I know how to use them, I still find times when I have to make more than one try to get it done.  The good news is, I'm finding it's not really necessary to bookmark all that often.  When listening to a book, if you just turn the player off (without pausing first), when you next turn it on it will resume playing from the point at which it was powered down.  So unless you want to listen to part of one book, then go on to listen to something else, bookmarks aren't necessary.    The battery life for a fully charged player seems to be only about 8-10 hours, which is a bit shorter than I'd like, but it's OK.  The player has a little "joystick" for navigating around the menus - I've seen reviews that don't like this, but I do like it.  It's easy to navigate with. The screen is nice and readable.  Since I don't store photos or watch videos, I can't comment on those aspects of the player except to say it's supposed to do them.    Main things I like:  4GB storage, a nice amount for carrying several books with me to listen to.  Nice readable screen, easy to navigate to what I want to hear.  Bookmarks if I need them.  When turned off, resumes at where you were - also keeps the volume at the same level (I have another player that always returns to its preset volume which is higher than I like when turned off then back on - that's annoying). Small size, nice looking player.  I still feel that I'm in the learning stage with this player, but feel I've discovered the main things I need to know.

<Title>Good value player, but wasn't as flexible as I hoped.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very nice little player. It's easy to hold and does a lot for the money.  However, I hoped to be able to use it without special software, just drag and drop folders to the device.  While you can drag songs from your hard drive to the player, your folder structure isn't retained when you navigate the music on the device - you just get a long list. If you want to make "folder-y" playlists, you have to use software to do that, either the software that comes with it or sync with Windows Media or the like.  Not what I was hoping for.  It is possible to create playlists using the device itself but the process is rather tedious.  If you like Windows Media player and managing your music and playlists with that, this will work perfectly for you.  The sound is good, and the line recording feature is great.

<Title>Died After 10 mins of use
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been waiting for years since the mp3 craze started to find the one that was just right for me before purchasing.  The Zen V Plus has all the features that I wanted.  So right out of the box I downloaded about 1 gig worth of my mp3s to listen to it on my commute to work.  I listened to what I downloaded for about 1 min to make sure it was transferred ok.  Seemed great.  The next morning after 5 more minutes of use I heard these REALLY DANGEROUSLY LOUD high pitched chirping sounds while the music was playing.  Then the player just froze.  I reset it and it shut off ok, but then on restart it would always freeze on start up.  I contacted their customer support and they told me to reinstall the  latest driver, firmware, and application s/w.  I tried to do that, but when reinstalling the firmware the player simply freezes also.  Customer service people told me that I must have did something wrong and could send it back if I pay for shipping and if they found it was a problem I could have fixed they would charge me. Perhaps I just got a player w/ some corrupted memory, and I could probably get it working if I tried long enough, since I am a computer expert, but I really don't have time in my schedule to devote to fixing a product that should be working right out of the box.  Thankfully I bought it from amazon and returning it was simple.  Granted it would be a great product (way better than the Ipod) if it worked.  But from all the reviews I've read I'm not the only one having this problem so there is something wrong w/ their quality control at creative. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always research a product before I buy it if it's a purchase over $100. The only two bad things that I could even slightly be picky about:  1. The small screen which would make it hard to watch videos (a feature I've yet to try since it is a mp3 player, not a DVD player.)  2. The Zen freezing and having to be reset.  The latter almost dissuaded me from buying this player. After reading about how often and how difficult it was for some to reset I got scared. But, I took the plunge since it was the only REAL drawback and if that did happen, I could always get refunded. Well, I've had my player for about a week now, and it's frozen twice (after disconnecting from the computer). Resetting it was simple. The first time I took a sewing needle, stuck it in the hole and reset. The second time I was at work and used a paper clip to reset it. The hole is so small that you can't help but to hit the button correctly. After resetting, the library rebuilt itself and continued playback like nothing had happened. Not a real drawback, IMHO.  4 of my friends have the Ipod Nano which cost about $60 more than mine while having less features. 3 out of the 4 envy my Zen. The line-in encoding is nice, though I wish it pulled the track information instead of just labeling it "Line In Recording (Date)". The FM Radio works very well. The customizable backgrounds, I love it. And the simple "drag and drop" or just "sending it to" the player for your files on the computer... couldn't be better.  I'm thoroughly and impressed and satisfied with my player for the money.  Not to mention, it looks better than the Ipod and it's scratch resistant. Just what I need. (Though, I have the leather carrying case. So cute!)

<Content>The Zen V Plus is very small yet packed with tons of computer power. I would say it rivals quite well with the Ipod Nano. I love the brilliant display, the pictures option for wallpapers, the built-in FM radio, and the durability as it is very compact.

<Title>Good product except freezed in a week
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This's my first mp3 player. I purchase this one because it's the only flash memory based mp3 player that has bookmark capability. Listening to downloaded audio book is my main purpose.  Menu is easy. Some functionalities need to read PC installed manual to figure out, such as how to setup bookmark.   Problem is it stops working yesterday, five days after I bought it. First it froze, no button works. It recovered after I pushed reset button using a pin. In a few hours, it froze again. This time, reset is not able to bring it back. As soon as the screen is on, it froze, no matter how many times I tried. The thing I did yesterday is loading about 2G music into the player. It might have some issue when loaded with too much music, but, hey, it's a 4G player.

<Title>Nano Trump card
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The other reviews covered most of what you would want to know if you were considering this player, I'll breifly express my opinion and include some technical details not found in the other reviews.  This player is amazingly robust, small, and sexy.  Having owned an Apple Nano prior I really appreciate this players "stance" of being shorter and thicker.  The unit is about twice as thick as a Nano, but less then half the height.  For me with larger hands this unit is much easier to operate.  Some people complained about having to reset their unit, having had this for 2 months now I've never had a problem.    Technically, the unit stores the location of several songs and movies you've been listening to in its memory.  This is great for videos and podcasts where you may have to put down the device inbetween listenings.  The syncing software works well with the exception of some video's you have to convert first before putting on the player. the included Zencast software (for subscribing to podcasts etc.) works very well and also allows you to sync within it.  Finally you can also use the device as media storage device for other files if desired.  The ability to throw music (and charge) the player on any PC is a huge advantage of this player (and other non-Apple products), I'm grateful to get away from the lock-in that is Itunes.

<Content>I love this MP3!  It is small and easy to use.  We now have two in our house and will order another.  It is easy to load the music, create playlists and use the player.  Color on screen is great and I love that there is a radio on it too.  Sometimes it is nice to listen to that.  Another great Creative MP3

<Title>Another broken player...
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After following startup directions exactly, charging for the requisite 6 hours, using the Creative software installed on my computer, my 4GB Creative Zen Plus froze repeatedly during playback.  Today, when trying to shut it down, the entire device froze.  Tried to restart it, followed the steps to reset it... no luck.  Now, I can't even get it to turn back on and there was power left in the battery.  Am returning to Amazon with regret and will look for a different kind of player.  Also, a note to other potential buyers, the black player ends up getting fingerprints all over it and looking generally greasy from the oils or lotion on your hand.

<Title>Be warned
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased 3 of these players b4 xmas for my kids on the recomendation of the worker at walmart(big mistake,I know).All 3 of them have had major problems.I am so pissed about these players that I am writing my first product review ever.Player 1 had a firmware crash on day 1 (Christmas)!It went into recovery mode and couldn'nt get out of it.Luckily I was just within the time limit to take it back to walmart for a refund.I wish I had just taken them all back.Less than a month later, the on/off button on player 2 pops off and won't go back on.So now my daughter gets to turn it on and off with a pen tip. Now this morning,35 days after opening, my other daughter tells me her players firmware crashed(player 3)!Again,can't get it out of recovery mode. I search the web and find a link in a forum about mp3 players.It took me to a recovery tool from creative for this problem.I run the program,and it gets the player working again but there was an error on their site so the program wouldn't complete! Now when you turn it on it has to rebuild the library every time.Custom settings reset every time. What a pain! As you can tell I do not like this product. These are just the major problems.If you are buying this product to save a few bucks over the competition, you should also know that the headphones that come with this player are horrible.You will spend another $30+ for a decent set. I replaced player 1 that I took back to walmart with a sony walkman that I ordered on amazon.Oh my God,the difference in quality was amazing!From the look,feel,and above all the sound,sony really came through.The screen is bigger,the headphones sound great and the buttons are sturdy and easy to use,and it wasn't much more money!In closing, don't make the same mistake as I did.Educate yourself on what is available b4 buying.

<Title>Great design, but a lot of bugs, poor quality, and warranty repair costs 1/3 as much as a new player
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: Great design Really like the design of the software Great features, if they only worked Small size  Cons: Poor quality Many bugs involve daily resetting Warranty repairs(3 months after purchase) are 35% the new price, and that is full warranty coverage per Creative Labs. Customer Service... felt like the service a bull gives a cow Need to buy ear buds as the one with it are the 10 cent ones  Life of my Zen V Plus: The resetting was a pain, but tolerable since I constantly made sure I bookmarked the location and could easily get back to it (Audio books).  The ear buds are junk as are most you get with players.  Eventually, the player screen slowly faded over a few days and then stopped working after just over 3 months of owning it.  I had been careful and knew it had never been damaged or even dropped.  It was always in padded plastic case.  I call Creative for the warranty and this is where it got really bad.  It took 2 weeks just to get a RMA from creative to send it to them for warranty repairs.  I sent it with all the info.  They then contacted me 2 weeks later and said they hadn't gotten the receipt.  So I faxed another copy of it.  They said it didn't come through.  Long story short 3 more faxes from different fax machines, 4 times e-mailing it as an attachment as an .mdi, .pdf, and .jpg file and then screenshots of circuit city's order history page and they finally got it.  A few days later I get an e-mail requesting I call and provide payment for handling and diagnosis before they'll even look at it.  I looked at my warranty and saw it said nothing about having to pay for anything, but shipping to them.  They have clarified that it did say I wouldn't have to pay anything.  I am now stuck deciding if I want to pay half the cost to get a new one or suck up my loss and go get a different player.

<Title>Weird static-sounding background noise between tracks
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this I was really impressed with the fact that the buttons are really quiet. There's nothing more annoying than being at the library and being able to hear every little click on someone's phone or mp3 player.   So, I decided to plug my headphones in and listen to the sample music, just to see what it was like while playing music. At first the sound quality was great, not knock-my-socks-off but very impressive. However, as soon as I shifted to the next track I heard... a strange noise. No, not a beep from the player. Not cell phone interference. Just... noise. Sort of like a record before the music plays, but a little more electronic. I thought that maybe this was just a bug, but then I switched to the next track and the next. Same thing.  I'm not that picky when it comes to mp3 players, but it should be a given that the player performs the function of playing mp3s well. It doesn't. I am returning this tomorrow.   Note: I had the old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CS7U1C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0917478-0089613">Creative Zen Vision: M</a> and it worked great. It didn't make weird noises when I changed tracks, and really that's the bare minimum when it comes to mp3 players.

<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT WILL BREAK WITHIN 6 MONTHS.  THE SCREEN WILL JUST DIE AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO FIX IT. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU TAKE CARE OF IT OR NOT, IT WILL JUST NATURALLY BREAK. IT IS SOMESORT OF PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS MP3. THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR MP3 IF YOU BUY IT.  BUY AN IPOD, SANSA, A ZUNE, IT DOES NOT MATTER, AS LONG AS IT IS NOT THIS.  ALSO, PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY CREATIVE PRODUCTS BECAUSE I ALSO BOUGHT HEADPHONES THAT DID NOT WORK.  I REPEAT THIS PRODUCT WILL BREAK.  THIS DID NOT JUST HAPPEN TO ME, IT ALSO HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, AND DOZENS OF REVIEWS THAT I HAVE READ ONLINE.  THE ZEN V PLUS WILL WORK FOR ABOUT 6-12 MONTHS BUT AFTER THAT THE SCREEN WILL COMPLETLY BREAK AND THE PLAYER WILL STOP WORKING.  I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING AN MP3.  PLEASE PICK A DIFFERENT PRODUCT FOR THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.

<Title>Decent choice for music and audiobooks
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a new player that would support both Yahoo! Music Unlimited subscription downloads and Audible books.  The choices are few.  I already had a Creative Zen Nano Plus, which I loved, but didn't work with Yahoo!.  The Zen V Plus has done very well at integrating with Yahoo! software and I easily added over 500 songs (automatically synchs my playlists).  But, the Audiobooks are hard to find on the menu (only available through the Genre section), and it is touchy about keeping correct place in the book.  When I tried to fast forward, it kept skipping to the next track, and then would restart at the beginning of the track.  If I press PAUSE before shutting down, it tends to skip backward as well.  And the battery life is much shorter than my Zen Nano.  So, for just music, it is a nice product.  Handling of audiobooks could use some improvement.

<Title>GREAT MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In the 6 plus months that I've been using my Zen V Plus 4GB I had no complaints, sound quality is excellent, features and menu very good, really stylish, I put it through an entire New year's party and everybody was happy with the music, and comments could go on an on... It froze only once after I hit the reset button it's been working fine.  Recommendation: buy the car or wall charger for it (from Creatibve though because there are some immitations out there that could give you a lot of trouble) it will save you a lot of time and the need to look for your computer to recharge (because it won't charge in any other computer different than the one you have the software installed on)  I'm going for the 8GB one next!

<Content>It's not the absolute best but it's up there I guess. The only problem I've had is that it tends to freeze from time to time and the only explanation I could find from the manufacturer's site is due to corrupt data. Now, I don't know how could that happen except maybe when I converted my CDs to .wma/mp3 formats but I've never had that problem with other creative products. Bummer.  I'd still pick this over all the other choices out there right now though.

<Content>I got my Zen V Plus about 3 weeks ago and if froze a few times the first couple of days. I downloaded firmware and it has only frozen up twice since then while I was trying to bookmark a book which is very difficult. Yesterday the power switch fell off and is lost and I have been trying all day to get a response from their customer support by e mail and phone. All I have been able to get is a auto response via e mail that says they will respond within 24 hours. I was never able to hold long enough to get to speak to anyone in their customer service dept. The player has great sound, poor battery life, freezes often and seems to be poorly constructed. I wish I had shopped around a little more.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player.  After reading the reviews, I thought hard and long about purchasing this player but ended up purchasing it in the end.  AND I am so glad that I did.    I loaded up 748 songs right away.  Songs that I ripped from my own collection of CDs.  I also loaded up photos and videos from my recent trip to Hawaii.  I had no problem doing this and the software was self-explanatory.  Basically, drag and drop into the ZEN V Plus folder.    And to top it off, I synched the ZEN with my Outlook contacts.  No Problem.  The ZEN menu system was easy to navigate.  I could easily find the music that I wanted to play and the photo/videos that I wanted to watch.    I love the small compact feel to the ZEN.    So far...so good.  I am glad I purchased this product.

<Title>Documentation please!!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My first mp3 player was a basic 1 gig Creative player. Great sound, easy to use with Windows explorer. Unfortunately, this device has virtually no instructions on how it handles mp3 files and the software is just as bad. I expected to categorize my music using folders, sub-folders, etc like on my computer. No way! I finally realized after several emails to creative that the player doesn't work that way. It uses "tags" associated with the mp3 files and the firmware to categorize your music. Unfortunately, nearly all of my ripped cd's had no tags so everything was a mess. Fortunately, I was able to add tags to the mp3 files without re-ripping my entire 350 cd collection. Better documentation explaining file handling etc would have saved hours of aggravation. Also, allowing a windows directory approach would be far easier. I recently discovered that a different brand player uses the same approach and also lacks documentation on how files are categorized, etc. The more indepth general manual did mention in a footnote that files are categories by tags, but didn't explain how they are added or how to edit them. What a pain. Overall, a great sounding compact player that should come with an AC charger.

<Title>Awesome Player - Great Price
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I checked as many online reviews as I could before deciding, and the Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB was both highly regarded and going to give me the most bang for my buck.  I was not disappointed.  Don't let its' small size or spartan appearance fool you; once you get the hang of the menu system, it is both easy to use and intuitive. It sounds great, though some of you may want to get a set of higher end earphones.  It appears to be fairly durable; so I'd expect it to stand up to just about anything short of outright abuse.  I've used a variety of MP3 players over the years and this one is by far the best.  The bottom line is that it's done everything I've expected of it and I highly recommend it.  I can't comment on the included software, as I use Linux (openSUSE 10.3), not Windows.  You can either reformat the Zen as a MTP device, or go to the Packman repositories and install Gnomad 2 and any associated dependencies to use it as a native PDE device, which is what I did.  Works flawlessly!

I carry it on my neck with the supplied lanyard when on the train and while riding a bike and I can't be happier. Again, sound quality is very very very good (I use Sennheiser headphones). The only thing I can think of that is probably better on iPod is the scrolling speed. Using the joystick the scrolling speed/control has less sensitivity. The joystick is very comfortable anyway, and control is very good so in my opinion it is still a 5 starts device. In my opinion the price is a steal as well (and I don't work for Amazon :) )

This is so much better it holds so much music and the battery lasts, for me, at least one week and thats with everyday use. I like my players small and sleek, its very compact but the screen is still large enough to see. I really enjoy it and i have many other friends that feel the same way.

<Content>The Creative Zen V Plus at this price cant be beat by any other player.  I have had my Zen for about 3 months now and all i can say is wow. So many more features than the competition and at a better price.  Pros: -Price -Line In is Crystal Clear -Microphone -and more  Con: -It froze on me twice (which is to be expected from any MP3 player)

<Content>Love it! Much smaller than I expected. Easy to use while running. Much better than the Zen Micro I had previously, which had the touch screen. The toggle does need a  fingernail to use, so it might not be as easy for someone short nails. Headphones do not have good sound and get muffled sounding when you sweat, so I use different ones.

<Title>Breathtaking
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zen VPlus and wow, it was simply breathtaking.  Where do I begin?  Firstly, I tried ipod from a friend of mine & it was great from every aspect, but I wanted the sound quality to be a bit better. I own some Creative stuff so I hoped if I go for a Creative MP3 player, it should do the job.  And it did! The little player has excellent sound quality - full spectrum with an exceptional s/n ratio. I am very satisfied with it.  Pros: - The player nicely fit in the hand. You'd find you'd like to keep it in your hands even when you don't want to use it. It's like a toy. - The device is very usable. The menu is very convenient. And the 2 buttons + joystick behaves exactly the way you think. Some people say the joystick button is a bit tight and gives a cheap feel. But I did not find it so. - When you look at the player, it looks totally anonymous. All product information is mentioned at the back side of the player. Even the root menu item reads, simply, 'menu'. I like this very much. Because if the player is very attractive, with its sophisticated artwork, it captures some share of attention which otherwise should have gone to the song itself. When you listen to music, the player should support you, by not capturing your attention and let you focus on the music. This player does it very well. - The screen quality is great. Creative has used OLED, which is not as bright as LCD. But the OLED display is viewable from every angle, unlike LCD, and also consumes less power. The ability to view from every angle is a great thing. - The ability to play video, the FM radio and the ability to record from Line-In audio adds much value to the package. - The sound quality of the FM radio and the recorded audio (from built-in mic) are extremely good.  - The casing and the screen are covered with a scratch-resistant layer. The player was dropped once with a big impact which made me to lose all hopes before picking it up. But the player works fine and still I was not able to find the scratch mark of the impact! Seems like it is truly scratch resistant. - The software kit was very convenient. You can manage play lists, etc., very quickly.   Cons: - Would have been better if a battery charger was included. The USB-charging takes some long time. But this was not a big issue.

<Title>Great Mp3 player . . . When it works.
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this as a replacement for my Zen Nano Plus that died a sudden death just after a year.  I figured I dropped it too many times, or something like that because I know I give "pocket electronics" (i.e. PDAs, cell phones, Mp3 players) a very hard life.  Well this one never left my house, though I will admit I put it through its paces.  My biggest problem with it is the buttons on the side of the joystick.  Whenever I use them, it almost feels like I have to use TOO much pressure to activate them.  I would expect something like this from a device that was 1-2 years old not one 3-4 weeks old.  Besides that, I love my player.  The screen isn't big enough to watch full-length movies, but I won't be doing that anyway so that doesn't matter, the pictures show fairly well, sound quality could be better, but I don't just listen to music; I'll read or do other things while listening, so sound quality doesn't bother me.  Also the battery life is repulsively short.  Even if I have a full charge, I'm lucky if I get 6 hours of listening time.  When you take everything into consideration, this player isn't good, it isn't bad either, it is your everyday, run of the mill average mp3 player, and I was highly dissapointed by that.

<Title>battery life is short
<Date>Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>his model seems to have a battery life of about 9 hrs so it's not really 15 hrs. To extend the battery life one must not use the equalizer, use lower bitrate songs, and lower volume yet it still has a short battery life so if you're planning to go on long trips it's not good. The annoying thing is that the headphones are a bit too big and uncomfortable for my small ears. The creative media explorer software was easy to use to sync music from my pc but there were some files that couldn't transfer with the smartfit option. The smartfit option allows me to compress the file that are transferred to the zen. The error that I got was that the music files in question might not be an audio file. Those music files transferred successfully when I disabled the smartfit option and transfer them as mp3 files. overall I feel this product offers a lot for its price but I would have liked a longer battery life. The charging time was not 6 hrs, it was actually about 3 1/2 hrs for me so I think that 's acceptable compared to the ipod or sansana.

<Title>Little player, little enjoyment
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If I had to do it again, I'd spend a little more and get an iPod.  Extremely low output when used as AUX with stereo systems.  My screen kept getting dimmer and dimmer until it went completely black, luckily within the warranty period of 3 months.  Creative was not horrible to deal with from customer service stand point, but is that why you'd buy a player?  I'd rather have one that doesn't require additional work in a few weeks.  Not bad for using around town, workouts or even on the slopes, but don't expect this to be the best of what's available.

<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this because I didn't want to give in to the ipod monopoly.  I was excited about the fm radio, but you rarely get reception.  The organizer is just a waste of space. I never could figure out how to set the clock on it.   But for about a year,it played back my music which is really why I bought it. Then the screen went out and I could only play the last album I listened to over and over. I downloaded updates and the recovery tool from Creative, but nothing worked and eventually the player stopped working all together.  What a waste of money. And even though I didn't want an ipod, every accessory out there is designed with an ipod in mind.  Sometimes, you just have to give in.

<Content>I purchased two of this mP3 player- one for my daughter, the other for my neice. I had done much searching and reviewing before purchasing this product through Amazon. Amazon had by far the best price. My neice at first insisted she wanted an Apple IPod until she saw the Zen and all it's functions, not to mention the 4GB holds more songs than an Apple IPod 4GB. My daughter and my neice were both very pleased- it's size, durability, and all the functions suit them just great. I would definitely recommend this product.

<Content>Bought for my daughter in Sept but display began fading after a couple months and finally died in December. Annoying that it lasted just past the 30 day Amazon return, but not much more. Per Creative the cost is $25 non-refundable for "labor" diagnosing returns.  That is outrageous! Over %25 of product cost for them to make it right (assuming they honor the warranty). Due to the lack of medium term reliability with the added insult of paying for warranty service, I will never buy another Creative product.

That's right, me. Creative makes a crappy product, and when it does not work, I get stuck with the trouble and expense of returning it to them.  During my research to fix this problem I came across other people who have the same glitch as I do, so apparently this is not a one-time-only deal.  Buyer beware!

<Content>This is my first music player.  I like it a lot for playing digital books, that I download from my local library. (Most public libraries are not compatible with iPods). It has a bookmark feature that's very helpful.  The only downfall I see, is that the player freezes up when fast forwarding.  You have to have a pin handy to stick in the little hole to reset it.

<Title>Don't buy this...too big of a chance of getting a bad one. 
<Date>Sun Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my husband from Circuit City.  I thought it was so neat looking and my kids have had other Creative products, so I ordered a Zen V for myself from Amazon.  The one I got had to be returned to Amazon since it froze and could not play a whole song through (Amazon, btw, has WONDERFUL customer service/return policy).   When we went to load songs on the Zen VPlus I bought my husband, it froze after about 60 songs (about .4 gb in) and the only way to reset it was to format the device.  I tried everything including downloading new firmware etc.  Sadly, I was not able to return it to CC since we didn't realize it was not working within their return period.  I did return it to Creative, paying $8+ to mail and insure it.  They sent another unit and it HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.   They supposedly have sent my complaints to a supervisor, but no one has responded yet.  I have a unit that should hold hundreds (or thousands, even) of songs, and we can only load on about 60 songs. What a RIP OFF it has proven to be.  I think that Creative is just going to monkey around with this until my warranty expires.

<Content>The power switch on the Zen V Plus doesn't always work. This occurs usually after it's been sitting idle/powered off for over 6 hours or so. If you play with the switch for about 10 minutes or so, it will power on. This and the fact that it doesn't integrate natively with iTunes are my biggest concerns. Regardless if you use PC or Mac, just get the Nano...it integrates with both iTunes, WMPlayer, etc. and I haven't heard any complaints from friends that own the Nano. Stay away from the Zen.

That too is suffered by many people (Search Google here too). Creative has only 3 months of labor warantee and products break so you will have to shell lot of money even if your hardware warantee is 1 year, what a trap!

<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I chose the Zen V Plus for a couple of reasons, not the least of them being its fantastic price.  It just seemed to do so much more than the iPod for so much less.  I couldn't put it down!  Sadly, very shortly after I got it, a small crack that had been growing steadily in the joystick finally gave way, splitting the thin plastic.  I exchanged it for another, hopefully less problematic one.  With both players, I encountered sporadic freezing, but on the second one, the reset button didn't work.  I gave up and just sent that one in for a refund.  It may just have been bad luck, seeing as I know others who have not encountered these problems, but be forewarned:  the plastic seems quite fragile.  If it weren't for the manufacturing, I would have given it a full 5-star rating.

<Title>Creative Zen - So Far, Fantastic; Update the Firmware Before Using
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Zen V Plus for about 2-3 months, and it's been working beautifully so far. I first chose the Zen instead of the iPod because I did not want to be bound to the iTunes interface - I'm a drag and drop sort of person.  One thing I did as soon that I got the device was download and update its firmware on Creative's website in the Downloads section with the January 07 release, as I noticed that there were plenty of complaints about the firmware. So far, no faulty firmware or freezing problems.  It's survived a few field trips, being passed around by excited middle schoolers (who, much to my chagrin and amusement, immediately coined it Tamagotchi-like and cute, among other similar adjectives). In addition, many commented that it was better than an iPod, due to the FM radio capability and higher capacity hard drive - many of them own the iPod Nano 2GB (in fact, me and a close friend are the only two to own a Zen product)There are minuscule scratches on it, but only visible if you go in for a nice close up.  The voice recording worked for entertaining us for hours on end, though the quality was a bit mediocre, and could have been better. While the subtitles were impossible to read, we did have a nice time with watching some smaller clips of anime and other media. I wouldn't recommend  watching a full episode, though, it is a nice thing to have on a field trip with you for the price versus a video iPod.  One of my friends who owns an iPod comments that one of the better things it has is the precise volume control, just clicking the up/down button on the side. He notes that he has tried changing the volume on his own iPod, and when distracted, accidentally clicks the wheel the wrong way and nearly blows out his eardrums (hyperbole, but it's a strain on your ears nonetheless).  This is surprisingly durable. I've knocked it onto the floor, banged it a couple times against an upright bass (music festivals include the major lugging of our string instruments), and some other incidents. One worth mentioning happened only today.  I was in the bathroom of my home, and had my earbuds on, listening, with the Zen on the counter. I'm a klutz, and Murphy's Law is evil - so of course, I slung my arm around to grab my towel to wipe my hands - and the Zen went soaring into the sink, still draining with about a quarter inch of soapy water. I quickly yanked it out, slightly wet from the incident. I quickly shut it down, and wiped it off with a towel. Hoping for the best, I waited for it to dry before turning it on. And lo and behold, it was still working and functioning correctly.  Granted, it wasn't in the water for very long, or even what you'd called completely submerged, but the damage that could have happened didn't. For that, I'm thankful.  The only time I've had to reset this was when I decided to view a video that I hadn't converted beforehand and the device froze. Fortunately, the reset button quickly remedied the freeze and I learned to not be too impatient when transferring media onto these that I know probably won't work correctly.  Of course, I've only had it for about three months, so I might be back with a few corrections. I wonder how well it (namely, the joystick) will hold up in the future.  Pros: - Smart Volume (great for keeping the volume from blowing your ears out and still achieving phenomenal sound; this can be disabled and enabled as you wish) - Great capacity for its price - Durability - FM radio - Voice Recorder - Customizable color themes and backgrounds from .jpeg pictures loaded onto the device  Cons: - Small video size - Tiny screen - Long charging period - Bass amplifier renders slightly scratchy sound; better off without it - Seemingly delicate joystick  Overall, it seems that since I haven't had the problems others seem to be having, might just have to do with updating the firmware. I can't say the same for the joystick navigation in times to come, but so far, this is one tough little device, and I hope to enjoy it for months, at least, to come.

<Content>This player works but it crashes and needs to be plugged into computer to be brought back up with its reset button. Screen is hard to see in daylight and sometimes impossible to see. Sound quality is good. Case broke where lanyard is attached, I was shocked. I have to say I would not buy this player again along with the Ipod which I found this is not up to the task of being used in a mobile situation. I have an old creative zen big 40gb hd model that has out lived 2 ipods and now is still in better shape than this one. It still is working today but I do not have much hope for it at this point.   UPDATE: This player is now dead as I had fallen asleep with it in my pocket with the headphones. It seems that one of the ear buds crushed the lcd while in the pocket. I am very displeased by this and it seems to me if you can have a cell phone last 3 to 4 years of every day use why can i not get a mp3 player last 1 year of intermittent use.

I use it every day at work and listen to books during my drive time. A warning when loading your music from your PC, don't let windows media manager do the auto sync. I ended up with about 500 pictures on the Zen. To make room for the books and music I had to remove them all. The only negative I have is trying to figure out how to rewind the books so I can listen to parts I miss. The radio works ok but did take a bit to figure out the best way to get to the stations.

<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wore out my Creative Zen V 1 GB(after almost a year), so I upgraded to the Plus with 4 GB.  I love it.  It's easy to use (since I'm not real computer literate) and it has lots of memory.  Right now I have 3 books on it I downloaded from netlibrary (for free) and 4 Christmas albums that I ripped from my collection and that only takes up just over 1 GB.  You can download pictures, videos, listen to FM radio and use the voice recorder to name a few of its functions.  Now why would you buy an Ipod?

<Title>Great product with excellent support for anyone with half a brain
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little player is very nice,with an incredible array of features and functionality.The manual is not buried deep in the creative program folder,as mentioned in one review.Go to program files/Creative/Creative ZEN V Series (R2)/Manual.Create a shortcut on your desktop,for easier access,if you'd like.It's a very thorough manual,with very clear instructions.The Creative website also has further assistance,such as firmware,the latest of which is 1.32.01,which improves the album art display.Audio quality is excellent,Video is easily converted with the software program.FM radio,voice recording,line in recording etc.Of course it has limitations,but for $99.00,I know I've got my money's worth.It's not on a par with my Cowon D2,but I have to give this feature packed device two thumbs up or a 5 star rating.You'll have to quantify that your self.

<Title>Zen V Plus - brilliant
<Date>Sat Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>ZEN V Plus 4GB Black/Blue I've had the zen for 3 months now and am delighted with its performance, it exceeds what I expected.  It does everything creative claim for it.  I use it most days both around the home and out and about, sound quality is great.  It hangs around your neck on the included lanyard and when you've made your selections it is small enough to tuck inside your shirt or in a top pocket so is unobtrusive.  The screen is a bit small for videos but having said that it plays them very well and its easy to convert them with the included software.  The included software works fine but after reading some other reviews I bought a copy of media-monkey which integrates perfectly with the Zen. So I would pass on that recommendation. You can download a trial version to try it before you commit.  One bonus I didn't expect is the line in. I've connected it to the headphone socket of my hifi and can digitise my vinyl collection without any special links to the computer. Works a treat, Brilliant!  Another bonus is the voice recorder.  Press the record button on the side no matter what you're playing at the time, hold it like a microphone, speak your notes and then resume playback.  Its so easy,  would even make a reasonable interview tool in a non-pro environment say for a student.  With the proviso that a model with a larger screen would be better for video, I would recommend the V Plus. Suggest that if video is important to you, you try the new ZEN otherwise the V Plus is superb.

<Title>Tech Support Responded Quickly Even Pre-Purchase
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted the Zen V Plus to use for audiobooks, as it seemed the best-featured and best-reviewed of the players that have been tested and work well with NetLibrary (free books through many public libraries, including mine). (I also used reviews from Amazon's question section, where someone had asked about the best player to use with NetLibrary. This was by far the most common response in my price range, and the most common response in any range by a smaller margin.) But, a couple of the other reviews here worried me; I didn't want to buy a dud with poor tech support!  So, I visited Creative's site and asked their tech support directly to respond to this concern before I purchased. I sent my e-mail to them at about 7 pm, and by 2 am had a very friendly reply, including this paragraph:  "Please also note that when you purchase a Zen V Plus, you will get 60  days of free phone support and 1 year email support. Should you  encounter any issues with your player or have any questions on how to  use the features, you are free to email us and we will be more than  happy to assist you."  I also explored the extensive knowledge base on their website. I'm pretty comfortable with my computer, so someone else might not find an online tech support database like that as reassuring as I do, but looking around, I felt like I could probably find the solution to most common problems there without having to wait for tech support. Add that to the two months of telephone support and the quick turnaround to my inquiry e-mail--which I sent to tech support, directed to the folks who would respond if my player froze up (which was what I'd read here in a couple reviews), not to any sales department, etc.--and I'm going to put my money down.  If their tech support had any problems before, then those problems seem to be resolved now.  Just thought I'd share that experience in case anyone else had the same reservtions about quality and tech support that I did, based on other reviews here.

<Title>Changed  My Life
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned my Zen for 7 months now and use it everyday.  I have it about half full - some music - a couple of audiobooks at a time - some photos.  It has only frozen on me 3 times in all those months.  I love the little size, the no scratch case and the ease of the software included.  What I don't like is that I can't reorganize my files once they are loaded.  Once in a while I'll misplace a song and I can't find it.  Also I broke off the on and off switch when my nail got caught on it while I was exercising.  I still can get it on and off using a pen - but I never did like that switch.  I like the "joystick"  better than the ipod navigation pad.  I bookmark my audiobooks but I can't get it to rewind if I need too.  Still for the $$ that I paid, its just what the doctor ordered.

<Title>Half a product in the box
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product specifically to be able to download audio books from the library, as well as listen to music. The Zen V Plus is one of the few MP3 players with that capability.  1st problem - the instruction manual is over 60 pages, 12 in English. None of which give adequate instruction on loading music into the player.  2nd problem - it is incompatible with Windows Vista. I sent an email to tech support. Received a quick & complete reply. I was told that I needed to download 4 applications (99 Meg) to make the unit compatible with Vista, to be able to download audio books & manage files.  In addition I was directed to a website to gain instruction on "How To" download music & audio books.  I believe that a "complete" product should be shipped when it is sold. This one is sold as a music/audio book player with voice recorder & picture viewing.  I think Creative should be ashamed to put it on the market.

<Content>This is a nice little player you have a voice recorder,you can listen to the radio,hold pics and videos too. I loves the size that was one of the main reasons i got it .  there was one problem with the player though ,  I have a 4gb and it worked until 3or 4 days it froze I didn't know what happened then i found the reset button, you have to use a paper clip (an ear ring works too) it has always been doing that . Its been about a year and the player still works and freezes on me. I also ask someone if they have a paper cilp or an  earing and they never do, so i just taped a paper clip  on the back of the player.

<Title>Awesome
<Date>Sat Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I paid $100 in total for my 4GB Zen V Plus. Much less than I paid for my daughter's Ipod Nano. It was much smaller than I thought it would be.  But the sound quality, ease of use and how light it is just works.  I really love mine and now my daughter wishes she could have gotten mine instead.  I have seen some complaints about the controls for someone who has big hands and I can see how that might be a problem, but isn't for me and I am just the average girl.  I would reccomend this for anyone who is looking for a 4GB. Be sure to shp for a bargain, because they are out there.  Truthfully if you can get a bargain on the 8GB Why not go just a little bigger and have more space.   I do wish it was just a little bigger and a had a little bigger screen, but for the price and the size this is awesome!

<Title>Little, compact, but great!
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After doing a lot of research on MP3 players I chose the Zen V Plus 4.  I was surprised at how small it really is, and even questioned my purchase at first, but I believe I chose wisely.  Some people who have seen me wear the Zen V around my neck have asked, "Is that the 'I've fallen and can't get up thing?"  Funny.  But that is how small the Zen V really is.  The device is easy to use, easy to navigate, and extremely easy to rip music. Don't even bother with the instruction manual.  It doesn't tell you anything! This is the only complaint I have about the Zen V.  The manual is too confusing, doesn't contain important information on how to use all of the tools, and is written in too many languages.  That aside, by experimenting with the Zen V I was able to quickly manage it.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to make changes with the equalizer is simple too.  The earbuds take awhile to get used to, and they aren't the greatest, but they provide good sound quality.  Tending to march to the beat of my own drum I did not want to get an ipod, and I am glad I didn't.  I am very pleased with the Zen V Plus!

<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zen 2 months ago and I just love it. I like the fact that it's so small. I can put it in my pocket and listen to tunes any time and anywhere I want. The only time it froze up on me was when I was trying to hook it up to play on my car radio with an adapator I bought at a store. The adapater sucked all the juice out of the battery on my Zen. Once I hooked it up to my computer and recharged the battery it worked just fine, and I haven't tried hooking it up to my car again. I also haven't had any other problems with it freezing up. Could be because I've never used the software that it came with since I use Napster. Bought a cover to protect it and a small digital camera case to keep it in as well. Like everyone else, I absolutely hated the ear buds that came with it, so I bought different ones.  This product has been everything I wanted and more, and the price was perfect for me.  I could not be happier.

<Title>Not an Ipod Yet but a good 2nd Choice
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Everyone compares each mp3 player to an iPod and since I own 2 iPods I am going to do the same thing.  The Zen's controls are OK, the little joystick in the center can be a pain if you have bigger hands or if you are trying to do 2 things at once (i.e. drive and change songs).  But it gets the job done.  The menu's and organizational software is good and it works well with Windows Vista.  The big plus is the services that it works with.  Yahoo's music service is great and if you are into music over the long run it is a lot cheaper than iTunes.  All in all my suggestion would be get and iPod if you have no mp3 player.  Get a Zen is you don't want to deal with iTunes or want a music subscription service.

I spoke to the two people who had the Zen when this happened and they told me that I am lucky it even turns on, because both of their Zens stopped working completly. I DO NOT recomend this product. An Ipod is the same price and from what I have heard a lot more reliable.

<Content>This is my second Zen player...wanted one with more GB so went with the 4 GB Zen V and I've had it now over 4 months.  The controls are easy to work, especially if you like tactile feedback.  The joystick is not too small and I have typical male-sized thumbs.  I've dropped it several times accidentally and the screen held up, no problems at all.  Battery life is really near 15 hours.  I just got back from a very long extended vacation with drives of over 700 miles on several days and it was a lifesaver.  Not a single problem ever with either Zen I own.  I'm just waiting on the 8 GB to go down in price :)  Update: After 8 months, still great.  It's only locked up on me twice...once I reset it easily, the other time I had to let the battery run down.  Still, only 2 locks in 8 months.  My next MP3 player will be a Creative product.

<Title>Disappointing after less than a year.
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zen V Plus as a Christmas present in 2006. When I first started using it, I was extremely happy with what I had got. Everything worked nicely, the screen was good, sound quality was good. As much as   The first time it froze up on me, I didn't know what to do at all. I found the reset button, and then I had to go searching for an earring or other small object. This has happened numerous times, and it's an extreme pain to have to deal with every so often.  Secondly, the joystick may seem like an improvement to others, but to me, it's quite a pain. Personally, I have a lot of songs on my player. When I want to find a band or song that falls between J and O, I have to hold it down for the longest time just to find the right song. Then, I usually wind up passing it and having to go back, which requires more thumb pressing. Once in a while, I'll push the stick the wrong way, and lose the list. When I go back to the list then, I have to start back from the top once more, just to find that one song.   Up until a few weeks ago, I thought the joystick was the most of my problems. Over time, my screen started to get darker. I thought it might have been lack of charging from my end, since I had a tendency to bring it with me to school, and then forget about it in my bag until the next morning. I plugged it into my computer, with that lone cord they give you, and nothing improved. I gave in, and went to the main Creative website and found out what was wrong: for some reason, the screen on the players sometimes get darker, and darker. Eventually, then all go black, and you can't see anything at all. The only way to fix this, is to send it in for a new one. Now, I'd be fine with this, but it requires you to have saved the receipt and I received mine as a gift, so I don't have the receipt.   I had really high hopes for this one after having a few problems with my old iPod. Experiencing this makes me want to return to iPods.  If you are considering buying this, consider it carefully. And as others have said, it has it's pros but it has many more cons.

<Title>Not for compulsive organizers, freeway drivers, the particular
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player so I could simplify my music-listening while I drive up and down I5 each weekend.  IT WAS A MISTAKE.  I've had it just over 24 hours and I've already had to reset it at least three times (yes, I updated the firmware).  The player died (wouldn't turn on) and froze (wouldn't turn off). Unfortunately the player has to rebuild the music library each time you reset it and that can take up to 5 minutes.  There've been at least 30 times that the music has stopped playing for no reason, and I have to press "pause" then "play" to get it to play again.  I drove for about 5 hours today and the battery is almost totally dead (I started out with a full charge).  The player turns itself off instead of sleeping, so every time you pause it and run an errand or take a phone call or whatever, if you don't make it back in time, you have to start it up again (and THAT TAKES FOREVER--FOR! EVER!).  Also it makes the most pathetic creaky cheap-toy plastic noises when you handle it (even without pushing any buttons), because the buttons are made of two pieces of plastic that touch each other.    The organization and navigation of this thing suck.  I have a car stereo that plays MP3 CDs, and the navigation is painfully simple:  Press the joystick up or down to flip through folders, and press right or left to choose a song. EASY!  I assumed (like a dodo) that an MP3 player as well-received as the Zen V Plus would work on a similar principle.  I was WRONG.  The Zen V Plus sorts by tags, and you can choose to select by artist, album, or genre, or select all tracks. I put a 6-CD compilation on the Zen V Plus, so there are around 100 different artists from that comp alone; with all of the other albums on the player, there are a couple hundred artists in the artist list.  So, yes, I sometimes have to scroll through a hundred or more artists to find the one I want. Did I mention I got this player to use while I'm DRIVING? Can't scroll and drive.  I guess I could simplify the process by hooking up the Zen to my computer, firing up the MP3 management software and creating a playlist, but the software is a joke.  Regardless, once you have a playlist, you still have to navigate through the menus to pick the playlist, then scroll through everything in that list; you can't even re-sort the list (e.g., by artist or album title) as far as I can tell.  If you make a playlist of all of the songs, you might have to flip through 300 of them to get where you want to be. You also have to update that list each time you add/remove albums from the player.  An alternative would be to make a zillion playlists and scroll through those. I don't want to! I shouldn't have to.  So, long story short, ha ha, to get access to all of your albums, you have to either select every album and scroll through songs individually, by the hundreds, or you have to stop after each album and go into the menu and navigate to the next album or playlist, which you can't do while you're driving.  The player doesn't go from the end of album A to the beginning of album B. It stops at the end of A (you can put it on repeat if you want). And just to make this clear as daylight:  In a playlist, you cannot skip over an entire album with just the push of a button.  You have to skip each song until you get to the next album on the list (20 songs on the album you don't like? Then you'll have to push 20 times to get past it). I just want to be able to listen to my albums continuously, in alphabetical order by band - album title, and skip over an entire album if I don't feel like hearing it. That isn't asking much.    The alarm feature on this is nonsense.  The "alarm" is a black dialog box on the screen. Great alarm, right?    The headphones that came with this player are insulting.  They feel awful and they sound rotten (distortion at volume level 8 [of 25]). I'm to the point that I'm wondering if someone dropped the whole thing in a lake on its way to me.  How could anyone think it's okay to sell something like this?  So...any good points?  I guess one good thing about this player is that you don't have to look at the controls to operate them (as long as you don't have to look at the screen, I mean). It's easy to tell which control is which by touch. I can't think of any other good points offhand.  I would say "The Creative Zen V Plus has never personally tried to kill me" but I'm not totally sure that's true.  If anything in this review is inaccurate, please advise! If I can't return this piece, I'd like to know how to make it less useless and aggravating. I'd consult the user manual but it's essentially useless as well.  Thanks for reading!  Please excuse the negative tone here; I am just really disappointed.  If you get one of these, I hope you have better luck than I've had. I'm just glad I didn't buy a bunch of expensive accessories for it before I realized how much I hate it.

<Content>I've had this player for three months and it has never frozen on me.  This is my first MP3 player and so far, I am very pleased with it.  Using the software to rip CDs was pretty easy and intuitive.  Making playlists using the software was easy.  The sound quality is quite good, in my opinion.  The headphone shape could be better (they have a tendency to fall out of my ears if I try to walk around with them on).  I haven't tried to put video on this, so I don't know how easy that is yet.  I have downloaded some Zencasts, and that was easy.  However, I do think people should know that they are very unlikely to be able to put 2,000 songs on this player - I believe 1,000 is the maximum one could put on this.

<Content>I bought this for myself, and the very same day I bought it, I was scrolling through my list of songs and it froze. I waited a minute, then tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't even do that. When I returned it that night, the light was still on. I couldn't figure out how to get the battery out, either. Getting songs on it was easy, but mine wouldn't create playlists without putting all of the songs in that entire section (album/artist) all on the playlist instead of a single song like I was trying to do. Apparently I'm not the only one with a messed up version of this product, so I'd highly recommend getting something else such as a SanDisk. I currently own the SanDisk e250 and love it.

<Title>Do not purchase for Audiobooks
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Update:  I have given up trying to use this product for audiobooks.  The more I have used it, the more frustrated I have become.  It is too late to return it.  It will go in a drawer where I don't have to look at it.  I am resuming my search for a MP3 player good for audiobooks.  Previous comments:   I purchased the Zen V Plus to use for audiobooks.   I have recently discovered online libraries with free audiobook downloads.  Alas, these books are not ipod compatible.    There is no comparison between the ease of use of my video ipod and the Zen V Plus.  With the ipod, I can move from book to book and rarely lose my place.  Turn off the Zen V Plus in the middle of a chapter and I can almost guarantee your place will be lost.  Moving forward or backward in a chapter of an audiobook with the ipod is simple with the click wheel. With the Zen V Plus, it is an exercise of frustration.  You move around the interface using a small toggle.  Try to advance more than a couple of minutes and the Zen will "freeze up".   The unit can not even be turned off.  The only solution is to reset it by inserting a paperclip to "rebuild the library".  Also, there is a distressing tendency to "skip" to another section of the book.    (Searching Chapter 21 becomes Chapter 4)  Forget the estimated battery life of 15 hours.  While searching for your lost place in the book, battery power drops rapidly.  However, I will keep the unit because of the 4 GB and the nice little screen.  With more and more libraries offering downloadable books, hopefully a unit designed to accommodate audiobook listeners will be forthcoming.

<Title>Disappointing in so many ways...
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product has significant flaws that mark it as a work in progress.  I like the compact size and feather-weight. I hate the software.  I *did* download the latest software/firmware from Creative's site and successfully installed it.  * The "Zen V Series Media Explorer" is but one of the numerous applications that the CD installed on my laptop.  It looks like Windows Explorer and allows me to "cut" or "copy" a song that was mistakenly placed in a separate folder from the rest of the tracks on the album, but then it won't let me paste it where it belongs!  "Paste" is grayed-out!  It puts songs & photos into whatever folder it sees fit.  Once a file is on the device, you can't move it to the proper folder!  The Organizer, a redundant application, is worse and should be called the "DIS-organizer."  If you put a collection album (like "hits of the 60's") on it, each song goes into its own folder.  * It plays MP3's, but when copying music from a CD it only does it in Windows Media Player format (*.wma).  To convert to MP3, you have to BUY software.  * The CD also installed useless "craplets" from Yahoo on my computer.  It also tried to change my web browser's home page to Yahoo and sign me up for special offers.  Watch those check boxes!  You have to catch those and un-check them to avoid Yahoo's "generosity."  * It doesn't come with a wall- or car-charger!  I spend enough time on the computer and don't want to sit here just to charge it.  (Note: The iPod doesn't either; it comes only w/ a USB charger.)  *  By the time I buy all the stuff I need for it, I will have spent what I would have spent on an iPod.  iPods get bad reviews, too, but I know more people with those and might give iPod a try.  * Creative's idea of customer support is relegating us to a "discussion group" on their web site.  The discussion groups are terribly messy and are for families of products.  There isn't one for just this product.  Some of those groups had over 10,000 posts.  Good luck.  * It's not loud enough.  I have the volume near the maximum most of the time.  It's a pain to find a song.  There's just no way to organize what you've stored.  It's a mess.  I could go on listing more problems with their applications, but I think you get the point.  Update (11/25/07):  (1) I put a bunch of my CD's on it and when I went to an album, sometimes only one track showed up!  The rest were elsewhere or not there.  (2) I copied some pod-casts (in MP3 format) to the "recordings" folder and the copy task-bars ran to completion, and the MP3's showed up on the recordings folder with their explorer app.  Guess what?  Those weren't on the device at all!  (3)  I copied some pictures to the pictures/people folder on the device, and some to the pictures folder (above it).  It wouldn't let me move those down into the pictures/people folder!  THIS THING IS UNUSABLE!  I really hated it and took it back.  Going to try a Zune or iPod.  Their crummy software absolutely ruins it.

<Title>Creative doesn't seem to like their customers
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've only had it 24 hours and I'm already disappointed. The documentation is minimal, and what exists is scattered around in web pages, 2 printed booklets, and a PDF file installed deep within the program files folder on your PC, so there's no single source for basic documentation. Support is available through email. (The site says to check your manual for a 24-hour phone number, but the manual says to their web site.)  The CD ripper that comes with the player does NOT rip to MP3 format. Apparently, they used to charge you $10 to be able to do that, but now all you get is sent to a dead link on their web site.  There's a discussion forum if you're interested in workarounds.  All in the all, the device itself is perfectly adequate compared to its competition, but given all the negatives, you might as well buy a comparable brand that's much more customer-friendly.

<Content>I recently purchased the Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB Nano. So far, I have been very pleased. I have a neuromuscular disorder and I am able to grasp this player more easily than my friend's I-Pod. I am able to use the joystick with no problems as well. The software is easy to install and work with. It is easy to recharge and the battery life is excellent. I have been pleased with the sound quality. And, it is just plain "cute."   A few minor "cons." Screen is hard to see in bright sunlight and the smooth exterior sometimes gets a "smudged look."  An excellent buy for the money and I would purchase this product again.

<Title>Piece of Junk!!!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Looks good, easy to add / delete songs videos photos etc, thats about the only good things about this product. Used it about 4 times since i bought it off Amazon, of the 4 times, it froze on me twice, once it freezes none of the functions work, cannot switch it off etc. the only way to get it working again is to reset the unit, which can be done only by a paper clip / pin (which is difficult to get on the subway or bus). Cannot return the product to Amazon as its past 30 day period, so stuck with it as long as it works.... thinking about contacting the manufacturer, may not have much luck there either. Remember to buy a box of pins along with this unit, looks like you will need it often.

<Title>DON'T BUY
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player worked ok for about 3 weeks - just occasionally freezing.  Then it started freezing several times a day, and the cursor would scroll down any menu without anyone touching the toggle switch.  I couldn't choose any selection with the toggle because the cursor wouldn't stay on a selection.  I returned it to Amazon & they exchanged it.  They were great!  Amazon's return department gets 5+ stars. The new player was fine for about 4 weeks & now it's again freezing constantly, but the reset button won't work.  To reset, you have to let the battery run down fully, then recharge.  It's really a shame, because when it's working it's a neat little player.

<Title>Zen V Plus for audiobooks
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's a bit of a learning curve with the Zen V Plus, but after you master the controls and learn how to use the menus, it works well for downloading and listening to both books and music. I use it mainly for audiobooks, and my only complaint is that if you pause for more than a short time, or turn the player off, it goes back to the beginning of the present track if you haven't set a bookmark (which sometimes is a little tricky). There is also a fast-forward function which you can use to return to where you left off, but sometimes when you hold this too long, the player freezes up, and you have to push the reset. Over all, however, I give the player high marks. It does what I want it to do, and is a low-cost alternative to the I-Pods.

<Title>Is this player worth even $25 to me?
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When switching over to a flash player about four months ago, I decided to go with the Zen V Plus.  My Zen Nomad had done fairly well over a few years with just a few hiccups.  I have become increasingly unhappy with the player as time went on, and am furious at the moment.  "Design"  The play button's integration into the casing itself does not provide a good enough reaction.  Often I found myself pushing Play and nothing happened.  I would have to really focus my mind on pushing in just the right location to get it to respond.  The joystick is not awful, but also not good.  I was not fond of scrolling through menus with it and did not like having to push it down to represent a selection.  It works though.  The volume buttons on the side are fine as well as the power slider.  "Pocket Player"  The whole point of a tiny mp3 player is so you can put it in your pocket and not have to look at it.  Therefore, these players need to be easy to use as if you were blind.  This particular player almost accomplishes this.  The only problem I had was with using the little joystick to move backward or forward a track, as it was easy to make a mistake and go the wrong direction.  Other players with dedicated buttons for backward/forward are usually simpler to operate blind.  "Audio Book Usability"  I don't normally listen to music, I do audio books instead.  One thing I loved about the Zen Nomad I've had is the way it keeps track of where I am when I pause it to turn it off.  The Zen V does not do this.  If you pause the Zen V, then shut it off, the player will restart you at the beginning of the track.  There is a way to keep you at the same place you were at: you must simply shut the player off first.  If you are currently listening to something, then turn the player off, it remembers your location.  However, when I am listening to a book, I often pause it for some reason, like to listen to someone else.  During that break, it might be 10 seconds, it might end up being 10 minutes, you never know.  The player automatically shuts itself off, and when you boot it back up you have now lost your position.  Turning it off directly is not a good way to keep your position in a book, pausing is much better.  "Screen"  Not great.  The screen has low resolution, things appear very pixelated.  I do not fault the player much for that, since I only care about being able to read the text easily.  However, it was apparent early on that the sides of the screen were getting darker quickly, which can be seen even when the unit is turned off.  Nothing is displayed on the screen unless the backlight is on.  Which means, to see what is currently playing or to look at the menu or anything, you must first push a button to make the machine think you are doing something.  I prefer if you can look at the screen at any time and tell what is playing.  Approximately three months from ownership, the screen died completely.  The player still plays music, but as I can no longer look at a menu at all to change the selection, the player is now worthless.  "Help Request"  I began a help request with creative after going through their website and doing every single thing possible on their troubleshooting pages.  The website is a major chore, as after every link you click you have to re-enter your product information, "America" "Music Player" "Zen" "Zen V Plus".  This was really annoying.  I sent a detailed amount of information when giving a description of the problem I was having, a dead screen, and 24 hours later I got a response saying that it does sound like a problem and to request an RMA, then listed possible charges that would occur.  Charges?  It is just over 3 months old and still under warranty.  Then, I loved the bottom of the email which said why don't you go buy an accessory for your player here?  Going through the website again for the RMA, they want to charge $25 for labor.  Labor?!  The thing is broken, this is a parts issue and the player has a 1 year parts warranty.  I just wanted it replaced because it broke.  I emailed my complaint about $25, they responded 24 hours later again and said that the $25 is so they can test the player out and make sure it is broken.  I understand their reasoning to an extent, however this bugs me to no end.  I went through their troubleshooting for them, I just want a replacement.  By the way, this second email referred me at the end to a handful of other products to buy as well, just to make me even angrier.  Now, I had to make a decision.  I was never pleased with the product from the start, it was not great, but I could use it.    My question was this: is this player worth $25?  I know I could not get a comparable player for $25, so it was do I want to spend $25 and still be unhappy with the product and hope that it does not die again...or spend more for something else?  I decided to go for a different brand.

<Title>Problems with Creative software
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the player itself, but the software has caused nightmares in my case. I already had another Creative MP3 player (NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra) but needed something more portable and with an FM radio. I though these two would work OK together, but the Zen V Plus software wouldn't even install properly.   Every single module to be installed on my PC raised some sort of "DoInstall failed to launch setup.inx" error message. The installation failed, and looked like it rolled back changes. But the software shows up in my Start menu - and the applications won't uninstall. On top of that, I am now unable to use the software I was using with my old player.  Worst of all, I am also now unable to uninstall other applications from my computer because this player's software screwed up something in the installer software. I contacted tech support, but have gotten no response from Creative at all.  Back to the store with this one... The player's fine, but don't get this if you're going to install two Creative products on the same PC.

<Title>Impressive. Great for audio books. One small bug.
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zen V Plus mostly for audio books and long podcasts and I'm impressed and generally happy with it. The bookmark feature for mp3 and wma is a winning feature for me which is lacking in most other players.  I find the controls easy to use but its important for a new user to take the time to read the manual that is installed from the cd. It has much more information than the paper booklet.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the fm radio works. The photo and video functions are better than I expected.  I have one issue with it. If I pause a track and then shut down, it is back at the beginning of the track when I power back on. This is mostly an issue if I pause and don't get back to it soon enough. It automatically shuts down after 5 minutes and loses its place. I can get around it by shutting down while playing instead of pausing if I don't think I'll be back in time although power off / on is not as convenient as pause / play. I think its a firmware bug that I hope will get fixed some time. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this issue.

<Title>Zen 4 GB player
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this for my daughters 15th birthday and she just loves it.  We didn't look at the size when we were looking to buy so I was surprised when it was so small ( 1/1/2 by 2 1/2 inches) but she was  happy when she opened it up and saw how small it was. The amount of gigs is perfect for a first m3p player and the battery life is longer than the nano by ipod. It is nice that skins were offered and we did purchase one.   We own a larger 30 gig Zen and have for over a 18mths and have had no problems or issues with it. This is of course what influenced us to take a look at the smaller Zen. We were happy with the specs and the comparisons we made so, when she took over our Zen we decided to buy her one.  The only comment we have with the purchase is that we found it two weeks later while browsing at our local electronics store for less regular price. ( something that has never happened with past purchases)  But we have been purchasing from Amazon for over eight years and have had only one  return (marketplace purchase) and Amazon made that easy because of their guarantee.We are always very satisfied with our purchases and can trust our online business with Amazon so we never hesitate to look here first when deciding to buy online.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After abusing two iPods to the point of death, I decided that I was ready for a new MP3 player.  From the moment I held the Zen in my hand I knew it was the MP3 player for me, interface unseen.  The form factor of the Zen V plus is just magnificent.  It feels like a perfectly formed little pebble in your hand.  The interace is easy to use and the colors are very bright (I could still make out the screen in direct sunlight from a reasonable distance).  Although the buttons are somewhat awkwardly placed, the orientation of the display can be changed in the options - try rotating it 90 degrees.  The buttons make a lot more sense like that.  The video playback, voice recording, and FM capabilities work well, although they are mostly gimmicky.  I found the audio quality to be slightly superior to an iPod, and it had no problem powering my set of Sennheiser headphones.  I can't talk enough about how durable this thing is - as I mentioned, I broke my two previous iPods fairly quickly.  I have dropped this thing on carpet, concrete, rocks, etc. and there isn't even any scratching.  I just put it in my pocket and go.  The included software is simple and straightforward, and the 4gb hard drive makes me update my music collection more often.  I certainly wouldn't go any smaller, but I don't miss having 30 gb of music I don't listen to either.  Unfortunately, Creative has followed the trend of other MP3 producers and has not included a dedicated charger, instead relying on USB 2.0, which takes roughly 4-6 hours.  If you're looking for a great music player with immensely appealing physical design with high durability and easy to use software, look no further than the Creative Zen V Plus.  Keep in mind that other hardware difficulties listed under this review refer to earlier released models like the 2 GB and the average electronics  product has a 3-5% failure rate.  I would make this purchase again without hesitation.

<Title>Solid, Small, Capable MP3 player
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen V Plus is a nifty little device that accomplishes a lot of audio tasks. It is an audio player and recording, and also displays JPEG pictures and small video files.      I found the usability of the Zen to be very good for it's size. You have to hold the "On" button for least one second to activate the player and this prevents it accidentally turning on by mistake in your pocket. The battery management is also well designed: the display dims a few seconds after you press any of the buttons. If the Zen isn't playing, it automatically turns itself after a few minutes. By virtue of these features, I found that I get hours of play before the unit needs recharging which is done by hooking up to a USB port on your computer.    Sound quality is very good: I was surprised given the Zen's small size and very light weight. In fact, the unit is so small and light, you'll want to attach the strap to prevent yourself losing it. The display is bright and readable. One thing I especially like is that Zen only plays one folder of music at a time and then stops: it doesn't keeping playing one folder after another endlessly like other players do. It's like playing only one CD or record at a time. There also is a "set bookmark" function for going back to an exact spot in a recording.    The included software works well for transferring and managing files on the Zen. While the unit is not straight Windows drag and drop, the Creative Media Explorer accomplishes the same thing. This software also rips music from CDs and is supposed to convert video files to play on the Zen but I couldn't get the latter function to work for my video clips.     The buttons on the Zen are a little on the cheap side but work well enough. There is a "lock" button that is integrated with the "On" switch: this keeps you from accidentally pushing any buttons during recordig or playback. The Zen also acts as a line-in recorder at 128 or 160 kbps recording rate, and has a built-in microphone also. Sound quality is good with line-in and decent on the microphone. I think these features alone are worth the purchase price. The Zen plays FM radio, but you can't record from it with this unit.     You can also display your favorite photos one at a time or in slide show format. The Zen also acts as a portable flash drive. To use this function you need to select from an internal menu to decide how much space to give the new data partition.     As far as "freezing-up" is concerned, my unit froze once when I first used it, possibly due to an incompatible music file that I transferred, and I was a bit miffed. This is simple enough to correct but you need a very small pin to insert in the side of the unit. This causes it to rebuild the file list which takes a few minutes. After doing this once, my unit has worked fine ever since.     The paper manual is a bit skimpy, as others have noted, but the online manual is sufficient. Holding down the "Back" button, the one with the little left-facing arrow, on the Zen shows you additional options for each function. One slightly amusing feature is that the Zen shows you messages like "shutting down" or "processing" in a separate DOS-like window superimposed on top of the main window. It's reminds you that the Zen is, in fact, a small computer. The Zen also contains a calendar and a nice-looking clock with alarm that, while not sounding a beep or buzz, turns on the audio player to a random track or the FM radio. It can do this from a completely shut-down state but you need to keep the headphones attached if you aren't looking at the display.       Overall, I like the Zen V Plus and found that it has become a constant companion for air travel and around the house for a variety of line or microphone recording uses.

<Title>Great performance; software a little flaky under Vista
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My previous player was a 30GB Nomad.  It was great for a couple years 'til I dropped it twice while jogging on the treadmill and killed the hard drive.  So I needed a player with no moving parts.  The Zen V really appealed with its 4GB, line-in recording, FM radio, and built-in mic for lo-fi speech recording.  Plus under $100 at Amazon.    I've had it for a month or two and it's performing up to expectations.  It sounds fine and the controls work pretty well--the menus work OK.  I like the tiny size (compared to Nomad).  I've also put in a bunch of photos and even some "contacts" information.  Negatives.  I initially tried to install it on my Win 2000 PC and it told me in no uncertain terms I couldn't do it.  So with some trepidation I tried it on the Vista PC.  It works pretty well.  The Media Explorer application usually locks up after I finish ripping files and I have to use the task manager to close it  Also, in Media Explorer after it finds the CD info, it puts the track names in some weird font of strange unreadable symbols.  Despite this, ripping CDs is pretty easily done.  (There's another included app that doesn't mess up the titles.)  I've had to re-boot the player one time.  Didn't lose any songs or data.  4GB ought to be enough for about 1000 songs at 128k sample rate.  I feel a little constrained since I had over 6000 on my Nomad.  But I haven't filled it up yet.  I thought $29 for a wall charger was outrageous, but charging from the USB works fine.  I bought a generic USB wall charger on eBay for $5, but it doesn't charge the unit.  Not yet sure what's up there.  Highly recommended.  Make sure your OS will run the software.

<Content>I am not very tech saavy and have never owned an MP3 player. I bought a Zune and then found out that I could not record free Overdrive audio books from the library so I sold it at a  loss. I did further research and found the Zen. It is wonderful! I have five books recorded on it and will take it with me when I go to visit my grandchildren in Texas. I used to have to carry lots of cassettes when I traveled. Since they were borrowed from the library, I was always afraid that I would lose one. This is SO much more convenient. It took me quite a while to figure out how to traverse the software and use the bookmarks, but I am improving. I also bought the adapter so that I would not run out of battery power.  It is a great invention!

<Title>Great alternative to the iPod market
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have this player and a Napster to go subscription, and simply could not be happier.  For the price of a CD a month, I have access to every new release, every week, and it is easily transferred to my Zen Plus.  Sure, I don't "own" the songs, but does it really matter?  After a month or two, I'm not interested in my old music, which is why I switched.  I got tired of having a shelf full of dusty CDs that I never listened to.  The Zen itself is small, sleek, and easy to use.  It organizes music very well, and I love the shuffle features.  FM radio is nice, but was a bit harder to figure out the tuning.  A line in feature is a really neat idea, and allows recording from almost anything.  I play this in my car with a cassette adapter, at home with a stereo cable, virtually anywhere.  My only complaint is that the power adapter should be included.  Creative products are not sold in too many places here (since iPod is so dominant), and finding accessories without going online is tough.  Charging via USB is forever, so get the adapter.  The micro adapter works just fine.

I then discovered the labor warranty is 90 days! and customer support is 60 days on the phone. Really lame. So, I had to pay $25 to return it plus shipping. They replaced it but with a 2gb unit. I tried to call but it looked like they would charge me $12.50 for the privelage so I replied to their email. Wouldn't accept an email (though they didn't say that in the email) so I made specific complaints. They responded with form email. The extended warranty is 35 bucks! which is an extra 27% over what I paid. The unit is great, but support and warranty are terrible. Buy it if you feel lucky.

<Title>First player defective, second works great!
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this product as a gift.  Within the first hour of operation, it froze up.  This should have indicated future trouble.  By the end of 2 weeks the screen burned out and freeze ups were so common that the neoprene case we ordered to protect it broke from taking it off and on so many time to reset the player.  Amazon took it back no questions asked and sent another within 2 days.  This one has worked flawlessly - not a single freeze up.  The player is a great size and is easily compatible with library audiobook downloads.  I would give it 5 stars but I think Creative may be skimpy on quality control.

<Title>The Perfect Portable Music Player
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was at first skeptical of buying a ZEN when it came time to get a serious MP3 player; I was holding out for an iPod but kept hearing negative feedback about them.  But then one of my co-workers told me about Creative's MP3 players, so I got my ZEN, and it was love at first sight (or play).  Not once have I had a single problem with my ZEN, and everyone I've talked to that owns one, too, hasn't had a problem, either.  The nice thing about the "V Plus" series is that they're small, so it's perfect for milling around the house, going out for a jog, enjoying some music at work, etc.  Plus, it's so light you can forget it's even there.  While Apple may be the power player when it comes to MP3 players, Creative is definitely there to give them a run for their money.  The only downfall to this device is that 4GB just wasn't enough for me (I have a 30GB "Vision:M" now).

<Title>Great Gidget
<Date>Sat Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is an overall great player. It has easy navigation with a small learning curve. The volume controls are on the outside which make it no hassle. It numerous features, more than other players on the market for the price. You can play music, watch videos, upload an organizer with Outlook, listen to the radio, and even record your own voice notes. I'm glad I chose this player.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I switched to this model from the 20GB Zen Sleek. Seems like a step backwards, but I'm a runner. The Sleek was heavy, & used a mini hard drive. Unfortunately, runners occasionally drop stuff and the drive packed up after a few whacks on the cement. Also, I had previously owned a Sandisk, which fell apart in a few weeks.   I picked this model because I otherwise liked the Sleek, but wanted flash memory instead. There's less memory - 4GB instead of 20 - but everything else is an advantage.  * Size is great; this tiny little unit weighs practically nothing and fits into the smallest phone pouch, yet is large enough to have a readable screen.  * Sound quality excellent, every bit as good as the larger Sleek.  * FM radio works reasonably well inside an office building.  * The joystick controls are easy to manipulate.  Compaints:  As mentioned in other reviews, charging options are limited; I'll eventually buy an external charger. Also, it has locked up twice (seems to be a characteristic of Zens); but that's easily fixed by poking the reset button with a paper clip I leave in the carrying pouch.  Overall, I'm very satisfied. This is a great little running buddy.

<Title>Tiny, smooth and extremely portable mp3 video player
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've used this mp3 player for over 8 months. It has always been pleasant to listen music or watch videos on this.   pros: Sound quality is crisp, clear.  Video quality is very high, surprisingly enjoyable even on its small screen.  Extremely protable-- light and tiny. Scratch free surface, no bag needed.  cons: The only thing is video file takes a lot of space as creative has its own format, which is cumbersome.  But overall, I love it.

<Title>Maybe I just got a bad one...
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me just say that I wanted to love this player.  I'm a big fan of Creative and aside from the Zune, I don't think that there's a better Ipod alternative out there.  My Zen Microphoto took numerous bang-ups and drops and still works perfectly.  It now belongs to my brother. With the Zen V Plus, I was expecting pure awesomeness but my disappointment started when I took it out of the box.  Yeah, it's light and I'm sure there are people who love that sort of thing for jogging and whatever, but still being used to the Microphoto, I like a little weight and a solid feel.  The disappointment worsened when I tried out the thumb stick, which had a slightly cheap feel to it.  Not cool.  However, I thought I'd be able to live with this as long as the sound quality was good.  It was.  It's also the only reason that it gets a three star rating from me.  That, and I still think it has a cool look to it.   Once I got everything set up, I got to where I half-way liked the thing and had even gotten used to the stupid thumb stick.  So, I was on my to thinking that I had actually made a good purchase until the next day when, when scrolling throught the menu, it completely froze up.  Not sure what caused it, but none of the buttons would respond.  In fact, the power was still on when I took it back later that day.  Needless to say, I was just a little disappointed.    Now I won't go so far as saying that Creative has a bad product. Who knows? Maybe I just got a lemon.  A certain website gave this player a 8.3 review and even gave it the "Editor's Choice Award".  This is part of the reason that I decided on getting one in the first place. There are also plenty of other reviewers here who seem totally happy with it. Anyway, this bad experience with Creatice has not changed my opinion of the company. I still think their Microphoto is one of the best mp3 players ever designed and their Zen Vision M just flat-out rocks.  I'm also looking forward to their newly designed "Zen". I'm just a little leary of getting another Zen V Plus. Anyway, enough with my rambling.  If you're still considering a 4gig player and want something a little bit different than the nano, give this one a shot.  But hang on to your receipt, just in case.

<Title>Be careful it's compatiable
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this item for my very tech savy son. He downloaded the software onto his computer, which has Windows Vista, and Windows Media player 11. After several attempts he was never able to put any music on the thing. The product registration still won't go away from the screen of the computer after removing the software. I sent it back and bought the more expensive but more familiar ipod. He's not had any problem with the ipod. I don't know why the Zen didn't work. But I am grateful that Amazon took the Zen back and refunded the full purchase price. I give them 5 stars for that!

<Title>a decent little player
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine because of a special Amazon/Audible promotion which led to it costing me only $9 or so. Heh. Even though I got this baby on the cheap, I do have some dissatisfaction with it. Overall, though, I like it a whole lot.  Pluses: 1) It's small and easy on the eyes. I've had people commenting on what a neat looking little mp3 player it is, and I'd have to agree. 2) Even without the Amazon promotion, the price is very reasonable for a 4GB player with an  FM radio (note this is a Creative Zen V Plus--the "plus" tells you this one has the radio). 3) The sound is excellent. I listen mostly to classic rock and folk, and while I had to set the EQ to my own preferences, the sound has been outstanding. 4)It has line-in capability, which means you can record directly from your cd player, thus ending the whole rip/sync thing that can drive you totally bonkers. 5) It also has an organizer which I haven't fully used yet, but which I am about to get set up this weekend. 6) It's pretty easy to load up with music and audio recordings. Thus far, I've got about 280 songs on it and one full-length audio book, and I've got about 2.2GB left to go.  Minuses: 1) Charging by USB--argh!!!!! I hate having to do this unless I buy a special charger. Grrr. Charging by USB takes a good long time, and I hate having to hook it up that way. 2) It does NOT get the battery life indicated in all its ads. Not even close. I've gotten 6 hours from a full charge thus far. That's the max. Isn't that sad? Yes. It is. 3) Good god. The cd that comes with it? You have to install it before ever using this player, and that one cd comes with so many programs that you'll be mind-blown installing them all and going through all you have to go through before even CHARGING your player. Geez. Let's see if I can remember them all. . .oh, yeah. The Audible program (which you will likely find useless, as it is not the most current version, and you will suffer greatly trying to get it to load an audio book on your Zen V Plus unless you uninstall it and install the most current version); the Zen Media Explorer (not a problem, but still--one more program to install); the ZenCast program; the Yahoo Music Store program; the MyZen program. I'm sorry--that's just too dang much. I just want to drag and drop or sync easily. I don't want to have to install all this STUFF that just slows my computer down.  4) The lack of support is just horrible. For example, I want to find out how to get the clock on my player to JUST FREAKING DISPLAY THE RIGHT TIME. Ahem. Well, where do I find that info? It's not in the guide book. It's not in any of the bazillion programs I just mentioned above. Do I have to go to the website? If so, that's one MORE hassle. Sheesh. Right now, my  Zen's clock is 6 hours ahead of real time. It's wreaking havoc with my ability to function, I tell you! ;-) 5) The on button, located on the left side of the player, is also the lock button. You slide up to lock, down to turn on or off. Well, if you've locked the player, you need to slide that little bar down to unlock, but if you go just a scooch too far, you turn off the beastie. Arg! I can't tell you how many times I've turned the unit off without meaning to. 6) I could  use something other than the joystick to move about. Either I have mutation-size thumbs, or that joystick is not user-friendly. Probably the latter, as it can't possibly be my thumbs that are at fault.  I bought this baby to replace my Sansa 1GB player, and I like some of the features of the Sansa better, but this one is nice as well. I must admit I'm liking it a lot, in spite of its flaws.

<Content>My wife and I both bought a Zen device.  we liked them for the first 3 months.  Then, within weeks, the headphone jack of both of the players shorted out. I tried to contact customer service but after spending hours trying to reach them through the internet, through their call-in numbers, and even by mail, I could reach no customer service person nor get anything but an automated response with help topics that had nothing to do with my problem. I was very disappointed.

<Content>I agree with all the other positive comments about this player.  The only thing I would caution someone about is the little "joystick" that is used to navigate.  Over time it will most likely wear out because I had a another similar product and the same type of "joystick" navigator wore out.  Other than that this is a good buy for the money and it is very easy to use.

<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Operation and menues are very easy. Intuitive setup. Additional features -- movies, radio options are fantastic. Haven't tried sound recording and ripping audio. When installing creative software, don't really need all software installed -- I skipped audiable and few other free software packages.    Many folks out there, keep mp3s in high definition recordings.  Frankly, unless you're an extreme audiophile, anything over 128 bits is excessive thus you might be taking up 2-3X of space required. Zen software has a feature to optimize/compress mp3 during upload.  Give it a try -- might save you lots of space.  Don't forget to sign up for some podcasting.

<Content>I happen to love this mp3 player - it was so easy to use and navigate that my 10 year old figured everything out without even reading the instructions.  It DOES NOT take six hours to fully charge, in fact, out of the box it only took about 2 - 2 1/2 hours to charge. It was so easy to transfer songs, pictures and videos..... I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an mp3 player.

<Title>pay for the 2 year replacement plan -- you'll probably use it
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After less than a year of , admittedly, frequent use the display of my Zen V Plus dimmed, then became orange only and finally disappeared.  Resetting and charging had no effect.   After searching the internet I found that others have had the same problem with the Zen V Plus and had to purchase new players.  I hadn't purchased the available 2 year replacement plan and so was left with the, then useless, 90-day protection coming with the player.  I have since purchased another Zen V Plus but was careful to purchase the replacement plan this time.  I would have tried a different company's MP3 player, but compatability with the Overdrive audiobooks available from my public library is important to me and I'm now used to the Zen V Plus's idiosyncracies.  The sound quality is fine although there is a slightly tinny undertone.  It's possible that the slight tinniness is a  function of the original recordings rather than the player.  When the player is started after having shutdown, play resumes with the beginning of the track being played when play was stopped -- not at the precise point at which play was stopped.  Fast forwarding to the point of the previous stop isn't difficult.  However, fast forwarding sometimes makes the player freeze -- at which point the player must be reset.  There is a bookmark function which allows resumption of play at the precise point of the previous stop.  However, when one uses this function, play stops at the end of the track rather than continuing to the next track. Perhaps one can change settings to avoid this problem; I haven't researched this issue extensively. Other customer reviews have suggested that resetting is difficult.  I've found resetting to be easy as long as I use the end of an uncoated paperclip rather than a sharp-ended pin.

<Content>This player is great! Excellent features. Easy to read screen. Very bright.   Easy to use menu system. Can customize to put your commonly used commands on the top menu.  Excellent sound quality. Includes equalizer so you can make any set of headphones work well.  Software interface to rip CDs was extremely easy to use.  I have read some complaints in other reviews that the joystick was hard to use if you have 'fat' fingers. I do NOT agree. Both my wife (long fingernails, skinny fingers) and I (short fingernails, 'fat' fingers) had no trouble using the joystick to navigate.  The player is smaller height and width than iPODs, which I liked because they fit places better. Although the iPOD is a bit skinnier than this one.  The player also shows jpegs and video well.  It has frozen up a couple of times since I've had it (about six months), but after hitting the reset button (which you need a small paper clip to engage btw - a pen or pencil don't work) all was fine again.  Overall, highly recommend this player to anyone!!

<Content>I bought this product before reading the reviews and ran into some of the same problems that others faced. After about a week my player froze and I had to return it. I got a replacement but because I was out of the country I was unable to return the defective one in time. I had to pay for both and now I am stuck with two. Fortunately for me the original one started working again after the battery went flat and was recharged so I am going to give that away and hope that it continues to work. As a plus though, it has a very good sound when it funtions properly, could have gotten a higher rating from me if I did not have that bad experience.

<Title>First Impressions...
<Date>Sun Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Shiny, feather-light, slicky, and smaller than any picture could show...it's just larger than a Zippo. Clear and logical navigation. The included buds are respectable, but when really "listening" I use Bose noise-cancellers- remember: great speakers make great sound. I recommend against dropping this player.  I have a video camera with a 5-way joystick, and while this one is tiny for sure, I find it easy to manipulate with the proper subtle touch; same for avoiding turning off the power when unlocking. While this thing is clearly not meant to be beaten, it has behaved as the manual describes. All controls respond promptly at this point.   The inital software install is quick - the inital charging wasn't - a pop-up window noticed I didn't have a "high-speed" USB port. It took 5 hours; I wanted to be sure I let it fully charge the first time out of the box- arrived in good condition, direct from amazon.  Charge time allowed me to familiarize myself w/ the quick-start user guide; the brass tacks are on the accompanying CD (launching the CD after-the-fact looks like it's installing again, but around step 3/4 it offers the User Guide).  Fully charged, I was able to easily navigate the "Zen explorer" program to "auto-fill", from my library, a list of audio tracks to load to the device. I de-selected the groove offenders from the copious list it compiled, and arrived at 167 songs. About 15 minutes and 25% of total storage later, I was rocking. Great loading speed, all tracks clean thus far.  My primary use for this device is music, but I like the photo and video possibilities included - and we'll see how the FM radio performs. Good personalization options onboard.   While I thought the personal empowerment of MP3 was to free one from bad radio in remote places, it's ironic that I find that option on the Zen V Plus to be attractive. The sound and graphic EQ are spankin; REALLY like it so far. Stay tuned...

<Content>I read many reviews and did a great deal of research before choosing this over the new Apple product.  Both my husband and I are very technical people and this thing died after less than an hour last night.  We spent hours online with tech support and help forums to no avail.  What a complete waste of time and money - it is going back to Dell where I had some points to use from American Express.  Thanks to Dell's policy - I am out $100 worth of certificates because I am returning the items.  There is a reason that I am writing this review on a Gateway laptop and not on a Dell, they stink.... Say what you want about Apple, but my baby ipod worked right out of the box and has not failed me yet - it has been on airplanes, on vacation, worn on motorcycle trips of great duration.  That little thing just works - no matter what - it has been running with me, it has been dropped many times... live and learn - no more Dell purchases for me EVER... lesson learned and passed on here.

I would suggest buying the "skin case," to protect it and no finger prints, the ear phones not very comfortable and they can fall out, the protective screen shield that came with the skin case, does not work at all, its a nice idea however you get air trapped between the MP3 screen and the protective screen and you get nasty air bubbles can't get rid of them.  I would suggest this product it is really good quality and price.

<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this Player after my older zen died. The headphone jack went and it was useless because you would never be able to listen to it.   When I got the player I thought it was a joke. I could not belive the size of it. I was appalled. After getting used to it the size was the least of my worries.   There are so many programs that come with the thing and I dont even use them to put music on the player. I am thankful that my dad tought me how to transfer music from folders to the player because otherwise I would not have music on it. The older zen was so easy to get music on and off. I was disappointed about that.   I bought a case for it. The case would not let me go back. It was stuck or something. I didnt want it to get damaged so I left the case on. If I tried to go back to the main menu it would pause my songs.  I own the 4GB one. For some reason now I cant not put more than 100 songs on the player. It will put the letters A-G (artist) then T-Z. It will not let me put any of the other files that I have. I took everything off then re-put them on and it tells me that there is a system problem and it has to be aborted. I could add 1 song or 100 it says there is a problem.  I purchased this player because I didnt want to splurge on an Ipod and they usually have more problems. This player I have mixed feelings about.   I loved the size and the whole joystick thing. I loved the black appearance. I also loved that I could add photos and use them as my background. I think that is a great feature. I also love the different styles on the player. My battery life is great. And It does not take 6 hours to charge. It takes much less time than that. I have not expierenced the freezing or anything(I had that problem with my old player). I wish there were better cases for the player. Overall I have mixed feelings about it. Im going to try to get all my music on here again and if I cant get the tracks on there Im going to have to rely on something else.   I love creative products thats why I bought this but I just cant go either way on it. Im right in the middle.

<Title>Don't Buy This!
<Date>Thu Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Update:   The player freezes with no sound and with the screen on (displaying album artwork), at random times and for no apparent reason. One of my two units had to be reset so many times that it can no longer be reset: it feels like that internal pad you press on with a sharp pin has now disappeared (it must have broken off). Our only recourse now is to wait 3 days for the battery to run dead, and hope that it will be reset simply by recharging it from scratch. We've only had this unit since August (it's now December), so I no longer feel the reliability level of this product is sufficient to justify its purchase. Buy something else that doesn't have to be reset all the time!     I bought the 2 GB model because the 4 GB version wasn't available yet and it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs. The 4 GB version is identical except for the amount of installed flash memory. This is the V Plus version, so it sports an FM tuner and the ability to display videos as a bonus.  Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.   I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.   At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.   The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.   This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.   Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.   The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.   The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.   I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.   The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.   Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.   Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.   It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.   If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.   You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.   Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.

<Title>REVISED: this mp3 player makes little sense, functions are IMPRACTICAL, MAJOR HASSLES. 1 STAR.
<Date>Sun Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recently purchased this item and have owned it for one day. I will list the type of features I look for and then the good and the bad of this mp3 device in order below. By the way, this player has frozen on me once so far (reset was successful).  Background Info: I've owned at least 7 different mp3 players since 2001, including this Zen V Plus 4GB. If you are like me,  you are looking for a simple mp3 player that will seamlessly interface with your computer (via Windows Explorer), has SPECTACULAR audio quality, and has a few cool features like voice recorder and FM radio. I strongly prefer NOT to install proprietary software included with the mp3 players I purchase, and would like the simplicity of simple drag-and-drop from one folder to the mp3 player's music folder and vice versa. I got this to replace my iAudio U2 1GB mp3 player (an excellent player in all aspects) and have found that the only real advantage that this player has over the prior is capacity (4gb vs. 1gb). Now for the good and bad below.  GOOD: 1. CAPACITY & STORAGE TYPE: This player holds 4GB of FLASH memory. Typically, this would mean that it consumes less battery life, resulting in longer hours of music enjoyment due to the storage type. 4GB is usually acceptable for holding between 800 to 1,000 songs. (The box advertises 2,000 songs, which is just false advertising unless all your songs are 64/92kbps. If they are, stop reading this review now.) 2. PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS & CONTROLS: This player's size and shape is EXCELLENT. It is very well-designed, no sharp corners, very compact and feels fairly robust. The tactile-controls are great and easy to manage, with the volume controls on the side. The navigational nub is also very responsive. 3. SOUND QUALITY: For audiophiles out there, this is a great mp3 player. The sound quality is great, which you would come to expect from a company like Creative that has been working in digital audio technology since the days of the original Sound Blaster card. 4. DISPLAY & OTHER FEATURES: The display is clear, brightly lit, and shows the necessary information well. The other features, such as FM radio, voice recorder, etc. work well.  BAD: 1. FILE MANAGEMENT: As with my interim MP3 player that I used before this (Zen MicroPhoto 8GB), I initially connected it to my PC in hopes of being able to use only Windows Explorer to manage my mp3 files. This is very limiting because a)I wasn't able to play mp3s from my Zen V Plus via PC application like Winamp, b)files aren't arranged by filename, but rather by Album Title(?!?!?), and c)deleting or copying files takes EXTREMELY LONG (especially deleting). So in other words, you are forced to use their proprietary software.  2. TRANSFER SPEEDS: Transfer speeds on this mp3 player are abysmal. It took about 25 minutes to transfer 2 gigs of audio files.  3. BUNDLED SOFTWARE: Adequate, but could be much better.  4. RECHARGING & BATTERY LIFE: It takes 6 hours to recharge the battery. 6 HOURS! When I had my previous iAudio mp3 player charging via USB, it took less than an hour to fully charge. Seriously, it should not take 6 HOURS to charge an mp3 player that has a battery life of 20 hours.  5. PLAYING FILES IN ORDER: Unless you create a custom playlist(s), the songs will play in alphabetical order of ALBUM! WHY?!?!? It should be in order of ARTIST! What were Creative's engineers thinking???  CONCLUSION: The mp3 player is great in terms of sound, navigation, it has enough features to satisfy most users, it is sturdy, and it looks nice. However, file transfer speeds are slow, file management via Windows Explorer and even the Creative software is poor, and the time to recharge the battery is way too long. If you are the type who likes to add music at least once or twice a week to your mp3 player, and you want to transfer files quickly and easily & spend less time having your mp3 player connected to your PC for recharging, then this is NOT what you are looking for. I see myself using this, until maybe iAudio comes out with an 8GB flash-based mp3 player. As for now...*sigh*, this will have to do.  _____________________________________________  ADD-ON TO REVIEW (10/17/06): Hi, just want to add a few more notes on this review. In the manual, there is a warning that reads, "the cord(s) included with this product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling." Hmm...so I guess if you're pregnant, or want to avoid cancer altogether, this may deter you from purchasing this mp3 player. Another thing, you can't delete songs/files directly using just the mp3 player. You have to delete from a connected PC. Though the mp3 player menu has a "remove" option, it will only remove the song/file from the list, but the file will STILL OCCUPY SPACE on the mp3 player. And when I use the Creative software, there is nothing that indicates which files are "removed" and which files aren't. One last thing: when you are in the middle of an audio file, and let's say you pause, walk away for a few minutes, and come back to find that it's turned itself off (to conserve battery life; shutdown from idle time can be configured), the mp3 file doesn't resume from the place it was paused. It will only start BACK FROM THE BEGINNING. This is a major problem, particularly if you listen to hour-long podcasts or really long audio tracks. Even when I go into menu mode, and accidently go into voice record,fm radio, or line-in record mode, it will stop the audio and you'll have to start back from the beginning again! The chances that I will return this product now? 99.9% (I bring my review down to 1.5 stars)

<Title>Small,sleek, not too cute, not too dull...
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>In summary why I picked Zen V Plus: -Good price/performance -FM radio and voice recorder -Small, scratch resistant and cool design -Drag and drop capability -Compability with different music stores -Very easy and quick navigation -Previous positive experience  If you want a more detailed comparison to IPOD-Nano and Sandisk Sansa C200 series, continue reading and scroll down, if not stop here and get back to what you were doing, or want to do or whatever... :-)   First off, this is my second Creative product in less than a year. No, no the old one is still good (ZEN Nano Plus) indeed the best one I've ever had, but I decided to go with something with color and a more navigation-friendly menu. I am not new to digital music.I've had a pleuthora of MP3 players within the last 5 years. Starting with a 32MB RCA (terrible), a 128MB Samsung (Good), a HD based Dell DJ(died on me,) two 6GB Apple Minis (one's Hard drive died, the other's click-wheel gave up), a Zen Nano Plus (excellent) and now this cool 4 GB Zen V-Plus. Before deciding on my new ZEN, I had two other serious considerations :  1) IPOD NANO - 4GB or 6GB : Although I really loved the look and the price (not much above its competition)of the new IPOD NANO, I could not go with it because of previous (baaaad) experience and the required slavery to it's ITUNES software. It just is a pain in the neck when using my own MP3s (non i-tunes songs) and other music stores' products. Plus it did not have FM and voice recording, which are, I admit, pretty cool features.   2)Sandisk Sansa E250 (4GB) or E270 (6GB): This was my clear favourite before actually going into a store and physically feeling it. Sandisk is the lead flash card memory manufacturer and its memories are really hi-Q.That and its clearly lowest price among peers made me consider this one more seriously. It had the voice recording and FM radio options and did not have the dreaded mandatory music software. Had even a bigger screen (1.8 inches) than Zen V Plus (1.5 inches). So why did Sandisk got eliminated? Easy:   i)Extremely hard to use click-wheel, even if one has small hands (I don't,I am 6'2" and 200lbs, so in my case a total "forget it"). The wheel is elevated from the surface very little, you accidentally hit other buttons while trying to operate.  ii)Overall size and design. Sandisk looks like a fatter and less slick IPOD Nano. It does not have the different (shorter,squarer, more compact) feel of the Zen V Plus.Bottom line it is bigger and bulkier than both.  iii)Icon based menu.That is a total no go for a small screen gadget. Just stick to line-based menu like all the previous and current IPods if your screen is less than 3 inches accross. So, cheaper, equipped with features like the Zen V Plus, with a bigger screen and comparable battery life, The Sandisk Sansa still got eliminated.  After a month, what do I think about my Zen V Plus (4GB)? PROS: -Great size, look and feel. -Great, optional very easy to use Creative software. -100% Drag and drop compatible. -Vibrant colors. -Easy to navigate menu. -Easy to use joystick and buttons (except one, see below in CONS) -Decent battery life. -Great FM receiver. -Price  CONS -Hard to see the screen (OLED's curse) under direct sunlight. -Charging through USB (the only supplied cable) takes forever. -The placement of the "back" button. It should be on the left of the "play/pause" button not below. When the unit is in your palm unless you have a hyperextending thumb, it is hard to press this button - though possible. -Screen is not big enough for video viewing. Although video playback is seamless and vibrant, the size is just too small.Don't let the video capability be a deciding factor if you are inclined.

<Title>Nice player...almost perfect.
<Date>Tue Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player a month ago.  I saw the new Nano's and was about to buy one.  I played with Itunes for a week and confirmed, that an Ipod wasn't for me.  I went to Amazon to see what Creative had that was comparable to the Nano.  I found the Zen V Plus.  I found it to be very versitile it did the things I do with a Mini Disc player but smaller and video.  I don't like Sony's DRM so I rip in WMA. The fact that I could transfer 10x faster  than Sony Mp3 player or Mini Disc and drop and drag kept me from returning it.  The sound is tailorable but not great; but still very good for a Mp3 player. The video sucks; with my Palm pilot video files compress to small file sizes for playback not so with the Zen it uncompress so a file that takes up 75MB on a Palm pilot takes up 450MB on the Zen. In short not for video and the screen is pretty darn small.  I will agree with other reviews on the plus and will not mention them so not to be redunant but I will point the the navigation/Music Mangement could be better.  Findings songs can take some time if you have alot of songs on the Zen.  If you want to listen to a group/artist/album that is all you listen to.  Unlike other players once the album/group is over it will switch to another group/album, not so with the Zen.  This something that could be improved on.  For the most part the Zen V is very small and doesn't scratch or ding up like pervious players I own.  As a Electrician and the player doesn't get in my way when I work.  I still haven't got use to the 14-16 hour battery life and the 6 hour charge time.  Sony devices charge within 2-3 hours and last for 25-50 hours on a single charge.  The Zen in short is a hassle-free device and would highly recomend this unit to anyone.

<Content>Originally, I had purchased the ipod nano, but had it for one day and after numerous problems, took it back and exchanged it for a Creative Zen V Plus. I couldn't be happier. My first mp3 player was a Creative also, but when I decided to buy a new one, I wanted pizazz and lots of accessories, and the ipod did those things for me. The ipod is a waste of money, whereas the Creative Zen V Plus has so much more to offer at a lesser price. Stick with a Creative, you don't be disappointed.

<Title>Tiny, tough and almost perfect
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player really deserves 4 1/2 stars. I bought one of these to replace a Sansa e260 that I had returned because of disappointing sound quality. The Zen V Plus did not disappoint. Sound quality is excellent, with punchy bass, good volume and no noticeable system noise during playback.   The form factor for the Zen V is terrific. The tiny size and curved shape make this comfortable to hold in your hand or slip in your pocket. And despite its all-plastic construction, it seems as if the Zen V can stand up to some abuse. I've found that it also does not scratch as easily as my previous player, the result of a scratch-resistant polymer coating. I plan to take this player running, camping, to the gym, etc., and don't feel like I'll need to "baby" it.  The interface is what you'd expect from Creative: simple, intuitive and powerful. There are many options for customizing, including choosing main menu options to display, setting photos as wallpaper and rotating display orientation -- and corresponding controls -- in 90-degree increments, so you don't have to strain your neck to read the display when your player is strapped to your arm. I feel like Creative spent some time figuring out what real users would want in a player. Also, despite its small size, the five-position joystick is easy to use and works well in combination with the interface.   Of course, the Zen V Plus also has a boatload of other features that you may or may not care for depending on your needs: FM radio with 32 presets, voice recorder, line-recording and PIM functionality (you can sync your calendar, contacts and tasks with MS Outlook).  I can really only come up with two negatives for the Zen V Plus. One is battery life, which at 15 hours (less if you use a lot of EQ) is on the low end of the scale compared to some of the newer players. If you plan on taking this on long trips, I suggest getting an AC wall charger. (Hint: the bargain-priced charger for the Zen Micro works just fine with this unit.)   The other possible drawback is the OLED screen, which is small, has lower resolution than most LCD screens and is difficult to see in bright sunlight. On the other hand, if you're buying this primarily as a music player and not a multimedia device, the screen is more than adequate. It is quite vibrant (the colors really pop) and does a decent enough job with photos.  Some also might be disappointed that this device is not true UMS (although you can partition the memory for storage). I run Win XP and am the sole user of the device, so having an MTP player is no big deal for me. I have my music organized by folders, which I drag and drop onto the player using Creative's Media Explorer. (Note: like the Sansa and some other players out there, the Zen V uses ID3 tags to categorize music and display file properties, so it pays to make sure your tags are cleaned up and correct.)  The Good:  Excellent sound, with no system noise Convenient size and form factor Simple, but powerful interface  The Not So Good  Small, low-resolution screen Battery life could be better

<Title>Frustrating launch- A+ after it is connected

<Content>I am updating my review, this is a 4 star product.  I had fits making it talk to the computer.  Creative support did in fact have a solution and walked me through issues with XP and USB permissions.  It took hours but it eventually communicated.  Great product once you get it going.  My daughter is thrilled.  My original Christmas day tantrum review: "Christmas gift for my Daughter.  Software will not communicate with the Zen.  We own a Zen Micro and have enjoyed it for two years.  This Zen V Plus won't talk to the computer after following the installation instructions explicitly.  Web site support is no help.  Hours wasted.  Save your time and money go to another product."
