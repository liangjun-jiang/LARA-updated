<Title>Sansa Clip 2GB - Great MP3 Value and Performance!
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>  The Sandisk Sansa Clip 2GB is a great value MP3 player.  It has twice the capacity as the iPod Shuffle for about $50-60.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can get the 1GB version for $35.  Pros -  + good sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner (20 Presets) + voice recording   + nice design with more color options + Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via software + 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Clip Plus + Integrated Clip means no add-on case / lanyard purchase needed!  Cons  - larger body than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  The new Sandisk Sansa Clip has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the compatibility, feature, and price benefits of other MP3 players.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.    The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced VERY well for the holidays.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.  The rechargable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The earbuds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only time will tell; so far it's holding up nicely.  I definitely recommend the larger 2GB option. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa, Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQJ19S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-9379263-7733201">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    Overall, an awesome starter unit that deserves a try.

<Title>Great MP3 player for 1st time owners
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I researched MP3 players for a few weeks and decided on the Clip to start out with.  As most have already stated (see other 2 GB Clip reviews), this is a great little MP3 player, and cute too!  It's my first MP3 player, which I found very easy to use.  I've had it for 2 weeks now, no problems (after firmware update).  My Clip is mainly used for audio books from NetLibrary and OverDrive, along with NPR podcasts.  Overall, it does what it's supposed to do at a very affordable price.    The two downsides: - No bookmarking, which would be very beneficial for NetLibrary, since their audiobooks aren't broken down into parts. - The screen is legible, but somewhat hard to read unless you hold it up close.  It works well in the car if you have an auxiliary plug-in.  I'd suggest replacing the included earphones, they aren't very comfortable, but I  expected that.

<Title>Great little MP3 player
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this for my 7yr old daughter and she loves it. Loading music was a simple drag and drop and she was able to figure out the controls by herself in a couple minutes. She carries it everywhere now and jams out. The sound quality is very good for such a little player and can be further adjusted with a built in EQ. Even the FM radio is good. An excellent buy!

<Title>Sansa Rocks!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Why anyone would want to pay the extra bucks for an IPod is beyond my comprehension.  If you don't want video, this is the MP3 player for you.  The sound is awesome.  I chose the Clip over the Creative Stone because the display is easier to read and you can record directly from the radio.  The only problem I encoutered was having to update the firmware.  Once that was done it's been rockin' on.  Even the earbuds provided weren't bad, but I did upgrade to a better set of headphones.  This is the second Sansa player I've gotten, and their both great.  The first one was for my daughter, but this one is MINE.

<Title>Great little guy!
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this little pink guy.  The battery power seems strong;  I've only charged it a couple of times.  The ear buds are not very good, but you can use whichever headphones you like, obviously. The controls are easier to use than iPod controls, in my opinion.  Easy to turn volume up and down and easy to lock.  The clip is also really convenient.   Ever so cute.  Everyone I've showed it to thinks its tiny size is adorable. I recommend this player for the price!
