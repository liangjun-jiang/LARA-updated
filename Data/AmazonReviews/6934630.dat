<Title>Handy little thing
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>At first it was kind of annoying that all of my wouldn't transfer without copying it to a disk. But once I got the hang of it, it went smoothly.  There are cool features such a "time machine shuffle" which shuffles songs according to the year they were produced.  It holds videos and tons of songs.  I don't particularly like napster but I get by it by using rhapsody.  I have no complaints!

<Title>Wow! IPod who?
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What an awesome player!!  I just got my 8gig. I upgraded the headphones to the Sony High Performance earbuds (I have only found them at Best Buy)and they cost $43 but are well worth it.  My live songs sound like I am truly at the concert and the bass is bone rattling. By the way, you do not have to use the Windows Media Player.  I found the RealPlayer alot easier to use and had absolutely no problem transferring files whatsoever.  This is especially important if you have music from file sharing.  Windows Media Player does NOT recognize most of these files and Real Player does.

<Title>Read it and weep, Apple.
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>PROS:  Outperforms iPod Nano in every important respect, for 25% less $$.  CONS:  Not compatible with iTunes; overpriced accessories.  With the introduction of their NWZ-S600 "Walkman" line of digital media players, Sony hasn't exactly put a man on the moon, but they sure have stolen Apple's thunder. All you people out there (like me) who have thus far resisted succumbing to Apple's iPod "siren song" (and all of the company's manufacturer-exclusive marketing tactics that ALWAYS end up delivering inferior components/performance to the consumer, at a higher cost) your patience has been rewarded by Sony. This digital media player simply kicks a** on its closest competitor, the iPod Nano.   PRICE:   The 4GB Nano is currently retailing for $150, or more. I just got my 4GB Walkman for $110. That's a 25% savings folks, for what I view as a superior player.   MEMORY/COLORS:   This line of Walkmans currently comes in 2GB, 4GB and 8GB memory configurations, and your choice of four colors: black, silver, red or pink. As with the iPod Nano, the memory is "flash" based, which means no internal drive or moving parts, and thus, greatly increased battery life (addressed further below). If you like to watch video on portable devices like this, you should probably go for the 8GB version, as video files tend to consume a lot of memory, and the operating system for the device consumes a little less than one-half of a GB, leaving you with about 3.6 usable GB in the 4GB player. Sony rates the player as being capable of holding "up to" 15 hours of video or 2,450 songs, but those ratings are going to vary substantially depending on the content and compression rates used in the video/music files you're transferring into the player. In short, this player will store more music than most people would listen to in a month, but if you plan to watch a lot of video on this player, you better step up to the 8GB version ... you'll need the extra memory.   BATTERY LIFE:   Like the Nano, the Walkman uses an internal rechargeable lithium-ion battery, but it must be larger and/or more efficient than the battery used in the Nano, because battery life is probably the most noteworthy difference between the Walkman and the Nano. The Nano is rated for "up to" 5 hours for video playback, and 24 hours for audio playback. The Walkman, on the other hand, is rated for up to 9.5 hours for video playback and 33 hours for audio. Again ... wow. Both the Nano and the Walkman will be fully recharged after only 3 hours on your computer's USB port.   SOUND QUALITY/MUSIC PLAYBACK:   I've listened to both the Nano and the Walkman pretty carefully, and I believe the sound quality of the Walkman is far superior to that of the Nano. I find the "earbud" style of headphones pretty uncomfortable, so I generally don't use them, but if you like earbuds, the earbuds supplied with the Walkman sound really great, and are especially surprising at the bass end. There's far more bass present in them than I can ever remember hearing in any other earbuds I've tried. In addition, the Walkman has a number of audio enhancement features that you can tinker with to make your music sound the way you like it, including a pristine 5-band graphic EQ (with not one, but two user-definable presets) and three advanced audio processing features called "DSEE," "Clear Stereo," and "Clear Bass."   The Walkman plays the most common compressed audio file formats, including .mp3, .wma and .wav. The song title shows up on the screen, you push the "play" button, and you're good to go. Depending on the amount of tag information appearing with the file, you can easily scroll through and pull up files by artist, album, alphabetical title listing ... whatever works for you. You can also create customized playlists in Windows Media Player 11 that you can transfer into your Walkman (more on that below).   On a CD included with the player, Sony also provides software that will allow you to convert any Sony "ATRAC" files you might have kicking around your computer into a file format that the Walkman will play.   Like all other non-Apple digital music players, the Walkman will not "synch" with iTunes or transfer/play music files downloaded via iTunes, because, in typical fashion, Apple formats iTunes downloads so that the only portable digital music player you can use to directly transfer files purchased there is ... you guessed it ... an iPod. I won't bother telling you my feelings about being asked to pay $1.00 for download of ONE SONG, and then being told by the company I just bought it from that I have to also buy their overpriced, underperforming digital music player if I want to listen to the song I just paid for anywhere other than at my computer station. Well, maybe I just DID tell you my feelings about that ...   You can avoid this problem by making your online music purchases through another vendor, like Napster.   VIDEO QUALITY:   The video screen on this thing is a 1.8 inch high res GVGA TFT color display. It's small, but it is sharp and bright, at 240 x 320 pixels. The screen will knock your socks off. Using the trial version of a third party video compression software I found on the Internet, I compressed a little piece of "Gladiator" and loaded it into the player just to see how it would look and sound, and it was, in a word ... awesome. Every minute detail seen in the film was clearly visible on this little screen, the playback was flawless, and the accompanying audio was fantastic. Unlike the screen on the Nano (which is square), the screen on the Walkman is rectangular, and you can change the video layout from vertical to horizontal and tip the player to one side or the other, so you can easily view movies in their original "letterbox" aspect ratio. That is SO COOL!   Video compression is a bit too complicated a subject to discuss in any detail in this review, but this Walkman plays .mp4 video files, with AAC audio. Once you find suitable software for conversion of your DVDs into this format, and use your computer to convert your DVDs (a pretty time-consuming and CPU-intensive process), you'll be able to easily transfer the resulting files into your Walkman and watch all your favorite DVD movies/shows on your player. Of course, you will also be able to transfer and play any shows or movies that were pre-formatted when you downloaded them.   It will also store and display gazillions of photos, in .jpg format, if you want to use the player for that function.   The various system menu items are well-designed and easy to read on the video display. Scrolling through the various menu functions is a breeze, which brings me to the operating controls.   SIZE/CONTROLS:   The Walkman is about the size and weight of a cigarette lighter, measuring about 3" x 1.75" x 3/8." It will fit easily in the smallest hand, with easy, one-hand access to the front control panel.   The front control panel consists of a play/pause key in the middle, surrounded by right/left/up/down touch pads, that are very easy to use. The unit turns on and off by holding down the multi-function "Option" button at the upper right of the control panel, and the "Back" button at the upper left of the control panel allows you to easily back up through all menu options to return to the "main menu," which is the menu shown on the video screen in Sony's stock photo of the player. The volume is controlled with a +/- toggle located on the top right edge of the player, and there's a sliding "hold" switch on top left edge. You use the "hold" switch to ensure that you don't inadvertently turn the player on or off while carrying it in your pocket. These controls are also easy to locate and use. As with Microsoft Windows, there's generally two or three different ways to make the controls do what you want, so you don't have to be a tech genius to familiarize yourself with all the player's features, and be able to use them within a very short period of time.   I personally prefer these types of controls to the touch-sensitive controls used in the Nano ... fewer unintended control changes.   USB INTERFACE:   The Walkman connects to your computer via a USB cable provided with the player. It is "plug and play" compatible with Windows XP and Vista, and interfaces directly with Windows Media Player 11. That is, in Windows Media Player 11, you can set up "synch" functions that allow you to control and move files to and from your player/computer more easily, just like iTunes does with iPods. You don't HAVE to use this function, however. You can also just "drag and drop" files to and from the Walkman using MS Explorer. That is, the Walkman shows up as a new drive when you plug it into your computer, you open it up, and just drag the files you want into the "Music" folder in your Walkman. The files are transferred into the Walkman, and off you go.   If you don't already have Windows Media Player 11 installed on your computer, this upgrade is included on the CD provided with the player, or you can easily find and download the newer Media Player online.  FM TUNER:  Although I'm not personally a big fan of my portable digital media players being mucked up with extras like FM tuners and voice recorders, I have to confess that the FM tuner in this player is cool, and works very well.  There's a simple, clear screen graphic for the tuner control; it's easy to scroll through and assign presets to your favorite stations; it seems to zero in and receive stations very well, and plays very high quality, at least when you're using the earbuds supplied with the player.  For those of you who don't know it, the "antenna" for FM tuners supplied in players like this is your headphone cable, so your reception can vary dramatically depending on what kind of headphones you're using and how their cable is shielded ... just a word to the wise.  Anyway, if you plan to use the FM tuner in your player a lot, you'll be happy with this one.  ACCESSORIES:   As is usually the case with Sony, it would appear they're padding their bottom line on lowball sales of the player by overcharging for accessories. For example, the custom fitted silicone and leather cases offered for this player are ridiculously overpriced at $40 ea.; the hard plastic shell is about $30, and you can't presently get these items ANYWHERE for anything less than that.  Adapters that would allow you to plug the Walkman into your cigarette lighter or AC wall outlet for recharging (as opposed to plugging it into your computer's USB port) are likewise overpriced at $40.00, excluding tax and shipping costs. At that price, I plan to simply do without these accessories, but I'm still delighted with the value represented by the player itself.   SUMMARY/CONCLUSION:   Unless you're totally strung out on iPods and Apple, you'd have to be a fool to not take a serious look at the Walkman if you're in the market for a new portable digital media player. This little gizmo is stacked, it's very attractively priced, and you'll love it.

<Title>Wow
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Sony, I'm impressed: No proprietary software, no proprietary memory and a slick design. This is a USB plug and play unit. I did connect it to my computer, it was immediately recognized by the system. Then I just drag and dropped my files, and ready to go. The battery charges directly from USB.  Now, Sony please listen: We need a FIRMWARE UPGRADE for the video codecs. (MP4 only, it's a shame)

<Title>It's okay... but I wouldn't buy it again
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My primary reasons for buying were: 1) it was somewhat inexpensive, 2) it supported playing copy protected Windows media (which to my surprise the Zune did not), and 3) I was leaving the next day for an international trip and my previous media player had died.  My overall impression is this is just an okay product.  The positives include:  - Easy to use user interface - Good battery life - Very light, which I appreciate when running - Good support for audio formats  The negatives: - Turns on at the slightest touch - hard to even put in your pocket without it turning on - VERY limited support for video formats - I had to buy a program to convert all my videos - Small screen size makes video impractical - Proprietary USB cable - Profile is different from iPod, so get ready to buy all new accessories - Expensive accessories (e.g. belt clip, carry case)  I would recommend this for people who don't want to spend more than $120 and are leaving the country the next day.  Everyone else: keep looking.

<Title>Great Mp3 player
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>For whatever reason I was NOT going to buy and ipod, so I was looking for an easy to use mp3 player. This player has been everything I wanted. I have over 400 songs on it right now and it is easy to organize them. I also use it at school to play classical music so I have it hooked up to external speakers and the sound is great. 4gb is plenty for me as I do not even have it half full.

<Title>An Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I'm totally blown away.  Pros:  1) It's small. 2) The display looks awesome. 3) 5-band EQ. I already made a custom "Metal" EQ because theirs was horrible. 4) Drag and drop MP3 onto it via Windows Explorer. 5) The stock earbuds are actually really good. 6) It sounds amazing.  Cons:  Haven't found any "Cons" yet. I REALLY like this thing.  This being my first MP3 player, I'm glad I ended up with this one. I did some research online and it had the best reviews of any MP3 player I looked at. I just rip CDs in Windows Media Player (the version that came with Vista) and either have it "Synch" with the player or I manually move songs over. Couldn't be any easier.  I highly recommend.  ~Slick

<Title>I've left the ipod for a walkman and loving it
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After having my ipod go bust approximately 12 and 1/2 months after I received it as a gift and after dealing with itunes' cumbersome file manipulation and synching, I selected a Walkman as my next mp3 player.  I absolutely love it.  It's small, light, and plenty big for my needs.  The sound is better than the ipod.  I've paired the Walkman with a set of AudioTechnica noise cancelling headphones and I can't believe how good the music sounds.  The file downloading and synching is very easy.  Great graphics.  Easy to use mechanisms.  Love this.  Good job Sony.

The battery life is great...up to 33 hours!  This is a great choice if you don't want to pay the IPod price.  I paid $109.95 from Amazon with free shipping and no SS tax!

<Title>Great walkman with great features!!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Sony is finally in the MP3 player race. The 616F Walkman is thoughtfully built with features, such as an FM Tuner, video support and drag and drop uploading that make this player one of the best. The ability to use Windows explorer to upload photos, music and video to the player is a great advantage so users do not have to install yet another application that "moves files around". The battery life for music playing is touted at 33 hours, and it comes very close to hitting that mark and in some cases exceeds! I left my Walkman playing over night after listening to it for 8 hours and still got another 8 hours of listing enjoyment. This is a fantastic feature especially since I am in an environment that I cannot readily charge my device!   Overall this is a fantastic player that I would highly recommed to anyone looking for a lightweight mp3 player.

<Title>good one!
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this in 4gb sat. morning, sunday I had it filled up with 911 songs. I use a Vista laptop and had no problems at all. The sound is outstanding if you trash the junk earphones that come with it. I am using Grado headphones and it sounds just like my cd's. The FM radio picks up more than any other small radio of it's type I have used. Pretty much the best mp3 player I have used. The battery seems to last longer than the creative Zen I have been using. You won't regret springing for one of these if you want good sound in a easy to use package , just get whatever decent headphones you want, the ones you get should sell for about two bucks!
