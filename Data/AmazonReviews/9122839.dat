<Title>A good no-frills choice
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This MP3 player is about as basic as it gets, which was fine for me.  I like music but I'm not an audio person - my main priority was to get something cheap and portable, and I literally hear no difference between, say, .WMA and .MP3 sound files.  Well, I now have a player that's very portable, well priced, and makes it easy to load and delete music as needed - as others have said, just drag and drop.    Once you figure out how to turn it on (hold play for a few seconds, and note that it starts up paused), you get no features to speak of.  No special playback modes, no sound equalizer, no track names or times.  Not even a screen, actually, and the only way to shuffle between tracks is one at a time with the forward and backward keys.  It'll easily hold 10-15 records' worth of music at a time (if you're okay with WMA format, anyway), but sorting through all the songs can be a bit rough.  They're played in the order they were uploaded... most of the time, anyway... Again, this is the most basic of basic models, and given the price, it's good for what it is.  So, yes, I recommend this product, as long as you know what you're getting.  I was a little concerned about reliability, because others have raised questions about that, but it's been smooth sailing for me thus far (after about two months).    This player theoretically comes with headphones and a AAA battery, but you'll probably want to supply your own of both.

<Title>Incorrectly advertised the COBY MP3 Stick product
<Date>Sat Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am extremely disappointed in the COBY product I purchased.  The Amazon web site advertised that it would work with Win 2K and it in FACT does NOT.  The time I spent with Coby technical support was useless and I was misled by them to think I could use this product with Win 2K.  I communicated with Coby by mail and phone without solution and the last mail sent to them was a waste of time.  There was NO reply at all.  Amazon should not be promoting products from this company.  My recommendation is that you drop all their products.

<Title>Nice, easy to use for the price
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Coby MP-C883 MP3 Player w/1GB - The player loaded easily from a 2002 Dell with XP via Windows Media Player (as recommended by the manual).  I pulled MP3 files from an external hard drive as well as the internal drive and filled the player without any problems.    This player can be hooked up directly to a USB port but includes a short USB extension cord which was convenient for use with a desk top with tough to get at ports. The audio is fine and the provided earbuds are ok, skip forward and backward work as expected.

<Title>Simple, Easy, Cheap
<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this for my 10-year-old sister.  It's simple enough for her to use, and is great for anyone who isn't that techno-savvy but wants a mp3 player.  It was cheap, shipped quickly, and came with all necessary features, though the battery provided was dead.

<Title>Very large MP3 Player for a very small price.
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro's: It holds a TON of music and is very easy to use. (Just plug it in and drag the music to the drive.)  other reviews complained that it broke so i bought the one years replacement plan with it, if it lasts the year then i won't complain about it breaking as i have gotten my moneys worth out of it.  headphones with it are very loud  Cons: Not really a con but when you turn it on (Just hold the play button for a few seconds.) it starts paused, took me a moment to figure that one out, other then that and the lack of display (It's cheap so again not really a con as they had to cut prices somehow.)  if you want a good player at not a lot of money then this is the one, but it is not a heavy duty piece of hardware, you get your moneys worth.

<Title>Great for the money
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was a little skeptical about purchasing this mp3 player.  My husband and I both have ipods and my son wanted one, but he is 6 and I couldn't spend that much money, even the shuffles would be too expensive for him(he breaks a lot of things),  So, we decided to try this one out and I have to admit, it was a good idea.  It's easy enough for him to use and it was a snap to load the songs on, just drag & drop.

<Title>Too Good To Be True
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I thought $20 for a 1GB MP3 player sounded too good, I should have trusted my instincts. Purchased for my Daughter for Christmas.  First one would not power on or work at all, so we sent it back.  The second one also will not power on or work at all - sending it back too and giving up.  COBY, you have forever lost our business.

<Title>Very nice bare bones player
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought this little mp3 player on a whim and didn't expect a whole lot from it for the price.  Frankly, I was pleasantly surprised. I find the sound to be clear and there's a good range of volume.  The player works much like a flash drive, plugging directly into a USB port on your computer - it also comes with a USB cord if you need one. It is very easy to put songs on the player and holds a decent number of songs.  Although there's no screen, flipping through the songs is simple and I have had no problems with lag going from song to song. Comes with a set of ear buds, but you can plug your favorite earphones into the standard headphone jack if you don't like buds.   Altogether a fantastic little player for the price, and one that is good for either people on a budget or for a child wanting to listen to their own music - at this price, if they break or lose it, you're not out much. I would certainly buy it again.
