<Content>I purchased this after owning the IAudio XL5 30 gig media player. The sound quality of the IAudio is many times better than this. The IAudio has much better equalizer settings. When recording directly by line in this uses an AAC format, the IAudio creates MP3 which is much more convenient. The random play feature on the mvp-9120 stinks. You can have thousands of songs but it only plays randomly from one folder at a time. The IAudio plays from all songs or by folder or subfolder. Again much better. You can drag and drop songs to both the IAudio and this. The only requirement is that you place songs or whatever in the "Media" folder for it to be available to play. The IAudio battery life is almost 4 times this one's 8 hours. The mvp-9120's control button is quite sensitive to touch. When using it I found myself all too often clicking the up or down function when trying to click left or right and visa versa. The IAudio when used as an external hard drive is powered by the USB, this is not. This has to be plugged in to be consistently available as an external drive or the battery dies, hence the 20 gig transfer limit advertised. The IAudio also has a built-in tuner and record from radio function. The headphone out jack on this is recessed which makes connecting a hassle. 3 out of 5 cords I have won't plug in deep enough to use. This is better than the IAudio in these respects: 1- 120 gig vs. 30 or 60, 2- media card slots, 3- the mvp-9120 has an included remote, 4- no sub-pack needed to record or charge, 5- this plays audio and video out to PAL or NTSC tv's although the quality and resolution is severely limited. The resolution appears to be near 640 x 480, VGA. When IAudio redesigns their unit to incorporate all the plugs to the main body I will upgrade back to IAudio.

<Title>Many QA/QC issues 
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 80 GB version at the end of July, 2006 in advance of a three week trip to Europe. My family takes lots of pictures and I was hoping this would be able to store all of those pictures. The first unit I received did not have any operating software loaded onto it. Yes, you heard me, the thing had no operating system. Wolverine sent me a replacement unit, but I had to pay to ship my original unit back to them, and then pay for expedited shipping to me for the new unit (I was leaving in 2 days). Strike one. The new unit arrived and worked pretty well. It certainly isn't an easy user interface. If you're not technically oriented, it would be frustrating. The buttons and joystick feel flimsy, and the red plastic shell is almost embarrassing. One of the features I was really looking forward to is the ability to plug the MVP into a TV to view the pictures you've taken. Well, here's the QA/QC issue: the unit shorts out when I plugged the cord, provided with the unit, into the video out jack. It just shuts down. As soon as I pulled the cord out, the unit is up and running again. Good golly, for $300+ I want a working, reliable unit. It's almost as if the people at Wolverine had a good idea, but didn't have the capital to put together a good product.  Hire some software guys and test the units before you sell them! The software in the unit sucks, QA/QC stinks and to top it all off it is ugly. I returned the unit.

<Title>Run from this item!!!!!
<Date>Mon May 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player basically does nothing but make its owner jump thru hoops.  Can you say work around?  That's what you're in for.   Can't play most formats.  I haven't found a video format yet that it will play.  Try creating a playlist and you might end up throwing it thru a window.    Why doesn't this company create some software to run this player like  everyone else does?  The interface is made for a baby's fingers (e.g., the not so joyful STICK)...AND .....the remote will give you Carpal Tunnel from repeated pressing over and over with no results.  ZEN's and IPODS are a pleasure to use after this thing...WOLFIE is way over priced for what you get...    CONS:  Everything about it.  No redeeming qualities..  Pros:  Still looking.....but I've pretty much given up.  BUY THIS IF YOU want to be frustrated...  I would give this a zero star rating if I could.

<Title>Not an MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're looking at this item with the idea that you're gonna use it as an MP3 player, my advice is to look elsewhere. This is a dream come true if you're big into digital photography or taking DVD's and TV shows with you but it's just awful as an MP3 player.  It has none of the familiar functionality of your standard MP3 players [I have a Creative Zen Jukebox], like playlists or synch software.  Playing MP3's is just awkward and cumbersome.  Don't buy this unit if you want an MP3 player but do buy this unit if you're looking for an excellent portable unit to store, share and view digital images, videos and the like.
