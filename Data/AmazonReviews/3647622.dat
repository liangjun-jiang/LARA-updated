<Title>Does everything fairly well
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, I loved this device except for one thing.  But first, the good:    1.  Once you start using the touch-screen on this thing, you won't want to go back to pushing buttons on another player.  Being able to tap this or tap that is pretty addictive and you quickly get used to it.  Archos needs to learn a few things about interface design.  I found unintutive in some areas, and some things just need to be tweaked out.  While I owned the unit, Archos released two firmware upgrades that I applied (very easy to do) that solved a lot of interface problems, and I expect some of the other things I didn't like too much will probably be fixed soon enough.  2.  Music (and all other content) is sync'ed using WMP10/11.  With the latest firmware, album art gets sync'ed as well, although I had plenty of albums that didn't seem to get the album art downloaded.  You can also bring the 604 up in hard drive mode and just dump whatever files you want on it (if they're music or video files, you can also play them).  3.  Video playback is superb, playing almost any DivX, MPEG, or WMV file I dumped on it.  Most of my videos are either recorded via Windows Media Center or downloaded from various Internet sources.  Haven't tried any DRM-ed videos you'd get, but I'm assuming as a PlaysforSure device the Archos 604 should play them if WMP syncs them.  4.  Surfing the Internet with this thing was pretty nice too, using the Opera browser.  You can view a page in real-size and scroll up/down and left/right, or you can zoom out on a page and see most everything pretty well on the screen.  Wouldn't play Flash movies and other active code, but what do you expect?  :)  5.  Finally, I was able to stream music and video off of my network shares.  Unbelievable.  With the use of the docking station, it's conceivable that one can hook the 604WiFi to their TV and stream movies or music wirelessly from a network share.  There is only one reason I sent the player back.  It was just a bit too big for what I wanted to do with it, namely play music while driving or working out.  It's an incredible machine for video and everything else it does, but too large to carry around in my pocket.

<Title>604 WIFI
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After finding the first 604 WIFI not working with my network, I was promptly sent another piece by Amazon without much issues. It is working great. The whole thing is awesome. I do wish the built in speakers were of better quality but earphones are great.  Overall this thing works great. Bought a DVR station from local Walmart for $78.00 (most Walmart out at one time)other retailers over $100. TV recording is clean. I recommend this to most media lovers. 30G HD is small but what can you do if you wanted WIFI.

<Title>The Perfect Multimedia Player Yet
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me start with this: *** You can download music videos from Google with your Arhcos 604wifi(directly onto it) and play them. That's right, the 604 runs a Linux distro and Google's protection does not work, so it won't ask for the stupid Google player. It neatly downloads an .avi file and it plays it*** Now, the above in mind, you can pretty much say you have a player with access to a database of videos that rivals Itunes(if not bigger) and you can get most of them for free! Now, when you purchase, do the following: * get later firmware release - No delays, as described by CNET in their review * buy plug-ins, especially if you have a huge video collection  * read this: [..]  Enjoy  P.S When the firmaware is hacked, God can't even think of the possibilities :D

<Title>Very Good High End Portable Media Player
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This media player is definitely on the high end of price for portable media players.  However it is worth the money.  The large screen makes it extremely easy to watch movies on and is very clear.  The touch screen also makes user interface very simple and quick.  WIFI on the device is faster than dial-up but still slower than cable.  The nice aspect is that with web surfing all the links on the page are accessible by touching the link with your finger or with the stylus.  I was debating between this version or the regular 604 and I am very happy that I chose the WIFI touchscreen.  Since I have had the Archos, I have almost never used the side buttons.  Battery life lasts 5 hours watching movies continuously.  Some cons are that the built in speaker isn't that great, so you pretty much rely on headphones.  Also the software with starting and stopping movies or music is a bit slow.  Plus the software will only play AVI files out of the box.  You have to buy additional software from archos to play Mpegs.  I bought the optional DVR docking station, and it is the best accessory you can buy for this item.  Charging the Archos on the docking station is a lot quicker than with the supplied USB cord.  The Archos is sturdy and has an all metal case but because the entire thing is a screen my fear is that if I drop it then the entire device would break.  Overall I think this device is more of a travel companion and a good device to keep around to keep you entertained.  Not like the video ipod where you can take it running.

<Title>Great Player AND RECORDER!
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have read all 15 reviews for this device and I am shocked at some of the comments. First I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I still think its a bit large and heavy to be a pocket media player. But with that said, there are so many positives: 1. Replaceable Battery, you can carry an extra on long trips. I know many iPOd owners that are not happy with sending off their units for battery replacement. 2. THis is also a recorder and DVR, iPod's are not in the same league. You can hook up to your COmcast/Charter or DirectTV/Dish settop box, and create your own timeshifted material.  Then take it to work, and watch during your lunch hour the next morning...no downloading hassles. 3. I no not care that I cannot buy movies from iTunes etc.  Just buy the DVD for $9 from Walmart, then use a free Ripper like DDR. Then watch all you want, and then save the DVD for the HD big screen. 4. The speaker does sound poor, but what do you expect, it does work in a pinch.  THe iPods do not even have a speaker (nor do any other Media players) 5. Video codecs cost real money for manufacturers to ship, so why ship every unit with codecs that I may never use.  The "buy if you need" is a good way to keep costs down. You can use "Super" converter for free, and it will convert all your videos to Divx 5.0 or any other format 6.  Yes the WiFi is slow, but what other Media players have WiFi?  ZERO 7.  The bookmarking feature is great for movies, what other HDD based player has that?  8.  The touchscreen is great, no iPODs even have a touchscreen, but looks like the iPhone (just shown at CES) will have a touchscreen 9.  This unit does make HiFi recordings with the built-in microphone, or you can use line-in (extra $$ for accessorie though). Note that mic recording s are MONO 10. Firmware releases are easy to install  On the con side:  1. Need more useable accessories 2. A bit heavy 3. I wish it had a "Now Playing" list like Creative Labs does.  Maybe in a new Firmware release????

<Title>OK
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is quite good for what it does. The only downsidews are that you have to purchase the plugin packs in order to get the full range of video codecs and it doesnt come with an AC adaptor. You will have to buy a USB to wall outlet adaptor or you can spend an absurd amount of money for a dock station and a cable from Archos. The only other grievances is that it doesnt play music while your on the internet and that pdf files load way to slow. If you can get past its shortcommings it is a really good product. I do not regret buying it, I just am a little dissapointed in ARCHOS for not thinking that the consumer has already spent hundreds on their product and they still want more.

<Title>Great picture... Sound could be better...
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased the Archos 604 WIFI Media Player, it is a very nice product with a very big price tag!  If you are more concerned with with viewing pictures and watching videos than the Archos is great for you.  If your primary use would be for playing music like an IPOD I would look elsewhere because the sound is not equal to that of an IPOD (I also own an IPOD).  The internet option is decent, it works well for things like checking e-mail, sports scores, or reading news articles.  It does not work though for web sites like YOUTUBE, and it is not JAVA enabled so doing things like watching football games in real time is impossible.  I would actually give this product 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option so I rounded up to 4.

<Title>ARCHOS 604 Wifi is AWESOME!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, kudos to Amazon--I ordered my Archos 604 Wifi on Sunday Jan. 14 at 10PM EST on a HOLIDAY WEEKEND, and I signed for delivery just a couple of hours ago (Tuesday Jan. 16 at 6PM via UPS). AMAZING delivery service, especially since I selected the FREE Supersaver delivery option! I am impressed!  Speaking of impressed, I LOVE this new Archos 604 Wifi unit! Note that I did not open the user manual for any of the following tasks, the new Archos UI was very intuitive (at least for me, since I have four different older Archos units.) I have had it now for only about two hours and after opening it and plugging it into my Mac's USB 2.0 in hard drive mode, it began charging and mounted on my desktop immediately as a hard disk icon, enabling me to drag and drop hundreds of MP3s to the "Music" folder. I was playing the playlist in MINUTES!  While in hard drive mode, was able to quickly copy AVI videos previously recorded from my Archos AV380 and AV700 to the 604 Wifi's "Video" folder, and was able to play those immediately as well! No need to "stream" video from a Windows network. I can just copy and delete videos as needed. I do wish the 604 Wifi had a larger HD, but that's why I will still use my AV700 100GB.   In another few minutes, I activated the Wifi feature, the 604 Wifi detected and was able to connect to my Apple Airport Express network (all I had to do was enter my 26 digit WEP key) and I WAS IN! Can't wait to test the 604 Wifi's connectivity with public Wifi access locations like my local coffee houses and bookstores. From reviews I have read, this unit should automatically connect to open public networks very easily.  ALL OF THIS TOOK ME NOT EVEN A HALF HOUR!!! Of course, working in tandem with Apple Mac hardware probably made this setup process super easy, I dont know how this would go with Windows (I don't own any Windows products at all.)  I also ordered the Archos 604 DVR station via Amazon (under $80, just got an email confirming that it has shipped), so I'll soon be able to charge the unit with AC adapter, hook up USB digital cameras or other Mass Storage HDs to it and record from my Comcast digital cable box or ANY video source.  Get yourself an Archos 604 Wifi, you will not regret it!  It is a great little unit at a great price considering its stunning video and Internet-enabled capabilities, which surpass my Apple 60GB video iPod which was about the SAME PRICE as this 604 Wifi--there is no other PMP like this on the market!  Archos rocks!

<Title>Best  PMP on the Market!
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only other Personal Media Player (PMP) that can compare to this one is the COWON A2.  The Archos 604 WIFI is better then the A2 for 2 main reason. First, WIFI and an OPERA browser. Second, Removable battery.  The A2's only real advantage over the Archos 604 WIFI is the battery life, but again it's not removable and will most likely fade over time.  I have also heard people say that the 604's audio is inferior to an Ipod.  Archos did have a few audio quirks in the past, but some firmware updates in October fixed theses problems.  Also, Ipod does not exactly have "great" sound.  PROS:  1.  Touch screen is a must have now.  I have used other PMP devices without a touchscreen and faired okay, because I had no choice.  Now that I have a touch screen there is no going back.  This makes things so much easier to navigate it's not even comparable. 2.  WIFI with OPERA browser.  This has improved greatly with firmware updates.  I find it very acceptable for a small WIFI device. 3.  Video is incredible.  Quality and performance is 5 star. 4.  Audio is as good as any other MP3 player I have seen. I really believe that the quality of audio has much more to do with how your MP3 was encoded, rather than the player itself.  Also, this unit can play the proprietary Apple stuff like H264 video and AAC audio with   a $20 Apple plugin. 5. Photo viewer is beautiful and quick. 6. You can opt to buy all the extras if you wish. This helps keep the cost down. 7.  Constant Firmware updates. Check the website regularly!  CONS:  1.  Battery life could be better.  You can buy an additional battery for $30. 2.  Video screen has a very slight film over it to allow for a fingerprint proof touch screen.  Not really an issue, but some have mentioned it in other posts. 3.  No JAVA or FLASH support for the OPERA browser. 4.  Video and Audio folders limit how you can organize your files.  I also have the DVR docking station.  This is $80 to $100 extra, but well worth it.  It works as a pass through device and is extremely easy to use and setup.  You can use it to charge the device (AC adapter included) and record TV in MPEG4 format.  Nice!  Overall, as you can probably tell, I'm a big fan of this new device.  There are areas for improvement, but it is the best PMP on the market today!   I'm looking forward to a device that will do all of this and be half the size with 3 times as much HD memory, and incorporate a phone and a Windows environment to allow for Outlook email and MS office products, but this will come someday.  I found this at Sam's Club in December 2006 for $367.00.  Remember to go to the Archos website to get he latest firmware.  They ship this with an old version of the 604 firmware

<Title>Archos does it again!!!
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been watching portable video players for two years now waiting for  them to mature. After reading several reviews for the new Archos series I settled on the 604 wifi. I had to sell some of my other toys to afford it and have had no regrets. Navigation is easy even in the dark. The touch screen is great, No proprietary software to load your music and pictures if you use it in hard drive mode. I use it more for videos and recording TV than for music. I still prefer a small format for an mp3 player. The wifi is great for sharing files and surfing the net when my wife and kids are busy at our other computers. Geeez surfing the net while you are on the toilet. Does life get any better than this?  Downside: Short battery life when wifi is on. Built in speaker is almost useless

<Content>This was one of the smartest buys I've made. I decided to spend the extra $$$ to get the Archos 604 WiFi instead of the ipoop products. I'm glad I did because I get to watch everyone's ipoop's bite the dust as many said in the various reviews I read prior to my purchase. The ipoop crowd stands around me looking at the 100's of photos I have on my archos with a brilliant display. Then they freak as I start surfin' the net. The sound level that many complain about is not that bad at all. I don't feel the need to blow my drums away. Best of all is copying all my cd's to my laptop and then to my Archos through the supplied USB.  Archos rocks!!!

<Content>I will have to admit that spending this much money on something electronic took alot of thinking but it was well worth it. I kept telling myself that I should just go and buy a iPod cause it was cheaper. Well I am glad I made the right choice. This thing rocks. I guess the only thing that it lacks is a good on board speaker (not the best quality) but you don't see anybody else putting a speaker in their system. The touch screen makes it a breeze to use. Very responsive. And as long as you have access to a fast WIFI connection, using the internet could not be easier. The best thing hands down is the resolution. I am almost positive that the picture quality is better than my flat screen TV. You will see it the second you turn the device on. It comes with tons of stunning pictures and even a few videos that will drop your jaw. Don't be an iPod slave, get this thing!!!

<Title>The Worst Customer Support
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am writing this while waiting on hold for customer support.  I was told the wait time would be 3 minutes; that was 14 minutes ago.  Before that, I waited 11 minutes on what was supposed to be a 4 minute hold, and then was treated to very LOUD static in my ear, along with a male voice, then complete silence.  Then I was disconnected.  I ordered the product because of the stellar reviews here.  I got it yesterday after an almost 2 week wait, though it showed "in-stock".  Most things are intuitive as advertised, and the display is excellent as advertised, but NOTHING WORKS!  1) I went the Archos web site to download the firmware.  It downloaded to my Mac fine and I followed the directions listed below and it would not update.  I tried 2 more times, carefully following the directions on the website for my product in case I had misinterpreted the instructions.  Here are the instructions:   Firmware is another name for Operating System (OS) or System Software. Below, you will find the instructions and the latest software to update your specific ARCHOS device.  Step 1. Download the firmware to your computer When you download this, your browser may warn you that the file 'could be harmful'. This is normal because browsers are not familiar with files that have a .AOS extension and suspect that they could be malicious. These files are not harmful to your computer.  Step 2. Turn on your ARCHOS device and connect it to your computer with the USB cable  Step 3. Wait a few seconds for device detection  Step 4. Copy and paste the downloaded firmware (.AOS file) to the "root" of your ARCHOS device. In "Hard Drive" mode, ( E: for example ) put the update file directly onto the ARCHOS icon.  Step 5. Disconnect the Device Use the "safe disconnect" green arrow icon in the system tray before unplugging the USB cable.  Step 6. On your ARCHOS device, click on "Update Firmware" From the main ARCHOS menu, click on "setup" or "settings", then click on the "System" icon, and finally highlight and click on the "Update Firmware" button.  When I finally got tech support on the phone after 20 minutes, he had an attitude and told me it says to keep the device connected when I update (check Step 5 above).  I connected my device to the computer and the firmware update worked.  The rest of my problems have to do with their website and certain options not working.  I hope this is a temporary problem but have no way of knowing.  Tech support was lost by the following problems, so chose to act as if I was making it up (they said they had no problems themselves -- without taking the time to try what I had just described -- and no way to check the website):  1) on my Mac, when I tried to put one of the plug-ins in my basket, it went to screen that said the basket was empty and to search for the item and click "add to basket" -- exactly what I had done!  After this repeated itself, I went to my Windows PC and was able to add the plug-in to basket, but when I went to proceed to checkout, it wanted my login and password.  Since I was a new customer I gave it my email and made up a password, that took me to a screen that asked for my login and password.  OK, I entered it and nothing happened.  There were no other buttons to push on the screen.  I waited, then opened another window and tried to login as an existing customer since it had accepted my login and password (I knew this because if I tried to readd myself it said my login already existed).  When I tried to log in as an existing customer and pressed proceed, it just cycled back to the same screen with no error message of any kind -- just prompted me to repeat what I had just done.  Tech support then admitted (or lied) that they have nothing to do with the web site, it belonged to sales support and gave me their number.  I asked if I would be on hold again for 20 minutes, he said he had no way of knowing (apparently they have no way of knowing anything and don't care).  He failed to mention that sales support is only open weekdays during the hours that most of us work, so all I would get was a recording that said they were closed.  Other things:  1) I have transferred video files that I have recorded to my Mac in DivX, MPEG-4, and DVD formats (recorded by eyeTV on my Mac); none of them play on Archos -- they all say they are damaged.  My Mac can access these files off the Archos 604 and play them -- so they are clearly not damaged. 2) The PDF manual loads very, very slowly, and getting to the page you need is much slower than having a hard copy.  It is fortunate that the manuals can be viewed on-line

<Date>Sat Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Once through the learning pains, the unit proves its worth.  The wifi is the most singularly important feature to me, since I can play downloaded movies and songs from my computer's hard drive without transferring them to the archos.  You will need the DVR adapter and the two codecs that Archos sells to make it work.  I think it's a ripoff for Archos to sell these piecemill since you need them to make the unit work, but they never ask me for advice anyway.  Don't forget, that there's a secretly hidden reset switch under the battery.  They must have thought hard and long before deciding where to hide that little gem.

<Date>Sat Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights.  The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%.  Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible.  I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room.  I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc.  Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch.

<Title>Very Poor Quality Of USB Hardware Connection
<Date>Sat Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first time we opened it up, we were so frustrated it could not be recognized by any laptops with Windows XP.  1. Our laptops are good ones, which can run other USB2.0 devices with NO problems  2. Called technical support, he immediately told me it is a hardware problem and advised us to return to Amazon  3. We purchased this 604 WiFi from Amazon with condition "New"  4. We are surprised that this one seemed NOT being tested when leaving factory  5. Visiting Archos website, it has a place for RMA. This is good for consumers, but also implies that the quality problems are a LOT  6. An observation of the USB connector inside 604 Wi Fi, it is a very thin connector with a lot of pins with very fine pitch. As I am a cell phone hardware designer, I can see this might be a big problem (easil broken) in the long run  7 I am returning this product right away

<Title>The more I use it,  the more I like it...

<Content>First impressions of the 604 wifi were mixed. The construction is very sturdy but also rigid, I don't think it would survive any sort of drop onto a hard surface. Those looking for any kind of "keep in your pocket" mp3 player will be dissapointed, its heft and dimensions are too much for anything besides maybe a large jacket pocket.  Works great for playing mp3s and navigating through your music is very easy although a search function would have been nice. Many reviews talk about the max sound being low and this is definitely true but it is mostly due to the cheap "disposable" ear buds that come with the product, a good pair of in ear monitors completely solve this problem. The touch screen is nice and responsive. I wasn't crazy about the internet browsing at fist(a major disappointment because it was a big reason I purchased it) but after learning the functions of the buttons on the right and figuring out how to adjust the zoom it becomes a much better experience. The wifi is slow to connect, doesn't grab anything but a strong signal and is overall pretty slow. The screen is nice but the outermost layer(the touch surface) adds a adds a annoying "matte" like appearance to it, taking a lot away from what I think would otherwise be a very crisp picture. At the price it is now (around 200) it really can't be beat, you could spring for the largest capacity ipod touch for double the price and almost 1/2 the storage and get a sleeker and probably better design, but for me at least, it wasn't worth the price considering dealing with itunes and a meager 16gig of storage. Overall I am happy with the Archos, it does just about everything, just not perfectly.

<Title>Not everything it could be, but still amazing
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before I purchased this from Amazon.com, I called the Tech Support line at Archos 877-300-8779 and asked them how it worked with DishNetwork, etc...  They said that the 604 WOULD work directly with my 622 HD DVR, but after receiving the unit and paying the one-time fee (DishNetwork) to enable the HD recording feature, I had to call Dish's tech support--and they told me that the hard drive of the PMP had to be at least 40GB (and this one is 30GB).  So if you want it to work, get a bigger drive.  I am going to try to bypass this by purchasing an external hard drive (bigger than the 40GB minimum) and see if I can record to it, then transfer from it to the Archos...   I did buy the HD DVR unit made for the 605 Archos from Archos online--the customer service said today that it is identical to the 604 DVR (which is no longer in production) except the remote doesn't work--so a separate remote is available for 12.95 through their website (note:  you do not need the remote to work the DVR adapter).  We shall see how it works--I understand it only records in real time, but that's better than nothing. I purchased the Podcast Add-on patch from Archos, which is cool, but for 20 bucks I'm not sure there are enough interesting podcasts to sign up for.  But again, I need to check out the availability before I make a decision on whether it was worth it or not. All in all, the picture quality is awesome, the music sounds tremendous using their earbuds (not so much from the speakers--it sounds tinny and cheap, but then, the speaker is the size of a pencil eraser, so what could we expect?).  The transfer-quality of the photos to our large screen HD TV is surprisingly good--very nice.  (And yes, the photos can be uploaded to your DishNetwork 622 DVR--it's only tv and movies that are blocked... and you can do the photo transfer without the 39.99 fee.) I am trying to figure out how to put a DVD movie on the thing, but while Archos' Tech support says you "can" do it, they won't give me any idea as to "how".  Something about how they can't recommend any specific program. It's a very nice unit--I do recommend it--but don't believe everything you're told about how it records via DishNetwork--even though Archos makes the PocketDish (which has been out of production for 2 years now), they are NOT compatible.  The tech support people even told me that while the latest Generation 5 model 605 and up are supposed to have downloadable patches to make it "Dish friendly", it has had very bad receipt by customers, with problems all over the place... so it seems that if you're a Dish customer, and want to use this unit as a recorder, opt for the higher GB unit at the least... I don't mean to be negative--it's still worth every dime of the 200 bucks.

<Title>Archos 604 30GB WiFi: Execellent Deal for a Portable Media Player(PMP)
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Let me start by stating I do not take reviews lightly.  My first impression when I received the Archos 604 WiFi in the mail was excellent.  The quality construction of the PMP's housing stands above all other PMPs I have ever laid my hands on.  After initially charging the battery for roughly three hours I powered up the device.  The interface is good but not as intuitive as other PMPs--Ipod Touch being the first to come to mind. Any ways, it is easy to connect this device to your computer; it is absolutely excellent for those who use Linux because you do not need any software to transfer files to the PMP.  On the other hand, those who use Windoze will be more than satisfied with the ability to sync it with Windoze Media Player.  The video quality is beyond excellent as any review will tell you the same.  The sound quality is between good and excellent(lets call it great). I purchased the Archos 604 WiFi for $199... at that price the player is an excellent deal: good interface, WiFi, Internet Browsing, 30GB HD, excellent video quality, great sound quality, quality construction, and very functional and versatile.   With that being said I will discus the CONS.  Battery life could use a boost but for what this device does and the price I will sacrifice (currently I get 4 hours for video and roughly 10-12 hours for music)... I just purchased two extra batteries and external charger for $90 to make up for the battery life.   Hard drive space is sufficient but I believe as always you can use more...on the other hand, I cannot complain since the Archos 605 WiFi has larger sizes available, you just have to pay the price.  No flash in web browser and it does not seem like Archos is going to ever make that available for the 604; so if you plan on using the device for watching flash movies(i.e. youtube) you will be out of luck--again look at the 605.  Some things I refuse to complain about are the codecs for other media types and accessories that do not come standard with the player.  First off they are not necessary, as for me I use only AVI/MPEG4 and MP3.  So Archos has made a smart move in cutting cost--which in turn is passed on to you, the customer--by not packaging these options by default... When you purchase the Archos 604 WiFi both Amazon.com and Archos.com will state entirely and clearly what is included in the box.  So shame on you if you are surprised about what comes out of the box.   Bottom line: the Archos 604 WiFi cannot not be beat for the price!

<Content>My first review ever! This product is very well built and the features - video,photos,music work flawlessly on the machine. As does the wifi and internet link. The big problem is connecting it up to a TV/DVD player to record and playback. Even with the optional kit this is a major challenge and required much experimentation and trawling of the Archos fan forum for advice.

<Title>Good product with inconvenience
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had Archos 604 wifi for about 2 weeks. I loved it when I first got the product and I was going to give 4.5 stars for this. But as I get to know the device more and more, I find some inconveniences and complaints about the product.  1. On the manual guide, it says to charge for TWO hours for the battery to be charged completely. With two bars of battery, I still had to charge more than FIVE hours to get full battery. Also, the battery dies out so fast. Two bars are lost with 1hr of voice recording;the LCD light isn't even on during recording.   2.On the manual, it says "File names, folder names and music tags can be displayed in various character sets, such as Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, etc. You can enable these character sets in the Language settings screen" It specifically says which language and I found no Japanese, no Korean. They even had the figure of what the screen should look like if you install East Asian font. I called the tech support to get help on installing language and he doesn't even know about the figure shown on manual and he says that they don't even have Korean at all.  For this reason, I have to change all the Korean characters into English before transferring into my device. And even if I do,some file names still appear as ????  3. Very inconvenient in getting tech support. You need to log-in in order to tech support. No on-line requesting or e-mail. If you cannot log-in to the website for some reason, the only way to get tech support is to call.   In conclusion, Archos 604 WiFi would be good product if you use English as language, use it just for music (in that way the battery won't run out so fast.But it's too big for music device) or have USB port with all the time to charge constantly.  There are many features but you can't really enjoy all of them because of battery life. You can get DVR travel kit to charge faster but I don't how it effective it will be. I ordered DVR travel kit but didn't get it yet. So, I will update review about that product in the future.

<Title>The best of its kind around so far
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just got the Archos 604 a month ago and it works pretty well. The web browser is poor. The speaker is small and isn't as bad as the other reviewers make it out to be. It's definitely not stereo sound, but I could hear it fine at home. Of course you won't hear it on a noisy plane.  Recharging it using the USB cable through your computer takes a long time and a hassle. But it's light to take anywhere and the input keyboard which pops up for easy fingering is pretty nifty. The Archos would blow every other offering out of the water if it would put together more support and software on its devices. It needs to get outside developers working on that or else, the device is nothing more than it is. I just notice Cowon has also come out with a mini video recorder that also offer document file application. I wish I could use this device to store books, like the Bible so I could use it in place of the physical one. Also if they somehow installed communication mic and enabled the use of my Yahoo messenger or Skpye on the Archos, I could use it as a webphone and talk very cheaply on it from anywhere in the world. That would be the killer ap for sure. But alas, they are not there yet. For it's price, it's not bad. So far, it's pure attraction is the ease of recording off the TV, and that itself may not last very long as a competitive edge.

<Title>Its worth for money
<Date>Tue Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all I would say about Amzon, its really nice to deal with it. I got all my orders (except few of them) in time and in sealed box, which is really excited me. There is one more thing that I saved a lot in terms of Tax, Shipping and cost as well when I bought from Amzon.  Now about Archos 604 Wifi player, This is truly not only a multimedia application but an advanced technology gadget too. Here are few facts about it:  Pros: ==>Touch screen gives you quick and easy handling of functionlity ==>Wide and rich color screen, gives you clear pictures ==>Wifi, wireless 802.11 b/g both standards support by this (including security), which allow you to surf on internet using Opera Browser and even you can download music/files from/to your laptop (wifi enabled). ==>its been very easy to set up for wireless connection and peer to peer for sharing files. ==>Play music, video and view picture in presentation mode. Play almost all movies format (when you have plaug-in installed). ==>Big memory space, so that you can store all kind of your data files and have fun on the move. ==>Record from any external source (using RGB cable and DVR Docking Station) and also you can play on any external device like TV, Projector. ==>Connect to computer so that you can transfer your data, music, movies etc to/from, also you can charge your device. ==>connect to other device(Camera, Pen Drive) without computer and transfer files from them on to you Archos. ==>Scalablity: Frimware updates provided by Archos  Cons:  ==>Its accesories like Docking Adaptor, even charger does not comes in original packing, but you have to buy it and pay extra cost. ==>Extra cost for Plug-ins too: that a big sheet about archos ==>Firmware: They take too much time to fix the bugs in Firmware. I don't know if they will provide more functionlity in the same device by updating its firmware or they may leave it and swtich to make new devices. As they did stop supporting their old device i.e. AV4xx series since 2 years.  But still I love this device. I hope Archos will provice new functionlity and support for a long time for this device, this way they could make this device a bih hit.

<Content>I bought this gizmo to watch and listen to streaming audio video direct from the internet. I listen/watch a large number of programs on internet radio stations, international TV news and from the US network TV websites. The PR says that you can listen to all formats and cannect up to the web with OPERA. They do not tell you that OPERA on Archos can not do the simple function of streaming.  What kind of WIFI Media Player can not direct stream from the web? Archos! Even Palm can stream and it is not a Media Player.  You are going to spend over $500 before you are done and tech support is either nonexistant or not helpful.  Save you money an double check that it can do what you want it to do before buying

<Content>I was able to figure this device out in about 10 minutes of just playing around with it.  I connected it to my Win XP machine and was able to copy MP3 and AVI files to it just as if it was another drive letter.  It plays Divx and Xvid format videos without the need to buy the additional plug-ins.  The screen is just fine for viewing movies.  The internal speaker leaves something to be desired, but is good enough for children to view movies on if required.  Most adults would probably prefer to use headphones for audio or a small set of external speakers.  The WiFi capability is slick.  It can view windows file shares without any problem.  It even shows hidden shares somehow.

Maybe it is just static charge, they need to fix whatever it is.  plugins should be included in price. They are included on other PDA Arhos models why not on this one? Doesnt make sense, just charging money multiple times and ways, Price is not cheap to begin with anyways.   These issues apart, this product is awesome...  recording from TV is a snap, movies play good. Good comments from everone who sees it.

<Content>This definitly an under hyped product. It is well worth every cent. There is no comparison with the 604 and the Ipod. The support for me is a breeze, I had a question I emailed them and I got an answer in less than an hour. This brand should be advertised more in the U.S. The sound quality is great after the update. People complain about the dvr or docking station not coming with the product, but what other brand include that? I can't think of any other mp3/pmp brand that even has a DVR. Yea, Ipod lets you watch tv/movies too, but you have to pay for them! The WiFi is great, internet speed is decent. The screen is very clear, it's very hard to scratch. I love the touch screen, it's soo much easier than any other interface out there. The memory space isn't the biggest, but you can easily swap stuff around wireless from your computer. If you're looking for an Ipod killer, buy this.

<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  Very solid design and construction.  Lots of features for the price.  Removeable battery.  Touchscreen is bright and colorful.  Video looks great.  Web browser works great on many sites and it is also pretty fast.  Sensitive voice recorder.  Very easy to add files (drag and drop).  Good overall user interface.  Cons:  Music playback is good but not great.  It seems to lack depth and the bass just doesn't "thump" like on my Creative Zen V.  Creating playlists is confusing.  Built in speaker sounds terrible.  No flash support for web browsing.  Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.  The price is great compared to similar players.  I have no use for the DVR and other accessories so actually I like the modular approach (pay extra only if you want extra).    P.S. - Handbrake is a free program that can be used to convert DVDs into mpeg4 for use with this device (save file with .avi extension and use mpeg4 or xvid encoder with mp3 audio).

<Title>Well made device, very pleased
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this product for several weeks now.  I thought long and hard about which type to buy (I finally settled on Archos as the manufacturer) and went with the 604 WiFi due to the size (704 is too large for what I wanted) and cost (the 604 without WiFi was about the same price).    I also prefer the removeable battery, which the 605 does not have. The 605 does allow you to stream video whereby the 604 doesn't, so if this is an important feature for you keep that in mind.  Also, oddly enough, the 604 WiFi comes with the Archos browser already loaded, and it appears you have to pay extra for this with the 605.  Learning how to convert files took me a while, but I found a good software to use (there are several freebies out there) and through a bit of trial and error, I have it down to a pretty good routine now.  I've put about four movies on it and they work fine, although one I may have to reload because the movement on the screen is a little choppy for some reason.  Converting DVDs to .avi takes a while, so I usually do this in the background while doing something else.  Transfering the file to the Archos only takes a few minutes.    I see many complaints about the fact that you have to buy extra accessories, which is apparently true for most any Archos PMP. You should, of course, do your research ahead of time and figure those costs in the final price before you make the decision to buy it in the first place.  If you want any cables, the docking station, etc. add those into the total cost when you compare, presuming that whatever you are comparing it to has these already included.  I have ordered the docking station but it has not yet arrived, so I can't comment on its usefulness (or lack thereof).  I also bought the two plug-ins online at the Archos web site.  I knew in advance that I would incur these costs in addition to the cost of the 604 if I wanted them.  Considering the price I got if for on Amazon, though, I still considered it to be a good buy.  Several comments have also been made regarding the sound quality of the speaker.  Well, of course it's bad! It is a tiny little thing on a faily small device, so don't expect thundering surround sound.  All I use it for is to make sure that the movies I have transferred to it did transfer successfully with the sound. In that respect, it's pretty handy to have.  I plan to use this to watch movies while traveling by plane, and I think it is perfect for that purpose.  It is heavier than I thought it would be and IMO it is not a good choice if you mainly want MP3.  There are many lighter options for this with probably better sound quality.  In no way would you want to go jogging with this thing; it's simply not made for that.  If you do decide to buy this device or another model, check out www.archosfans.com to get some useful tips on using it.  For newbies like me in regard to file conversion, a great resource on this site is http://forum.archosfans.com/viewtopic.php?t=8348, which guides you step-by-step.  All in all I have beep pleased with my purchase and will probably buy a second one to give as a gift.  I do recommend it.

<Title>1st  PMP and lovin it!
<Date>Fri Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my 604 30GB wifi as a gift from my boyfriend and now he wants one. and about two months ago and I'm really enjoying it. The screen resolution is great and the functions are fairly easy to use. I got the DVR station too and it was easy to set up. I love that you can record off your tv. You can browse and transfer files from one place to another i.e. computer, another Archos, or mp3 player.   There are a few gripes though. The battery life is only about 3-4hours long when watching a movie file. There is no keyword search feature (unlike the Creative Zen W Vision that my boyfriend has)only a browser and with 30GB of hard drive space to fill looking for songs takes a little longer. Some of the instructions aren't very clear.  All in all I thinks it's a best buy!

<Title>Pleasant surprise
<Date>Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I take trans-continental trips about once a month and want to able to listen to music and watch films. The music part is easy, what with today's MP3 players, but the film part is a little more difficult on planes that make it hard to open a laptop. I also like the idea of not taking my laptop everywhere I might want to access to wi-fi, and having a lot of extra disc space for backups.   Having had great luck for several years with one of the original Archos jukeboxes I took the plunge and bought the 604 wi-fi.  It's a very good product. Running as a 30 gig hard drive when connected to a USB port it is a snap to load up on music and video. The touch screen is very intuitive, and after an hour or so with menus it is extremely easy to operate. I'm getting very good wi-fi connections (a word about some problems below), and the overall video and audio quality is very good, though a little more audio punch would be welcome. The little keyboard is really usable only with one finger or a stylus, but the whole system is well designed so that logging in to an email account is easy, and really isn't terribly time consuming. Ditto for accessing favorite web pages, which can be saved in a rather elemental bookmark system.  I gave it a good workout last week, taking it on vacation instead of my laptop (the presence of which would have induced me to work too much). Using a Belkin USB bridge I was able to easily back up my digital images for easy viewing. I had several hundred songs along for easy listening, and loaded up four movies. All worked as advertised. No serious glitches of any kind. Battery life was pretty good -- I was able to watch a two hour film, listen to music and review photos without full discharge (better than my laptop), and it is easy to change batteries, one of the great features of this product -- a second battery can be had for less than thirty dollars.  Ok, nothing is perfect, and here are some minor complaints:  - it doesn't have the most sensitive wi-fi card in the world, so it is important to be where there is a strong signal.  - it does not work with ALL wi-fi routers, particularly older models.  - music/video volume is on the low side; my original Archos Jukebox is much better. To fix this I purchased a little battery powered volume booster at Radio Shack. I can now watch movies on planes with pleasure.  - the basic kit is a tad on the weak side. Though the device can be recharged through its provided USB cable, one is up a creek without a computer unless a charger is purchased. One also needs to purchase a software upgrade to watch most films. Come on guys, pack in a charger and the basic software for watching flicks.   - life would be much easier if it saved passwords and login info.  - a very simple text editor for saving notes would be great.  -some Archos media players can accommodate a small 4 AA battery pack, something I would snap up in a second.  I had a chance to sit down with a relative and compare the 604 to his iTouch and, frankly, I think I have the better of the deal, even with the added costs. The screen, though not as brilliant, is larger and, to my eyes, pretty impressive. The 30 gig hard drive -- with no iTunes to mess around with -- is much better for road warriors, and being able to pop batteries in and out is a deal maker for me. Two standard batteries should suffice for a trans-continental round trip.   By way of conclusion, I think this is a well thought-out and nicely built product.

<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this product for about a month now and I love it.  It has wifi internet access, so you can connect to the internet wherever there is a wifi hotspot.  I've also downloaded music and photos onto my device.  The downside is that you only get the USB cord to charge the product.  You can purchase a wall charger unit at an additional charge.  I would also recommend getting screen protectors since if you scratch up the screen, you will not be able to see the images too well.  If you want to add movies, you need to download a separate program.  This is a great product, but you need to spend more money than you think when you purchase it.

<Title>Lack of flash support
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product is horrible.  While the wifi does work well, it doesn't support flash ... which means it is almost useless to view any video or audio format on the web (think, for example, no youtube).  While the sound quality is much better than the ipod, the unit freezes up at the slightest movement.  In addition, the idea that you have to pay $40 to for software updates to use most audio and video formats is just poor business.  Finally, unlike the ipod, the Archos has no software to organize your music files on a pc.  Rather, you have to spend hours doing it with the windows explorer...and forget about the automatic updates for podcasts.  Seriously, this was a complete waste of money. For the same money, by an ipod and enjoy.

<Title>Like most said "Great, but not perfect"
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It was a completely impulse buy on my part. I jumped on it when I saw the price of this thing, $199? I paid $250 for a 7 inch portable dvd player not long ago!  It took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to use all the buttons, and the addition of the touch screen makes it so much easier to navigate the different functions. I simply dragged and dropped all my video and mp3 files from my desktop to the video and music folders and it played back everything without a hiccup. I did have to purchase the cinema plugin from the Archos online store because some of my avi files could not play because of the AAC audio. The sound of the mp3 seems flat comparing to my Creative Zen Micro using the same headphone (Sennheiser CX300). It also difficult to use the 604 as a mp3 player, it's bulky and heavy, you have to take it out of the case and your pocket to change any settings. I used the TV/LCD button to lock the unit once, and it really did, I have to remove the battery to reset the screen. The battery life is also questionable. On a fully charged unit, the battery gauge is down one bar after 10 minutes (not even watching video), 30 minutes later it's down to half. While I did not make a complete test of the battery life, I did manage to finish watching a 2 and a half hour movie with still one bar left. Also not thrill about the wifi capability since so far I could only connect to my own home network. I live in Manhattan and the unit could not find a free network to connect outside my home, in midtown NYC? I hate to charge it with the usb cable because it's simply time consuming. I'm also buying the docking adapter so I don't have to find a pc to charge it when the battery ran out. AFter all I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it  as an alternative to anyone who wants to buy the Apple iTouch, not just because I despice anything Apple or Mac, because I beleive it is a superior product in most aspects. After thought - I just saw the price of the 605 30gb went down to $229 on Amazon, don't know if I should be getting that instead. I know the 605 has a higher res screen (800x480 vs 480x272)and was really impressed after playing with one at a local Sharper Image, but did not get a chance to compare the 2 screens head-to head. Also the 605 did not come with a browser ($30 extra, but supports Flash) and come with a non-removable battery.

It is much better than an ipod because ipods dont have built in speakers.

<Date>Sat Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you want a player that is small, light, plays almost all types of media, then this is the player to get.  There is ample space - not a lot - but enough to store movies, pictures and mp3s for a couple of days.  The images from movies are crisp and vibrant. In terms of the Wifi, it is a bit dissappointing.  It takes about 3 min to enable the Wifi and connect to a network.  However, once connected, playing movies from a share is smooth with no lag.  Overall, highly recommeded !!

<Title>Awesome for recording TV!!!
<Date>Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Archos 604 wifi aroun x-mas time/'06, and have been very happy with it. I mainly use it for recording tv shows using my computer's tv tuner,- (a great way to use that function without buying the dvr, which runs for around $100.) The only flaw in its design is it's soft metel body, which means that unless you buy a leather case for it, (some are very convenient anyway, -MP3extras.co.uk- ) you may scratch or dent it slightly every now and then. Overall, I LOVE THE ARCHOS 604 WIFI!!!, and would definitely buy it again and again!!!

<Content>I use to own a 30GB video iPOD so I could watch movies. But then I got the 604 and the DVR station (sold seperatly) and it couldn't be easier to watch your dvd on this thing. And the quality of the video is way better than the MP4 format that is used for the iPOD.   The WiFi is extremly handy when your on the go. Pitty it doesn't support Flash or java otherwise I would of given this a 5 star rating. Otherwise it's great.   the menu interface takes some time to get use to (especially coming from owning an iPOD) but you get use to it real easy.

<Title>Awesome Do it yourself Device
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great things about the device is the screen size and impressive 16 million color color screen. Picture viewer, MP3 player, PDF reader, Sound recorder, REMOVABLE BATTERY, a little leg in the back to lean it on, and Wifi Web Browser, solid frame and construction.   Now let's get to the problems people have with this, plug in purchase for certain video files. This is what people consider to be the Archos weakness, but that is because they don't know how to use a computer. The archos accepts avi with divx compressor and that is all you need. I wanted to watch mov files but I couldn't do it, Trid re-rendering the file in avi divx but there were pixelation problems, so I got me a convertion program from a-z, now the program cost 32$, but the trial is free (only converts 50% of the movie file to make you buy the whole program)So I opened my file in a video editing software, and made the file twice as long with the second half only black screen. Then run the convertion software and WALLA!!!! you have the format and size you need. You didn't need to buy the plug-ins or the lisence for the full version of the file conversion program. BE RESOURCEFULL!!!!! If you don't want to then this device is not for you.  PDF reader is a bit slow, the touch screen is fairly good and acurate. Overall a solid device, a definite Best buy!!!!!

<Title>604 wifi really delivers
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Really a well made video player... I used this on my recent cross country trip to entertain my wife and I in the car. I got an extra battery which is a must, but each battery when charged lasts 4 hours or so...not bad! The newer 5 series won't let you swap batteries. But if you're prudent in the car you can plug it into the car lighter and juice it up in between shows and stretch it out for longer trips.    I'm hooked on it now...I watch stuff in bed with headphones on almost every night now. The screen resolution is amazing.  I find that the wifi features aren't as important to me and would probably get the larger capacity version/no wifi now. The web surfing is OK but if you have a computer handy for that then you'll use the pc instead. Java and Flash won't work in the Opera version on this one, and that reduces it's use to mostly text and pics.   The screen is a little brighter than my HP Ipaq PDA's was, but still hard to see in sunlight. It's less reflective (at least the touch screen version is) so that helps.  The built in speaker isn't really loud enough to use. I got an IPOD based external speaker for it that really makes it usable for when not wearing headphones. For instance, when in the garage or washing dishes (need a rechargeable one to carry around).   I'd definately buy this again!

<Title>ARchos 604 WiFi: Close to being the ULITMATE in mobile electronics 
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 604 WiFi comes as close as possible to being the ULITMATE in mobile electronics, but still misses the mark. The tiny (think of a thin stack of 3"x5" notecards) device is a superb audio and video player and recorder accommodating MP3 audio and a variety of video formats (including MPEG-4, protected WMV, DivX, and H.264)  as well as functioning as a photo viewer. The 4.3" TFT screen (480X272 pixels) has excellent color and clarity for a touchscreen. It also has a little touted but highly useful feature of reading/displaying PDF files. And while it has a very usable incorporation of a WiFi interface, the one weakness that keeps this from being THE device to have is the Web interface; The inclusion of the Opera browser is a compelling feature, but its inability to execute the Active X and/or Java as well as render some websites that employ the Adobe Flash plug-in correctly all but killed it for wide use in our company. In a sample test at a shopping center, the 604 WiFi was able to connect to a `free' WiFi site (Panera Bread) but wasn't able to properly load the `Flash' graphics or  `logon/splash  screen  that the provider requires passing through. On the other hand, another nearby WiFi provider (Caribou Coffee) had no such `logon' screen and internet browsing worked seamlessly---the virtual keyboard that pops up when browsing to a text-entry box is ingenious--but really demands use of a stylus rather than a finger for tapping the screen. This inability to connect was repeated when attempting to connect at a paid WiFi provider. ATT WiFi service has hot spots at Barnes and Noble, McDonalds and many other high profile locations. Unfortunately a login screen that couldn't  be processed by the Opera browser on the 604 limited its use. Perhaps Archos will release a patch/update that cures this limitation.   None of my colleagues found the alleged limitations (the 30GB hard drive, battery life, processor performance, the proprietary USB cable) to be significant. The one (other) point of  irritation in the purchase was the need to spend extra (a significant amount of money)to get the MP2 video decoder software plug-in. The control buttons along the right side weren't exactly intuitive (each button can be pressed left or right), but not a hindrance...that is once someone created a `cheatsheet' and taped it along the side for reminders.   As my ML1 Media colleague (our video specialist) summarized it: "That thing is like an I-Phone (Apple) without the phone...it's too bad the I-Phone doesn't have the features of the Archos 604".   If Archos can improve that browser, I'll be buying another 6 of these.

<Title>One of the Best, could use some work though
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me start by saying that this is a great toy, I have had it for about a month now and have no regrets purchasing the Archos 604. I will say that as strong as this product is in some areas, it is as weak in other areas. The product itself is great, but it seriously lacks in software. There are basically no instructions that come with it, and the instructions that are available on the web site, could be a lot stronger.    I bought this with the idea for which I believe it is marketed for, a video media player. But guess what? When you get it, you have to go to the Archos web site and buy some software just to use it as the item which it is marketed for, a video media player.  And on top of that you have to buy more hardware if you want to use it as a DVR.  If you want to use this as an MP3 player great, but I would think there would be a better choice out there just for that?  My choice was to use this primarily as a Media player. (if you connect using the Windows media player, make sure you uncheck the allow all music tab, other wise every thing from your IPod will automatically be loaded on this as well, assuming you have an IPod?)  If you search the web for five minutes or so you will find some software that will help you to "Back up" your DVD's. There is some software out there that is free, but so far the best stuff I have found will cost about $80.00, there is a trial period of 21 days, after that you will likely want to buy it though.    Basically I am not telling anyone what they cannot find out by reading some of these reviews. It is a cool toy, but be prepared for the extra costs and for the extra time in searching for the software that will work, and software that you will be comfortable in utilizing. Once it is up and running, this is a great tool, and so far I haven't seen any product out there that can come close to competing with the Archos. I just wish that the makers would get with the game and package this product properly? If they would do that, and keep the price reasonable, I do not think there is much out there that could compete with the Archos, no matter which model!  Pros:  Great Product Nice Screen Fairly Easy to use Movies and other Videos anywhere After much personal research, nothing else comes close!  Cons: Hidden Expense of Additional Software Little instructions included Headphones that come with it are useless External speaker is could be better  All in all a Great little machine!

<Content>Well the product it self is great. Exactly how it is described in the website so as far as hardware is involved I am happy.  The ONLY thing wrong with it is that they DONT UPDATE THE FIRMWARE ANYMORE!!! So you are literally stuck with the programming inside it. So using for the internet is limited because you cannot view any of the flash items at all!!!  Also the video codecs are limited and they require you to "buy" plugin to be able to use other video file types on the unit. Which in my opinion is a rip-off!!!

<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My main gripe with this player is the fact that the lock button doesn't work very well. I use it to conserve battery by preventing the screen from lighting up every time I accidentally touch the screen. Yet it displays a message that says "buttons are locked." I categorize this as useless and defeats the whole purpose, especially since if I keep pressing the screen, the lock function disables. This is incredibly annoying because battery drains within 3 hours if this keeps happening. So you either have to put it in a container that suspends it wherever you move, or you have to not move it at all. Highly inconvenient. I would've just bought another Zen Vision M if I knew about this. The screen is gorgeous and huge, reading e-books and watching videos that you can get to work on it without buying the 2 add-ons is awesome, but the sound output isn't loud. If I have my Zen at the level I keep this one at, I would move lickety split towards hard of hearing.

I do not have its DVR station so I can not use AC to charge battery. You must buy it if you want convenience. I hope it will support more media formats, I need convert some my personal videos before I load on this player. I did not use it with wifi, because I could not figure out how to fill wireless network information. Anyway, it is a very good product, I like it.

<Title>Another Awesome hit from Archos...
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've long been an Archos fan. I have the 6GB Jukebox Recorder, AV420  and now planning on getting this. Its got a bevy of features and is an all around superb tool. I mean look at the capabilities - Wifi, browsing, photo, video ( many formats including DVD !! Just copy the decrypted vobs ), music   However, there are a few features that should've been there which I feel would've knocked this out of the park - 1. portable gaming. Yeah, its big these days 2. Phone capabilities ( this just will remain a wish till Apple comes and does it and everyone will copy ) 3. built-in camera for camera/video recording. C'mon every tiny cell phones have that now.  4. misc. PDA functions - calendar, appts, todo, notes, voice recorder  And it should've a larger HDD. like 200GB, 30GB just doesn't cut it these days. Hopefully, the expansion slot will make up for this. But all in all, this is an excellent product and I will get one for Christmas

<Title>Great Product but a bit slow when responding to touch screen and reading PDF files
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>4.5 stars. Great unit and its positives have been well reviewed. However, there are two negatives that need to be corrected and which I believe can be corrected with a software update. One, when using the touch screen for input, the unit is a bit slow responding. When reading PDF files, the unit is painfully slow. Other reviewers have made the same observations. If Archos could speed up the response of the touch screen and (cache PDF pages) to speed up reading PDF files, it would solve two of the only negatives on this otherwise fine product.   Update: December 23, 2006 5 stars Latest firmware update (V1.6.05) corrected every criticism in my previous review above. Touch screen now responsive and reading PDF files very quick. Other manufacturers could take a real lesson from Archos. I have spent many years working with computers and their peripherals. Archos has shown themselves to be an extremely responsive company. My hat is off to them. Highly recommend the Archos 604 Wifi.

<Title>Excellent, but with a couple of bugs
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my archos for about two months and I love it!  It has great audio and video quality, an amazingly fast photo viewer, and a gorgeous design.  The wifi is suprisingly fast for a little device, at least two times as fast as the PSP.  However, Archos screwed up in a couple of places, mainly the prices.  Pros and cons below. Pros: -Supports almost any file format out there.  -Can stream from shared folder on wireless network. -The best portable video out there.  -Great sound quality. -Optional videocorder dock works great. -Very colorful screen -Touch screen functionality blows ipod's clickwheel away -Wifi is cool, can download movies to device pretty quick -Sturdy metal body Cons: -When you add up all of the accessories, you are paying about 600 bucks if you want to record movies. -Have to buy plugins to play H.264 and MPEG-2. What a ripoff. -Moving through menus is VERY slow-processor is weak. -Equalizers don't change the sound that much. -Touch layer on screen brings down contrast, sharpness slightly. -No online podcast organizer like on the PSP. But these are small flaws that you barely notice when you are using the device.  If you cannot decide between the iPod, Creative, or other competitors out there, go to cnet.com or dapreview.net. Have fun!

<Title>Must also buy DVR recorder
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the player without realizing that there is no legal download content (other than pornography) for this device. (Don't be fooled by the PlaysForSure. As far as I can tell from contacting the referenced stores, it doesn't really mean you can get content that is playable.) If you want to watch movies on Archos, you have to shell out the additional $100 for the DVR recorder, then buy/rent some DVDs or find what you want on TV, then record onto the device. A lot more expense, time wasted and planning ahead than expected. Support desk was useless.

<Title>Everything I'd hoped for (but didn't get) from the Zune
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I primarily need a device for listening to podcasts while walking or in the car or at the gym. At the gym, I watch a lot of tv shows, and this is perfect. Also great to have on you for those "waiting room" moments or on the train. I LOVE being able to stream video from my PC to this device over my wireless. I seldom use the web browser, but it's pretty slick, and I love knowing it's there.  Only thing keeping this from being perfect is the battery life, which is understandably hammered by the massive screen and wifi, and the slightly sluggish OS, which is constantly being improved by Archos via simple firmware upgrades.  If you want something to strap to your arm while you jog and listen to iTunes DRM protected songs, this is not for you. However, if you want an elite gadget that delivers an unbelievable set of features, then I say go for it.

<Title>Disappointing
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this item because of its looks and because I thought it would be handy to use while flying and being able to watch my DVDs. Also bought the DVR station.  When trying to copy a DVD using the s-video connection, encountered a problem, and called tech support.  Waited on hold for 29 minutes, after which I was told that I needed to remove the s-video and connect using the RCA connectors.  Did so, but could not copy.  Connected the unit to my Motorola cable box using the s-video connection, and was able to copy a tv program, but no audio.  Absolutely frustrating.  The unit by itself is very nice, very portable, and the videos included and the music are fine, but the sound through the built-in speaker is poor.  Prior to this experience, I was having problems connecting to my WiFi connection at home and called tech support.  Waited 11 minutes, and was told by the technician that the device "did not support home-based Wi-Fi."  I reset the unit, re-checked the WEP numbers, and it connected.  This tells me that the tech support is poor.  The manual, all 59 pages of it, has to be copied from the Archos site.  There is an additional manual for WiFi.  Not very clear, does not tell you how to conect the various devices you might want to connect, such as a DVD player, cable box, or TV.  It does not tell you, for example, that you have to disconnect the out cables from your DVD player in order to connect the Archos.  A very attractive unit, very well made, great screen, but the support and the manual are below par.  I finally returned the unit and the DVR station to Amazon, and am now looking for a better unit.

<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 610 wifi is a great product. I have not had any problems using it. It is very straight forward. The only negative I can find is that the Opera  web browser does not allow some pages to open. I have not contacted Archos  yet to see if there is an update. I recommend it.
