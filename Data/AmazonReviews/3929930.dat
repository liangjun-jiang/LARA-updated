<Content>The Coby MP-C7097 is small, inexpensive, and works.  Operation is confusing and built in speakers are not very good - as might be expected.

<Title>4 Stars for what you'd expect

<Content>The MPC7097 is an extraordinary mp3 player for the price. I am sure that I could have gotten something much better for a lot more money but to tell you the truth, I am rather impressed, more so than disappointed.   Pros: The price is unbelievable. There is absolutely everything that I would want in an MP3 player stuffed into this thing. They did a nice job of making the default ear buds also be the neck strap. Video isn't bad (screen is small but hey, it is video!) and it does come with very easy to use video formating that converts anything that I have put into it thus far. It supports pictures, ebook files, various sound files, has radio and various ways to record different things, and can ultimately be used just as a USB drive. THE MEMORY IS FLASH NOT HARD DRIVE!!!  Cons: Well it is cheap so you can't expect everything to be perfect. I didn't like the way the software lined up. It felt really choppy and minute-made. The internal speakers, although a nice touch, are hard to hear. The buttons seem hard to press or at least press so that the player knows you are pressing the buttons. The plastic flap that covered the USB hole fell right off as soon as I opened the box. The player is much smaller than it really seems (this might be a pro for some of you, but I like bigger players). The sound (maybe it is just the ear buds) is all in the treble. There is virtually no bass at all. I have to press a button 3 times before it responds when it shuts off the screen after 2 minutes to conserve battery life. I also found it difficult to understand how to use a lot of what was given to me on the player.  All of the cons to me aren't all that bad for the player. But there they are. Video MP3 players and iPods all seem way to expensive ESPECIALLY when compared to this baby. I think I made the right choice.
