<Title>It's iPod like
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The NeXus is not an XM receiver.  It's XM ready, ie, you'll need the XM passport to play, which is the receiver.  But the XM passport, which comes with the purchase of your NeXus, is good for all other XM ready devices that you may want to own.  Recording individual songs from XM is very easy and you can play the songs again and again without the XM passport as long as your XM subscription is current.

<Content>This XM / MP3 player is so versitale, it gives me the best of both worlds, able to record up to 50 hours of music, plus hours of MP3 songs.  I could'nt ask for a better combination.  Samsung put a great product together with the NeXus YP-X5Z.

<Title>Very sleek, easy to use, quality throughout
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is a great value.  It may not be flashy with a nice color screen, but the display it provides is very informative and easy to view.  The features are fantastic, it does a great job of organizing your music by file name or ID tag it would seem.  I automatically breaks it down by artist, or you can make your own playlists.  I use mine in the car for XM and mp3 playback to my car radio, then wear it on my belt while walking into work, then listen to it at my desk with the included home kit.  Transfer is quick from PC to unit.  Only concerns are that you only get 1/2 GB for mp3s and 1/2 GB for XM recording, there is no way to change this to a greater portion for mp3s, I would avoid the Nexus 25, I couldn't imagine much use for only 250 MB of mp3 storage space.  Also, the remote is a bit weak as far as strength of signal, but how far can you get from the player in your car?  Not a bug issue.  The extra $ makes this unit worth it over the Nexus 25.  Overall the device is top notch, I've only had good experiences with Samsung products.

<Title>A niche product that falls short of expectations
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Unfortunately, I found the Nexus to be a very niche product. I'm sure anyone who is researching this product knows by now that it does not allow you to listen to live XM content on the go. Fair enough, since it never claimed to. However, the idea of this being such a small player only for use of MP3 content and recorded XM content did not impress me.  The screen is incredibly small. Of course, this isn't a problem if you are using this player hand held, or in a situation where you don't want to see the display anyway. However, listening to live XM content is entirely different. Don't expect to have this receiver docked in the home kit a yard away from you, and still have the ability to read the screen.   This also becomes a problem in the car. I drive a small compact two-door car, and had the receiver mounted at eye level on the dash. I could see the display okay. Not perfect, but okay. My passengers, however, could not see the display at all. Before you have the chance to think of any bad eyesight jokes, I have had both an XM Roady 2 receiver and a Sirius Audiovox PNP3 receiver mounted in this same position, and never got any complaints. Adjusting the brightness and contrast didn't do much good. The artist text is easier to see than the title text, as it is in bold letters. Having a black and white screen did not help.  To record live XM content, you must begin the recording within 45 seconds of the start in order to get the entire selection. This may be great when you hear the first notes of a song you know, love, and want to record, but it's a huge flaw for discovering new music. How many of us can decide within the first 45 seconds of a song whether it is or isn't a song we'll want to hear again? Since XM boasts of having the largest play lists on Satellite Radio, how can you assume that song you just heard on Deep Tracks will be a song you will ever hear again on XM?  Wait, you could've just add it to your TuneSelect, so it will notify you next time it is played and you can record it then, right? Nope. The Nexus does not include a TuneSelect. Nor does it even include a memory option, where you can store the artist and song title. There is an option titled "Bookmark" though, where the Nexus and the included Napster software will make it easier for you to find and purchase any song you "Bookmark" when you have the Nexus connected to your PC. However, I could find no way to see what songs I bookmarked without using the included Napster software.  The User Interface on the Nexus could use a lot of help. There are way too many buttons to press to find your way around the unit. Simply going from Live XM to Recorded/MP3 content can take a while. Be prepared to wander around aimlessly with this receiver for at least the first few hours.  Of course, this receiver does not have the 1-10 presets that other satellite radio receivers do. I did find switching between stations more challenging while driving due to this. You can set up a "favorites" category list on the Nexus, but I would have liked more options for customization with this category.   Both the Nexus Home Kit (included with the receiver) and the Car Kit come with remotes. I found the remotes to be pointless though. The remotes could have offered an easier way of getting to your favorite channels, but there was no such option. The number keys on the remote only guided you in accessing a channel if you knew the channel number. If you could dock your Nexus across the room and see the display clear enough, the remotes may have been of more use.  As for MP3s, you are able to search by artist or song title, but not album. You just transfered the entire Led Zeppelin II album onto your Nexus, and you want to play it from start to finish? Well, if you have some other Led Zeppelin songs on your Nexus, you'll have to find "Whole Lotta Love" and begin playing there. The album title will not be displayed on the Nexus screen though, and the track number won't be either. I'm not expecting the Nexus to be an iPod, but I did find this to be an extreme annoyance.   Note that the Nexus can be partitioned to store either 50% XM content and 50% Personal content, or 100% XM content. Don't expect to fill 1GB of your own MP3 collection.  The Nexus also contains a new technology for XM known as the Passport. The passport is a small chip that is docked directly behind the Nexus in the home or car kit. It is not and cannot be physically connected to the Nexus. The passport is only required for Live XM content. If you purchase a Nexus and activate it with XM, you are not actually activating the Nexus. You are activating the XM passport. Essentially, you can purchase as many Passport enabled receivers as you desire and only pay one subscription fee, assuming you will only want to listen to live XM content on one receiver at a time. Of course, this is a plus side to the Passport technology. If you only have the desire to own one Nexus, it can be a real pain to have to carry around and dock both the Nexus and the Passport with you every time you go from the car to home. The Passport's small size could make it much easier to be lost or misplaced as well.  I have heard that satellite radio companies make it hard for thieves to get away with stealing equipment. The victim of the theft just needs to contact the company, and they will blacklist the ID of the receiver so it cannot be reactivated. The Passport makes the Nexus an easier target, since it is impossible for the receiver to be blacklisted, due to the ID coming from the Passport.   Although I am well aware that the car kit is sold separately, I feel the need to mention in this review that I was not comfortable with the cosmetics of the car dock. The bright silver color of it made it very easy to see, regardless of the time of the day or the amount of light coming into my car. Needless to say, I was concerned that this would be a huge theft magnet. Most satellite radio receivers and mp3 player car docks are much more low profile, and for good reason.  Although I'm sure this is the result of stricter FCC guidelines, FM Modulation is only an option with the car kit. Unlike previous satellite radio receivers I have owned, you can use any FM frequency you desire with the Nexus. One thing to note is that the FM Modulation will not work if you have anything plugged into the "Line Out" of the car kit, such as a cassette adapter or auxiliary cables. I was very disappointed that no FM Modulator is included with the home kit.  I can't say there is nothing positive about the Nexus though...  Loading your personal music collection onto the Nexus is very simple. You can even simply do a copy/paste or drag and drop though Windows. I used Rhapsody instead of Napster to load some of my songs onto the Nexus, and it worked perfectly.   I also liked that there was an equalizer included. Of course this is an expected feature of an MP3 player, but it also works with live XM content.   It doesn't play only MP3s either. I have all of my music library encoded with iTunes AAC, with a VBR of 128Kbps. I had no problems with playback of these files.  Overall, the Nexus does what it is advertised to do. I feel the receiver comes short on many features and with it's portability. I noticed the price of these have already gone down substantially since the holidays, and some retailers have already stopped carrying them. It should be interesting to see if Samsung and XM continuing with this design. Hopefully they will address some issues and create a receiver worth while.

<Title>All that I wanted and more!
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I previously had the XM Roady and loved it, but I needed something portable that I was able to use at the gym also.  This radio is perfect for use at home, the gym and in the car (note: a separate kit for the car may be required!  Check the box.  Mine only came with  the home kit.  More detail on this below.)  This radio is small - about the size of most cell phones and is very lightweight.  What I love most about this radio is the ability to record right from live radio.  As soon as a song comes on that I want to record, it's 2 presses of a button and it's recording.  Also, if you don't catch the song until 2 seconds after it's already into it, that's ok... it will record back about 2-3 seconds so chances are you'll get it right from the beginning.  A few times I've tried to press the recording button right after the DJ stops talking, but I still end up getting it in anyway due to this feature.  Also, you don't have to stop the recording when it's finished, the radio will do this automatically.  So far I haven't had any problem with it cutting off too soon or too late.  The sound of my recorded songs is crystal clear, just like CD quality.  It's great to have the option to record from the radio rather than downloading from the internet and paying for it.  If you have CD's you can also upload the songs to your radio using the software they provide.  My radio came with a home kit which includes a docking station, power cord, antenna and red/yellow/white plugs for use with any stereo or TV!  I have a big screen TV and was able to plug the radio into it and listen at home. I do not have a regular home stereo, I have an older XM stereo that it wasn't compatible with.  It also comes with a set of earbuds that are ~ok~ at best, but luckily any standard size plug for earbuds or other headphones will fit if you care to buy a better pair.  For the gym it also has a rubber case with a belt clip that it slides easily into - but is a little harder to get back out!  I have broken a few nails trying to get it out of the rubber case, so beware.  I can't comment much on the battery life, as I usually use it for about an hour a day but it works great for that type of use.  The battery recharges automatically while it's on the home or car docking station. The home antenna has an extra long cord, I'd estimate about 5' long.  The antenna is also about the size of a cell phone and needs access to a window to receive a signal.  I've been able to catch a signal from across a 15x15 room with no issue.  I live in a suburban area in the Midwest, so getting a signal in the car or at home is never an issue.  I get a crystal clear, perfect signal every day.  I have a South facing window at home also, so that probably helps.  The car kit included a docking station, a continuous playing "tape" (for those who have a tape deck in the car) and a power  cord that plugs into the lighter.  If the tape is inserted, the radio will play through your car stereo speakers.  The power cord also has a built-in "FM Modulator" that is supposed to work if you program the radio for a certain FM station (such as 88.1 for example) and tune into it.  The idea is to use that method and play the stereo through the FM rather than using the tape, however it does not work with our stereo.  We have a "Monsoon" stock radio with a tape and CD player in our 2002 Pontiac.  This makes for many cords that can be annoying, but we have rolled them up and used some twist-ties to keep them together and out of the way.  The antenna for the car is a very heavy magnet and is flat.  I've taken it through the car wash without any problems.  The magnet is so strong, you will have to pry it off the car!  Works great.  We ran the cord under the seats, around the side and through the trunk so the antenna is mounted on the trunk.  One thing about the radio that was hard to get used to was how to navigate around and find the menus.  Since the front of the radio only has 4 arrow buttons and 1 "XM" button, it takes a little getting used to.  I was able to figure it out after a few tries and didn't have to consult the manual (thankfully!)  Some common complaints I've heard are in regards to the channels and how to change them.  I have found the best way to handle it is to set channels as your favorites.  Then, when you press the arrow to the right you'll always get your favorites list.  All you need to do then is scroll through and select the channel.  If you don't set the favorites, there is a "manual" input screen if you know the channel number by pressing the arrow to the left.  Or, you can press the arrow up/down to get the entire channel list and scroll through.  The biggest complaint that I have (and it's pretty minor, all things considered) is about the vent mount for the car.  It slides onto the back of the car docking station and has plastic pieces that resemble clips.  I say they "resemble" clips because if they WERE clips, it would stay on better!  There's 2 long plastic pieces that slide onto the vent.  I went over a railroad crossing and out it came, the radio flew out - the docking station on the floor - quite a pain while driving.  I had to rig it up a little to get it to be secure and stay put (I don't recommend this, but I added some thin cardboard in between the "clips" and the vent to tighten it up a little. However, I nearly lost it inside the vent on the first attempt which is why I don't recommend it!)  There is another type of dashboard mount that swivels slightly, but it wasn't easy to see the display while the radio was on it.  Also, it mounts on the dashboard with 2-way stick tape.  Not the best option if you ever plan to remove it.  I learned this the hard way when we had the Roady mounted in our car - the docking station is still there because we can't pry it off.  When you first get your XM subscription, I'd suggest going online to activate your radio rather than calling the 800 number; at times there is a long wait for a customer service rep and it's just as easy to do it yourself. I have activated all of my radios online and they've been ready to go within 10 minutes.  The first subscription will cost $12.99 and each additional is $6.99.  However, if you already have an XM radio and want to de-activate that one and re-activate a new one in it's place, call customer service and don't do it online!  You'll save yourself the $9.99 activation fee if you call and tell them you want to "swap" radios.  If you've stayed with this review all the way through, I hope it was helpful!

<Content>I'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if I had used it; I have found Samsung products to be very good.  I did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my XM Satellite Radio Subscription.  I already am paying costs for two radios.  I purchased this item to have more portable capabilities, but I did not want to incur an additional charge on my XM account.  Consequently, I returned the product without using it.

<Title>Promising, but falls short of being praiseworthy...
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It seems like they put too much effort into keeping this as small as possible, and it is a poorer product as a result. The separate XM Passport is a pain, and it doesn't have nearly enough memory to be useful as an mp3 player, since it isn't that small, and only holds 512 MB of mp3s (it's bigger than a Zune or a video iPod, and when it is out of it's dock, that's what it is competing with). Either it needs to be smaller with this functionality, or it should be a tad bigger with the passport inside, and more memory. If you aren't looking to listen to recorded XM content while taking a walk or something, I'd go with a different model.

<Title>Only so-so
<Date>Sat Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So going from the Delphi Skyfi to a Nexus here are my thoughts.  I don't mind the passport idea, I like it. I used to have two accounts, one for the car and one for the house. Now I only have one and take the passport and unit with me. The ability to record XM is great, I setup a session to record Air81 on BPM. Worked great, small drop out in volume after each 1-hour set but I can live with it.  Did not try loading mp3's, I don't really have any mp3's as I like XM to much.  Now the problems. 7 days into using it, the unit died. All static if any output. I bought a 2nd unit, tested and found that the Passport chip is okay, but the Nexus unit itself went bad. I'm also finding that the passport chip gets VERY hot... almost unsure if it should be this warm but can't find anything online about it.  I'd say, all in all. If you can find the new INNO on sale. Go for it instead.

<Title>Pain in the a**!
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Awesome concept, however I live in an apartment that doesn't have any south facing windows, so I was unable to get a signal.  I strongly advise against calling the XM radio help # from a phone that won't use up your cell phone minutes.  Had to call them four different times, and all they did was read me the instruction manual, and tell me that if I don't have signal my radio won't work (I had clearly established that fact already).  I recieved the radio for free because of a rebate, and didn't even intend on getting XM radio, but figured since the unit was free, and an MP3 player, to give it a try.   I was going to break down and buy the $70 car kit but then I ran across the AGT sportscaster for $20, which came with a car kit.  Since I can't use it in my house, I hook up the home base to the car kit, and at least I can use it that way.  This ended up being a lot of work for something I wasn't sure I wanted in the first place.  Haven't used the MP3 player yet, but napster does not seem the most user friendly.  (I have the majority of my songs on Itunes)

<Title>I Wouldn't Recommend
<Date>Fri Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I decided to get a portable XM that could record.  I love to listen to Coast to Coast AM, but I can not stay up and hear it at 1am.  I decided on the Inno for myself and went to get it.  Last minute at the store my husband wanted an XM, but was hesitant to spend the extra money for the Inno.  That was about a month ago. Last night he went ahead and bought an Inno for himself.  The NeXus, while cheaper, did not function as well.  He had a hard time finding his recordings and they did not seem to play in order.  Overall he felt that instead of an upgrade from an old Roady, this was a step back. It did not work well, he had lots of problems with playing music he loaded onto the unit.  The screen was not in color.  It would lock up a lot. It was a pain to carry the passport everywhere with the NeXus.  I would recommend getting the Inno.  In the long run you will be much happier.

<Title>Nexus50 - A Cool Innovation From Samsung
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Samsung Nexus 50 for a few weeks.  I am impressed with its ability to record each song or each XM satellite channel.  With each song recording, you manually press the record button within the songs first 45 seconds of play, the Nexus50 records the entire song, then stops the recording process.  If you want to record a designated channel for a long period, the Nexus50 gives you 50 hours of recording time and saves each individual song on its own track, just like a compact disc.  The Nexus50 also allows you to schedule the recording of your favorite shows/channels in advance with its built in calendar.  Switching from channel to channel could be a little easier if the Nexus50 was built with a radio dial like I've seen on other satellite radio's.  In addition to receiving XM, it also works as an mp3 player. Provided is a USB cable and software to help manage your content via your computer.  Overall, I enjoy the user friendly functionality of the Nexus50 and would highly recommend it.  Too cool!

<Title>Great service if you never plan on canceling
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....    2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player.

<Title>Annoying auto dropout cuts off every XM tune!
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the Nexus 25 but assume the same problem exists in the 50. When listening to a recorded XM channel, the player automatically drops out (cuts off) the last couple of seconds of each song and the first second or so of the next song. This means you lose the last few notes of every tune and the first few of the next one. This is extremely jarring if you are used to the normal radio listening experience, since like most radio stations, XM's songs are played in a continuous mix without break, meaning normally the next song starts as the previous song fades away without interruption. Even more noticeable is when this happens during spoken moments such as station IDs or jingles. Instead of hearing "The History of Alternative Music, Fred on 44", you instead only get "istory of Alternative Music, Fred on Fo" or instead of "American Top 40 with Casey Kasem", you hear only "rican Top 40 with Casey K". It is just ridiculous and there seems to be no way around it.

<Title>So-so product... be SURE you like XM Radio before you buy
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I stopped using this product after a few weeks because of its limitations, which when added up make it a poor entertainment buy in my opinion.  No secret is made of the fact that this device only picks up the XM signal when it is tethered to its antenna and cradle... you can't get the signal on the go.  This actually isn't as bad as it might seem.  You can easily set up the device to record many hours of your favorite XM channel overnight for example and listen to it on the go later.  You can delete songs you don't like and you will eventually end up with quite a bit of music you do like.  It records XM music at a fairly low bitrate (128 kbps), which does not give you a high quality recording.  It could be that XM's signal doesn't broadcast at a higher bitrate, which would mean this limitation isn't the product's shortcoming, but rather XM's.  The user interface (a 'special' version of Napster) can be extremely frustrating in terms of getting it to recognize the Nexus device until you realize you have to start the software and plug in the device in a particular order, which the user manual doesn't tell you - neither did customer support at either Samsung or Napster.  In fact, I was told things about the device and the software that were so clearly wrong as to be sadly comical.  For instance:  Napster told me the software can only manage music purchased from Napster, which is clearly wrong.  The Nexus manual tells you in writing that "you can only transfer songs [between the Nexus and your PC] that you have purchased from XM+Napster or songs that you have ripped from your audio CDs."  This too is clearly wrong.    All the above in my opinion isn't even the worst of it.  This product, tied to XM Radio service, can obviously be no better than XM Radio itself.  I wanted very much to like XM but could not get over the fact that even though you are paying $12.95 a month, they still talk over the music, and they play plenty of ads and irritating XM 'jingles'.  I have cancelled service due to these issues.  I don't see the point for all the XM-originated chatter and channel ID jingles when you can simply look at your device to see what channel you're listening to (and paying for) if you can't tell from the music selections.  I tried out XM a few years back for a few months (cancelled for other reasons) and the talk-over and extraneous jingle issues seem much worse now than they once were.  I have found internet-based sources of free music that is free of ads and chatter, and which can be recorded on your hard drive with various available software... and at higher bitrates that are of noticeably higher quality.

<Title>I'm ordering this radio to use along with my Nexus 25
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a Roady XT as well. but it isn't portable.  I took my Nexus 25 to a dental appointment today and listened to my favorite show while having treatment.  As James explained in his review, you are paying the subscription for the passport mini tuner, and can use as many radios as you like with it.  Only radio one at a time can be live.  And each radio must be connected live at least 8 hours a month.  This is a good value.  The passport mini tuner alone is retailing for $30 at my local Best Buy. If you're interested, Google XM Passport and see what they have planned for it.

<Title>XM Satellite billing issues
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>XM Satellite billing issues  I had read this earlier on posts regarding XM's billing practices but thought it was just that person's problem or misunderstanding. Unfortunatley, I was wrong.  When you sign up for XM online you give over your credit card # which is then in their greedy little paws. After trying one of their radios for a few weeks I decided there were some good features but nothing worth keeping. I returned the radio to an area big box store w/o any issues.   I had only paid for a 30 day subscription with my credit card but they continued to bill me.   Links on the web site for unsubscribing lead to another page of links w/o telling you how to unsubscribe! When I called to find out why they were continuing to bill me one representative gave me a runaround saying that even though they could cease billing me they had to bill me as the radio had still been running (this is well over a month after returning it)!. Eventually they agreed to a partial refund even though I do not trust them to not bill again.  For those who might say this is not about the equipment listed on Amazon, I believe it's impossible with satellite radio to unlink the radio programming or the billing issues from the equipment. This is not Amazon's fault, but I think consumers need to be warned.  If you must try XM, I would highly recommend using a credit card that you add money to for any individual purchases not your usual purchases. I do not, however, think they're a very honest company.

<Title>Meets Limited Expectations Nicely, Constrained by the XM Format
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First XM offers superior music to Sirius, sounding better, stronger stereo signal. Unless you absolutely must hear Howard Stern, XM is the better choice for music fans.  Second, this package from Samsung is well-designed with all the features you need to get on XM from your home. Remember the unit cannot tune in live XM while you walk around, only when it is docked. This is fine, as efforts so far to provide true mobile access from XM and Sirius have both been pretty miserable, with portable shoulder mounted antennas and large uncomfortable oversize headphones that sound rotten, and barely functional signal tuning even with the stupid devices. Live personal non-car based mobile access is neither feasible nor desirable with current tech. Instead the Samsung records up to 25 or 50 hours of XM broadcasts and then plays them back later as you walk around. A good compromise, and you can get live tuning when the unit is docked. You can connect the dock to your home stereo, but the kit does not include an FM transmitter so you must use a wire connection. This kit is all you need to get up and running, and is a lot cheaper than other options from XM or Sirius. If you want cheap satellite radio, this is it.  The Samsung Nexus is a decent player. Controls are easy to figure out, and the screen though tiny has all you may need on it. The player feels a bit lightweight and plastic, and the MP3 function is an afterthought as the memory is small and devotes half of the space to XM files, even if you don't need or want that much space. As a result, you can only have half a gig of your own MP3s on the Nexus. (512 MB of MP3 files? Why bother?).   The real issues with the Nexus are really issues with XM. I think it's fair to link XM service to this product in the review, as the Nexus is pretty much useless without an XM subscription. XM service to me is a big "maybe" as there are three major issues with the existing service.  First, you may not be able to tune anything in. Land based transmitters are only available in several big cities, and the satellite system is dependent on your location to the southwest sky and the signal interference in your area. I work in downtown Manhattan and have a clear view of the Southern sky but despite this I could not tune in a usable signal from either terrestrial or satellite based broadcasts. I could tune XM in fine from home, but as I explain below, I have no real need for XM at home. Before you activate your account, make sure you can tune in the XM Sample channel One, which you should be able to do without subscribing. If you can't tune in the sample channel, don't bother activating the unit, send it back and spare yourself the heartache of dealing with XM subscription service.  Second point, XMs efforts to keep subscribers at any cost make AOL look like amateurs. It is literally impossible to unsubscribe from XM. I tried for three months in a row on a prior subscription, and could not get the account closed. I was promised they would close the account, credit my card back etc, and even after half a dozen phone calls to different agents and even supervisors, the account was never closed and no credits were issued. XM Staff gave me a few months for free when I tried to close the first time, and I got the impression they would have given me some more free time when I tried to close the account again, so if you like calling up and threatening to cancel periodically and getting some free extra months out of the deal, this may be for you. But if you think you may ever want to close the account and walk away, you are in for an ordeal. I finally called my credit card company, and they cancelled future payments to XM and refunded me my last month of unwanted charges. The credit card customer service dept said this was a common problem with XM Radio accounts. Unless you are certain you know you want XM service indefinitely or forever, think carefully before subscribing.   Final point: who needs XM? If you have a computer with internet access, you can get dozens of free internet radio stations with similar quality and variety to what XM offers. If you drive and want XM, this may be a good fit if you don't mind choppy reception and sudden drop-outs on occasion. But if you are at home, you can do as good or better than XM for free on your PC, and by using various wires or wireless gadgets you can broadcast the signal from your PC to your home stereo. Yes, the gadgets cost a bit, but this is a one time charge, not the endless $13 a month that XM charges you till the end of time. My employer blocks streaming internet radio on our corporate firewall so I thought I would get XM so I could listen to the service at work, but as I said above, I could not tune it in. I don't need XM at home, and don't want it in my car, so I sent the Samsung back to Amazon for a full refund.  Moral of the story: if you are sure you like XM and want to subscribe for the indefinite future, if you can tune the broadcast in, and if you are really sure you can't meet your radio diversity needs in any other way than XM, the Samsung Nexus is an excellent and inexpensive way to experience the medium.

<Title>Another discontinued XM radio for too much money
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Once again, Amazon demonstrates its inability to offer competitive prices for contemporary, non-discontinued products.  This radio will not function as a satellite radio without using the docking stations.  While portable it only plays recordings on the internal memory.  The radio does come with a home docking station but you will have a hard time finding the car kit because all Samsung XM hardware has been discontinued as of early 2007.  Not only that but the car kit is large and awkward for use in a car.  Part of the reason is the sheer bulky awkardness of the docking kits, which not only require you to plug in the NeXus unit but also require you to plug in a little 1"x1" cartridge in order to receive satellite radio.  Carrying around two units, one of which is the cartridge, makes this a really bad design for people who are comfortable with carrying their satellite radio from place to place--all the other XM radios are better at this, which is ironic since this is supposed to be a portable unit.  Interesting concept but poor execution and it's too bad Amazon.com is still only a bookstore web site.  It's still selling this thing nearly full price even though we are over 8 months from its being discontinued.

<Title>Absolutely love it!
<Date>Tue Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As long as you understand that this device is NOT Live XM, then you'll love it.  I'm using for my long commute, and some of the areas do not get good XM coverage.  So having 'recorded' content is actually a plus.  I just record new sessions overnight, and grab it to go the next morning.  Another plus, it the tiny size (much smaller than the ones that have the transmitter on board).  It is so small, that I don't even realize it is in my pocket.  A few other reviewers mentioned a 'break' or 'gap' between songs.  I have NOT heard this at all. Listening to recorded content is identical to live content on my device.  And the recording sessions are nicely organized so you can listen by Channel, by recording session, by playlist, by artist, or by individual track.  It was super easy to install and activate too.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat!!

<Title>great product- very versatile
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently decided to get XM radio rather than invest in an ipod, so I purchased the Nexus xm player. I love that I can record songs from the live xm radio while I'm listening to them, and switch between live xm and mp3 mode. If I am not in my car or at home where I have the xm receiver, I can take the mp3 player with me and listen to songs I recorded from the radio or songs I downloaded on my computer.  The player is easy to work using the remote control that comes with it, and you can save your favorite xm channels for faster access to them.   The only drawback is having to remember to bring the passport if I switch between my home dock and my car- basically I have to keep the player and the passport together all the time so I don't forget the passport if I'm in my car. Also, the screen is kind of hard to see if the player is not right next to you.   Other than that I think the nexus is really versatile and great for someone who wants an xm radio and a basic mp3 player. It's also a really great deal because its so much cheaper than other xm receivers and has more features.

<Title>Much better than a MyFi...
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>We used to have a MyFi and a friend purchased a Helix and neither unit is ready to be called "portable".  If I have to hold the unit up in the air to get a signal - it's a waste.  Since these units don't allow you to wear them and play them (unless you live in NY City), we opted to the Nexus.  It's smaller and we don't have to "position" it in a attempt to get a signal.  With 50 hours of music, we have lots of content for exercising, hanging at the beach and working.

<Title>Excellent Radio!  Love it!  Love it!
<Date>Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had a SKYFI2 and my husband has had the Myfi XM2GO.  This radio is by far the best of all!!!!  I record songs that I love just by a couple of touches of the buttons.  So very easy.  I thought I would miss the preset buttons greatly, but there is a favorites list that does the same thing.  I am thrilled.  It is incredibly small yet very easy to navigate.  If you are worried about being able to navigate this thing while driving, don't.  Just be sure you mount it up high.  I made the mistake of having my SKYFI2 too low and it was very difficult to drive while using it.  I have not used this out of my car yet, so I can not say how it does.  I have listened to the recorded songs and they are several clicks away, but still easy to get to.  All in all, I highly recommend and my husband is going to get one too.

<Title>What I've Been Waiting for...but Get the Car Kit
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device meets all of my needs as both an XM radio and a MP3/WMA player. Just keep in mind, that unless you have an input jack on your head mount in your car that you need the Car Kit (YACP200) to listen to this device in your car. In comparison to the Inno/Helix the only thing that makes this device less than perfect is that it does not have Tune Select (in other words it can't detect other artists or songs on another channel). However, this is okay because if you switch to the other song you cannot record it because of the delay it takes for the radio to detect other streams. In addition, if you live in an area where there are no XM terrestrial modulators the fact that this radio does not have an antenna built in does not really matter because you cannot pick up a signal on the go anyway.

<Title>Just as good as the Inno/Helix if not better! 
<Date>Thu Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Some reviewers of the Nexus 25/50 XM portables will have you believe just because the Nexus has no color display or live mode, it is inferior to the higher priced models The Inno & Helix, well they are wrong in my opinion. The Nexus aside from no live mode, color display and tune select is basically EXACTLY the same as the Inno & Helix! It does everything practically they do except its ALOT cheaper.  The whole point of walking around with a portable is to have HOURS of music so if the Nexus models do not have a live mode outside the home/car cradle is not the sharpest of points to be making. You can record 25 hrs or 50 hrs which is ALOT of XM content or MP3s if you chose to transfer your collection to the Nexus. My old MyFi/Airware would break up and lose single when I was walking around so being able to listen to recorded songs that like instead of having to switch over stations when I hear songs I dont like, is great! No live mode? Bah! Who cares!  The color display is fancy sure but did it make me want to spend a heck of alot more on the Inno & Helix? No because i cant afford it. If I could, I possibly would have but I like to save money. The display on the Nexus is just fine, it shows extended song information, even more then the color models I believe. Its clear and sharp so again not sure why some reviewers think this is a horrible thing.  It's very easy to schedule recordings, everything goes off without a hitch, this player is a true delight. Recording up to 50 hrs of XM content is heavenly! I can now record The Twilight Zone, countdown shows on my favorite pop/rock stations & individual songs. Plus battery life is very good!   Some reviewers are suggesting the Nexus to the stepchild of the next gen models & thats completely false. If it had come first, everyone would be loving it but since it came after the color models, people's attention are on them. The Nexus does exactly what it should, it's compact, it records 50 hrs of music, it's easy to use. The Nexus models are just as superb! BUY IT NOW!!

<Title>This is a great product!  Stay clear of the Sirius Sportster 4!!!
<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Going against my better judgment and the other Amazon reviews of the Sirius Sportster 4, I decided to purchase it. The first warning I should have just returned it? A big orange card in the packaging indicating "The aux in port on this device does not function. Ignore references to it in the documentation." Note that I also purchased this product with the home kit so that I could use it in my office.   The whole point of subscribing to satellite radio for me was so that I could listen to it while working in my home office. Normal radio is too cluttered with commercials and they play the same songs over and over again. I had a positive experience with XM in my Chevy Impala. Being curious to hear an uncensored Stern led me to look into Sirius.   I followed the installation manual, pointed the antenna as instructed (west, with an unobstructed view of the sky). I verified the antenna direction with a compass and Google Earth. This radio just did not work. All I got was static and the preview channel was choppy. Checking the signal strength showed that I was only getting two bars. And, that was the best I got. It continuously fell back to "Acquiring Signal." So, I decided to try their tech support. As other reviews have noted, this was a dead end.   The first time I contacted customer service, the rep said "Um, I'm not that familiar with connecting this device without using the FM transmitter." BTW, the FM transmitter sucks on this product. I was told where I bought it "The FCC filed a suit against both XM and Sirius and the both reduced the signal strength of their FM transmitters." Um, OK. This radio had to be directly ON TOP of the receiver in order to work. When I asked why I couldn't activate my radio on-online (another story altogether) and get the offered $5 discount, her response was "On-line activation is always hit or miss. Just tell them you tried to activate it on-line and they'll give you the $5 credit." Sigh. She then connected me to tech support, who promptly disconnected my call after 2 - 3 minutes of being on hold.   The second time I called customer service, I was connected with their overseas call center. They took my information and put in the tech support hold queue. Guess what happened? I was disconnected after 2 - 3 minutes of being on hold and listening to clearer music than I was getting in my Sportster 4.   That was the last straw. It went back in the box and back to the store.   After returning it, I decided to try the Samsung Nexus and XM service. The difference was night and day. Flawless installation, crystal clear reception, instant on-line activation. And... I couldn't tell you what their customer service is like. Why? I didn't have to call them. Everything just worked. I should have just stuck with XM from the beginning. It would have saved an afternoon of frustration.   Sorry for the lengthy post, but I can't say enough bad things about the Sportster 4.  Nor can I say enough good things about the NeXus.

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just love this player!  It is much more compact than my MyFi XM radio.  If you like recording XM radio broadcasts, this is the radio for you.  With the click of a few buttons you can organize your recordings in a variety of different manners (artist, song, recording session, category).  This also makes it easy to select one of the organizing folders and delete those recordings.  I like to record a certain talk show every day, then I organize it by "artist" and delete all the commercials in a matter of seconds.    You can also fast forward through a recorded selection, (useful when they get on a boring topic)which is another thing the MyFi couldn't do.  With 50 hours of recording space you can have a large selection - all recorded effortlessly from XM radio.  One thing I wish they would add is a few additional choices for scheduling recordings.  They are the same as the MyFi - one time, daily, or every day.  It would be very nice to have "every week day" and "once a week" (like every Saturday).    The tuner card is so tiny - I look forward to the release of car and home stereos that have a slot built in for that tiny little tuner.  That will make your one XM radio subscription portable to multiple radios - cool!

<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had so many frustrations with Samsung and this product.  I had bought this as a birthday gift for my father in August and only now is everything working.  He had barely used it a month when it froze and would not work at home or in the car.  Samsung customer care told us to send in all parts (including home and car kits) to their service company and that it would take 7-10 days to fix this.  2 months went by and we had no response.  I finally screamed loud enough at enough people and I found out a part was on permanent backorder.  They sent a replacement radio, but not the car kit I sent in.  I had to work with 5 more people and get sent to second level support to get a refund for the car kit as they could not replace the part.  I finally bought a replacement car kit and the new radio started freezing again - just like the first one.  We did end up getting it to work after removing the battery about 5 times and restarting the unit.  4 months to get this radio working is way too long and I will make sure to steer clear of Samsung products.  I myself have a Pioneer Inno and it was wored beautifully since day 1.

<Title>Cool device, clunky UI
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Nexus 50 is an intriguing device that fills a desire that I've had for years.  In my office, you can't listent ot radio (Satelite or FM) because of interference and a lack of windows.  My musical tastes are eclectic, and I am very annoyed by the song repetition found on most popular music stations.  I've long wanted to record interesting radio programs for playback at the office.  The Nexus fills this desire admirably.  I can record content at home, then play it back at the office.  I can add some or all of the tracks from a recording session to playlists, and can skip tracks that I'm not interested in.  So, what's not to like?  Well, there's the UI, which requires at least 8 button presses to add a track to a playlist, and 10 button presses to delete a track and doesn't provide fast-forward or rewind within a track.  It also doesn't let you schedule a recording session while listening to recorded content -- only while listening to live streams, which can only be done while the device is sitting in a powered base unit and has active reception through its antenna.  Lastly, if you repartition the memory (partitioned between recorded XM and your MP3 or WMA files), you lose all of your recorded content.  And if you want to have even one MP3 or WMA track on the device, you have to give up 25 hours (or 50%) of the device's XM recording capacity.  The DRM restrictions on this device are onerous, if not entirely surprising.  You cannot extract recorded tracks from the device.  And you have to connect to live XM frequently (more than the 8 hours/month listed in the users guide might lead you to believe) in order to have access to your recorded XM content.  Then again, this is not entirely surprising, as you technically are paying XM for radio-like usage of the tracks -- you are buying a service from XM, not buying content.  If you plug the Nexus into a PC running the provided software, it will help you find and purchase your favorite tracks from Napster.  So, what we have here is a device that fills my requirements better than any other on the market, but is marred by several restrictions and an annoying user interface.  I'll keep using mine, and won't grumble too loudly about its weaknesses.  I would give it 5 stars if the UI weren't so clumsy.  As it is, I give it 4.
