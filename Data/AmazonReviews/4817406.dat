<Title>Not worth the money
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You are probably looking at this item and thinking the same thing I was thinking before I bought this: It's very cheap, doesn't look so bad, and what can possibly go wrong. Boy was I wrong. After the first week, the garbage headphones that it came with stopped working. After a month, the sound kept on going on and off and stopped working the next week. It is also very hard to navigate around this thing. Save yourself the time and money and buy yourself something like the SanDisk Sansa m230 which is a little more money, but probably worth it. Now I'm stuck with a broken mp3 and I am going for the  m230. Trust the reviews. The people that gave this a good review, probably rated this a day after they received their mp3 player. I should have trusted the reviews before buying this. Don't get stuck with this like I did. I only rated this 2 stars, since it lasted 5 weeks.

<Title>They don't last
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased three of these this summer. I am now back to purchase something different. For the MP3 part :: One died quickly and quietly. The other two took awhile.   When you first get them they work great but after awhile they start to act up.  At first it is little glitches in the interface and then they just up and stop working.  You can replace the battery and do a reset but that only works temporarily.  It must be some tiny part or something that wears out. The voice recorder and as a Jump drive they are still working today. If you are buying as a JUMPDRIVE and VOICE RECORDER Go for it.  The MP3 part of the deal is not worth the time or money!

<Title>Nowhere near as bad as made out to be - come on people!
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a Machspeed Trio 512mb nearly 2 years ago and it is working just fine - STILL!  So, to the reviewer who thinks the people giving a good review are probably reviewing after just taking their product out of the package and reviewing with one days use, I think you are not being fair and your comment is out of line.  Maybe this device works differently than others (?), but it does work!    I just purchased another unit for my adult daughter to use when she works out and bought the larger memory, same unit.  Since I plan to give her a "gadget basket" full of modern technology for Xmas (she still uses floppies...) I was trying to keep the prices in line and why I chose this device.  I wanted to set it up for her and load it with MP3 files so that when she opens, it is all ready to play.  I suppose the saavy factor should be the other way around but ironically, I am an older person who has had experience with gadgets and my daughter - d/t her lifestyle and studies, is only just beginning, and why I wanted to get her set up.      Upon opening the package I plugged the unit into my PC USB and opened as a removable drive.  Amongst the software and such pre-loaded onto the drive, there were 2 pre-loaded songs that played on my PC just fine.  Next, via drag and drop, I loaded up the unit with MP3's, closed the drive, removed from my PC USB, added a battery to the back of unit, turned it on and proceeded to set up the device.  Additionally, I chose the white background as I find the colors make the text difficult to read.    Maybe I should have read the directions (and I am female, lol...sorry guys) but I did not and relied on my intuitive skills...  Initially, I was a bit frustrated until I discovered how to use the rocker switch atop the unit but after that it was smooth sailing!  I don't care much for the sound quality via the supplied earbuds, they lack the features of a decent set of buds - but that seems commonplace with "almost" any device with supplied earbuds.  With that in mind, I purchased better quality buds for a reasonable price and resolved that issue; said and done. Of course it would be nice to have quality buds come with the device, but this is not an iPod and that was not to be the case, plus, I liked the inexpensive pricing!  Better buds come in an assortment of pricing that is not outlandish.    It seems to have a bit of a delayed start-up and the menu took a bit of patience to scroll through, learn and set up - but if old me can do this, I would venture to guess most anyone can tackle this too.  This player is all plastic and feels like you'd want to handle with care and hope to not drop.  Maybe even get some kind of a clip or velcro fastener strip for carrying.  With my older player, the USB cap lost it tight grip and would easily slip off and I suspect this device will do the same.  A piece of masking tape holds my end cap on (ugh).  My older player has some scratches in the casing, but otherwise, plays very well and lately, I have been using it as a portable storage instead of dedicated music player only b/c my cell phone conveniently has MP3, FM and voice record. This device works both ways if you outgrow it's memory size, or whatever...  Also, with both players, I find it too easy to erase songs, thus keep back-ups loaded on my PC just in case that happens. Or you could say that I only copy my songs to the device verses moving the file.   Additionally, there is a "hold" switch on the "bottom" of player for lock and unlock that can easily be bumped and one might want to keep that in mind.  As well, upon set-up there is an option to how your files will play, so make sure you have that set to your choice so you aren't left wondering why another song won't play, or not playing in order.  Optionally, one can plug this device into a portable speaker unit to enjoy your music while in the bathroom, fixing your hair and getting ready, or whatever may apply!  Overall, this player does exactly what it claims to and with better buds, sounds even better.  I like it and don't understand what all the fuss is about.  For this price, I'd give it 5 stars if it came with better quality buds...but then the pricing would go up!

<Content>But works well once you figure it out.  Does anyone know how to turn this off without taking the battery out?  I just ordered two and the poorly written manual indicates to "hold the play button down for seconds."  I held it for 5 seconds, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc....nothing turned them off!  Help!

<Content>I'm 13 and I had bought this with my Christmas money in hopes of having my first mp3 player...but, when I gave it to my dad to put the program that came with it that's supposed to make you be able to put music on it and all it came with was an upgrade for the program.Then, my dad went online trying to find a link and when he clicked on the link it had a black screen that said YOU ARE AN IDIOT  with a scary clown voice and i started crying cuz i was dissapointed or something and my dad eventually figured out how to put music on it without the program cuz he's a whiz at that stuff so... remember that if you try to buy it

<Title>Great for kids!
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a simple mp3 player for my 6 year old (and my 38 year old too) but I didn't want to spend $80 or more just to have it get lost or forgotten somewhere.  Even the so called "kids" mp3 players available are at least $80 or more in the toy stores.  I found this one for under $40 and it has been a great bang for the buck!  It actually does a bit more than I expected for the price.  It allows you to scroll through menus to choose music, ebooks, sort through your albums and even has a little voice recorder.  The voice recorder is great fun for the kids.  It is smaller than I expected too but the buttons are easy to learn and it is so light weight.   The earbuds are less than comfortable, but what do you expect when they "come with".  For the price, don't expect alot of bells and whistles, but this one has enough to compete with the pricey models out there.

<Title>Bogus Rebate!!!! BUYER BEWARE-UNDERHANDED COMPANY THAT CHEATS THEIR CUSTOMERS! 
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased many items with rebates last Christmas. Digging through my records it looks as though this is the only one that didn't come. I bought it and mailed the items out correctly, and on time.  Today reading the small print and wondering why I didn't get my money, I discovered it says you have to wait 10 weeks to get your rebate, but if you don't receive it, you must contact them no later then 120 days after the promotion ends. So you have to wait 70 days, then somehow remember that you were not sent the rebate, but before 120 days is up, you have to remind them that you still want it. Otherwise you forfeit your rebate. What a scam this is. Shame on you Machspeed Technologies. All for a stupid $10 rebate. Very underhanded company.  Now to just post this review for every item they sell!

<Title>Not recommended
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My wife bought this for me so I could record audio quickly and scroll around playing back stuff and deleting what I don't want.  I find it to be a completely unintuitive product.  Most of the display is unreadable to my 50 y.o. eyes, even with reading glasses, and it has just been $40 worth of frustration for me.  The audio quality seems good, the features sound good in the manual but implementation of them is another story.  I thought I was just impatient and needed to read the manual more carefully, but after I did that I found the manual was just flat out wrong or misstated some of the products functions.  Example:  Manual says to turn player on, press and hold play button for 5 seconds.  This is not true, you simply press it and it turns on.  If you hold it for five seconds it turns off.  Manual goes on to say that to stop playing a song you hold the play button for 3 seconds.  This will actually turn the whole player off.  5 seconds are not actually required.  Having the same button that with one press turns the player on, with another press plays a song (if you are in the right mode), with another press and some amount of holding pauses the song, with another press and more holding but not too much ends the song, and with yet another press and more holding turns the player off is simply assigning too much responsibility to one button.  The interface is unusable to me, I would not buy from this company again.

<Content>i love this mp3 , the price is very convient , me and my wife purschased it , and then we got one for   our son ,   my  mother in law  got one , so did my wife's aunt.  the point i am trying to make is you can't lose with machspeed. it plays good , the headphones are not that nice , if you like your  music loud , then you should buy new headphones.  i love this mp3 player , it holds  about 110 songs,  depending on the size of the music .  it has nice features  you may need to play with it , just to get the feel of the features.i have no  problem with it.  the manual doesn't explain much.  i played around with it just to understand the features. overall i am happy with it. the battery life is decent.  it averages  about  20 hours on  one 1  AAA   battery. for the  price , you wouldn't be  dissapointed

<Content>This MP3 player is basic, but easily workable.  Good throw weight for the money.  Advantages - I plug it in to the USB port - the Computer sees it as a USB drive - I throw MP3 files on it - it plays them for me. Simple, direct, no muss, no fuss.  Disadvatages - the controls are a touch arcane and don't always work (I turn mine off by slapping it against my thigh to dislodge the battery, breifly.)  It does exactly what I want (Plays MP3s for me while I am at work or in the car) without being a hugely expensive "Name brand"  Jay ~Meow!~

<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my daughter for Christmas.  I was not expecting much for the little money I paid for it, but I was pleasantly suprised at what a nice player it is!  It's small, lightweight, durable & the menu has a lot of customizable features for such a small device.  It's very handy that she doesn't need any cords to plug it into the computer; just remove the cap & plug in the onboard USB connector.  And the battery lasts a lot longer than I would have ever imagined.  Wonderful product.  I am going to buy one for my other kids as well.

<Content>The picture of this product on Amazon makes it look nicer. Considering the price though, it just barely delivers the amount of quality you would expect. It consumes many batteries (but I guess that's what they all do) so get rechargeables. Sound is good, storage is good. File transfer rates are slow.  I'd suggest investing in a higher quality brand.

It was complicated and no where near what I thought it was going to be. I wanted a recorder, where you have "REC, PLAY, STOP, REW, FEW."  I got this thing and it has an ear piece that I never saw on the web site before purchase. It was a horrible buy. It's sitting here.  I won't use it.  I think this might be the last time I buy from Amazon.  Thank you for the chance of review.  Have a nice day.

Plus the so-called "10-hour" battery life is really four-hours and 47 mins. Song capacity is more like 75, even with small files.

<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Machspeed Trio 512 MB MP3 Player is a very usefull and handy mp3 player. The only thing I didnt like about this product is that it doesn't have the radio function the 1 gig version has.. Thus not being able to record off the radio either.. The voice recorder sounds ok but could have used a better microphone.. This device holds about any where from 4 to 8 complete albums depending on format and size of files.. This model includes about 6 or 7 dif background lighting colors and settings to control how long it stays on. The machspeed trio mp3 player also has settings for recording bit rates, and play modes, as well as an ebook setting which I couldn't figure out how to use. Also has six dif eq presets and navigation functions. This device last about 2 or 3 days with a cheap triple aaa batery and about 8 or 9 days of use with a regular energizer. The earphones that come with this unit don't sound as good as ipod earbuds but are ok sounding. Upgrading the earbuds does wonders for the sound of this device or you can just use it as a line out to your sterio. This mp3 player is a good choice if you want a simple easy to figure out mp3 player, allthough you might wanna go with the 1 gig version for around the same price..

<Content>For $30, it's worth it. I found no problems with the quality of sound with the headset it came with. I just wanted a simple, cheap mp3 that can hold a good percentage of songs for my walks....and this does it. I didn't have to install any programs, my computer just recognized it as a USB drive and I transferred my songs quickly.  Some things I wish it had?  - an on/off button. I read the manual and stuff, but nowhere did it say on/off button...but I think if you leave it alone for a little bit, it turns off by itself. (correction:  just hold the play button for a little bit, and it'll turn it off!) - a mode switch between the voice recorder/mp3. I have accidentally pressed the voice recorder a couple of times and I couldn't switch back to the mp3 without taking out the battery.  - a way to browse through the music. All it has is a scroll on its side and that's how you go from one song to the next.   But nonetheless, I got what I want. A cheap, functional mp3 that can suit my needs. If you want something fancy, this isn't the mp3 for you, that's for sure.

<Content>I purchased the 512mb unit. I have gone through three and still do not have a working unit. The first one I purchased, the left channel of the ear bud gave out. The second unit had power up issues and would not turn on. The third one also has the no sound ear bud issue. I would have returned this one also but the problem occured after the return period. The problem occured 35 days after I received the item. Now I'm stuck with this piece of junk. I have spent additional money to return the items in addition to the original purchase price. To top everything off, I sent in the rebate and after 18 weeks I'm still waiting. I have requested a status update of the rebate but no response. I purchased the unit because the rebate made it an attractive buy. Now I regret ever purchasing this inferior product. BUYER BEWARE!!!

<Content>Be careful when buying a mach speed product. Customer service is non existent. If you email tech support they will reply asking for   you to call them. Buying a player like this is a gamble. Save yourself the pain of begging for help and buy a reliable brand like Sony.

<Title>Great value absolutely lousy customer service
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought two of these and they work fine and sound pretty good.  After the rebate they were a great value.  However, Mach Speed's customer service is absolutly lousy.  I have email back and forth with them close to ten times just to get a rebate.  They don't respond quickly and don't appear to have any idea what they are doing.  I can say that I have spoken with their tech support a couple of times and they seemed to be an entirely different company.  I wouldn't recommend them however because they just haven't got it together.  Without the rebate there are much better brands.

<Title>easier than i thought

<Content>Great little unit, no software required to use it, just plug it in to the USB port and drag songs on to it! As for actual use it was kind of mystifying until i called their tech support (who spoke english!) and they explained that the little toggle switch on top fo the mp3 player is also a mode switch to get between menus. All in all a great buy, good sound, good price, and easy to use (once i figured out the mode switch).

<Title>Avoid at all Co$t
<Date>Fri Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this three weeks ago, It is built cheap, the buttons are low grade plastic.  The first time I pressed the play button it got stuck inward and I had use a bent staple to pry it back to the regular position.  after one week it would cut off for no reason, I tried to lock it in place hoping that would fix the problem, I also bought new batteries;It still did it, any sudden movements like running or walking would turn it off.  After 10 days the power would not come on at all.  This item is poorly made for the price, I should have paid a little more for a better product.

<Title>Cheap price, but cheap unit
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I challenge you to find a 512MB player with LCD screen, EQ, etc. cheaper. It's impossible. It has all of the features you'd want and works as designed. However, the unit has some issues as follows:  * Terrible battery life. I've tried a handful of different NiMH and Alkaline rechargables. Battery life is a handful of hours. Batteries drain fairly quickly while the unit sits unused. * Terrible sound on a weak battery. Once the battery meter indicates anything less than a full charge it emits a background hum and distortion mixed in with the audio. I have to recharge the battery after every trip to the gym to negate this. * Headphones cord 1' too short. There's no accessories for this so you're stuck with it in your pocket. But the headphones cord is too short to stick it in your pants. Terrible. * Won't skip randomly in random play mode. * Is thick due to the use of a AAA battery. * No tech support. I emailed the company about some of the issues I had, and asked how to use the 1" string as a lanyard (must be some joke) and never received any reply, autoated, scripted, or otherwise.  If it weren't for the battery issues I keep experiencing I'd probably give this 4 stars purely due to the price and features. However, it's annoying me to the point where I'm ready to get a different player. Something with a built-in battery that charges on the USB like an iPod.

<Title>Cheap is cheap

<Content>I have two of these.  They both had the same problem. They play the first song and then shut off. I tried all  sorts of batteries, to no avail. Changing the name of the songs, la di da... why the hassle? You get on your bicycle and press play. Then at the end of the first song it just shuts off. You have to stop to try and figure this out and nope, it just plays one song.  Intolerable. Not worth even the $30- Useless player.  The two players sit in the drawer until further notice.
