<Title>Large size good price
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Outstanding hard drive space for the price, the ear buds that are included are of excellent quality, and I'm completely addicted to it.  The best feature is putting my entire music library on shuffle and listening to things I've ignored for years.  I'm still not always crazy about iTunes but I'm getting used to it.  It's completely changed the way I listen to music.

<Title>beyond expectations
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was virulantly anti ipod. They were for noobs, kids, non tech savvy. I had an iRiver H320, which could be hacked, rockboxed (alt operating system), had line in recording and FM, and a big geek factor.  It played videos before ipods (albeit choppy quality and totally a gimmick). It is drag and drop from windows explorer, no itunes interface needed - well that is a superior feature ipod just doesn't have. I loved that thing. I still have it, but it is only 20 gigs. iRiver doesn't make them any more or support them. it is heavier and fatter than an ipod.  Enter my 80gb ipod video. Form factor - A+. slim, light, portable. Usage factor A. simple, slick interface. click wheel a bit too sensitive, but you get used to it. Video - A++ - biggest surprise for me. Thought it was a gimmick, but video quality is amazing and you can easily output to a TV. Even on 50" HDTV screen, videos are great - VHS quality. With some qeek abilities, you can find excellent free software online (DVDshrink, Videora) to enable you to rip any DVD (or captured youtube video with Videodownloader) to mp4 and have it on your ipod. 6 hours video is plenty.   accessories - A+++. Sets these apart from other brands. Bought a Belkin Tune Talk Stereo, and it is now a digital recorder, capable of 3 hrs of recording live music or ripping old lp's or cassettes to digital. speakers, chargers, cases: huge assortment online for any taste, budget or functional requirement.  80 gigs - what can I say? HUGE storage ability. nothing else comes close.   itunes software took me a while to get into, but it is easy and just fine. I still prefer "UMS" ability to just drag and drop from windows explorer onto player as though it were a hard drive, without any extra step in between. But itunes has some advantages for music management.  all in all, totally satisfied. (But I still use my iRiver now, almost exclusively as a digital recorder) Rockbox is coming for the 80gb ipod, however....!

<Title>Excellent for school
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm at college frequently and sometimes I have several hours between classes. This is perfect for those times when nobody is around to talk to and you need some long term, or short term entertainment. The screen is a little small, but its not painful to watch. With an 80gb capacity, I managed to cram 600 hours of video onto this little guy, which will give you about 300 movies, or 800+ tv show episodes. You can cram probably double the amount of music on here if you don't care about top audio quality (as if you can get it through the regular ear buds anyways). The games are excellent, especially tetris, which has kept me addicted for many hours. You can listen to and skip through music while you play your games as well. It is the absolute best investment if you frequently travel or have a lot of downtime on the go, especially if you don't have the space for larger electronics like a laptop. I do not recommend using the itunes store for anything but games, however, as all of their products come with DRM that will only allow you to play it on the ipod and your PC,  which means when you want to buy a new player, you are out of luck.

<Content>I have to say, I promised that I would never buy an iPod, but after the addition of an 80GB model (and the capability to play Pac-Man!), I was finally wooed. The effortless podcasting integration is also a winner. I had a Creative Zen Vision M, but this model is over twice the size and is thinner. I wish it had more filetype compatibility, but it is so easy to use. This is a winner.

<Content>Having this expensive toy is certainly something of a "what one wants, not needs" thing, but what I personally appreciate about it is the portability of it, combined with its ease of use. I can stash my recorded TV shows, all music, pictures, and every single piece of music owned in one spot, and view these here if needed. Play it thru my car's plug in or on speakers, or even jst headphones. It's pretty easy to use once you get the hang of the wheel dial and how to use it. One big plus is how it updates so easily when I plug it into my laptop - and charges too!

<Title>Excellant Apple product

<Content>I've had a different mp3 player but sold it to go with a video iPod. I don't regret making the switch. I've loaded it with books on tape, tv shows, and music and it works well.  I'm not fond of the click wheel but I'm getting used to it. By biggest quibble is iTunes. Since it's a free program I try to cut it some slack but I dislike it's organization scheme - much prefer Music Match. And while this review is supposed to focus on the product how can one ignore the program that makes it work?

<Content>80 GB Ipod arrived in non working condition. Seller would not replace,reffered me to Apple support. Item was repaired and returned in 3 days but continues to have problems. I had to buy extended warranty from apple ($60) because I know this unit is a dud. On it's 3rd trip back to Apple repair for same problem (Static/distortion through headphone jack & Docking interface). Item arrived quickly and what appeared to be good condition from seller but with all the problems I've had I wish I would have bought locally so Item could be returned/replaced instead of repaired. Was not worth the $50 I saved by buying online. Seller has little to no control over this, unfortunate experience with my first Apple product for me.

<Content>I received this iPod as a Christmas gift - I would never have gotten it for myself.  I mean, who needs 80 GB of MP3 storage and the ability to play TV shows and movies in a miniature screen?  Aparently, I do.  I love this thing.  I have loaded tons of music on my iPod, a season of SouthPark, some old Star Trek episodes, and I have 60 GB space remaining.  Plus, the screen quality is remarkable!  This is a very cool device - and I am not an Apple fan.  One thing - I am told they scratch easily, so I was quick to get a case for it.  I suggest the iSee case by Contour Designs.

<Title>Ipod...not bad, not bad at all
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay, let me start off by saying that I too was once one of the many people who were determined to be completely anti-ipod. When I bought my first mp3 player (a 40 gb creative zen) I strayed as far from the ipod as possible, not wanting to conform and be like everyone else who had them. I had my zen for a little over a year and it really was a terrific player; easy hardware and software, no silly click wheel, organized my music perfectly. I guess I should mention that I'm also one of those people who has yet to increase my music collection digitally. I'm still old-fashioned in the sense that I prefer to buy CDs instead of downloading music from the Internet or from a music service. Anyway, like I said, the zen was great but it didn't hold pictures, store videos, or even have a color screen. Not to mention, it was quite large and bulky. That's when I decided it was time to seek a new mp3 player. The zen was so easy to use and I didn't want to part with it, but it was definitely time for an upgrade. When looking for a new mp3 player (what would be my second) I did my research, trust me. I knew that I didn't want to lose any space so I narrowed my search to players that stored 40 gb or more. That's why I ruled out the Zune, which, though attractive in many respects, only had a 30 gb version available. After hours(seriously, I probably spent a full 24 hours overall) of intense research, I narrowed my options down to the 60 gb Toshiba Gigabeat and the 60 gb iAudio. Still not wanting to submit to the conformity of the ipod, at first I was leaning toward the Toshiba Gigabeat. It looked like it was very user friendly and had all the same features as the ipod and more. But then when reading the customer reviews I saw that users suffered from frequent crashes of the mp3 player and lost entire music libraries. Plus tech support was not very supportive. The iAudio was also very enticing, especially because it included an FM radio component. But then I noticed that it had a maximum file limit of 10,000 files. Even though it advertised 60 gb, the iAudio really only offered 40 gb because of this limit. That brought me to the dreaded ipod. The size and popularity of the thing finally won me over and I purchased one. Although I'm losing credibility in the non-conformist department, I'm really glad I made the purchase.  Pros: great battery life bright screen, crisp, clean picture tiny! easy software with itunes (and for me who still uses the cd method, all i have to do is pop a cd into my drive and itunes automatically asks me if i want to add the tracks to my itunes library, it's really simple) the click wheel really isn't that bad, just a little getting used to holds a crazy amount of media, music, photos, videos, 80 gb is all i'll ever need  cons: you can't actually do anything on the ipod itself, like organize music, delete songs...everything has to be done on the computer doesn't come with a charger, you must charge through your computer and often times the warning "do not disconnect" comes up on the screen until it is completely charged  In the end, I really like the ipod. It's worth the money. I'd recommend buying a case before you take it out the box though, because it is unbearably prone to scratches (not pretty). Also, make sure that you don't charge it when the battery is only half or a third of the way empty. Wait until the battery is completely empty before recharging and this will preserve the life of your battery. The ipod really is a great buy. If you're like me; a music addict, then you won't be disappointed. Hey, sometimes being a sheep isn't so bad.

<Content>No problems.  If you don't know what it is by now, your in trouble!!  One of the best features I love about the Ipod (and I'm not sure which models have this features), is that I can do a photo slide show, by syncing a folder of pictures and a song playlist.  I went out to "Five Below" and they had a $5 A/V cable that connects from your speaker jack of the Ipod into your TV.  For the holidays, I put family slide shows together and it was a big hit!!

<Title>Go with 80 Gig if you have movies in mind
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, you will find the anti-Ipod group will find something wrong with all apple Ipods. I've been using Ipods for around four years and my first Ipod still works fine. In fact the oldeset Ipod I have is permanantely placed in my car. Now the new 80 Gig, buy it if you plan on downloading movies and TV shows. Some of the shows I watch happened to be broadcasting at late hours. For example I love Jay Leno, so I purchased 20 episodes of his show for $10.00 from itunes ( I think that's the cost). I travel quite a bit and killing time is priceless. I use to carry a laptop plus all the movies I wanted to watch in a case and sometimes even a portable DVD player. The convenience factor is amazing if you are willing to pay the premium price. Although I wish they have more movies in the Itunes store along with a cheaper price tag (that's not going to happen anytime soon).

<Title>One star docked for the freezing issue
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This new Ipod is a great improvement in general over the 4th generation.  I'll agree that there is a minor problem with freezing up, but it's likely a very well known problem to Apple and it will get fixed in a firmware update sometime relatively soon (they're probably focused on getting Itunes working correctly right now - now THAT is something that is in desperately need of updates to work correctly.)  In the meantime, I think I've discovered a very simple, temporary, albeit unwieldy fix: don't use the Hold button.  I have found that nearly every time I've pause my 80gb Ipod and then used the Hold button, I've unpaused and unlocked only to find my Ipod frozen.  Since I stopped using the Hold button, no freezing.  Inconvenient?  Definitely.  You'll have to weigh which is more annoying - having your Ipod play randomly in your pocket if it gets bumped or whether you have to center-button/menu reset it all the the time and lose your place in your songs.

<Content>This is a great product.  It does what it says on the can, however you do need to make sure that you arrange your music well on the PC prior to importing it as the IPOD wants to be the king and control what you do.  Its a little bit "big brother" in the way it prevents you doing things like burning your own CDs etc, but I manage that via WMP and then import it to itunes.  Seems to work quite well.  Great product, not sure how to get movies onto it yet but time will help.  Highly recommended.

<Content>I waited all this long to own an ipod and now I feel this 80 gig ipod is worth the wait. It has met all my expectations and I am really a very happy ipod owner.  One cool enhancement that I am very happy about is its bright display compared to the older ipods. I store my dvd movies in the ipod and watch them while working out. The clarity is excellent. The new search feature is good too. I can get to any of my favourite albums in no time thanks to the search.  The only thing i hate about this ipod is its ear phones. They don't fit into the ears thanks to the 'cool' design changes that apple made. Then, they got rid of the foam cover just to make things worse. As these covers are not sold seperately, you are forced to buy another set of ear phones from one of their accesory vendors.  Overall, this is the ipod i like and would recommend to everyone. And I wish Apple would do something about the earphones :(

<Content>If you plan on using all the features of the Video Ipod - Videos, pictures, games, and of course music this is the one to get. Easy to use as all Ipods are, and plenty of space. However, even thou its slightly thinner than the 60gig, still kinda of bulky. I use my Ipod mini for jogging or activities in which the size of player matters. This Ipod has been a great addition to my car stereo, especially for those long road trips.

As an owner of 600+ CDs, I was tired of lugging around two cases back and forth to work full of CDs, only to want to listen to one I didn't bring.  So 80 gb of space is ideal for me.  Now I'm never without any CD in my collection, with plenty of space on the hard drive to spare.  Only (slight) problem I've had is the freezing issue.  However, it's never frozen on me during playback, just twice as I connect it to load songs on.  But it's still not that big a problem to warrant docking a star rating.  Enjoy!

I love having this to listen to all my music and watch all my music videos, TV shows, and movies all in one.  I would seriously recommend it.  Plus it's mainstream, so there are lots of add-ons you can buy for it.  I use and would recommend erightsoft's SUPER (freeware video encoder) to go with it.  It encodes to the right format (.mp4) at great quality at a variety of resolutions.  And if you have DRM complaints, just don't shop at the itunes music store; don't blame this device for it.

<Title>Works Exactly as Advertised
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 80Gb IPod is awesome.  I have been a PC person for many years but this may make me think more about Apple.  The IPod does exactly what I expected.  The sound is terrific.  I have about 6500 songs or about 25Gb of music.  That leaves plenty of room for as many movies as I want.  Even the ear buds sound great.  Plays great in the car with a FM transmitter.  The real beauty is that it syncs up with ITunes and no intervention is necessary.  The only hiccup is that ITunes does not have a feature to re-sync itself with the music on the hard drive (3rd party SW is available for free).  I highly recommend this product.

<Title>I love my iPod!
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The thickness of the iPod is probably 25% thinner than the 60 GB iPod Photo, and it is noticeably so.  This makes it easier to carry around in your pocket (if you don't have a case).  The screen is larger.  This is noticeable as well, and is a welcome upgrade to previous versions.  The headphones that ship with it have been upgraded.  Nothing spectacular, but if you are familiar with the older iPod headphones, you'll notice that these are a little more streamlined.  Just a visual difference, not an auditory one.  One complaint: There is no longer support for a remote control.  The audio input into the iPod is a single circular hole, and not the circular hole with the small rectangular hole right next to it.  This really annoys me because I can no longer use my remote and store my iPod in my holder while I am working out.  I suppose this was intentional by Apple to move people away from using one iPod for everything, and forcing them to an iPod nano (or a shuffle) if they want to use it to work out.  Well, I guess it worked, because I had to buy a shuffle so that I could control the iPod from my hip, because it just wasn't feasible for me to take it out of the case to raise the volume or skip the song.  That annoying debacle aside, I love the product.  On a separate note, the video playback works really well.  There is one neat thing, however, that Apple doesn��t make it easy for you to find out about: You can actually output video output from your iPod to your TV, and it looks great.  Your iPod is, in effect, a personal video player, and you can play your movies and TV shows on any TV as long as you purchase the Apple cords (which run about $20) or use the exact same cable that shipped with an iPod Photo.  Just hook this cable up to the iPod, and then to the video and audio composite inputs on any TV, and then adjust the following iPod setting.  Go into your menu for Videos Then click on  Video Settings then click on TV Out and change it to ��ON�� or to ��ASK��.  (��ON�� means videos won��t play on your iPod screen, only your TV, and ASK means it will ask you every time you play a video �Vwhich is what I prefer.  If you want to see it on your iPod just choose ��No�� when it asks you ��Output to TV?��, or choose ��Yes�� if you DO want to do see it on the TV screen.)  This function is really cool.  Now you can download TV shows on iTunes and take them on the road and play them in a hotel room or at a friend��s house.  This really makes the video iPod MUCH more useful.  I wish I had this when I was a consultant and traveling a lot: this would have made my evenings on the road a lot more enjoyable!  Oh, one more thing.  This iPod plays games as well.  There are not so many to choose from yet, but you can pick things like Pac Man and Tetris.  My favorite, however, and the only one that seems truly optimized for the iPod control wheel is Mini Golf.  I highly recommend that as a game purchase.

<Content>SO FAR, this product is preforming as I'd expected. The only thing I'm disappointed in is it doesn't seem to have a "photos" tab/section like it does Movies and Music where you can isolate photos you want to store on it.  The battery lasts surprisingly long time.  I bought an APC extended life (10 hour) portable batter for it (about the same size as the iPOD...last 10 hours), but have yet to need to use it and I've watched a full movie (2.25 hours) and still had plenty of battery left.  My last Photo iPod's hard disk bought the farm WAY too early and the cost of fixing it was over half the price of a new one.

<Date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are a lot of MP3 players out on the market but this is the most marketed version of them all.  The advantage of mass marketing is the availability of any accessory you ever need or can imagine.  That is why I chose none other than the 80 GB and the 30 GB IPOD video.  Since we also own the Bose speakers, I figure that we should have both MP3 players branded by Apple.  Initial set up requires charging the unit which is through your USB cable or the Bose speakers.  I chose the latter.  Next, I proceeded to download iTunes.  Set up was easy and I just added my library by dragging it into the iTunes window.  Sound quality is very good for a compressed format but still doesn't compare to the actual CD.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  The simple design keeps me from messing things up.  Playlists are easy to set up.  I converted a DVD to see what it looked like on the IPOD.  I can say that it's not bad looking to watch a movie (micro-style).  I may download some TV shows and other videos from iTunes in the very near future since it's convenient and priced appropriately.  I do recommend getting a screen protector before even opening the box so you don't get a nasty scratch on it.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZYGTM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9917419-1952141">Belkin F8Z085 Protective Overlays for iPod Video</a> The bubbles are a pain to get out but scratches....are more intolerable.  I got a plastic Ascent 18 Case which works well and is very durable.  It even has a stand. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I3MHCS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-9917419-1952141">Agent 18 VideoShield Case for 60GB and 80GB iPod Video</a>  You cannot go wrong with either the 30GB or the 80GB versions.  Downloading Podcasts or Vodcasts are so easy.  It's so easy to subscribe to programs. That is the greatest advantage to getting the Apple.  I highly recommend this product.

<Content>Getting a video onto the iPod takes QUITE a while, and it's pretty complicated. Also, ALL of your songs better have their correct ID3 tags, or you'll get the 'Untitled Artist' syndrome, where all of your songs will be titled incorrectly. Another drawback is that you CANNOT get the songs/photos/videos off of the iPod after you put them on there, you can erase them, but you cannot just drag them off onto a computer. Other than that, I like it. Nice, clear, bright screen, pretty simple interface.

My wife used a cd ripping service that takes your CDs and converts them for you to MP3.  Saves tons of time and the music and data are far better than with iTunes.  I don't use the ear buds that came with it.  I am old school and have studio head phones.  Now I need to get a stereo hookup so I can listen to the music  on my hifi stereo.  Can't recommend it enough!

<Content>How come you don't own one already?  EVERYone has one of these things. C'mon, you're not "cool" unless you got an iPod, man.  I bought the 80 gig black one cause I think black electronics are slick. I went with the 80 gig version, cause you can NEVER have enough space in electronics. So last year I made the leap. It's nice.  Sounds fine - depending on what you're playing it on - some speaker systems are better than others - but it's a great thing to have. No more burning CDs, or using my CD changer in my car. I use a microphone jack in my car stereo and a $12 cable to plug this thing in. This thing takes scratches and fingerprints like crazy though, so in no time yours will look like you've had it forever. There's a reason why these have sold so well - THEY WORK THAT GOOD. The iTunes setup is nice, the functionality of the iPod is unparralleled in simpleness, and it just looks cool. Mine has frozen up at odd times now and then, but it hasn't been a huge issue.  It's a slick thing.  Are you STILL reading this?  Dude, get thee an iPod, NOW.

Haven't downloaded a movie yet, but for music playback it performs well, and also for photo storage/slideshows.  Being new to Apple products, I wish it came with a few more details in the instructions.  It would have been helpful to know right off the bat how to disconnect it safely from iTunes after syncing without having to download the manual first to find out.  The earbuds were not very comfortable, and I had to get a different pair.  Overall I would highly recommend it. It is definitely the coolest electronic toy I have ever had.

<Content>After many years of my mother trying to convince me that I wanted a iPod, she gave me one for Christmas. I was excited because I like to listen to radio programs and I knew that some of my favorites were now "podcasts," though I still wasn't sold on transferring all of my CD collection onto a little media player. After the first few days of using my iPod, I was HOOKED. I now have over 1,000 songs on my iPod (and I'm still not done transferring my CDs), 70+ podcasts, and some of my favorite television shows. I am selling most of my CDs since there are over a hundred that I only like one or two songs on. The convenience of these things is amazing. And how about that video screen? The picture is amazingly clear - I've watched quite a few television programs on it already. I'm sold.
