<Title>Nice player but not flawless
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The good: Line-in encoding. Voice recording. Equalizer. Long battery life.  Small. Lightweight.  Easy-to-use.  Portable.   The bad:  Skips between songs-there is about a 1-second pause between songs. Cuts off the first second of every song-it will start at 00:01 and not 00:00; this can be circumvented, however.  The "Favorites" playlist will re-order itself by album name if you turn the player off and back on again. Quite annoying, actually. Shuffle and Repeat One modes take up tons of battery.  Does not seem to be compatible with any format of playlist. Also quite annoying.  The clock is always two minutes off. You can only set the hour, not the minute.  The earbuds short out quickly.  Sometimes it freezes; a quick punch of the reset button fixes this, however.  Scratches easily. The back, at least. As in if you put it on too hard a table and whisk it off, it will have a new scratch.   I like my player, but, as my library grows, I'm going to be looking at new models with more space, more compatibility, and a more durable design.

<Title>"Does not" IPOD 
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As with most folks that are new to MP3 players we tend to go with what's well advertized and, well "Hot". So we look towards IPOD. After looking at the price tag of the IPOD and hearing of the difficulties with I-Tunes. I did some research and found this product to be superior in every way. It has many sound options that IPOD does not, it is more compact, it works with many on-line music store programs, it has an FM radio, (IPOD does not) It is cheaper! Why IPOD? Go with this little beauty, you'll be much happier.

<Title>Nice for the first 3 months. From then on, hell. 
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It looks like the best player ever made. Until, of course, the warranty expires.   And then we find out everything wrong with it...  It scratches more easily than you would believe.  Every new album I've put on it has blanked out the entire player and made me have to format it and resync my entire library.  It holds nothing like 1GB of songs. More like 900 MB. It records so quietly you can hardly hear it.  The earbuds hardly work.   I would not buy this again, given 70 bucks. I would go for a completely different brand, different model. And next time I won't be fooled by 4 glowing reviews.

<Content>This item was returned to the manufacturer. It was great to look at and had wonderful sound. The graphics were really good but overall it's a poorly made unit. There's a lot better buys out there than this one.

<Title>Good for a while, then, 70 bucks down the drain
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mini MP3 a while ago and loved it. Good radio, nice sound quality, and beautiful graphics. But then, it became possesed and said I needed to "re-sync every freakin' song to listen." ?!! RE-SYNC?!!!! I ALREADY SYNCED IT, I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN!!! So, I format it and attempt to download again, but the software rejects it once again. I get mad and break it accidentaly, and then I lose the stupid thing it's so small. Take my advice, avoid the un-neccasary anger and don't buy it. There's lots of other good quality MP3's out there, this ain't one of em.

<Title>Loses it's mind
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit runs ONLY on Windows XP, there is a patch that supposedly allows it to work on Windows 2000 Pro, but the patch doesn't work for ANYONE I know, so don't bother.  I travel a lot, so I enjoy the FM stereo, and the recorder comes in handy for meetings and such... No complaints there.. mine is also one of the ones that gets excellent battery life (MANY people say the battery life is poor, and about an equal number say it's excellent.. go figure)...   I use it literally every day, and have for over a year now.  My only real complaint is that once in a while, it loses it's mind (or at least it's place).  I listen to a LOT of Audio-books with it, and sometimes it skips to something like "Track 5" and re-starts there at the beginning of track 5 EVERY TIME you turn it off and then back on, even if you are only on track 2 (or the middle of track 2).  It will keep starting at track 5 (or wherever) until you listen past that track, THEN it will either clear up and do right, OR it chooses some NEW random track to start on every time you turn it off and back on... USUALLY it starts back right where you left off, but AT LEAST once per book it starts doing this "random place starting" thing, and once it starts it, it will keep doing it until you listen past where it's decided to start..    I have NO idea why it does this, but I have mentioned it to several friends with the same unit, and they say theirs does it too when listening to Audio-books saved as MP3 files (The Conversion software used doesn't seem to matter.. I use Goldwave, but others use Cool Edit, or Windows Media Player's "Save" feature to convert the audio books from CD [or Audible] to MP3). It's no big deal when listening to songs, but it's not fun trying to find your place every time you re-start an audio-book that may be 30 hours long... especially of you are driving.  It's aggravating enough that it's causing me to look for another MP3 player after a year of this, which is why I am here right now.

<Title>Sound could be better
<Date>Thu May 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A nicely designed little device with lots of power, though not much storage compared with others with similar prices.  I've had mine for about 10 months now, and haven't had any problems with it freezing,as other reviewers have mentioned, but it does refuse to set the date and time properly, but that's just a minor convenience to me.  The best features of this, however, are its recording capacities - line-in with excellent sound quality, beautiful FM recording, and a pretty powerful audio recording feature as well.  It picked up most of a conversation I had with my dad one afternoon, for instance, all while lodged within my backpack.  The only real drawback I find to this player is that its sound quality when playing music files is noticably inferior to my portable CD player, even when I'm running lossless files.  The sound settings improve this a bit, but not enough.

<Title>Life-altering device
<Date>Mon May 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Tiny, easy to use, with a capacious memory and excellent sound, this device has freed me from the tape players/recorders, CD players, and radios I used to carry evreywhere. It allows me to download, without cost, many books from my public library (whose system won't work with an iPod). It plays for a long time before needing recharging and then can be recharged either on the computer with a USB cord or same shaped cell phone charger with wall plug. Ever the cheapskate, I bought this refurbished but ir has worked beautifully. The sleep timer function (along with my pillow speaker)allows me to go to sleep listening and more important go back to sleep after waking. The FM radio works well but I haven't tried the other functions. My only criticism is not for this player but the general family of digital audio players: they are all designed for music listeners, not book listeners. We may be a smaller part of your market but we exist and would appreciate being taken into account in instructions, labeling, etc.

<Title>Good player with limited storage
<Date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned two of these players and other than the 1G storage, I would put them up against anything out there. The "street mode" boosts the output so that even the lowest volume files play with plenty of punch.

<Title>Great for Tween users
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these for my 9 y.o. daughter last Christmas.  She loves it!  It's small enough to fit into her pocket and has a little hook on top for charms or a lanyard strap.  The MP3 is easy enough for her to use by herself when downloading her favorite music and family photos.  I would recommend this to anyone with younger kids.  The battery last a long, long time between charges via USB on any computer.  Don't buy the super expensive MP3s, this one packs a punch for much less--- holds tons of media files, plays FM radio, and records. The graphics on the screen are cool too.

<Title>Battery recharge problem
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If the battery worked I would rate this unit a near 5. I really like this player and I wish Samsung could fix it. If the battery drains completely the player can't be recharged and will not turn on. I've sent this player back to Samsung 3 times for this problem. Samsung returns the unit, after 3-4 weeks, working and fully recharged but the problem happens all over again. Now it has happened for a 4th time. Samsung is either unable or unwilling to fix it. I'm stuck with a lemon.

<Title>Can I get one in 8gb?
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Almost 3 years ago, I think, I got this little samsung. It has traveled across the world with me and survived a freezing winter in Eastern Europe. It was probably the best mp3 player I have ever had the chance to use. I have dropped it multiple times, it's been tossed and squished and banged up and still (for the most part) works. But sadly, it no longer works and I've had to replace it. None of Samsung's products seemed as good as this one, and I ended up getting a Zune. But I still wish they made this product in an 8gb form. Exactly this one, because I love how sturdy it was. I worry about breaking my Zune...
