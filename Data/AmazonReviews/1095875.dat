<Title>Not a Breeze to Set Up, But Well Worth It
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When Apple finally enabled lossless format files to be ripped and managed through iTunes, I thought it was time to finally transfer and store all the CD music. I had experimented with playing MP3s on the home system (plugging in the iPod, burning MP3 CDs--even wirelessly through TiVo), but I was always thoroughly underwhelmed by the playback quality; no matter how much 'fixing' you could manage by way of EQ, etc., there was a distinct lack of "presence" in the music. On a decent home system, playback is only ever going to be as good as the source, so lossless became the way to go. But how to port the playback??  Enter Squeezebox.  First let me say that this marvelous device (or, more specifically, the SlimServer software that powers the thing) is not really ready for the masses. Although I am no IT wizard, I am fairly adept at common computer technology issues (at least on the Mac platform), and this was definitely a bit of a challenge for me. In fairness, I have always found that any new new technology worth having somehow seems to come with its share of hair-pulling; I can't really think of any sophisticated device or application that was actually a breeze to set up and learn. My situation was also not the most common: I have two iTunes music libraries, one filled with low-quality files (MP3s, AACs) for sync with the iPod, and one on an external, 320GB hard drive exclusively for home playback. SlimServer does not handle this circumstance partcularly well. When you first set it up (which I did twice, because I acquired a new Airport), SlimServer will automatically find and scan your "most local" iTunes library REGARDLESS of how you have set the preferences. Twice I needed to "clear library and rescan everything" in order to get access to the right library. Plus, the scan can take a long time, and there is no scan progress indicator (this definitely needs to be added in a future release).   For those familiar with the ease and intuitiveness of the iTunes interface, SlimServer will be a bit of come down (and you DO manage playback through SlimServer--not iTunes; I wasn't at all sure of this when I purchased or set up the system, for it is not explicitly stated anywhere; what you can continue to use iTunes for is MANAGING the library and the playlists). SlimServer has all the features you want, including album cover art, and it works, but it is considerably more cumbersome than iTunes.  All that said, however, the technology is, in a word, breathtaking. CD quality sound, and your entire music archive managed from your desktop. Plus, an absolutely elegant readout device (the Squeezebox itself) that not only displays the currently-playing song data, but facilitates library and playlist browsing via the remote. Sweet. I've only had the set up for a couple of weeks, so I'll have to see if I run into problems down the road (I note several comments here about issues emerging later on), but as long as it continues to perform as it does now, it has been more than worth the temporary frustrations in set up.

<Title>Clear, crisp quality
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own both this and a Roku Soundbridge M500.  The Squeezebox is FAR superior although marginally more expensive.  Why?...   - Sound quality is excellent  - Wireless connection never drops  - Navigation is fast  - Screen is easily visible across the room (font size can be increased)  A few gimicky features:   - SqueezeNetwork, I've played with it a little (podcasts and international radio) but I just don't use it.  All I really use it for is to play purchased music.  - Synchronizing multiple devices (PC server, Soundbridge and Squeezebox) to play the same music has some lag between players.  This may work better with multiple Squeezeboxes but I doubt it.  - Alarm, screensavers, visualizations.  If you want to play music over a wireless network this is a great solution.

<Content>The Squeezebox payoff is that you get your whole music collection in the living room with a pleasant looking and easy-to-use interface. The job requires you to pay $300, install an application, neatly organize your music collection, and keep your computer running. Don't apply for this job if you don't know what DHCP, Server, IP-Address, mp3, and 804.11g are. The audio quality is very good.

<Title>stunning display & very flexible codecs
<Date>Sat Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the wired version. I love the product because you can play just about any format. The display is stunning. Squeeze did an outstanding job on the hardware. However, a year ago I boxed up my family room stereo along with this device. The Apple Nano has spoiled me for life. I may eventually hook my Squeeze & stereo back up, but I'm not holding my breath.  PS: Many hours went into developing the software for this product. The developers put a lot of sweat equity into it and made the playable formats very flexible (mp3, ape, flac, wma, wav, etc...). But it is browser based and a bit quirky. I would have preferred an exe, just a preference.

<Title>A good addition to my A/V system
<Date>Tue Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a dual-purpose device for my living room: 1) access my MP3 collection on my computer and 2) access Internet radio.  I needed 802.11g since running wires just didn't appeal to me.  I would have liked it to have a built-in hard drive to store my music files in order to be able to leave my computers off, but that wasn't necessary.  I did not want to have to have my high-def TV on just to listen to audio, so it needed a display of its own.  The SqueezeBox came as close as I could find within the price I thought the budget committee would approve (I got it recently direct from SlimDevices at $249).  I considered AppleTV and Roku and a couple of others.  AppleTV doesn't do Internet radio as of yet; it does have a hard drive; no display.  Roku is 802.11b only, which would drag down my D-Link router, and many people have been less complimentary about its sound quality.  One nice feature of the SqueezeBox is the inclusion of digital audio out.  1)  I installed SlimServer on both a PC and a Mac iBook with little difficulty.  ITunes is not needed, but if iTunes is your thing, it integrates well.  I have my files organized by boys/girls/bys&girls/classical and so forth directories, and then by artist within those, and the SqueezeBox lets me browse within those directories quite easily.  You can choose a directory and push Play, and all files within are played, shuffled if you so desire.  (Note, the "Favorites" playlist here is best ignored.)  2)  The Internet radio feature (SqueezeNetwork) has been very good.  I listen to Pandora a fair amount, and this device is good for that, though it will cost $3.95/month.  I also listen to a station my wife and I did a weekly show at (KXCI, Tucson, AZ) many years ago--you can add most any streaming site to your own "Favorites" within SqueezeNetwork.  In addition to Pandora, RadioIO, RadioTime, Rhapsody, and Live365 all integrate into the interface without any cost (unless you want the premium services).  Altogether, the SqueezeBox gives me access to a lot of services in my living room and without having to sit at a computer.  So why not five stars?  Well, because I can't choose 4 1/2 stars.  You see, the form factor doesn't quite fit in with other A/V gear.  Given the large front panel it would be nice to have used more of that acreage for three lines of display.  The set-up was initially frustrating, but I got over that, and so I do suggest this for someone with technical familiarity.  Others have mentioned some reliability problems, but maybe those were early production runs.  I will certainly keep in mind those experiences in a year when the warranty is nearing its end.

<Title>I wanted it to work, but...
<Date>Mon Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I already use Roku Soundbridge M500 / M1001s to stream music around the house, using iTunes as the server. More recently, I bought a Squeezebox v3 based on the online reviews, which spoke highly of the audio quality. After 3 months' I gave up and it now languishes in a drawer - one of my Soundbridges has taken its place.   The problems with the Squeezebox were several: 1) Sound quality - the wifi connection just kept dropping out all the time (i.e. every few minutes). This never happens with my Soundbridge and my router/access point is only 3m across the living room. Sure, I could run cables round, but they would be unsightly and I live in rented accomodation, so channelling the cables into the walls is not an option.  2) The slimserver software was more sophisticated than iTunes, but the flip side is that I found it to be much less user-friendly. I prefer the simplicity of the iTunes / Roku Soundbridge combination, without the need to run a separate server. 3) Navigation at the device (as opposed to at the PC) is (IMHO) a lot weaker than Roku's. On the Squeezebox, I had to scroll through all album (or artist) names, whereas on the Soundbridge I can scroll by letter and then drill down to the names - much faster. I accept that the PC interface is much better for the Squeezebox, but I wanted it to use in the living room i.e. away from my fileserver, so ease of navigation at the device is key to me. Font size is comparable on the Soundbridge M1001, so that is not an issue for me.    In the end, the Squeezebox's lack of reliability rendered it useless; I could not get it to play a single track without it cutting out. I replaced it with one of my Soundbridges and since then have not looked back. As for audio quality? I never got far enough to find out. Shame.

<Title>Not ready for prime time, but getting there
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Like other reviewers, setup was relatively painless and I got it working on day one (familiarity with wireless networking needed).  After a week's time, with new songs and playlists added to my library, the bugs started to appear, and now I can't get it to play anything (though it does receive the data with no problems over my network).  Numerous rescans, software re-loads, and interaction with the help desk couldn't get humpty-dumpty back together again. I am hoping that the open software has some good engineers behind it so that the bugs will be worked out and I can use it.  Great concept and great while it worked. Sitting broken on my shelf - not so good.    September 2007 - since a recent software update, the device is back up an running (so far without flaws).  If you are willing to go through some computer-related stress to get results, it's a solid product that makes your library of music sound great on any decent hi-fi setup.   If I could update my star rating, I'd bump it up to 4 stars, since I've been 3 months without problems and I'm pleased with the performance.

<Title>I also have nothing but silence
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I too can relate to all of the reviewers who can not get sound.  Slim Devices drops my wireless signal about every three minutes.  It is very rare that it will play a whole song.  I have tried a linksys G router, a US Robotics router, and now a D Link router.  I am not using other wireless resource while it is playing besides my latop.  All of my other wireless devices show "excellent" signal strength while this thing can not seem to locate a network.  Customer support said it was my router's power settings.  I am on my third router from three different manufactures and I think it is the sqeezebox.  I would recommend passing on this product as I am sitting here playing MP3s on my laptop speakers looking at my Squeexebox screen stating its usual "Problem, can't find a wireless network" message.

<Content>Ok...no problems here...has worked perfectly from second one...sound quality is truly outstanding...ability to play back not only mp3's but multiple higher-quality formats (.wav and flac)...the internet tuning capability works fantastically well (tune by city, genre, popularity, etc.)...but what really makes the unit is the interface, it is speedy and intuitive...highly recommended.

<Title>Amazing! Even I can do it!
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have recently decided to enter the 20th century and made my computer/printer wireless. Then, what the heck, how about the stereo too. This is new and daunting stuff for me (I'm much older than 14). Once I got the coumputer wireless to satellite (LinkSys), then came the print server (NetGear)--no problem with either. The stereo connection was simplest of all. In less than 20' (including reading the instructions) I was streaming my CD collection to my stereo. Only one glitch. After about 1/2 hour, the computer-squeezebox interface (Web) failed to find the Squeezebox. What fixed it was going through the Squeezebox setup again. (It had everyting I had previously entered so I just stepped through.) I has worked for the last 2 hrs. w/o problems. If you don't hear from me again on this, assume that it is still working well. Frankly, I'm amazed that this suite of mixed-maker products work together. I know, they should, but realistically, how often do electronics interface as they advertise? ADDITION: After a month or so, I still greatly enjoy this product, but there are glitches. When my network goes down, sometimes the Squeezebox does not come back up with the rest. I found that unplugging it then going through the setup menu (accepting everyting as it is presented) brings it back up. Simple unplugging and powering up does not work. Also, I have Panasonic home theater with wireless back speakers. I had to move the WiFi to channel 11 to prevent interference and buy new wireless phones too (Panasonic DIRECT 6.0). It's a learning experience! Not hopelessl, though!

<Title>Siimply the best purchase for my home audio system I've ever made
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not going to do an in-depth review of because so many other folks have, but I'll give my two cents.  I've owned a Squeezebox for over 2 years now and it has worked flawlessly the entire time. Setup was easy from what I remember (it's been a while), sound quality is fantastic (especially when using FLAC files), and it looks so good sitting on my shelf with my Onkyo TX-NR901. In fact frustration with Onkyo's built in music server is what prompted me to buy the Squeezebox. This is one gadget I have never had one iota of buyers remorse for... ever.

<Title>This is the future of music. Insanely cool.
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am a gadget freak and this is without a doubt the COOLEST toy I own. After ripping my entire CD collection to WMA lossless and later converting to FLAC to get the advantage of replaygain volume leveling, I can now instantly play any song or playlist from over 400 CDs, quickly searching via artist name, album, genre, or a custom playlist. The networking setup is not quite as easy or simple as it should be, especially if you are using wireless or multiple PCs running multiple servers. But it's not that hard, either, and I was able to figure it out and once I did, it works consistently and very, very well. The sound quality is absolutely as good as from the original CDs. The remote is not bad, but it could be even better, but it's just as easy to run the interface from a laptop using wi-fi, even if your music library is on another network computer or hard drive. The support on the slim devices forums and knowledgebase are very good, and if you really need some hand-holding you can call them and talk to a live person for help. Seriously, you set this up and you will start feeling like a pro DJ-  all you need is a VIP guest list...
