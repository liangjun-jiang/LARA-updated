<Title>it can't be better!
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got one! it's just awesome on video playback, awesome! my friend insist that i should compare it with PSP, but here is my point: it's about two third thickness of old 60G, and it has 2.5 inch screen, it play awesome video. what else you want from an iPod?! To be honest, I gotta say that the video playback even clearer than most computer screen. No block at all!  But there are several thing to remind you, there is no POWER Adapter in case, and they trade off a like-leather case. check the size of the new iPod, i don't think any solid old iPod case fits perfectly.  New iPod has screen lock function, like chubb lock. that's interesting! Since i just got it less than 2 hours, i can't give more information about the battery or other new functions. But, no doubt, it fullfills me really well. Take it, it will never turn you down!

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my fourth iPod and definitely my favorite, it's a great player and I love the ability to be able to watch videos.  I'm not bothered by the fact that they left out the charger block as I already have two, plus you don't really need one.  For everyone who is considering getting on or already has one and doesn't know how to convert video to it here's a short guide (assuming you already have video on your computer, from wherever).  Ok, very easy, the PSP uses the exact same video format so use google to find a PSP video converter and make your video 320x240 and either 512 or 384 kbps.  Use mp3 audio at 96 or 64 kbps.  This will make video about 200mb per hour plus it looks great on the iPod.

<Title>Great player, hard to find Accessories
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my 60GB model through the Apple website along with some accessories.  This was my first iPod purchase and I am very happy with the unit and how easy it was to load it with my mp3 library.  The unit is small elegant and packed with features.  However, I was disappointed to find no AC charger included (I had wanted to use one in my office and the IT folks won't allow me to load the software to use the USB cable).  I was also disappointed to find out I could not easily find a case for this model (hopefully they will be available soon).  The biggest disappointment was that many of the accessories for previous models (including FM transmitters) are incompatible with this model since there is only a headphone jack and no charging jack on the top.  I'm sure the after market guys will soon develop more accessories, but it is frustrating to own the flagship model and not be able to use it in the same manner as people who own less expensive or older models.

<Title>Solid if not spectacular
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had for almost a week now. Solid (first) attempt at place- and time-shifting video programming. Video color screen is vivid and rich. 60GB of storage is more than abundant (I honestly think 30GB will suffice for most users). Using my iBook, I'm able to convert full-length 8GB DVDs of movies into 600MB MPEG4's for "downtime" viewing (e.g., commute, slacking off during lectures or meetings) on my iPod using a free downloadable (Apple-only) program called HandBrake (available at versiontracker dot com) (this process takes 4-6 hours, and is something you start before going to bed....in the morning, just load the finished product onto your iPod as you would music files). Much more elegant and not as bulky or expensive as other portable video players, although not as flexible in terms of content sources either (see Archos' player).  No mechanical or cosmetic problems yet (see iPod Nano). Video capabilities would be better served if screen utilized more real estate (i.e., make it widescreen; but I suspect that's a technical limitation at present). Comes with USB cord, software CD, and earbuds, but no AC or desktop charger. Limited 5G iPod 3rd-party accessories at present.

<Title>Great product but can still improve a little
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just picked this up yesterday because my mini's 4Gb just wasn't enough anymore. The new color screen is extremely sharp, just like looking at my LCD monitor. I love being able to watch my favorite music videos on it although iTunes didn't have my favorite, Stacy's Mom. But I'm sure their video library will expand every Tuesday just like their music. It's also a nice feature to be able to download TV shows from ABC to watch at my convenience. But once again, the selection will need to improve on that one as well. I've only had it for one day and I bought a leather case with it but even the case made for it has already started to scratch the glossy black surface. So I'm disappointed with that. The operation of the clickwheel is slightly different than my iPod mini. When I'm scrolling through artists, songs, etc., it will scroll at normal speed and then jump maybe 4 times faster than normal so you're going from Aerosmith to Pink Floyd and the next thing you know you're looking at ZZ Top. On paper the feature probably sounded like a good idea but in reality it's just annoying and as far as I can tell, it's not an option that can be turned off. Overall I'm still very happy with it and highly recommend it.

<Title>pretty much a cynical rip off for the money
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this video unit very swiftly followed on the heels of the photo ipod which clearly was aimed at maximising sales for folks who wanted to put digital photos/power point presentations etc on an ipod, presenting them with another three-four hundred photo/video unit after they'd just bought a threee-four hundred dollar unit. After barely three months the photo ipod is now effectively discontinued and being discounted. I initially got a 60 GB photo which I discovered is incompatible - its just too thick for the docking station -  with the new Altec Lansing IM 7 - after establishing said incompatibility with Apple (obviously Altec's fault - not Apple's) I discovered that the new 60GB (slightly thinner) video was just about to be launched so I swapped my photo for a video only to discover Apples cynical exploitation continues. I was very unimpressed with the video ipod, the screen would have scratched very quickly and does according to many reviews, unlike the photo which happily is more durable, there was no mains adapter, none of the peripherals I have like iTalk work, you have to buy the new universal dock at fourty dollars a pop to make some features work. The better (20 hours) battery life is only for the 60GB, another deliberate cynical ploy. The video/battery capability is seemingly  pretty limited as regards watching films longer than 100 mins or so. I dont really see the point of watching vacuous mtveee type music videos on such a small unit - but each to their own. As for the limited TV series drivel currently on the itunes PPV web site, enoough said!!   I originally had a 4th gen 40GB which was big enough for my 5000+ songs. Each time they update the ipod they take something away from the package. This time with the video they've taken virtually everything away, no dock, no adapter, no peripherals, and added the crappiest thinnest case you could imagine which wont really protect the unit long term. Unless very small screen video is really tremendously important to you and you're happy spending two dollars on each music video/populist tv shows thus far offered buy the photo ipod and save fifty dollars and get a much better deal with a screen that will not scratch so easily and wont be such a problem even if it does scratch up a bit. I use mine exclusively as a music/audio player and now have a second photo ipod after swapping out my new vidoe player. I found the video player took thirty mins or so longer to download the exact same number of songs that my photo ipods took.  And I can still record speech/memos etc on my ipod, use an fm transmitter on the car stereo. Its funny how generally speaking the media just lap up whatever apple do and never seem to criticise the (to me) cynical plethora of products, many of which if you have a reasonable music collection are worthless, 1GB or less of music recorded at at least 192kbs to ensure reasonable play back sound is to me a waste of money and effort. If you buy decent headphones - at the very least Shure E3's or better, owning a 60 GB ipod is an expensive toy. Doubtless Apple will sooner or later launch yet another expensive video ipod update, presumably enough folks will want the kudos of having the latest model so Apple's profits will continue. Hopefully if this cynical product exploitation continues increasingly folks will begin to see through this creeping corporate cynicism. I make this observation as a free market loving Republican. I suppose as a proud non gamer and older geezer, with nothing but contempt for the vacuous mtveee and its ilk this product is not really aimed at me.  My music ipod is still by far and away the finest and most cherished toy I have ever owned.

<Title>Converting Video to 5G iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't let any of the reviews about difficulty of video conversion dissuade you. I found an app off of download.com called SUPER (freeware) that perfectly encodes videos of virtually any format for the new iPod. It's fairly quick, though CPU intensive. For the most recent version of the program, check out  http://fever.link.free.fr/SUPER.html#Dnload. Don't spend money for Quicktime Pro when better (and free) alternatives exist. Oh yeah...get yourself a new iPod in black. Sexy as hell. I'm the first of my friends to get one, and everyone is jealous.

<Title>APPLE IS AMAZING
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again with the new 60GB ipod video. This unit is beyond amazing because not only have they improved upon the size, color, function, and battery life of ipod, but what is great about this thing is that it plays VIDEO. The picture quality is crisp and clear, and so far, my only gripe is that the unit scratches too easily. I'm still waiting for a case that doesnt suck. Also, the fact that there is no AC adaptor that comes packaged with the unit should be a crime. But despite these gripes, its still the best music player out there, and now it plays video.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Can't mess with Apple!  For $400, you get 60GB, a beautiful screen, and a cool black design.  As always, the major gripes are with the cheap earbuds and lack of early accessory support.  You do get a case with it now, a thin slip-on deal that does make it easier to put the iPod in a pocket or briefcase without scratching.  I would disagree with people who don't like the accelerated wheel scrolling.  At just over 30GB on mine, scrolling through the artists or albums would take a long time one-by-one.  The acceleration is fairly intuitive once you get used to it.  The screen is big and clear.  I seriously doubt anyone would watch movies on it, but I can see downloading news and half-hour shows to watch while on a Stairmaster or riding the train.  At this point, you're on your own for video content unless you're a Disney lemming.

<Title>Yes I Have This One, & With VIDEO, Now It's Worth It!
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got mine alittle over a week ago directly from Apple.  (Sorry Amazon, but it's the same price, + free laser engraving & shipping)  I HAD bought the iPod 60GB photo for about a week, but as soon as I saw these new ones coming out, I sold the photo on ebay and bought the 60GB video in black.  I got the new one for 3 main reasons:  1: The iPod is finally in BLACK!  2: It's thinner = more portability.  3: Yes, it plays video.  Now these reasons are listed in order.  I didn't get this new one just for the video.  I got it as a music player first and a video player second (or third).         First off, since it's the new feature, lets talk about the video.  The video quality is excellent!  (considering that the screen is only 320x240 pixel)  I say this from putting my OWN videos on it, meaning videos that weren't downloaded from iTunes.  $1.99 isn't too bad a price for a music video or an episode of a TV series, but at the same time, most of the music videos and TV series episodes they offer aren't everybodies can of beer!  (I don't care for Lost and especially Desperate Housewives...unless the 4 women did the show nude!)  All I did was rip the DVD of a TV series or whatever I want, then transcode it into a format that the ipod can read, and Presto!  Now I know while your reading this your thinking, "If I get this iPod, how can I put my favorite stuff on it the way this guy is talking about?"  No problem, I'll tell you!         First, if you want to get a movie or a TV show off a DVD, chances are it's probably CSS encrypted.  (Pretty much any movie or TV series DVD you buy at any store)  To rip these type of DVD's into a video file, you'll have to get a DVD ripping program that can decrypt CSS.  You can find a number of them online for free or cost alittle $ to download.  My experience, most of the freeware ones can't rip any decent quality video, so you'll probably have to shell out afew bucks to get a decent one.  I had already downloaded one called AoA DVD Ripper afew months ago for about $25 or $30.  (Do a google or yahoo search to find the site)  It does a really good job of ripping the DVD's and the video/audio quality is great.  (Especially using the DivX 6 codec)  Next, you'll need to transcode the video file into a format the ipod can read.  (Go to apple's website for video specifications)  I already had Quicktime 7 Pro, which comes with a setting to save videos it can open to the proper format.  I tried using it; it took an hour just to convert 5% of the video!  It was only a 22 minute video!  WAY TOO LONG A CONVERSION TIME!  (would have taken almost a day!)  So I went searching online for another program that would do this faster.  I found a freeware program called Videora iPod Converter.  (Again, do a Yahoo search to find the download site)  It comes with a number of options and it does a great (and fast) job of converting the video to the right format.  TIP: When using this program, ONLY certain video settings can be used for the converted video to work on the ipod.  Check the forum of the website you download this program from to see what other settings people have tried to get it working.  It may seem like a lot of trouble, but if you want to be able to watch certain videos, it isn't that bad once you get everything set up.  (It only took me a total of 30 minutes to put an episode of Chappelle Show on my iPod using the process I described above!)      Now that the video is out of the way...The sound of the ipod is excellent.  I read somewhere that they also fixed 3 minor sound bugs that were present in the earlier versions of iPod.  (Another bonus)  Overall, there isn't too much more new about the new ipod besides what I talked about.  One drawback that people have mentioned, but hasn't affected me; the 4 prong connection that was on top next to the headphone jack is gone.  So if you already have ipod accessories that use them, tough luck, they won't work on the new one.  They'll be coming out with accessories to replace the older ones sometime though that exclusively use the dock connector on the bottom.  (Already have in some cases)  Also, if you don't like using iTunes to transfer music to your iPod, there's a program out there called Anapod made by Red Chair Software.  It integrates into Windows Explorer and just drag and drop!  Has a lot of cool/handy features, and they just put a new version out that supports the new ipod!  (Namely transferring video)  It costs about $25 -$30 depending on which version you get.  Well worth it though, I think.  Hope this review helped you out!

<Title>Ipod
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My ipod changed my life.lol  Im in the navy, so everything has to be compact.  No more carrying around CD's DVD's TV's etc.  Now it is all in one place.  I can watch movies in my rack now without a bulky laptop.  The picture is so crystal clear.  i fought the hype for a while by buying a creative, a gigabeat, a lyra.  They cannot compare by far.  Having an ipod is like belonging to a club.  Trust what ever you want a mp3 player to do the ipod does.  A little advice though, learn how to use itunes fully.  People at work are always asking me to hook their ipod up like mines.  Itunes is simple.  It will organize all your stuff for you if you take the time to learn how.  Fyi don't buy that 100 dolar cable to hook your ipod up to your tv.  Just go to walmart or somewhere and get a 20 dolar cable that plugs into your headphone jack and converts to audio and video rca's.  Normally these cables are for digital cameras/cams.

<Title>One of the greatest devices ever w/ a couple of pleasant surprises.
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all I've owned this 60 GB 5th gen Ipod for over a year now and it's been a blast to own. I often tell people that if it were any more versatile that I'd consciously use it in my sleep :). During the time that I've owned it it has been a snap to operate. ITunes is very easy to browse through and buying and transferring new songs to your IPod likewise is a snap (you can make $$$ disappear really quick while browsing ITunes :)).     So far it's held up remarkably well I have my IPod in a simple case and I've dropped it a million times and thankfully it hasn't given me any problems. The worst was when I accidentally dropped it into a bucket of water I freaked out (naturally when you pay as much for something like this) the rest of the day it didn't work and I was bummed and thought I'd have to send it in, but remarkably the next day it worked again :). So in closing this is one of greatest devices ever is quite durable, worth the money, saves you the risk of sifting through 10 million CDs while driving, and is among one of my most valued possessions as in if I lost it I know I'd have to have another ASAP. After owning this wonderful device it's no wonder that there is so much competition trying to compete for a slice of the Apple pie.

<Title>The care needed for this amazing device
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After purchasing the Apple iPod Black 60GB last September 2005, I noticed that once the clear seal which protects the screen and iPod wheel was taken out, I found the surface to be very sensitive. The surface is succeptible to scatches easily. If you are planning to own this device, I suggest that you purchase adhesive plastic cover or iPod skin to protect your investment. Other than that, the iPod 60GB is an amazing device that can fit approximately 20,000 songs depending on track lengths and MB size.   Looking for new music? iTunes, the desktop companion to the iPod, offers one or two free songs every Monday online. Want Podcasts on your favorite topics? No problem, just use iTunes search engine to see if it's available in the iTunes website.   Planning on using your iPod during long drives? Purchase the iPod iTrip which easily fits underneath your 60GB player. Look for a clear station on your car stereo and start dancing or singing away!

<Title>Best iPod Ever
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my 60GB Video iPod- there's plenty of storage room with all my music, photos, videos and room left over to backup my data.  If you look at the price per Gigabyte, this is without a doubt the most cost-effective iPod model. The Battery lasts for hours upon hours when playing music and still for several hours when watching video. I love the fact that I can hook this up to my TV with a video cable and watch my video on the big screen. It also works great when coupled with the dock and remote, before the Apple TV, this was the best way to watch my iTunes movies and videos on the big-screen from my sofa.   The iTunes software works great for managing all my media and the sync process is easy and fast with the USB 2.0. Just plug it in and go. I was really surprised at how clear the video screen was - yes it is small, but it's fine for occasional viewing such as when on a trip. Made my 8 hour overseas flight much more enjoyable. I also bought an iPod compatible stereo for my car and now I rarely use anything else. Great for podcasts and audio books, especially for long commutes.  Oh yeah, and last but not least- it's absolutely gorgeous.

So, first things first, I recommend searching for a smaller-sized model if you don't have a very large collection.  I have owned a 5th gen 60 GB iPod video for almost a year now and felt that it was a good time to write a review about it.  I've read reviews from people who have complained about their iPod breaking and freezing, and I have my own input regarding this.  One of the abilities of the iPod is to play videos.  The iPod will only play .mp4, .m4v, and .mov format videos, so be careful!  iTunes DOES take care of converting videos for use with an iPod, but I'm not reviewing iTunes.  Assuming you've converted your home movies for the iPod and have downloaded the latest season of your favorite TV show, it's now time to put it onto your iPod.  Once you've got it sitting nicely on the 60 GB hard drive, you can access it in the menus and begin to watch.  On a fully charged iPod, video playback is noted at up to 3 hours, and I've found no problem with this, though over time that length might decrease just like most electronic products over time.  The video quality is superb on iTunes purchased movies and shows and the audio quality for those shows is just as good.  With your own movies, it can be a different story.  Basically you just need to make sure that the audio quality is good enough and the video resolution is good enough for the iPod.  If you've succeeded in those two areas then the video should view GREAT!  I have found that, over time, my iPod was filling up with shows and movies and I had little room to store other new videos.  I would recommend regularly updating your iPod.  This means that once you've watched a movie, if you have no future plans to watch it again, delete it off of your iPod.  This way you can always save space for videos you may want to put on your iPod in the future.  But remember: ALWAYS make sure to keep a "hard copy" of the video on your computer.  Otherwise you may find yourself an unhappy camper.  Music has always been the main focus for the iPods ever since day one.  My music has always worked GREAT on my iPod and I've never been failed.  Many people have complained about the lack of an option to use alternative audio formats with the iPod.  Unless you're looking to put all .wma files on your iPod, you won't be disappointed.  The iPod works well with most usual audio formats.  Just as long as you keep your non-iTunes Store music as mp3 audio you shouldn't have any problems.  Audio quality is great for great quality audio.  It all depends on the kpbs.  160 kbps is nearly indistinguishable from CD quality for most people.  192 kbps is a much larger file but is just the safer route.  iTunes Store music sounds great at the quality they have set for all the music.  Podcasts work great with the iPod and work very similarly to music on the iPod, as they are all audio files.  The only difference is that the iPod treats podcasts as they are and they have a separate folder within the iPod.  Photos work fantastic with the iPod too, and the picture quality is great for the most part.  The size of the image you upload to the iPod has a lot to do with the quality.  But for the most part, your standard digital camera pictures will look great.  I have not played any of the iTunes Store games that are available for the iPod but have heard good things about them all.  I don't think this is a relevant feature for the 5th generation iPod at this point seeing as how there are so few games available for purchase.  No outside source games are compatible with the iPod to my knowledge.  My only complaint with the iPod is the occasional freezing/slowing down of some media when playing it.  This is largely due to the fact that this is a hard-drive based player, and most problems can be solved with a reset (pressing the menu and center click buttons at the same time and holding).  My iPod has also been scratched a bit on the screen, even with a case.  With proper care and treatment, this should not be a huge problem after prolonged use, and the scratches on my own iPod are due, for the most part, to my carelessness with where I put the iPod.  If you put the iPod in a backpack that has dirt or sand in it, it WILL get inside the case you bought for the iPod, and WILL scratch the iPod if you do not remove it quickly.  This is just common sense.  Overall the iPod is an extremely fun player to use and can be very easy to use, given that you actually read the instructions.  Make sure that your bases are covered and you will be fine.  I would also like to add one last bit of information that will help some people, I'm hoping.  The Apple iPod has a TV-Out feature that is extremely useful for when you would like to hook it up to a TV and watch it at home with the family.  Apple has a sleek little RCA cable that you can buy for a pretty penny to be able to hook the iPod up to your TV, but be assured that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY IT.  With these steps, you can have your iPod playing on your TV in NO TIME:  1) Go to a local electronics store and buy a standard RCA cable with the red, yellow, and white plugs on one end and a 1/8 inch plug (headphone jack) on the other.  Again, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THE APPLE BRAND RCA CABLE FOR THIS.  Don't waste your money.  You can pick up a great RCA cable for a few dollars that will work fine for this feature. 2) Turn on your iPod and select your desired settings concerning TV-Out.  I enjoy the Widescreen format and the "Always Ask" option ON.  This ask option is just so that whenever I choose a video to play, the iPod will ask me if I want to turn TV-Out ON or OFF. 3) Once you've selected your desired settings, grab the RCA cable and plug the 1/8 inch end into your iPod's headphone hole. 4) Locate the analog input holes on your TV (red, white, and yellow) and grab the RCA cable.  Here's the tricky part that Apple "accidentally" forgets you to tell you.  Instead of matching colors and plugging the RCA cable into your TV, you've got to switch colors around.  Plug the RED END into the YELLOW INPUT, the YELLOW END into the WHITE INPUT, and the WHITE END into the RED INPUT.  Apple switched the way the composite video signal and analog audio signal comes out of the iPod on us!  Once you've switched the colors around and you're plugged in, switch the TV to the channel or mode that matches with where you've plugged into, select a video to watch, select TV-Out ON if you haven't already, and sit back and relax!

<Title>The iPod revolution continues...Great device
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's a GREAT device.  On a Mac, it's a snap to load videos to watch on the go, and has the usual superb iTunes management system for music, not to mention the iTunes Music store for downloads, music videos and limited at this point TV episodes.  A few downsides keep this from being a 5 star device...It scratches from the moment you pick it up, which you will do a lot to watch video...In a week waiting for an Invisible Shield (which does protect - albeit in a cumbersome fashion) it had dozens of scratches on the black finish and screen.  When more cases are available, this should get better, but Apple's stock case is suprisingly shoddy for the usual Apple elan...And besides looking horrible, the case doesn't allow you to use the player, at least for video.  Accessories are pitiful, and you will probably need at least one or two besides a halfway decent way to protect this.  So add another hundred dollars for a charging unit, and a dock...But whatever you do, DON'T buy the Apple remote.  At least as of this writing, it's not designed to do anything other than turn the unit on and off, volume  up and down and skip to next music track.  NO video controls, NO menu screens, NO playlist management.  It's also a surprise for Apple to be so irritatingly poor.  But this is another groundbreaker...Not the first Video player, but the elegance, ease of use, and absolute superiority of the iTunes management system are all top notch.  Highly recommended.

<Title>poor user instructions
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>yes, it's nice but how does it do all it's suppose to do?  I downloaded the user's manual and looked at the video demos and they mainly tell you what it WILL do but not how to do it in detail.  For instance it says in order to download music to your iPod after the data has been stored to your computer "go to 'source' in iTunes and find 'options'" and then it continues it's instructions.  I CAN'T FIND the 'OPTIONS' they are talking about.  Does somebody know of a more detailed user's instructions I can get that is NOT distributed by the Apple people, just some 'good ole joe/jane' that can talk people talk and not company advertising talk?  Thanks, Sub

<Title>THE Case
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are some good reviews here already on this great product.  I want to address the case issue. The iPod WILL scratch. It comes with a crappy, discardable sleeve (along with discardable earphones, but they're another issue!) that will provide some false assurances of scratch protection. However, if the tiniest bit of a foreign substance with a Mohs Scale of Hardness number of 2 or greater gets inside the sleeve, your 'Pod is scratched.  I recommend the purchase of the "invisibleSHIELD" (google it) to protect your 'Pod. I installed it on mine and couldn't be happier. This product is a tough plastic "decal" that is almost bullet proof! There is a video of guy using a car key to try and scratch a protected iPod. This stuff is tuff!  Application can be a bit tricky, but I got excellent results the first time. The screen is still crystal clear, but I'll have to admit that a "protected" iPod is slightly less beautiful than a new, "bare" one. However, it's still way more beautiful than any case can be and it will stay scratch free!    When it's time to sell your iPod, it will still look new. InvisibleSHIELD says that their product is removable, but I can't attest to that personally. I would think that a buyer would want to keep it on anyway.  Bottom line: I love my iPod. I would never want it to be without this protection.

<Title>READ before you spend your money AGAIN
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I went to my local Best Buy today after reading the reviews, and almost bought one. BUT, then I came to my senses.   Let's see, I purchased the 20 gig Ipod, then the 40, then the 60. Then I had to buy another 60 gig cuz the screen on my first got crushed (totally my fault). Was happy again for the most part, but had some problems with the video screen darkening (which I never had on any of the previous) and Apple was not at all helpful. So I went on, enjoying my music, but not my screen and then the Nano and Photo come out. Someone bought me the Nano as a gift, but I decided to buy the Photo because I am a photographer (amateur, but...).  And now, Apple wants me to spend another hefty chunk of cash to buy the video Ipod. Well, it looks great, sounds great, and love the black case, BUT......  I refuse to spend anymore money until they get it right. I am tired of having to dish out a few hundred dollars every 6 months or so to get their new product that does basically the same thing as the previous version.  I am going to wait 6 months or a year or however long until they get it right. An Ipod that continues to play music, shows photos, plays video (for longer than 3 hours, I mean c'mon), has all the normal cables and hookups and software, doesn't scratch with the slightest bump (or comes with a protective case that works). And something that is UPGRADABLE would be nice.   At this point, Apple is starting to look like Microsoft. They know they have the most popular product, so they feel they can just keep releasing new versions every few months and people will keep spendingthe money toreplace the perfectly good version they had before, for an inferior upgrade. Well, not me. Get a stable platform, with upgrade capability, and a decent battery life, and no constant extra cost for me and I will be happy to buy, but until then, this is getting stupid.  Imagine if you had to do this with your TV, your Microwave, your Clock Radio and every other electronic device you own. You couldn't afford it and you would say no. Say no to Apple until they get the product right.  They make great stuff, but this is getting stupid.  Just my opinion. I am not a paid Apple employee like some of the reviewers on here.

<Title>Beautiful screen, huge hard drive
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I upgraded from the U2 black and white iPod mainly because I wanted a color screen. The screen is a major reason to get this iPod. It is crisp, sharp, and the font is much easier to read than the B&W models.   The video ability is a nice add-on, but not really important for me. I have an Archos PVP and found that watching videos longer than a few minutes on a small screen is annoying. Plus without a backrest, I can't imagine watching a movie with the iPod -- holding it in the hand for 1 1/2 hours doesn't seem like much fun.  The 60gb space for me is fantastic. Although I have over 60,000 songs in my collection, I am able to put tons of songs on the iPod.   One note of caution: a few hours after I had mine, I noticed several hairline scratches all over the front of it, from the left of the wheel all the way onto the screen. I'm not sure if this is a nano-like issue, but it scratched easy and fast.  Apple needs to address that issue. Otherwise, this iPod is a work of art!

<Title>Smaller, Sleeker, Massive Space and Great Display
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my 60gb black video iPod for about a week now.  I upgraded from a 1st or 2nd generation 20 gb iPod, which was an upgrade from an old Archos Jukebox.    When first announced, I didn't think the video feature was cool enough to upgrade for, but after taking a look at the product in the Apple store, I was amazed and had to jump on board.  The display quality for such a small screen is wonderful.  When not playing video, having the large color display makes for easy visualizing of what songs you are playing.    I do think the hard drives moves a bit slowly.  It takes longer to load up the next song when fast forwarding.  My older iPod would do this seamlessly.  Now there is about a once second delay.  This is a bit disappointing, but doesn't really change my favorable opinion of the iPod.    I'm not sure if the unit will scratch or not.  I'm not chancing it, so I've left the plastic on that it came with it until my case arrives.  I don't think the scratching should be a deal-killer either.  The sound-quality, ease of use, small size and great looks makes this the best mp3 and now video player out there.    This also integrates seamlessly with iTunes, of course.  It's nice buying some of the older music videos I grew up with.  Apple needs to get a bigger selection of video quickly, but for now, it's a pretty good range of videos available.    So overall, this is a great product.  It's the best out there, and will satisfy most people's needs for the next couple of years.

<Title>The best iPod so far!
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros:  This is the ultimate iPod, for example, the unit itself is slimmer and more updated.  The screen is huge and bright, the storage capacity comes in either 30g or 60g.  It also comes in either black or white, I got a black one just because it looks different from the older iPods.  The screen size is humongous compare to the previous iPod.  The unit plays music videos, videos, pictures and the normal mp3, which are AAC encoded.  And the function is all the same with the usual iPod, click wheel and games, with the addition of a clock and stop clock.  Overall best iPod so far...........  Cons:  But it has some flaws.  The thing is a scratch magnet.  I really hate the scratch on the screen because it makes the screen look distorted, even though it is not.  Second there is a timing lag when switching songs, the title takes longer to load than the music, and mine crashed or stalled when I switch to a previous song.  When a certain song is done playing it will not switch to the next song because it is a different artist.  The music videos look fantastic, nice and clear, yet the music for the music video is less than great.  The battery life is said to be at 20 hours, but I think it might be less.  Maybe I touch it too much.  And last is the price.  It is quite hefty, and only comes with the basic accesories, ear buds, USB cord, and the CD.  Overall this might not be the iPod for everybody.  If you have thousands and thousands of songs, love music videos and have the funds for it, I recommend the 60g iPod video.

<Title>THE BEST TO DATE.......
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the 60 gig Ipod photo first and was blown away by the sound, size and scroll wheel. I decided to get the 60 gig Ipod with video and I'm glad I did. I wanted to put my home videos on a portable device. I was reading more reviews after I ordered the ipod video and realized that not many people went on record saying they had put home videos on their device, so I got worried that it wouldn't be right for this application. It came, and within a day I found PQ DVD to iPod Video software. It works like a charm and converts any movie file into ipod useable ones very quickly. The movies are great on the ipod and it really is amazing to watch and hear your videos on this unit. The screen seems so much bigger than the Ipod photo. NO PROBLEMS CONVERTING YOUR MOVIES OR VIDEOS TO PLAY ON IPOD!! Could use sub files to make things easier and Apple is just too concerned with making as much money as they can to be a user friendly company, but they make a great product anyway. GET A CASE BEFORE YOU GET THE UNIT! DON'T BOTHER WITH THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AS THEY GIVE YOU THE RUN AROUND AND DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON CUSTUMER SATISFACTION.

<Title>Best ipod yet! Can't they fix the screen scratches?
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this ipod. I have the second generation, and this was a great improvement. The battery life problem seems to be fixed, as I have had this for 6 months and haven't had it die on me during a long trip yet. The video looks great, the audio sounds better than ever, and the click wheel is a nice feature, although I miss the touch sensitve buttons. The menus are very nice, and everything is organized very nicely. One thing I'm not sure about, there's a place in itunes to add the music lyrics, but i don't know how to locate them on the ipoid, maybe it doesn't display them? My biggest issue here, the screen scratches very easily. Please make sure to buy a protective cover, or leave on the one that comes with it, or something. I was VERY careful with it, had it in a case and everything. I took it out one day to check a couple things out, and when I looked at it later in the day, it was scratched!! Bad enough that I notice it when I'm watching video. I don't think anything even touched the screen except some paper that may have been on my desk. It was very strange... Itunes integrations is as good as ever, and it's very easy getting ripped or purchased music onto your ipod. PROS *Best sound quality of any ipod yet *Video screen looks great *Click wheel is pretty responsive *Battery life is fantastic *Factory headphones actually sound pretty good CONS *Screen is very susceptible to scratches *The entire body of the ipod will be scratched and/or smudged within a week, don't expect it to stay all nice and shiny forever. But get it in a good cover ASAP and just take care of it as if it were a nuclear bomb just waiting to explode on impact! :)  All in all, this is a great player. Apple haters everyhwere will tell you it sucks and battery life is terribe and screen is too small, blah, blah, blah.... but the fact of the matter is it works. It does what it's supposed to do, which is play music VERY well, and it also plays movies, TV shows, and other video surprisingly well.

<Title>A must for every music collection
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my 60 gb iPod several months ago which was definetly money well spent.  I take it with me everywhere.  I have loaded over 500 CD's of every musical genre and have only filled up a quarter of the capacity.  One of my main pleasures has been rediscovering CD's I bought many years ago which had long been forgotten. Having them all available at the spin of my thumb makes them instantly available. I recently took a trip to visit my sister and and brought a connection cable so we could play it through her Bose radio.  It became the main entertainment through ten days of partying and relaxing. I can also play it through the car radio.  I am thinking of making an iPod input a must-have feature on the next car I buy. A big advantage of the iPod is iTunes, a free software from Apple. This program makes it so easy to load and classify my music on my computer.  And all I do is plug in my iPod and it immediately begins to synchronize the iPod to iTunes, copying any new music or changes I have made.  And it does it all by itself without any input from me. Unless you are planning to store lots of videos and/or photos, I think a 30 gb unit would be more than adequate for most music collections.  I could probably put a couple thousand more CD's on mine before it got full.

<Title>I bought a fad
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My impression of the iPod after all these months is I feel ripped off. The only good thing about the ipod that's not available from much cheaper and simpler Mp3 players is the memory size. The iTunes software is like paying to be spammed. You have to learn magic if you want to use music from another source other than iTunes or direct from the CD. "Video" has to be bought from iTunes. Some quicktime clips below a certain size can be loaded on but others can't and there is no telling which ones can and can't until you just try.   I have a 1 gb player of some generic Chinese manufacture. I plug it in and it shows on "my Computer" as another drive. I copy and paste the music I want on it and poof! I am ready to go. Loading the iPod the first time is an hour long ordeal using the UI of iTunes is for "Mac" people ( you know who you are) and it is maddening.  Last thing to address in my rant is the fragile nature of hard drives. A hard drive has moving parts and they don't do well with shock. A drop of 31 inchs to concrete will kill your iPod forever. Just one is all it takes. a good rap and your $260.00 is gone. Treat your ipod like a raw egg and it will last. Take some advice though, buy a flash memory based Mp3 player. Sure you can't load 60 million songs on it but you will be happier and more trouble free with ease of use plus less drop stress.

<Title>In Short - It's GREAT!
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll keep this short and sweet.  The new video playback iPod is worth the money.  It has a lot going for it - and all of it is positive.  To get to the most important point first, yes:  I downloaded an episode of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES and watched it on the iPod.  The clarity and color were nothing short of High Definition TV quality.  Others saw it and everyone was knocked out on how sharp and clear the video is.  The rest remains just as good:  You can download your CD's onto the system; use the iTunes store to buy new songs, etc.  It's quick and easy.  And burning a CD of your favorite tunes is so effortless, that nifty feature practically makes up for the cost of the unit.    Battery life has seriously improved as well.  The bad points?  Apple could be more generous with what they pack in the box.  First time iPod users are going to have to get a lot of the essentials as Apple really gives you nothing more than a standard set of headphones, etc.  It was disappointing when you realize that they even skimped and did not include a manual (although you can print one out courtesy of Amazon).  But, the high caliber performance more than makes up for what was not packed with the unit.    In short, the video iPod is fantastic.

<Content>This new iPod is an excellent piece of equipment. This is my first iPod and I am impressed with the features. It is a must have for music lovers and video lovers. The only thing that I can complain about is that it could be a little more durable. I say this because it scratches easily but that is nothing a case could take care of. Another flaw that I seen is that it is not compatible with Windows Media Player. That is really a preference though but I think I can adjust to iTunes since it is easier to use. Other than that this new iPod is great and I don't regret purchasing it.

<Title>Great iPod version but video drains battery quite fast
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's nice to be able to play videos and I can even rip a DVD movie using third party shareware/freeware software and play it on the iPod. Although the screen is much larger than prior iPods, it's still a bit uncomfortable to watch a movie on it. Also the battery will only last about 2 hours when watching video so it would probably be better to just watch TV shows and music videos when using the battery. If you want to watch a full length movie, you should probably plug the iPod in to a power source either using the included USB 2.0 plugged into your computer or using an AC Adapter which costs extra. Apple absolutely should have included the AC Adapter/Charger with this iPod like they have with the previous 4th generation iPod.   The good news is that for music, this iPod lasts quite a long time! And it sounds great (better than prior iPods) and it's physically much thinner (with the same outside dimensions). Most of the accessories that I already had for my prior iPod work on this 5th generation video ipod (such as my Belkin Tune Doc and power adapter). If you use a case for a prior iPod, you will probably need a new one though.   I like the Black color and think it looks cooler than the White one however it does show up scratches more than White so beware of that.  While I recommend and like this iPod, if you plan on doing a lot of video, be prepared to have some other power source available. Music is still the main thing it's good for, with the video capability just being a secondary extra.

<Title>The future of buying and listening to music
<Date>Sat Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned my video ipod for a little over a week and love it.   As a classical musician, my main concern was music and not video. I look upon the video capabilities as a nice extra when I want to use  them. Also, the differential in price between the video and non-video ipods is minimal (I suspect that a LOT more programming will be available for it in the not too distant future).  Because I have sensitive ears, I also purchased a pair of noise-canceling headphones. I have never found the popular earbuds comfortable or capable of producing the detail that I like.  I can safely say that the tonal response of the ipod was nothing short of excellent. I hear every detail from the source recording. Even demanding organ recordings come through with the full dynamic range.  A word about compression is in order. The ITunes software makes importing your CDs, as well as purchasing music from ITunes, seemless and easy. I prefer using the Apple Lossless method. However, this produces about 5mb per minute's worth of music. This means that you can get about 200 hours worth of music on the 60-gig ipod. Music transferred from the ITunes Music store uses AAC-128kb. This produces about 2mb per minute. For jazz and smaller ensembles, it is fine. I downloaded some chamber music and it sounded fine. But for larger works, you will want the Lossless reproduction.  200 hours is a LOT of music. Plus, you can always take things off of the ipod as you need too.  The video reproduction, even with the small screen, is excellent and there is even some free network programming available.  In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with this purchase. I suspect a huge 3rd party market will quickly grow around this device.  I heartily recommend.

<Title>Apple doesn't stand by it's product
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>amazing what 2 months can do...if i'd left this feedback when i first got my ipod, it would've been 5 stars just like everybody else.  i loved it.  Now, 14 months later, i wish i could get my $300 back.  Apple idea of tech support is to charge you $50 just to ask your question, then they have no repair department, so you're issued a new ipod for $300.  That's a little bit off, because you do get 1 FREE call to apple in the first month....WOOOPEEE!!!!!  And after that first year, forget it, they might as well laugh at you on the phone.  My ipod wasn't mistreated, in fact, i babied it.  wasn't dropped, didn't get wet, left in cold, and of those scenarios they throw at you.  Then on that 14th month, it's quit.  And i'm not talking about the usual problem Apple claims which is battery loss(yes this is a major issue and another $50), but quit as in doesn't want to work.  When i contacted Apple, i was told that it would cost me $50 to talk to tech.  Then they told me that no matter what the problem was, if i were to send it in it would cost $300 to "repair".  i will NEVER purchase another Apple product, i've never seen a company care so little about their product after so short a time, my loss, hopefully you're gain.  Just shows that they knew their product was junk and that's why they put such a tight "warranty"(if you can call it that) on the product.  my advice, DO NOT BUY!!! all these 5 star rating customers will find out in about a year just how 5 star this company is.

<Content>The new ipod is fantastic.  The storage space and thin design are the best yet.  Many of the other reviewers have mentioned that the new model is not as durable as the old one, but the added features make up for it.  If you are into sports, try the ipod shuffle, it's smaller and easier for exercise.  Also, I got my ipod for 10 dollars off a promotion on premium ipods site.  It worked great and cost me 10 bucks (much better than 300) check it out: [...]

<Title>Reassurance on the scratches
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have the white 60 GB ipod video and my husband has the black. We purchased about 3 weeks ago. We both love it.  Feedback on watching video: There has been much feedback on the product not being a good option for video. I do not have the flexibility in my schedule to watch TV. I bought the entire second season of Desperate Houswives (8 episodes at the time of writing this review) and watched it on the ipod. The clarity and experience was amazing. The video quality is exceptional. I can watch during my ride to work or at any point when I have about 15 minutes to spare. The ipod memory feature picks up at the point where I stopped watching when I click on the episode. Fun! For me, it works very well as a video device too.I have ripped my workout DVDs to the ipod. I bought the TV connector. No more excuses not to work out when I am traveling.   Scratching: Neither my husband's nor mine are scratched yet. Please dont be scared to buy because of the feedback on the product being prone to scratches. I was concerned because I read this. All it takes is a little extra care - I keep it in the pouch as far as possible.   The only flip side - the battery life is not 20 hours. Mine runs out of charge much faster (about half this). But then I use the back lighting a lot even when listening to music because I have loaded album art or pics of the artist in lieu of boring album art and I still cannot get over staring at the awesome screen when listening to songs  Edited after a few more weeks since buying to say - Still no scratches! I recently picked up up a skin with a lanyard (available in Asia). Even wothout the skin, we had both managed to keep our heavily used ipods scratch free though.

<Title>Fantastic!
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This iPod is everything I hoped it would be.  Go for 60 GB because of video.  Note: you will want to get Quicktime Pro on mac to convert your movies into iPod videoes; however, that 30 dollars is well spent if you have video in unencoded formats.  It takes a good while for QT pro to "export" the unsupported video to iPod size, yet it's worth the wait.  I let the CPU purr while I do something else.  Caveat: muxed audio in MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 must be converted!!!!!!!!  Third party utility required.  This is true because of Quicktime and iMovie limitations, not the iPod itself.  Thus, the trick is to convert from a muxed file then export.  BTW -- I was in a waiting room for an hour+ yesterday, but thanks to my iPod, I did not realize that the time went by until I got in my car and looked at the clock.  UPDATE:  get iSquint to convert the muxed files.  Its free.

<Title>I'm now one of them
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my new ipod. It was a gift for me and I couldn't ask for anything better. I am a design student in college so I have to bring large files to and from school. I was looking at getting another flash drive because I need about 1G per class. But now I just use my ipod as a portable hard drive. I don't have to worry about erasing files everyday to make room. It is amazing. I work on a Mac at school and a PC at home and it goes back and forth perfectly. The video is so clear and the sound is even better. I don't leave home without it. It does scratch even if you are so careful...it's my new baby. I would get a good case to protect it. If you would have asked me a month ago if I could use an ipod I would have just laughed at you, now it is always in my purse. I am remodeling my mother's kitchen and put an image of the wood molding that I needed to match into my ipod and used it at the store to insure that I didn't buy the wrong item. I would recommend this to anyone.

<Title>HEAVEN IN THE PALM OF MY HAND
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just received this as an early holiday present yesterday and am in iPod-induced bliss.  This is my third iPod - I have the 2nd generation 15GB model and the 4th generation 40GB model.  While I am still in love with them, this was more than a step up in so many ways.  If you already have an iPod and have iTunes already set up with most recent version of iTunes software, all you literally have to do is connect this to your computer via the USB cable (no more firewire!?) and it is off and running.  Seriously, it is that easy.  It only took about an hour for it to load all 6,100 songs in my iTunes library.  SCREEN: The color screen is insane, almost otherworldly in its clarity.  While small, of course, it completely pulls you into whatever you are watching (the world around it seems to fall away, somehow) and it has almost a 3-dimensional depth to it.  I was surprised by how great it was to watch video on - already downloaded a few videos and shows (The Office) from iTunes.  Very quick and easy download.  CAPACITY: The 60GB drive was a big deal for me.  If it seems unlikely to you that anyone would need this much space, you would be sadly mistaken.  You will find it amazing how quickly you use up the space if you have a significant music/photo/video collection.  While I am really in no danger of encroaching upon the 60GB of memory (especially since my computer currently only has 40GB capacity), I am sure the day is coming, probably sooner than later.   CASE COLOR: While beautifully designed, I could never get past the white color of my previous models.  I am NOT a fan of white, so this glossy black (my favorite color, of course) is perfection.  That said, I must admit it has already proven to be an incredible smudge magnet.  It also seems very fond of any dust of fine hairs that may be in the air, static charged particularly to the screen area.  Thank goodness that when the backlight is on, you can not see any smudges, dust or the like.  The screen just blows right through it.  Still, this is an area where the white model is superior, it just never showed any of this stuff, with the exception of the metallic backside.  Still, I will happily take the smudgy black model over the white any day.  It isn't horrible, very much like owning a black car - harder to upkeep but well worth the effort.  It's the price you pay for aesthetic.  Still, it would be nice if they could somehow figure out how the treat the surface to limit this effect.  Three complaints/observations:  NO FIREWIRE, CRADLE, OR PLUG ADAPTER:  While all of these came with my previous models, they were nowhere to be found with this one.  All you get is a USB cable.  Nowhere to place your iPod (safely) while charging, unless you have a cradle from a previous iPod as I do.  Still, very inconvenient to switch them out and the cradles from the previous models don't fit perfectly since this model is a thinner and slightly wider.  Also, with no plug adapter, I am more than a little confused as to how one is to charge their iPod with any level of ease.  Is there something I don't get regarding how you're supposed to charge your iPod with only what is provided?  Again, thank God that I have my hardware from my previous models.  NO PROTECTIVE CASE:  While I understand that they are trying to keep the costs reasonable, which I do greatly appreciate, I am still somewhat dismayed by the discontinuance of a proper protective case.  The somewhat odd, thin protective sleeve which was included with this model may help reduce scratches when the iPod is not in use, but it is by no means a carrying case and will not protect the device at all from any accidental bumps or drops (God forbid).  It just seems like there would be something a little more substantial included with a device of this cost and sensitivity to scratching.   BATTERY LIFE:  While the battery life does seem slightly better than that of my most recent iPod model, I think that the 20 hours advertised seems very optimistic, even if just playing music with the backlight off.  If you scroll around often, like I do, use the backlight to any real extent at all (the screen is VERY dark without the backlight on), or view videos, you may be looking at 3-8 hours realistically depending upon whether you are listening to music or watching video.  Even with the complaints listed above, I must say that I am completely blown away by this latest model already and only anticipate my love affair with it to grow.  I completely recommend this model, just don't expect to receive much beyond the actual iPod device itself.  All other hardware now appears to be a la carte.    Can't find it at your local Apple store, Best Buy, Circuit City, wherever for Christmas?  Contact Apple directly, through their website or by phone.  Mine was apparently purchased just last Thursday and was delivered in less than 24 hours the next day (this last Friday) by FedEx.

<Title>Get a Protective Case
<Date>Fri Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Anyone who wrote the review before Oct 18th hasn't even seen the thing live. They are probably cutting and pasting the specs from from Apple site. So beware.  I placed the order as soon as it was available on Apple store. It will be shipped before Oct 21. My two concerns are: Is it going to scratch like the black Nano and is the screen going to crack. Will update as soon as I find out.  I am a Windows guy with extensive collection of music in WMA lossless. After waiting for the wma camp to come up with something good, I am finally giving up on them. Toshiba and Cowon seem to be on the right track but everytime they try to do something cool, Apple comes up with a stunner and leaves them in the dust.   In anticipation of this, I converted my entire WMA lossless library into an additional 192kbps AAC library (keeping the lossless archive, ofcourse). With only 60GB, I have to reconvert some of them to 128kbps - which is a slight disappointment.  I wish Apple had put in an 80GB drive (Toshiba has one that will fit this model) that will allow use of lossless or higher bitrate AAC.   UPDATED Oct 25th: Got mine yesterday and downloaded the entire library. The screen froze with a do not disconnect message. But this was resolved by holding the menu and the center key for about 10 seconds and waiting for Apple logo to reappear. The manual says to keeep the hold switch on. The reset works only with the switch off.  I haven't taken off the plastic clear cover on the front yet as I am scared of scratches. In addition, I got a new Ipod 4G 40GB case to fit it (the 60GBs fit very loosely inside and the screen is not fully visible). 5G cases are not available.   My wife was surprised that I am treating an electronic gadget with this much respect not accorded to far more expensive pieces. I don't know myself. May be I have an emotional connection with music that I don't have with the others.  I visited the Apple store yesterday to see how unsheathed iPods are faring with scratches. While all of them show some scratches it doesn't appear to be as bad as some I had seen on the internet.  But the only thing that really matters is the music. The music is spectacular. What more can we really ask for?  Updated on Nov 6th:  I finally finished installing the so called invisible shield. This is made of 3M scotch cal and is not made for iPod but serves to keep the pod scratch free. The installation is a NIGHTMARE.  Key tips to remember: (a) Do NOT use soap and water as their website says. Use Windex spray (a tip I heard from ilounge forum) (b) Do Not try to squash air bubbles - they cause snow flake like appearance that stays forever  The shield is expensive (almost a rip off). Apple should really research into a non-scratch resin protection for its pods.   BTW, after researching through various speaker systems, we bought the JBL On Stage. This has some kind of a circular woofer, which gives superior sound compared to others like Altec Lansing or Creative.

<Title>Let's get some things straight...
<Date>Fri Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I don't know why people say that it's wider when it isn't. As far as I can tell from the spec page, the new iPods are the SAME height and width as the old 20 GB ones that it replaced. Both of the new models are actually THINNER and hold more capacity. What's not to like?  I think the confusion lies in that the screen has increased in size from 2" to 2.5" WITHOUT changing the actual width and height of the 4th Gen 20GB iPods. That's why you see the screen covering almost the entire top from edge to edge. Because of the increase size of the screen they no longer could fit the original dial on the front. So the new models have a smaller dial. Not as small as the Nano but definitely smaller than the older iPods. The effect of these two modifications gives the ILLUSION that the new iPods are wider or taller but it's NOT.  The other thing I hear people complaining about is how it's not good for video. Let's get something straight. This is a REPLACEMENT for the older iPods, not an additional model introduced for the sole purpose to playing videos. Like Jobs said, the video is just an ADDITIONAL benefit of the new models. You're actually paying the same prices as the old AND you're getting more capacity and video functions to boot! Again, what's not to like?   As they become more successful with video, they will introduce models that will showcase more of the video but what's the point of introducing one at this juncture with no real programs for you to watch??? Remember boys and girls, Apple is a business and as such they want you to replace your iPods over and over as technology improves. The current product cycle for Apple seems to be every 12 months. That means you should expect a really cool video iPod by the same time next years IF they are successful with this video experiment. Let's hope that Jobs will be successful in getting more studios to sign up!  That brings me to the other complaint I always hear: that the iPod/Nano scratches too easily. Come on folks! This is not a device you're about to keep for many years, do you really care if it gets scratched up if you're going to replace it every few years??? Instead, just enjoy using it and then replace it as newer and better ones will continue to be introduced. Enjoy life!

<Title>Greatest music player, with video too!
<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.   The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.   I have owned the 60 gig iPod with video playback, for several days now, and I continue to be impressed. Its physical appearance, quality, craftsmanship, and the wide array of features are keeping me entertained!   Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.   Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, even this 60 gig is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.   Capacity - This 60 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 15,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or 150 hours of video. The great thing I love about my 60 gig iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. Furthermore, with the video capabilities on the new iPod, you may find yourself needing the extra space that this 60 gig iPod provides.   New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.   Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 60 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 20 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of three hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.   Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.   Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.   Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car. Apple is including a small sleeve-type case, with this iPod, to help you keep it in good condition.   Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.   Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.   Value - This 60 gigabyte iPod is priced at $399, which is a great value. It provides a huge amount of storage space, and more features than ever.   Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.

<Title>What about the peripherals?
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Many have lauded this as being the best iPod yet and most of the things said so far are true. The wider screen looks great, the video function is cool, and the battery life is much improved. However no one has mentioned the one major drawback to this new iPod-the peripheral jack located next to the headphone jack on every other iPod is not on this iPod. That means that all the cool peripherals like the Griffin iTrip and the headphone remote control are now completely obsolete. Apple didn't mention this at all in any of their advertising and I didn't know about it until I got my new iPod in the mail and opened it up. I don't know why Apple would do this or if they intend on releasing any adaptors or anything like that in the future but it sucks for me because I constantly used my headphone remote with my old iPod. I listen to my iPod at work but I constantly have to pause it in order to talk with people so it was great being able to keep my iPod in my pocket and just clip on the remote. In my opinion removing this peripheral jack is completely pointless and keeps this from being the ultimate iPod.

<Title>nothing THAT new!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think there's alot of hype over the video feature of these ipods- keep in mind, theres nothing new about video playback and plently of other products do this and have done so successfully for sometime now.  What is the feature that should be focused on is the storage capacity of ipods -much bigger than other products and the relative sizes of the ipod body - much smaller than other products on the market.  But dont be sucked in by ipods "now it does.....video playback!!!" - it should have had this feature a long time ago! but then again they wouldnt make all that extra money!! also be aware that other reviews state older peripheries are obsolete with this model... you will have to buy all these again when they come out.

<Title>I actually DO have one
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unlike a lot of reviewers who post reviews on a product they've never seen or held (Apple Stores were told they wouldn't get theirs until the end of October--per Charlotte NC store) ----- I actually have one.  I ordered mine on Oct 12, and it arrived Oct 20. I of course ordered the 60GB device.  It was easy to swap out my old 40 GB device with this new one. I'd previously installed the new iTunes and the iPod software version 10-12-05 that I'd downloaded. It was plug in, register, and download. (And I had to swap cables on my dock***.)  Some observations:  The screen is very bright when you turn the backlight on and leave it on, it's very dim if you don't (probably how they get the stated 20 hour battery life).   ***No more Firewire connections. I was sad to see that, as the Firewire connection saved me from getting a new USB hub.   The Holy Grail is video here...however, converting it to iPod standards isn't easy. I have a lot of DiVX video, to which the QuickTime Converter isn't up to recognizing, much less converting. Forget about 3rd party converters that you already own, it seems the iPod only wants Apple-converted video. But rest assured, there are software developers frantically scrambling to solve this. I have a couple of beta converters I found, but with very mixed results. I'd give it a couple of weeks then good software will be available for converting video to the iPod.  The sound is as good as ever, no worries there.  It has the same width and height as my 40GB iPod, so your cases should fit nicely, and maybe a similar thickness to the old 10/20 GB iPods. It fits in my auto transmitter/charger, but I have to slightly angle it back as I'm inserting it to hit the dock squarely.  All in all, the video situation was disappointing, but with lots of money at stake, it will get worked out by all these 3rd party developers. I did manage to get a couple very short preexisting QuickTime videos converted successfully to the iPod standard, so I know it DOES play video - the problem is just the conversion process. Not necessarily Apple's fault, except that their video standard is maybe a little too rigid.

<Title>Worth The Wait
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the iPod I've been waiting for since the first generation iPod was released. I bought an 40GB iPod for my wife almost 2 years ago but held out for myself because I knew this day would arrive. So the moment Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod video I went straight to the Apple website and broke out the Visa. I've had it for 4 days and so far it has exceeded every expectation. Unlike many, I didn't buy it for the video because I just couldn't see myself watching anything of significance on a 2.5in screen. To me, the value was in finally freeing those thousands of digital pictures from my computer and being able to view them on a screen that actually does them justice. Unlike the iPod Photo, this screen is about the size of a small wallet size photo and serves up the pics in beautiful detail. You WILL be impressed. The slimmer profile, 60GB of storage and 20 hour battery life of the iPod Video are several layers of icing on the cake. Co-workers, friends and family can finally stop nagging me for the latest baby pictures - now they can scroll through hundreds in just a few minutes. And now that I've seen the quality of those pictures first hand, I might have to download a few episodes of Lost.

<Title>Great player, no charger
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just received mine and am very impressed by the display.  I had suspected that video playback on this machine was merely a gimic, especially the television downloads, but it is surprisingly watchable.  Note to Steve Jobs: I need Sopranos downloads!  The problem with this package is what's not in the box.  There is no charger, no dock, no decent case (which given the propensity to scratch is a clear and present danger).  Apple is well known for scrimping on required accessories, but they have sunk to a new low with this package.  Let's face it, they kept the price at the previous levels only by eliminating essential components and forcing us to buy them separately.  Summary: Buy the player; you'll love it.  But make sure you've got a hundred bucks left over to get the rest of the stuff you'll need.

<Title>Great hadware, software could be better
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my new iPod. I bought this one after my 60GB iPod Photo was "misplaced". I had a library of about 6,000 songs (small for what this thing can hold) and the first time I updated the new iPod with the library I got error messages every 700 songs or so. I had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until I finally got al my songs into the iPod. This was problem number one (which I don't expect to happen again unless I update the iPod whith more than 700 songs at a time).   Problem number two: if I'm searching for a song by artist, it won't display all the songs I have by that artist in the iPod. Say I have like 20 songs by Madonna, and I search for Madonna on the artists menu, I only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are. That didn't happen with my old iPod.  But all in all, it's a great product and I would buy it all over again if I had to.

<Content>First off--I'm old(ish) in my 50's and I watched my daughter using her iPod nano.  Then she started playing me songs from her iPod, then I started really liking some of the songs, then I got jealous, so I asked for my own for my birthday.  So I got the biggest and newest, and I love it.  It has fantastic sound.  I play it in my car.  I also use it to listen to audiobooks.  I can't wait to watch movies on it.  It is also very easy to use.  So I give it 5 stars.

<Title>Now that I've had this...
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>for over a year I think I can give a fair review.  Although this is a nice little machine it's got its problems, problems that shouldn't occur in such an expensive product.  But first, the positive.  I listen to alot of music, I've already had to delete about 10 gigs to make room for other music so the 80GB is looking pretty tempting right now.  Actually, I heard that a 100GB is coming soon, I can only hope!  Anyways, everything you might have heard about the iPod being hard to use with PC is untrue.  If you have any computer skills at all it should come as no problem.  iTunes is easy to use (although I hate all the music on iTunes), adding songs, pictures, movies and text are simple enough.  When you first get an iPod you may struggle for about 2 minutes.  The mp3s sound good although I with there was a function that kept all the songs at the same noise level.  It sucks when you have it turned up very loud when a low sound level song comes on and then your head explodes when the next song comes on!    Okay, so now some of the negative.  First, battery life.  I turn off my backlight because it will eat the battery in about 4 hours!  I forget exactly how long it says the battery life is supposed to last, I think 12 hours, but it isn't close.  And, it only gets worse the longer you own it.  Okay, another thing that I hate.  I'm not sure if this happens to everyone but my songs will duplicate, meaning that I'll have 2 of the same album instead of just the one.  This is very annoying because, like I said, I put alot of music on this and having double of an album only takes more space that shouldn't be taken.  I have to go through my iPod about once every 2 weeks to get rid of doubles.  Sometimes when I try and turn off my iPod it won't respond.  So I have to hold down play once...twice...thrice...foursies...five'ins...you get it.  It'll respond after a bit, but this is annoying.  And finally, my biggest complaint of all time, the 5GBs that you don't get to use!!!!!  This is such a pain because I bought a 60GB not a 55GB!!!  If iPod has to use 5 gigs to put memory crap on here then make it a 65GB and sell it as a 60GB!  Don't cheat people out of 5 gigs, I need the space!!!!!  Okay, I'm calm now.  So, all in all this is a good piece of equipment if you've got a whole lot of music and don't feel like carrying CD books around.  When I do get another MP3 player, I don't think I'll be going to Apple again though.

<Title>Good little gadget, but not perfect
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod came into my life about a month ago.  Learning to use the iPod has been a battle at times, but overall, it's been a battle worth fighting.  So far, the iPod itself works fine.  It charges relatively quickly, and plays many hours on the battery between charges.  I've heard the screens are easy to scratch, so I've been careful with mine, and I haven't had any problems with scratching to date.  My main problem has been figuring out the software.  On the same day I got the iPod, I also got a Sandisk 512 Mb MP3 player.  Without reading the instructions for the MP3 player, in less than 15 minutes, I had it loaded with music from Jukebox software that came with my computer, and playing tunes on my new iFi system.  It took the better part of 2 days to get that far with the iPod.  I had heard that iTunes can screw up your filing system in your music folder, so I tried connecting the iPod to Jukebox.  Several hours after starting the download to the iPod, the system froze, and I found that the download was aborted.  Then I found that the iPod had put the music files from Jukebox into its Notes folder, and didn't recognize them as music.  It seems an iPod will only talk to iTunes (although there was no documentation saying so in the packaging), so I had to install the iTunes software.  Fortunately, the software does give you a choice about rearranging your folder system, so my initial fears were unwarranted.  When I went to download my music from iTunes onto the iPod, however, the system reported that there wasn't enough space because of the files Jukebox had put in the Notes folders. I had already deleted those files by moving them to my desktop recycle bin, but some trace must still have been left in the file system.  As I tried reloading the music from iTunes, the system froze.  And the iPod froze.  And the only way out was to reinitialize the iPod.  Due to my unfamiliarity with iPod technology, it took several hours of studying the online instructions for such a procedure to understand how to do this, which buttons on the iPod to push and for how long.  Finally, I got the iPod back to its initial state and could begin to download my music, which took 6-8 hours for 35 Gbs.  Since then, the software has run more or less OK, although it's not very intuitive, and takes a bit of a struggle to figure out.  I think Apple thinks it's cool to provide a minimum of signage or instruction and let people figure things out on their own.  Perhaps the mystery of a device or software without instructions is supposed to be endearing, but I just find it frustrating.  It took me several days to figure out how to turn on the shuffle feature on the iPod.  As far as I can figure, every time you begin to play a shuffled playlist, you always have to start with the same first song.  Stupid design, if that's true, and stupid documentation if it's not.  I'll never figure out why people are so loyal to Apple anyway if this is an example of what customers have to put up with. Not only does Apple have an overwhelming share of the hardware market for music players, but they also rule the software, and through it, online sales. Smells of a vertical monopoly structure to me.  Good for business, bad for customers.   Since iPods are known to bad for your hearing, Apple has provided 2 volume "safeguards".  The first is through the iTunes software which has a tool to analyze all songs and put them at the same volume settings.  I tried this feature, and my music is still all over the place in terms of volume.  If the software did anything at all, I think it amplified applause and drum solos.  The other is a setting on the iPod where you can choose a maximum volume.  It would be great if the iPod software could look ahead at a song and make sure that it doesn't play it back with a decibel setting over a certain level.  Instead, the volume guard simply functions as a stop on the dial, so that you can't turn up the volume any higher than the setting you define.  But since music can come into the playlist at a variety of levels, if you set the volume guard in a quiet piece, when a loud piece comes on, it will set your eardrums afire.  And if you set the guard in a loud piece, you won't be able to hear the quieter pieces even with the volume turned up all the way.  In other words, the feature is useless.  Basically, Apple still hasn't done anything meaningful to address the volume problem, although a software solution wouldn't seem that hard to implement.  The iPod ships with a set of earbud headphones (with little black sponge caps that are impossible to put on and fall off all the time), a faux velvet case for the headphones (not for the iPod itself, which I mistakenly assumed, so I ripped out the seams of the little case trying to stuff the iPod in it), a CD with the iTunes software, and a short cable for connecting the iPod to a USB jack.  At a minimum, I would suggest investing in a tape adaptor for your car if you are lucky enough to have a tape player (the Sony tape adaptor works great, and is under $15), and a car charger.  Not only are tape adaptors cheaper than FM adaptors for the car, but they also are a lot more reliable and don't have the channel changing problem as you drive long distances.  You can connect your iPod to your existing stereo system with a Y-cable.  Or get an iPod ready sound system with a built-in charger.

<Content>This is an awesome gift. I use mine primarily in the vehicle and at the gym. While i'm doing my cross-trainer, I watch TV shows and listen to music. In the car, I just flip it to whatever playlist I want and continue my jams. The screen is delicate. I suggest you immediately purchase a clear screen protector or some kind of jacket so your video quality does not diminish. I can watch about 3 tv shows before I need to recharge the battery. The battery is great when listening to music though.

<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the first Ipod I've  bought and I'm pretty impressed. I put about 1000 songs and 200 pics on it and only used about 5 gbs. The sound, even thru the earpieces, is excellent and it has tons of space for all kinds of stuff from podcasts to music and pictures. Itunes software is also great and makes downloads a breeze. The one problem though is that it scratches in it VERY easy so if you buy one get a good case to go with it. Mine had several scratches on it within a few hours of having it and I even kept it in the case that comes with it. Also, unless you buy the adapter for $30, the only way to recharge it is to hook it up to your computer. They say that the battery can last for 20 hours on a charge, but I think its probably less than that. Still a great product!

<Title>Great screen! Enormous capacity! I love mine!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I absolutely adore my iPod with video. I have had a Nano and the B&W 20GB one as well. This video iPod is my clear favourite. I have had my iPod for over a month now (kind of a Thanksgiving present to myself).  The music runs great, as it did on the other ones. I have been fortunate never to have had a problem with my iPods yet (knock wood), and this new iPod is no exception.  I had reservations about the screen's being small at first, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I watch the iPod on the train in the mornings on the way to work, and I think the detail on that small screen is exceptional! True: you can't read, say, subtitles or small credits, but it's great just for good ol' TV- or video podcast-watching.  One drawback: the number of video shows available is limited. However, even in the short amount of time that I have had my iPod (around one month), I have seen the number of shows available double. I imagine that this number will continue to increase.  I think the size of the iPod is quite manageable as well. Although not nearly as small as the Nano, it's still a tiny size. I think it's still small enough when working out or running.  I love my iPod. If you have the money and the inclination, I would recommend getting one for yourself.

It works wonderfully and i will never use anything again this is a must buy!!!  the only reason i gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because of 2 things.  The "video" part is not that great its not like you can download the matrix onto your ipod and watch it when ever you want.    and also it says that i should have like 20 hours of battery time or constant use time and i sit at work for about 8 and a half hours and the battery bar goes down to the small red part wich means its allmost out so unless it stays like that for another 11.5 hours than its very very wrong and that is dissapointing.  but other than that its amazing!!!

Of coarse its not going to have all the battery life that it says onthe commercial, do you believe everything you hear on TV? If you expected everything cool to come with it you do not need to be getting anything because you WILL need to buy accessories for things, thats why they are called accessories, duh! And people, if you read the specifications before bought it, it tells you all about the movie thing and how you need to change the file types. So next time research before you buy the newest thing on the market!

<Title>Works great, scratches easily
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Actually, it's more like 4 and 3/4 stars, but Amazon won't let me do that.  Onto the review:  My first piece of advice for everyone buying this is to buy a case along with it, because the one in the package is almost worthless.  With mine, at least, scratches have been a problem, though a minor one.    My second piece of advice is to be on the lookout for some black headphones, because Apple packs this device with its trademark white ones.  (They sound pretty good and are attractive, but they are also a theif magnet.)  That said, everything else works like a dream.  Battery life has been as good as promised, maybe a bit better.  I managed to get two full viewings of Star Wars: Episode III in on it before the battery went, which is about 4 hours and 20 minutes of video in total.  The only thing that's a drag about getting video on the thing is that Apple doesn't have a conversion utility built into iTunes the way it does for music, so you have to find a third-party alternative.  I've been using Videora and it's been working great.    Finally, onto the music.  It sounds fantastic.  That's about all I can really say.  Plus, iTunes makes it so easy to manage what music you want on the player.  (It's been eye opening for me since my last mp3 player was a Rio Cali with what I realize now is awful software.)  All in all, a great machine.  (And yes, I think it's worth the extra $100 for the extra capacity and battery life.)

<Content>I wasn't really interested in iPods. My youngest son got one of these for Christmas last year and I conceded it was cool, but didn't see the point. After all, I had XM satellite radio and all the music I could stand. Then my wife walked me into the Apple Store on my birthday last July and announced that she and my two sons were buying me the biggest iPod available. I quickly discovered how cool it can be to have ALL of my tunes available all of the time. I have what I thought was a pretty big accumulation of CDs - around 1,000 or more - and this thing swallowed them all up and begged for more. At the moment, I have about 6,100 songs on it, along with my calendar, contacts and a ton of photos and that only amounts to about 23 gigs of the 60-gig capacity. And then there's podcasts. I've been a fan of Leo Laporte since the TechTV days and use the iPod to listen to nearly all of his podcasts, along with video podcasts on Photoshop techniques and other stuff. It was a big revelation - actually discovering the obvious - a couple of weeks ago when I bought a car adapter for my iPod. When we bought our Subaru Forester a couple of years ago, we thought the 6-CD changer was a big deal. Hah! On our last road trip, we took along maybe 50 CDs in a big bulky notebook-style carrier. Next time we hit the road, we'll be packing more than 1,000 albums worth of music in a device about the size of a pack of cigarettes. My wife liked it so much, she just bought the new 80 gig iPod and is eyeing the growing list of full-length movies available for iPod. This is an amazing device and I was delighted to be proven wrong about whether I needed one. The only downside is that you can get really obsessive about loading it with everything you can think of, to the point where it's almost like taking on a new job.

<Title>My First Ipod
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okey, I've had my 60g video Ipod for a few months now. My entire CD collection is now on this thing along with most of my digital photos. With all that I still have used only about 10 gig or so of space on my Ipod. I now take it on my walk to work and use it all the time. The short of it is I love this thing.

<Title>Good product. Had it for 3 months; Use it daily and often.
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>===THE GOOD===  - Sounds great.  - Screen is sharp and clear.  - Will play any MP3's you already have in your music colletion (but requires iTunes software)  - Easy, intuitive user interface.  - Works well for frequent, everyday use.  - Has games, a calendar, and contacts and note-storing capability   ===THE BAD===  - I have to convert MPEG, DiVix and AVI movies using intermediary software because they do not play in their original format.  - Requires iTunes software (included) to interface with the iPod.  - Music purchased through iTunes is in WMA format which only plays on iPods, unlike MP3 which plays on most software.  - Only comes with a USB charger. Recommend buying a charger for the car lighter and/or 120V wall outlet if you travel and don't have consistent USB access.  - Screen scratches easily. Recommend buying a case w/ a protective screen cover.  - Battery discharges quickly when watching movies. (When watching a movie w/o interruption, battery will last about 2-4 hours.)  ===ALSO...===  - Battery discharges quickly; but charges quickly too.  - The 60GB hard drive is actually about 54GB.  - iTunes has a slight learning curve and takes some getting used to.

You can have access to music catalogs, download your favoriate TV Shows (wow how far we have come) and take nice pictures all with a spin of your fingers.  Convinent, stylish and functional.  If you don't have a good computer, I don't recommend this device.  You may find yourself frustrated due to lack of memory or durating of music downloading time.  Also, this device could be more affordable but it's worth every penny.

I'm a little confused about why Podcasts are showing up under the music category, but that's not the iPod's fault-at least I don't think so.  The only bad thing is that the accessories are very expensive.

<Content>I'd have to say i'm satisfied with this purchase. I take it everywhere i go. If i kno i have to wait, i take it with me, if im gonna be in the car, i take it with me. Its very useful, not only for music but also for video and photos. The only things would be 1. iTunes; if u lose your music in iTunes, u need a third party application to take everything off of your ipod. 2. The 80Gb came out like 2 weeks after i got this one, for the same price. So I'd go with the 80Gb. Other than that, which really isn't problems with the item itself, i'm happy with this purchase.

<Title>Ridiculously Fantastic 
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a number of toys in my older age, and the Apple I-Pod is clearly a favorite! I use it in the car. I use it with my high-end home system. I use it for music enjoyment first and then and occasional audio book. I also use it during a workout. When I travel or get stuck waiting somewhere for something I will use the video. All the functions work great. It's easy to use and it does so much it's just about ridiculous. It's the Mother of all gadgets. If you buy one (and you will be glad) I recommend getting a protective case for it just to keep it looking like new. This compact wonder is one of the few things in life that will give me my moneys worth (and more).

<Title>WOW
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had no idea how addictive this is. I've gotten into bit torrents and just watched "Chronicles of Narnia" in mp4 format.  There are great video podcast to download. The first music video I downloaded  from iTunes was "Thriller" Battery life for videos is just over 2 hours. I haven't figured out how long for just music or regular podcast or audiobooks but it has to be 10+ hours. It charges up completely when I sync it to the computer in a couple of hours. I add/take away things 3 or 4 times a week. One thing I've worried about is scratches because so many people complain. I've yet to get one and I've had it over a month. I realize by saying this the next time I look I'll find some. This is by far the best gadget I've ever bought.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a Zen Micto on May, and I was looking forward to have a better MP3 Player. When I saw the iPod video at a local electronic store, I was amazed.  You can store everything: music, photos and videos, plus the extras.  PROS:  - Amazing quality. - Big screen(considering the size of the iPod) - Store music, photos and videos. - Shows the album art on a song that has one. (I really like seeing the album art while playing a song). - Very lightweight. - Good quality sound.  CONS:  - Scratches easily. I'd recommend getting a iSkin case or something to protect it. - The battery life is shorter while playing videos or photo slideshows. - Doesnt come with an AC Adapter, so be ready to s[end some more money. - To view videos, you must have the video files in mpg4, and iTunes lacks a converter, so you must get one third party converter, such as Videora. (Search on google "Videora iPod converter") This was a annoying because I have a lot of recorded TV Shows on my Media Center PC. So if you want to convert recorded TV Shows from Media Center, you have to convert the dvr-ms file to mpeg (go to www.download.com and search for DVRMSToolbox), and after converting it, go to videora and convert that mpeg file.   Thats it. After 1 month of having it, Im very pleased.

<Content>My wife got me the new black 60gb iPOD Video for Christmas.  I loved it right out of the box. I've used other MP3 players and this is by far the best. It was easy to setup and transfer all of my music over.  After a little research and downloading a few apps I was able to rip a DVD to play on the iPOD.  It looks better than I expected.  the iPOD is very easy to use and is full of neat features that make it more than just a music player.  The sound is better than the Creative MuVo 1GB player that I had prior.  I would recommend you buy a case or cover for it as soon as you buy it because it is easy to scratch the cover which would bother me much but I didn't want mess up the display for watching videos.

<Content>I just got the BLACK version of the 5G iPod. From the moment my hands touched the box to the point I first saw its beautiful and LARGE color screen, it is simply stunning. Thinnest iPod to the date sporting the biggest screen to the date. The 60GB version has longer battery life and both versions come with video playback. You want the video on your iPod and don't think the screen is too small -- it is just right! With Quicktime Pro 7 you can convert any of your movies and put them on your iPod and I hear you can download other programs that convert full 3 hour movies in less than an hour!!!! YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT! Everyone will stare at you because this product is simply stunning. Eye candy indeed!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>A Fashion Statement
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: -Looks awesome -High capacity. No other company yet offers a 60GB player. They are all stuck on 30GB. -Video capability -Good interface -Good value. For once in the history of all versions of the iPod, the 60GB video player is the best value in it's segment. However, I doubt this will last long. Apple products have been notoriously overpriced throughout Apple's history and I doubt other companies will sit around for long watching Apple bask in its newfound value.  Cons: -Faceplate (including screen) scratch very very easily. After a short time, the beautiful video is hindered by all of the scratches on the screen. This is really the most serious problem with this iPod. Go find someone who has had theirs for a while and just look at it. Not so pretty anymore. Make sure you buy a protective covering if you buy an iPod. -Materials are typical Apple quality. Which is to say, they are very low quality. Drop the iPod from 2 feet = GAME OVER. Sometimes you don't even need to drop it, it just breaks itself. -iPod must be sent to Apple when it needs a new battery. Other companies' music players have removable batteries to avoid this annoyance -Ease of use? Most other companies use an interface that is nearly the same as Apple's. In fact, Creative's is almost exactly the same. If you think the iPod is easy to use, then many other players will be easy to use too. Just compare Apple's interface to Creative's (as an example). Both have few buttons and a scroll device and their interfaces are nearly identical.  Credit Apple's success with the iPod to styling and some of the best advertising in history , not to functionality and value. Unfortunatelly, other companies have not yet matched Apple's 60GB. Furthermore, other companies 30GB players are little less expensive at the moment. So, if you need the capacity and can keep the screen covered, the iPod is, for once, the best choice. But that doesn't mean it's a good choice.

<Title>The New iPod
<Date>Tue Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The best Portable Music Player has gone video. Now, thinner and longer battery life then its predecessor, the  new iPod is unmatched with any other portable music player available.  Overall, this item is great but there are still room for improvement: 1) Wider Video Format Support: Currently, the iPod video ONLY supports MPEG-4 and H.264 video formats.  It would be nice to be able to playback MPEG-1, MPEG-2, DivX, and Xvid.  Many people need to convert MPEG-1 to MPEG-4 but the audio can't be retain from a direct export using quicktime pro.  If you are having this problem, what you have to do is demux it first, convert the audio separately into AAC.  Once that is done, open the video and AAC audio file and join the audio with the video.  Now export to MPEG-4.  But make sure you set the audio to pass through other wise it will re-encode the audio, resulting in poor audio quality.  2) Longer video playback: The iPod video has 30 or 60 GB's of space allowing you to store hundreds of hours of video.  But, the battery life only lasts 2 hrs for the 30 GB and 3 hrs for the 60 GB.  Barely enough to watch one movie.  But I guess that's why they are only sellying TV shows and Music Videos on iTunes.  3) Support for Higher resolution: Currently, only 320 x 240 is supported for H.264 and 480 x 480 for MPEG-4 (Though I have put in a movie of the size 640 x 256 in and it played just fine).  The optional iPod A/V cable allows you to stream the video to a TV but with such a small resolution, the video quality isn't as good (Not bad either).  It would be nice if it can support 720 x 480 (the TV resolution standard).  Everything else is just fine.  The limited bitrate for H.264 might get annoying, so you can just encode in MPEG-4 (which support 2.2 MegaBits or roughly 270 KiloBytes).  Thats more than enough.  320 x 240 screen resolution is good, any bigger and the iPod won't be very portable anymore.  Compared to the new video playing mp3 player from Creative Labs: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CS7U1C/qid=1136251449/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl147/102-9014245-3805738?n=507846&s=pc&v=glance  For a higher price, it looks comparable to the iPod but until its release, I can't be certain.

<Title>cool cool cool
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many people are stating that they do not use their iPod for video tasks nearly so much as video.  I am a little different.  I have a ton of videos I downloaded off of bitorrent, that I watch everytime I get bored with what ever I was doing.  The 2.5 inch screen does not seem to be scratch prone, but lends itself well to eyestrain after 2 and a half hours of watching videos on it.  The first thing you will notice when you view videos is how great they look and sound, and then you will notice your battery life disappeared and you can't watch any more.  Videos that you download off the web (not through itunes) are only able to be classified as music videos or movies, and that makes for a big mishmash of videos within those two folders.  On the ipod it appears impossible to select an video album or a video artist.  So that gets to be a real pain in the butt.  Also, the headphones suck.  Replace them as soon as you can.  Lastly if you plan on watching a lot of videos get another pair of headphones and a splitter because other people are gonna want to watch yuor iPod also.  I like it.  You probably will too.

<Title>Uh, is it supposed to scratch like that?
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I received my iPod in the mail today, and I was, to say the least, completely blown away by it's size, and of course it's capabilities. What I wasn't blown away by, on the other hand, were the amounts of scratches it got. Right away. After I wiped it with my shirt.  Anyway, negatives aside this thing is a mechanical behemoth. If you're going to go iPod video, go 60 gig, because frankly, 30 is not enough for video and music. Of course, if video isn't your forte, go for an iPod photo for it's color screens (and it's cheaper.).  Before you think you can add your DVDs into this, think again. Try and find software to rip the video files out, and then find a converter to make it iPod compatable.  All in all, this is an excellant product with a lot of potential, but if you're looking for something with the same capabilities and not just the name, go for a Creative Zen: M. The same thing (almost) in 30 gigs and with no need to convert your other files into anything "creative compatable".

<Content>My old iPod died and I was faced with the dilemna of what to buy next.  Stay true to Apple, even with all of its problems and mine unexpectedly dying?  I was VERY tempted by the new Gigabeat, and the only reason I didn't get it is because there are no accessories for it.  No cases, car chargers... I don't need anything fancy, but I do want to be able to charge this thing when I'm driving between San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Plus, I already had most of the accessories I would need for a new iPod.    I've had this new iPod for about a month now and I am very happy with it.  GET A CASE.  I don't use it for video or photos (why you would want to watch something on that tiny little screen I just don't know), but for music, it's great.  No complaints... yet :-)

<Title>A descent MP3 player to use
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is not that bad.  However, two little quirks that I didnt like about it is 1) you have to use iTunes to transfer the songs from your computer to the player and 2) as far as I know, only MP3 and AAC file extensions are supported.  My whole jukebox on my computer is WMA format (20GB worth).  So, if you are like me, plan on two days of file converting (iTunes does it for you), before you can enjoy the product.  Havent used the video option yet.  It also would be note-worthy that this iPod has the battery built-in.  So, in a year or two, I am anticipating forking over another thirty to forty bucks for a new battery.  Other than that, have been pleased, thus far, with using the 60GB iPod.  Also, a helpful hint.  I bought the black version, because the white shows the dirt and grime...however, come to find out, black shows fingerprints very well...a simple over sight. :P

<Title>IPOD 60GB Video
<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had all types of high capacity hard drive mp3 players from I-river to Cowon to the original PJB, Archos etc....  I have purposely stayed away from the Ipod due to an original PC interface problem.  However, I bought this project now since it represneted to me an advanced capability, and my new Nissan Maxima only had an interface for the IPOD.  So I was sort of boxed in if I wanted a lot of music in my vehicle.  The IPOD has greatly impressed me in its functionality, ease of use, i-tunes software interface, size, sound, earphones are the best set of "earbud" phones I have ever listened to.  Note, "earbuds", not nearly as good as the Koss portaphones, but good quality to say the least.  I have a Cowon X5 60 GB as well, which is probably 90% of the quality of IPOD, i.e. it fails in the customer support arena, battery life, peripherals, etc.  But it outweighs IPOD int he drop and drag arena and maybe a bit on the sound quality.    If you are thinking about getting this product, I would go for it vs. any other player on the market as of this writing.  One more thing, "DO NOT BUY ON THE AMAZON CARD".  I made a mistake and had to travel overseas, and they immediately took my interest rate from a promotional 3% to 29% with penalties and fees.  Nobody at Amazon or the bank cared about my reasoning, and therefore this has soured my interest in dealing with Amazon again, either via credit card or not.  A total lack of consumer consideration with a very viable and "backed up" reason for a simple error!  They were horrible at the bank and Amazon, without a care.    So buy Ipod, but either get it somewhere else, or at most don't use your Amazon card....they will rip you off without moving a facial muscle in the process!  Good Luck folks, and enjoy the new Ipod 60GB Video.

<Title>Thinking different is cool, Apple iPod is not.
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.    That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers.  I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).     I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player.  I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod!  Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over).  What a waste of money and time.

Then I looked on apples website and saw the 80GB IPOD!!!!! The batterly life for video is 3x as long. The screen is 60% brighter. There is gapless playback, as well as other tweeks for $350....GET IT NOW!!! Mine will be here in about 3 days. Don't pay $370 for a 60gb ipod and get mad when you see the 80gb in stores. If you want the 60gb and not 80gb just w8 for the price drop. Apple no longer makes them so the price is sure to drop. The ipod is not the perfect HD mp3 player, but they are still king of the mountain. I highly recommend this product from using this product second hand.

<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Yes, iTunes purchases do have their own format, but all my other music is copied from CD as an MP3 (using iTunes no less) so it can be played on multiple formats.  The user friendly controls are the best I've used on any MP3 player, and there's no beating the look.  The only reason why it gets a 4 instead of a five is because a integrated FM tuner would be nice, as well as even longer battery life.

<Title>Don't leave home without it!
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am in disbelief when I see reviews that are mad at Apple because they have to re-upload their digital music to a new computer or because they lost their songs because he wanted to add a cd.  First off burn all your songs on to a DVD and be done with it.  Lastly, learn how to use your own software and hardware and you would not have lost your music because of your ineptitude.  Ranting done, it is bad luck to have your iPod break on you.  But this is inevitable.  Millions of iPods are made and there are most certainly going to be some defects or something bad that happens, and most certainly those very same people are going to come on to sites like this and bash it, more so than the millions of people who love their iPod are going to write good reviews.  Don't let this deter you from this wonderful product.  I almost didn't get one because I doubted the hardware that I would be spending good money on.    This is perhaps the most used product I own, second only to my computer.  To date I have only been able to use about 20gbs of space and I have put 4,000 songs on already!  I have compared this product to older iPods and the screen is definitely bigger and more vibrant, plus the drop down menus are better.  I have only had one glitch happen once, which was when I pushed play it said it was playing but nothing happened.  When I plugged it in to my computer it corrected itself with the power influx.  I have nothing bad at all to say about this iPod.  I can't believe I waited as long as I did, but I am all the happier now that I have it.  This is a must for everyone.  A definite recommend.  5 stars.

<Title>What can you say?  It's the iPod
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Arguable the best product Apple has ever made, the iPod Video (5G) does exactly what it's supposed to, in the best looking package, with the best user interface.  For all the talk of iPod killers, I don't see it happening anytime soon.  There's simply nothing better or easier to use than the iPod + iTunes package out there for 95% of consumers.  This is the thin wedge into Microsoft's empire!

<Title>my ipod
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, this is my first ipod ever. I got the 60gb one cuz I figured $100 more for double the memory...and plus I felt as though I'd regret not getting the 60gb version later on.  I resisted the ipod craze for a good, many years but for some odd reason, changing CD's, leaving my cd case in the car, guessing what album was in what spot in my in dash cd changer, and all that good stuff got to be quite annoying. I invested some time and researched some good car kits and went with a neo ion car kit that set me back $200. $400+$200=$600..quite the penny for some music. Anyhow, for the amount of money I spent on this gizmo, I suppose I was expecting a religous experience or something. Not quite. I suppose its on par with my CD player but thats about it. Navigating your ipod while driving is quite the risky venture, quite a bit harder than changing cd's while driving. So sounds on par with everything else out there..nothing mindblowing. The interface is fairly straightforward on the ipod itself...although itunes is another story. I wanted to shoot a hole in my computer after itunes decided to rearrange my entire library in some wierd random format that split some albums into 4-5 different albums just for ***** and giggles. I spent quite a bit of time fixing that mess. Black as I'm sure you've all heard, scratches quite easily. I rectified this with an agent 18 case. During the time that the case was being sent, I just had the ipod w. the factory plastic layer on it. It survived relatively unscathed. The agent 18 case does a very good job of protecting the ipod. Beware that it does take away quite a bit of the aesthetics of the ipod..it loses some of that sleek, sexiness factor that is intrinsic to the ipod...kind of like the hot supermodel that gained about 30lbs too much.  If I wasn't such a show off, I'd have gone with a cheaper brand with more options for music subscription. You have to deal with the proprietary itunes web site for music purchases. I just don't see a Zen mp3 player wowing anyone thats in my ride. They absolutely coo over the ipod video. So its certainly a plus in the wow factor, and as i'm still young and in the dating game, every little edge helps. Hrrmm, what else...oh yeah, its way too heavy to take on a jog or nething like that. Plus seeing as how its hard drive based, not a good idea to be flopping it about everywhere. I got the shuffle for work out purposes...1gb of random songs is a bit much though...I'd like to be able to see where I am going but I digress. Black and sexy on the front, a metallic silver on the back engraved with your name on it if you so desire. Sleek, dark, and pretty. I view it more of as a status symbol than nething. A bit overrated, its not going to give you an epiphany or nething. It works though. There still are a few bugs to be worked out though. The new 1-10 update is pretty darn bad I hear. I would wait before updating to the latest firmware as I hear its buggy in and of itself. Hope my ramblings helped. Get the 60gb. Video will eat up a lot of memory.  Oh yeah, I'm one of the few thats not too hot on the click wheel thing. Say your right next to the item you want to select. Also, say your driving, one eye on the road, one on the ipod. You move your finger ever so slightly to select just the right album when suddenly you move 3 spots over instead, only to begin the process annew. I'm relatively svelte, so I don't have sausage fingers or nething but sometimes, one handed navigation of the ipod while driving is quite difficult. Sometimes, while just pressing the enter button in the middle, you will accidently brush up against the gray outer circle and press the wrong selection. Just something to keep in mind.

<Title>Functionality is great, but beware of the screen!
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the iPod.  The functionality and simplicity of use really cannot be beat.    I bought a 3G iPod a couple of years ago, and besides needing the battery replaced in the first year (which Apple essentially paid for), it was and continues to be a great product.  When the new video iPod was released, I knew it would be a short amount of time before I upgraded my 3G.   The Video iPod works just as well as the 3G, very easy to use...photos and videos look great, all in a package that is thinner than my 3G while having 3X the capacity.   However, I have one major complaint - the screen scratches so easily I am just about to the point that I am going to call Apple and request a refund. Before buying, I read several other reviewers complain about scratches but thought they were just careless.  I've always had my video iPod in some type of case and after about a month I have A LOT of scratches on the screen.  Even cleaning the screen with a clean cloth seems to scratch it - extremely disappointing!    So, if I were to make my decision today, I would actually hold off buying the video iPod until the next class action lawsuit forces Apple to re-work the very low quality surface they have chosen to apply to the video iPod.

<Title>I love my iPod but.....
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Actually I give the iPod itself a 5, but give Apple a 1 for how they supplied and distributed the iPod. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy on their part.  I received my iPod video for Christmas. I love it. It does everything Apple says it will do. However, there are some things you should know before you buy one.   Note: I have a computer with Windows XP, and this review is based on my experiences using a Windows based computer. I am reviwing the 60 GB version.   1. Apple provides almost no documentation with the iPod. If you want to read the owners manual you have to download it from their website or from Amazon.com. Even then, the owners manual doesn't give a whole lot of detail on things like converting video to a format which will be playable on the iPod. You have to visit the online help section of the Apple website.  2. The iPod doesn't come with all of the software necessary to connect it to your computer. The iPod does come with a special version of iTunes, BUT it does not come with the proper version of Quicktime - you need version 7 to run the iTunes software they provide. You have to download this from their website too. When I did the download, I was visiting my folks and had to use their dial up internet access to download Quicktime 7 - this took 2.5 hours.  Another thing, when you install Quicktime 7 it also installs a version of iTunes. - This is important - This version of iTunes is NOT the correct version required to run the iPod. Once you install Quicktime 7, you need to install the iTunes software provided WITH the iPod afterwards. The Apple website erroneously indicates that the iTunes downloaded with Quicktime 7 is the latest version of iTunes - not true - The iTunes supplied with the iPod is the true latest version. I tried to connect my iPod to the computer using the incorrect version of iTunes and the iPod froze completely which brings me to my next criticism.  3. There is no way to re-set the iPod when it freezes like mine did. The screen stayed lit and the "Do Not Disconnect" message stopped flashing. When my laptop freezes up, if nothing else works, I can always remove the battery. Not so with the iPod. The battery is inaccessible. If you need to get a new battery, the owners manual says you have to ship your iPod to Apple, and pay about $ 60 to replace your battery. Also, Apple says that when your iPod comes back with the new battery, all of your music, videos and pictures will be gone. You will have to re-load them all again. It also (helpfully) says to make a backup of your files before you send it in. I had to wait for the battery to run out before I could try again.   4. Apple doesn't supply a recharger with this iPod. Unlike previous iPods Apple cheaped out on supplying a recharger. You can recharge the iPod through the USB port on your computer, however this is not helpful on the road unless you happen to have a laptop or other access to a computer. Apple will sell you a recharger for $30.00, and according to several customer reviews on the Apple website, the recharger doesn't come with the proper connecting cord. Apparently this costs another $20.00   5. The iPod software doesn't come equipped to convert video files into a form which will play on the iPod. The Apple website says you need to upgrade to Quicktime 7 PRO for another $ 30.00. According to Apple Quicktime 7 PRO "easily converts video files". NOT TRUE - While Quicktime 7 PRO may convert some files, it does not convert "muxed" video files which I learned later from the Apple website (after I purchased Quicktime 7 PRO), that it will not convert "muxed" video. FYI "muxed" video is when your video and audio are integrated into one data stream. A search of the internet led me to the Ulead website. They sell a product called Intervideo CD Copy 4 Platinum, which will rip video from your home DVD's and convert them to a format suitable for the iPod video. However, the software costs $79.00 - you can download a free trial version. I ended up buying the software and it works fine. Buying Quicktime 7 PRO was a total waste of my $ 30.00  Other - Apple's website is geared towards Macintosh users. The video conversion section assumes you own a Mac. All of the screenshot examples they provide are for a Mac. If you use a Windows based computer, you are basically on your own.   Fortunately, I know quite a bit about computers and was, after some time to play around, able to figure out how to easily download music, video and pictures into the iPod - One word of warning - I strongly recommend that you set all of the download options to MANUAL. If you don't, the iPod will sync with your computer automatically, and if you have deleted music, video or pictures from your hard drive OR connect the iPod to multiple computers (as I do), you will find your music, video and pictures get deleted from the iPod. Setting to manual avoids the deletions. There are some minor clunks to the software too. I have been including album cover art with my music. Most of the time, the iPod diplays the cover art when I play my music, on occasion though it indicates that a picture has been added for the song, it won't display the picture on the screen. I think this is somehow related to the information line for the Album description. If this is blank or there are many albums entered at once for the same picture, it seems to get confused and not display the picture. In each case, playing around seems to have gotten the picture to show, although, I am not exactly sure which step seems to resolve the problem.  All in all I love my iPod. I am now fairly adept at using the software and can download music, video and pictures easily (and without deleting them). If you are a novice at using a computer, you may find it very difficult to use and learn the software. While the iPod itself is easy to use once loaded, if you are getting one of these for someone who is not comfortable with a computer you might want to load it up for them.   Also the iPod is a delicate mechanical hard drive. If you have very young children you might want to keep it out of their curious little hands - and don't drop it.  I hope that a piece of equipment this complex will last for many years.    Apple is not behaving in a customer friendly manner. They look like a company trying to squeeze every cent from their customer base. Raw greed is not becoming. Apple can get away with this right now, because they have the only player with these capabilities. You have to buy from them right now and they know it. They have a monopoly on players with all of the iPod features. Like Microsoft they are alienating their customers. Once a suitable competitor for the iPod comes along, Apple will be forced to make changes to how they market and package the iPod. As they will lose some of their customer base. It is marketing 101 that you want your customers to feel good about your company. Right now, I have a very low opinion of Apple, based on their money grubbing attitude. They make a really neat player, but don't treat their customers very well. This will come back to haunt them I'm afraid.

<Title>Ipod Video: The Future Of MP3 Players
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I, just like everyone else I'm sure, asked for an Ipod for Christams, and received it. I have had it now for about a month, got about 1,000 songs on it, and I love it! This thing is a dream. I really think no other MP3 player on the market is a sweet and amazing as this thing.  So, what is it that makes it so amazing, and so much better than everything else? I'll tell you. One of the best features is that its 60 gigs of space, meaning a s**tload of songs (15,000 to be exact). Another feature it has is the ability to store over 10,000 photo's onto the Ipod. Now, that may or may not be a huge deal, depending on whether or not you actually care about photography or something. But its a very cool feature, nontheless. Another, and the most obvious new feature, is the ability to play videos. I can safely say that this is the most remarkable feature I have ever seen on an MP3 player. The picture the Ipod generates looks great, and it can play music videos, movies (my friend even put Star Wars on his Ipod), and Podcasts (basically, a bunch of TV shows and stuff that you can usually get for free at the Ipod online music store). Its a great feature, and you can take it to school and show all your friends your videos, not just music anymore. Another cool feature are the games. You have Parachute (basically shooting a bunch of paratroopers parachuting out of a bunch of helicoptors), Music Quiz (probably the coolest game, especially if you have a lot of songs. The Ipod randomly picks a song and plays a small clip, and you have to guess which one of the choices it is), Brick, and Solitaire. The click wheel is a lifesaver. Say you have 3,000 artists. Which would you rather do: use a directional pad on the MP3 player to scroll to find whatever song your looking for (don't forget, thats 3,000 songs), OR, would you like to get to that artist in a fraction of the time? Well, that's what the click wheel will do for you. Sometimes, it can get tedious, though. Like if you finally land on that artist you want to listen to, you move your finger to press the middle button (which is kind of like the enter button), but then suddenly, it goes to the wrong artist, because you moved your fingers just enough to scroll one more artist down. It can get VERY annoying, and it happens to me nearly every time I use it. There's no getting used to it. I've had it for a little over a month, and I still keep doing that.  Despite the large amount of memory this thing has, its not big at all. Its just a tad bit larger than the 30 gig (which is super-slim). The Ipod itself is in no way durable, but you shouldn't own such a device if you're not going to be careful with it. The Itunes software is easy to install and simple to use. You can store a nearly infinite amount of regular MP3 format songs, tons of videos, and plenty of photo's. You can also add the cover artwork from your favorite CD's, which shows up at the left of the screen, next to the song titles. The color screen on the Ipod can get scratched very easily, so it might be a good idea to buy a jacket or a case for it. The jacket they give with the Ipod gets dirty very easily, and doesn't protect the Ipod very well. The headphones that come with it are average quality, and sometimes your music can be heard by people around you, even with the volume at minimum level. This is because there are sound holes on the outer part of the headphones, which doesn't go in your ear, making it sound louder than it is. The only problem really with the Ipod is the battery life. It says ten hours, but after maybe 2 hours for me(not even that much) of total use at school or somewhere else after a full night's charge, its already almost out of battery.   Pros: 1.It has 60 gigs worth of space. 2.It is very thin, despite the amount of memory. 3.Has the unique photo storage feature. 4.Also has the unique Video playback feature. 5.Color screen looks very good. 6.Has addictive games you can play while listening to your music. 7.It is the largest capacity MP3 player on the market. 8.Itunes software is simple to install and use. 9.The click wheel offers much faster navigation for easier acess to your music. However, sometimes, it can get tedious to try and pick a certain artist using the click wheel, as it sometimes scrolls an extra time when you hardly even touch it, causing you to pick the wrong artist (it gets annoying after a while).  Cons: 1.Case it comes with gets dirty easily, and doesn't protect much. 2.Ipod gets scratched VERY easily, and isn't the least bit durable. One fall, and you have to send it back. 3.WAY too expensive. 4.Headphones are average quality. 5.Extremely low battery life compared to others on the market.  Overall: I would highly recommend an Ipod Video to anybody who wants to store music and listen to it on the go without all those bulky CD players (think about it: you can carry like 1000 albums on this thing, and with a CD player, you can only carry as much as your CD case fits). A bit expensive, but if you can afford it, you might as well get it, especially if you LOVE music like me.

<Title>With a little patience, the video capabilities are fantastic
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 60GB Black video ipod from an Apple store this week.  I asked the sales rep what I needed to do to play my DVD's and TV shows on the Ipod.  He told me that was not supported unless they were downloaded from Itunes, and would not work due to a variety of issues, including copy protection and technical problems with converting the files to the right formats.  Based on what I had read on the internet, I knew he was wrong.  So I spent the weekend deciding to prove him wrong.  I have several Tivo units and a Windows Media Center PC, as well as movies on DVD.  There are a number of solutions on the internet that offer to convert these files to the Ipod video format.  I played with several of them with mixed results:  Cucusoft was highly rated on the internet, but after playing with it extensively, I found that the programs would occasionally lock up, or I would lose the sound randomly while watching a show.  Too bad, because it was easy to use, and it supported the ability to load multiple files into the conversion utility at one time.  This is an important feature, since the conversion process is so slow.  With cucusoft I would load twenty TV shows and let it run overnight, and everything would be converted and ready to load into Itunes the next morning.  The second product was PQ DVD.  This product has generally received good reviews, but people have noted that it crashes from time to time.  In my testing, I was able to convert DVD's, Tivo recordings, and Windows MCE recordings almost flawlessly.  It did crash once, and to fix it I had to uninstall the software and reinstall it.  Still, for $34.95, it's a bargain.  I now have dozens of TV shows and movies ready for viewing on my Ipod, all with excellent video and sound quality, and all without having to pay a fee to Itunes.    You may wonder why anyone would want to watch much video on a 2.5" screen.  In general, it's not my first choice.  But, for those long airplane rides when you have lots of time to catch up on your favorite shows, there is nothing more convenient than the Ipod for music, TV, movies, and photos.  I can fit more than 40 movies on the device, along with 2,000 songs and all of my photos, and still have room left over to add new content.  The possibilities are endless.  Over time, I'm sure the conversion utilities will get faster and more stable.  Still, for a version 1 release, PQ DVD really adds a lot of functionality to an already great portable entertainment device.

<Title>For those new to iPods
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This review is written from the perspective of a first-time iPod user, and is intended for those who are also new to this. So, forgive my newbeeness.  What is an iPod? An iPod is a portable storage device. This 5G iPod can store music (its main function), podcasts, audiobooks, video, and general computer files. It has a rechargeable battery built in.  What is the difference between an iPod and an "MP3 player"? MP3 player is a generic term and refers to a range of portable music players that use digital music files. iPod is a specific "MP3" player from Apple. It plays AAC files (Apple's proprietary music files), the old generic mp3 files, and a few other files. Please do a little research on the different file types before you buy an MP3 player, otherwise you may get stuck with something that doesn't play the files you already have or bought online. Cnet.com has an MP3 buying guide that is the ideal starting place if you need to know more.  Then what is the advantage, I already have a CD player? Because the 5G iPod can, essentially, hold your entire collection of music in the palm of your hand.  How/what do you connect to an iPod? You can connect headphones directly. You can also plug into to the bottom 30-pin docking hole by which you can connect to a wide variety of accessories (stand-alone speakers, car-adapter devices, etc.) or connect to your home PC. You can also connect iPod to a television (when you purchase those cables). The iPod accessories are what really make the iPod such a great device (and also what really makes money for Apple).  How does it all work? The iPod is really part of a 3-part system: iTunes software (which exhists on your PC), the iPod itself, and the accessories. iTunes software is downloadable for free from apple.com and is necessary to operate your iPod (you can go download it right now to get a taste of what using an iPod might be like). iTunes is the central hub which gathers all your music, podcasts, audiobooks, and video and then places them onto your computer's hardrive and organizes them for you. It's all kept in one "Library", which can be searched/sorted numerous ways. How does iTunes get music into your library? 1) Place a CD that you already own into your CD-Rom drive on your PC, open iTunes, and "import" the music to your library. 2) Download music from the music store (which is built into iTunes) to add those songs to your library. 3) iTunes can search your hardrive for various music that you've already downloaded in the past, and copies them into your iTunes Library. Once you've gathered you music, video, etc. then connect your iPod to your PC via a USB connection, and then iTunes will transfer these files to your iPod. The iPod device itself is mostly read-only, meaning that you cannot really change/add/delete stuff unless you connect it to iTunes. iTunes controls the content of the iPod, whereas the iPod by itself is just a player. Now that you've got your stuff onto the iPod, just plug your iPod into the various accessories or headphones to play your stuff.  Why iPod? Why not use another MP3 player? Because iTunes is such a great piece of software. It's all centralized into iTunes. Importing, buying online music/videos, burning your own CDs, putting stuff into your iPod ... it's all in one place. iTunes is very intuitive, versatile, powerful, yet easy to use. The iTunes music store has the largest selection of online music and allows you to preview songs before buying.  What all comes in the 5G package when I buy it? You get the 5G iPod with 30GB or 60GB hardrive, earbuds, USB connection cord (to connect your iPod to your PC), and the iTunes software CD. This USB connection cord is shaped like a USB connection at one end and the 30-pin docking connection at the other end, and this will recharge the 5G iPod when connected to a PC. The package does NOT come with a docking station. It does NOT come with an AC adapter for your car or home outlet use. It does NOT come with external speakers.  What things should I be aware of before I buy this?  - You really need a high-speed internet connection if you want to buy music online. Also, downloading iTunes by itself will take forever if you have dialup. - Make sure you have high-powered USB connections on your computer. These are ones that came with the computer when you bought them from the manufacturer. Many of the add-on USB connectors (like ones you install to a PCI slot) won't work. - USB 2.0 is preferred and provides much speedier response when you connect the 5G to your PC. If you have USB 1 connections (like I do), it will take a few minutes for your PC and iTunes to respond when you connect the 5G. It appears as if the computer is locking up, but just wait a few minutes. - Although music is very easy to manage with iPod, getting video onto the 5G iPod is rather tricky. You can download videos and TV shows sold through the iTune's music store and those play just fine. The trick is trying to get you own DVDs onto the iPod. It can be done. However, it usually involves a multi-step process with two or more different programs that you have to find or buy (and no, Quicktime Pro will not do this). It's beyond my understanding. Check the apple.com message boards for help about this. I just don't want you to get the impression that you'll be able to put you favorite Family Guy episodes on your iPod with ease ... it's really tricky and almost doesn't seem worth it. - Tech Gear's USB 2.0 port PCI card and ADS Tech's Dual-Link PCI card (which has USB 2.0 and Fire-Wire) will NOT work with the 5G. When attached to Tech Gear's card, the iPod will not be recognized by iTunes. When attached to the ADS Tech's card, the computer reboots in a never-ending cycle. ADS Tech completely ignored my emails to their tech support. - Battery Life quotes from Apple are always overestimated and based on controlled situations. The 60 GB hardrive 5G iPod is rated at a 20 hour battery life. However, this is only if your music is stored at 128 killibits per second and you don't change to a different playlist or activate the backlight, nor use the sound equalizers, and listen through headphones at a low volume. Realistically, you're gonna get 8 - 14 hours of music playback from a full battery charge. Video playback is only like 2 - 3 hours. - The small pin connection on the top of the older iPods (it was right next to the headphone jack) is now gone for the 5G. Be cautious when buying certain accessories that may use this older connection. Some of the FM transmitters and voice recorders use this and won't work on the 5G. - Songs downloaded from iTunes are protected and will only play on devices that you authorize (using your iTunes account name and password).  Things you may need to also buy (don't just budget for the iPod, because realistically you'll also need some other accesories): - Protective carrying case. The 5G has moving parts. The back of the 5G is slippery. Not a good combination. Consider getting a semi-hard carrying case to protect your investment. - Car accessories. To listen to your iPod's music in your car you'll need one of 3 things: an FM transmitter (the most simple and popular method), a cassette adapter, or a direct line (the most expensive and tricky, yet best sounding). Some of these devices also recharge the iPod. - Docking bay with speakers. This allows you to place the iPod on the device and then listen to music though its speakers. Many of these also recharge your iPod. Almost an essential for any iPod user.   (Just FYI, in case you are wondering what the term "5G" means. This model is the 5th generation iPod created by apple. Hence, the term 5G. (4G would refer to the previous model, or 4th generation, etc.) Thought I should explain this because many of the accesories will refer to the iPods by their generation number.)  ********************  Well, apparently you aren't supposed to disconnect the iPod from your computer without first telling iTunes or windowsXP to disconnect it. I knew this, but for some reason I disconnected it improperly anyway. Guess what? My music got lost. I must have accidentally disconnected it when the iPod was updating the table of contents part of the HD (the FAT, I think) �K and now all the music was lost. It still says I have 20 GB of space used up, but no music shows up. So, I had to reset the iPod and reinstall the music.  So, what to do if your iPod decides to "act the fool" and you need to reset it to it��s factory preset condition? Well, there is a free program to download from the apple website. The iPod updater program can do one of two things: update your iPod to the latest version, or completely reset all settings and erase the iPod��s internal HD. Go to http://www.apple.com/ipod/download/ to get the iPod updater program. Once installed, you will have to reboot your computer. So, reboot. Then, you have to find the program and run it. Go to My computer --> open your hardrive --> programs --> iPod, to find this program, then run it. Warning, this will erase all files (music, video, etc.) from your iPod and put it back to the status that you first got it out of the box.  One other little caveat of info. I got a newer computer with much faster specs and a high speed USB 2.0 slot. When I am transferring the music back onto the iPod, it��s giving me problems if I try to send too much music at once. For example, I selected my entire library on my PC and then dragged it to the iPod to initiate a transfer of all my songs. Well, it worked for a while and then stopped the process and spontensously reset the iPod. Anyway, to make a long story short, I have a theory: on a real fast computer and high speed USB2.0 connection, I think the computer and USB are processing and sending the data faster than the iPod can write it to it��s little hardrive. If you have a fast PC and are experiencing these types of problems, I have found that transferring over 100 songs or less at a time seems to work. And then wait a few seconds before transferring over more songs, to give the little iPod hardrive a chance to ��catch up�� and finish writing all its data. Hope this helps.

<Title>Less than 2 hours of playback when doing videos
<Date>Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this in the hope of watching my favorite shows. Unfortunately, the battery doesn't last the 3 hours (playing video) as advertised. 1.5 hours is the norm I've got so far, so it's certainly not enough for those long-distance plane rides.  I'm keeping it because I need an MP3 player. But I should have gone for the 30GB model. What's the point of keeping 40 movies  when I can only do 1-2 hours of playback.   Or perhaps, a photo iPod might have been better value for money.  Oh btw, make sure you get a carry case, the shiny surface scratches like crazy.

<Title>Bow down to the new pod.
<Date>Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this thing for Xmas and it's freakin' awesome. The quality of sound, in my opinion, has improved majorly, and the new case for this thing fits snug, which is good because it won't slip out. On my Video Ipod, I have a bunch of stuff from David Bowie, NIN, AIC, Pink Floyd, Green Day, the list goes on and on. I don't have any videos or TV shows of my own or that I've bought(which is the whole point of this new Ipod), but me and my dad are going to check that out sooner or later. Another thing I like about this Ipod is that my old Ipod mini would only label the songs of one of my own records as track 1, track 2, track 3, etc, but this one reads the disc and puts up the names of the songs! I don't know if anyone had the same issue with an Ipod mini but I did. The Video Ipod comes with a little case that looks like a little pocket. It slides pretty easily out of the case and there's no way you can see the screen. I suggest getting the new case for the Video Ipod. Thanks for reading bye.

<Title>ipod sucks 
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was about to get an ipod video or mini or one of the millions they have,when my bought a creative mp3. He couldn't fit every song on it so he gave it to me and he bought another one. Let me start out with ipod just plainly sucks. Such as you cant use windows media player, and every body thinks itunes is the best but the 4gb mini can hold a little over a 1000 songs and my 5gb creative zen micro can hold 2500 songs. It also has a case around it like the new ipod videos but doesn't scratch up at all. The key pad format is simular but much easyer to use. If apple were to come out with an mp3 player that was compatible with windows media player and didn't suck so god damn bad I might actually be temted to buy one. The only reason apple came out with the ipod is so that people would buy there over priced (like anything from apple) computers. Another analagy is that apple makes something and microsoft and other brands make it a hole lot better. Creative is one of the best mp3 makers in the world, I say this because creative stands by there product and is not making a new model every day. If microsoft or some other company were to come out with the mp3 player before apple, apple would be another company on the side lines. I know this info because I've had frends and family that have told me this.    Pros: Eye candy small and slim can play video many accessories Cons: Scratches easly custemer suport sucks no removable battery pack over priced only works with I tunes hard dives fail on occasion almost no battery life compared to other mp3 players break easly small memory  This list of Pros and Cons reffer to the newer ipods (video, nano, etc). I forgot to menchen that Ipod holds half the amount of songs that any other brand, because windows media player cuts the file in half and keeping the sound quality. So if your planing on buying an mp3 player Creative is the best way to go.

<Title>Notes on a new iPod
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm not the oldest guy in the gym, but I finally got tired of being the last one with a tape cassette Walkman. After much deliberation and delay, I bought the 60gb iPod to hold all of our family's CD's (about 32gb in MP3 format) and support my workout music.  Why the Apple?  A network of friends who raved about it and want to give me music (it may be illegal, but it seems to be assumed..), no real perceived advantage to being contrarian, easy access and large drive size. Impressions: Overall, it pretty much meets all that you have heard in terms of styling and usability. You can't really go wrong unless you have some esoteric requirements. Understand, you will boost the base price with at least one charger or docking station, some type of warranty extension and some type of case, at a minimum. The headphones are an insult, but if you have any other sets around, they will all work (better). The thing does what you were told it would and does it prettily and simply. That said, for the money and the  market leadership, it has some sad lacks. 1)Sound quality is only OK. I'm no great audiophile, but I can tell that this device is at best a "B" for sonic reproduction. 2)Sound control is weak. Given that you cannot set input volume compensation as you can in an old school mid to high end tape deck, you are forced to face a playlist where the volume changes, song after song, this is maddening. I consider it the number one failure of vision and interference with the user experience of the music. 3) Failure to engage the vision of the end user is a major flaw. This could be an exciting toy, but past basic use, you really have to dig to find out what the possibilities are, and most of them are limitations. I expected the software to give me much more control over setting up and working with playlists. I guess I may be jaded to give such impressive technology a ho hum review, but the promises and potential are much greater, and the mediocrity of primary function bring it down. Overall, it is a solid, basic music player in a very pretty package but I'm looking forward to giving it to my son and getting the next generation, probably not from Apple.

<Title>onto our third iPod...
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>couldn't stand it anymore, so have upgraded to the almost latest and greatest.   i'm not sure why some of the other reviews are having difficulty transferring files to their iPods, and the other complaints.   for me the interface is very intuitive, loading in files is straightforward with iTunes, and the fidelity is more than good enough for me 99% of the time. i don't use the supplied earbuds but use inexpensive but excellent sounding koss titanium headphones that can be bought on sale for $20.  for the relatively small incremental price increase i went with the 60gb over the 30. just like Mac or PC hard drives, just when you think you have a hard drive that is so big that "i'll never fill this thing up...." it is full.   the only bad thing about all the iPod models is that they do get scratched up pretty easily. i solve that problem with an inexpensive silicone skin bought from eforcity website. no additional bulk, etc and the silicone makes the iPod easier to hold onto.

<Date>Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>my uncle got me the ipod as a gift...truthfully, i wanted to tell him not to bother with it because i wanted the creative instead. this is the worst form of mp3 player i have ever seen. i lose my songs time i try to update it. right now i have to call my uncle, apologise to him and tell him the ipod is driving me crazy. anyway, before i get angry an break this waste of money, the best option for me is to sell it and get the creative zen. my brother owns one of its old models, and i envy him. first of all, with the ipod, you always have to have the original cd or whatever, or else you are screwed. the only option left is to copy it to your hard drive. which i finally decided to do, but with a 60 gb ipod, there is s much space it can take. so i bought a 120 gb portable harddrive that cost about 200 buck. right now i have only 30 gb left, in only 2 weeks. so for the people who want to get songs from their friends ipod. don't bother because by the time your ipod updates, everything would be erased. while for my brother, some of the songs he has are from his friends computers and for the past year his player has not caused him any grief mine has caused me in the past few weeks. with his creative zen, he can easily store the music without having to spend a whole day for it to first convert and then store. for my ipod, i have spend atleast 2 day trying to convert my cd (although it contains 800 songs) and then wait another 2 days for it to store on the ipod and this is only if my itunes does not freeze and make me start from the beginning. any way, uncle, i'm sorry but the ipod has got to go and i guess i also have to say good bye to the 25 weekly free songs i get through facebook. oh well things i have to give up to have a peace of mind. before i forget, my 60gb ipod which is supposed to take up to 15000 songs can only take 3500 songs...i am still baffled over this because i have more songs that need to be in one place.

<Content>For the price, it better be good and has been, so far. I have pushed EVERY music CD I own to this thing and it did not squeek once. I have been pushing all my favorite movies and TV shows to it and have been very pleased. I only have about 15 gb left. It is pretty cool to have all the music I own on this thing and video as well. The thing that I'm finding out is the poor quality of some of the accessories; I mean, there's some real crapola out there, especially some of the charging docks with a line-out to your audio system.....DO YOUR RESEARCH. I have been using Lenogo DVD to MP4 for the video stuff and it's pretty good. I do have some problems with video/sound sync on some DVD's. I don't know if it's the conversion software or the actual DVD quality. I was able to convert Lost season 1 disk 1 and not the next disc in the series; I tried over and over, no luck. I tried two copies of the same movie and got the exact same problem. Not sure what that is. I may try another conversion software program and see what happens.

<Title>Apple 60 GB iPod with Video Playback Black
<Date>Wed Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As a techno junky it was a great rush to receive the iPod w/ video.  It of course goes anywhere, and with the right accessories anywhere can be more broad than you think.  I have the desk to speakers, earphones, car transmitter, and the micro-speakers.  I work out at the gym, listen at work, on my way here and there.    I have realized however the battery isn't long lasting. And I found the online instruction manual hard to find specific instructions.  When trying to find instructions to delete/clear items from the iPod I went over and over the manual then finally had to use the search feature to lookup the word "delete".  Managing the iPod library may be a little time consuming if you have other MP3 players loaded onto your computer.  The library features automatically finds all music on your computer and lists them on the iPod.  However, this can be easily corrected by clearing the unwanted music/podcasts/videos...  Once up and running I can say it is a breeze to add new music with the click of a button (whether uploading a cd or downloading an album from iTunes).  One thing I learned later that makes organizing and listening easier is to list the type of music in the properties of each song or album.  Then you can fully use the sort feature which is what makes iPod so speceal.  You can sort by author, genre, by beat...   The iPod is great.  I didn't have real problems with the device that a little understanding didn't solve.  And so far I've found only one limitation and that is the battery life, but what do you know.  There is an accessory for that too.

<Content>The 60Gb Ipod is almost perfect for me! The only things that could be improved are concerning: The lifetime battery, because it lasts very fast;  How it can be easily scratched out, so it must never stay without its case; and It would be perfect if we could have FM transmittion in the Ipod, as a lot of others MP3 player's have.  In the other side, it is wonderful to know that more than 14,000 songs can be stored in the IPOD - it's music for more than 2 generations...

<Title>Impressively Cool
<Date>Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm not used to 'jump into the bandwagon', especially when it comes to hyped technologies, but I have to admit this gadget is really special, like everyone says. But I won't waste your time (and mine) saying here what everyone knows. Let's concentrate on what is NOT being said:   1. For starters, it's really not 60Gb, it's around 55Gb. Apple used the same criteria as HD manufacturers, which is to consider 1Gb as 10^9 bytes, when 1Gb is equal to 2^30.  2. The only way you can charge the batteries is through the USB port of your computer, unless you buy extra acessories. The unit does not come with an AC adapter.  3. Yes, you can plug this into your TV to watch movies, but it's another extra accessory (the AV cable).  4. The documentation that comes with the unit is quite poor. There are a lot of books about using the iPod in ways that the documentation doesn't address, though.  5. It seems that Apple ignores the existence of Linux, since there is no iTunes for Linux, and no plans for it. There are some options around that enable you to take songs in (and out) of the iPod in Linux, but naturally these are unsupported, so the risk of damaging your music collection irreversibly (i almost lost mine when i used ephPod) is entirely yours.  6. I'm a really big fan of cross-references, so I wish we had the option to, while a music is playing, see music of the same genre, same album, same artist, etc, and be able to jump back and forth between related music. Say, i'm listening to Pink Floyd, which is in the 'Progressive Rock' genre, and from there i can see Emerson Lake and Palmer, which is related to the same genre.  7. The 'shuffle' option is somewhat useless to me, since it uses every single song in the player. I wish it worked only for the list of songs I intend to hear in the moment, like of an album, or an artist or genre.  8. 55Gb is A LOT of space! I'm trying hard to reach 10Gb, and I have a LOT of songs and CDs. If you have a huge collection of music and want to carry it around with you everywhere you go (like me) then this iPod is more than enough.   9. Why not stuff more audio formats, like OggVorbis, and especially video formats, like DivX? Better yet, why not release them as 'plug-ins' or maybe publish an API that enable software developers write plugins for it?  10. Video resolution is not very good for a TV set or home-theater. I hope Apple can improve this through a firmware update someday.  All that being said, this is a wonderful product to have, and it's certainly the best portable media player around. Every aspect of this piece of technology was carefully designed. Its looks, its packaging, the way it works, etc. Apple just doesn't make anything that comes short of 'cool'.

<Content>Okay, all these people are talking about getting this for free, but I'd say it's worth the money anyways. I got my 60GB Video iPod (yes, the one shown above!) for Christmas, and love it! I've downloaded about 2,000 songs on to it and I've only used up a small fraction of the memory. A computer geek I spoke to said that realistically, this thing can hold way more than 15,000 songs. Plus, it works as a memory card. I take a lot of digital pictures for my work, and then I download them onto my home computer using a special program. I was able to put 330 photos onto my iPod as a file and take them into my work and it didn't even make a dent in my memory. I'm telling you, this thing rocks! I haven't had any problems yet, but I would reccomend buying a case that will help with the impact if you drop it. An iPod is not like your cell phone, but more like your laptop, so treat it with care and enjoy!

<Title>iPod...because it's all about me
<Date>Sun Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>To clarify my stance on this issue, I have never owned an iPod prior to this 5G release.  I had long admired iPods, and when the first 40 GB model was offered, for the first time ever it became a feasible prospect to own one.  But I held off--until now.  Thankful I am for this, for the fifth-generation iPod with video is, without a doubt, the finest electronic device I have ever owned.  In what I see as a stroke of brilliance, Apple finally eliminated the "lameness factor" of the iPod by offering a new color--sleek black.  In what has become a sort of cult following, I rarely see new white iPods in any incarnation (proper or nano); instead, everybody's back in black.  Indeed, I would never buy a white iPod under any circumstances now that the black one is offered.  This release of the iPod has undergone a list of improvements over previous models.  First and formost is the fantastic color screen.  Though of course the 4G iPod photo (which eventually became the standard iPod 4G) had a color screen, it was of the standard iPod size and aspect ratio.  The screen on the 5G iPod is 2.5" diagonal (320 x 240 pixels), which is a significant area increase over the original.  Another difference between the 5G and previous releases is the click wheel, which is both perfectly flat (previous releases had a slightly raised center button) and (allegedly) slightly smaller than that of the 4G.  In fact, the entire front of the 5G iPod is entirely flat (the screen is no longer recessed).  Finally, another major difference is the increased battery life--up to 20 hours in the 60 GB model.  Perhaps what makes the 5G iPod great is, for all its enhancements, it's still an iPod.  It functions the same as previous releases, it's still easy to learn, and its sound quality has, if anything, been improved (so say the folks at Apple).  The photo capability is highly practical (unlike on the iPod nano, what with its miniscule screen); the vivid screen beautifully displays the finest details and delicate hues of even the most intricate pictures.  The video capability--of course new for iPod--is an added bonus; videos play smoothly and with exceptional resolution.  Even so, conversion is a very tricky business (Apple allows only for videos recorded in its proprietory formats).  One might think of the iPod with video as just that--an iPod with video as a conditional bonus.  I use my 5G iPod mainly for music, so I am most qualified to comment upon this aspect of its performance.  In a word, spectacular.  The ability to carry in excess of 15,000 songs in my pocket at one time is empowering to say the least.  The main benefit for me is in the organization department; before, I would burn almost 20 compact discs worth of music in alphabetical order by artist, only to purchase more music and undermine the entire organizational structure.  Plus, carrying 20+ CDs was just too cumbersome.  The iPod changed all that.  Now I can carry around my entire circa 600 song library (I am very picky with my music) with room to spare for, well, just about everything else on my computer.  The organizational structure of the iPod software--provided one is willing to fill out the song information for his or her entire library--makes navigation very easy.  Plus, if one is a stickler for the order in which songs play (i.e. he or she wants the albums organized in release order, for example), he or she can manually produce playlists in any number or configuration imaginable.  All this is much appreciated, especially from somebody who subsisted on burned mixes ever since the days when an 8x CD burner was hot stuff.  Apple's proprietory music management software--iTunes--has been given a bad rap by several reviewers.  To be perfectly honest, I really can't agree here.  I had in fact been using iTunes for over a year before I had my iPod; it is an excellent, very easy to use platform.  Plus, it is the only program I have found which burns CDs without any gaps between the tracks, should one so desire.  It also plays tracks seamlessly.  Really, using iTunes could not be easier.  One simply drags and drops files onto the iPod (mine is named "Compendium") and the music immediately begins downloading.  Adding album info is a snap, albeit time-consuming.  But then, that's a problem intrinsic to the act itself, regardless of which platform is used.  iTunes allows for a rich array of file types, including the standard MP3 and WAV extensions.  In addition, there are Apple's uncompressed format (AIFF), Apple Lossless, and AAC conversion.  Many complain that WMA is not supported by iTunes, but since Windows Media Player doesn't support AAC, it's mutual.  What's more, I appreciate that Apple forces users to leave behind the archaic MP3 format (though MP3 is indeed supported, songs bought in the iTunes Music Store come in AAC) in favor of the sonically superior AAC format.  I am an audiophile, but at a mere 160 kbps, I can hardly tell the difference between the original and the converted files.  For the final transfer, I opted for 192 kbps AAC compression (my nano uses 160 kbps).  The sound quality of this iPod is spectacular.  Everything is crystal clear and uncolored.  The signal path is clear and unobstructed.  Unlike every portable CD player I've ever owned, on the iPod, there is no background noise floor (which is caused by the mechanical action of the spinning compact disc).  The volume is exceptional as well.  That was one of my worries when I first received the product; on occasion I have come upon electronics with very poor volume.  The iPod is not one of these.  Incidentally, the 15,000 song capacity reported is based upon the 128 kbps AAC, four minutes per song "standard" applied by Apple.  Just as a novelty item, in uncompressed (AIFF or WAV) format, that translates out to about 1,350 songs.  Finally (this is an update), iPod finally includes a provision for gapless playback!  It is a feature that first appeared in iTunes 7.0, along with its respective firmware update (currently 1.2.1; gapless playback is supported in firmware versions 1.2 and above).  One must download iTunes 7 in order to affect the firmware update; the process for the latter has been integrated into iTunes.  Then one must designate those tracks one wishes to play seamlessly, and that's all.  It works flawlessly.   I love this product.  No, I do.  But, regardless, there are drawbacks which I feel must be exposed.  This iPod SCRATCHES FAR TOO EASILY!  Look at the poor beast the wrong way and a fright pattern of nasty and deep scratches honeycombs the surface.  The entire surface of the iPod is one easily impressionable piece of soft plastic.  Take this advice (and that of just about everyone who has reviewed the 5G iPods): BUY A CASE IMMEDIATELY!  Don't use the automatic syncing feature.  Switch to manual immediately.  There is a bug which obliterates the album artwork for every song in the library (on the iPod).  Plus, if you connect your iPod to a computer which does not contain your library in its entirety, you will lose every song from your iPod which is not represented in the current computer's library.  This is a real headache.  Just use manual updating; it's simple enough.  Finally, one must charge the iPod exclusively through the USB port unless he or she buys the separate (and expensive, at $40.00+) AC adapter.  Note that this device came standard with some of the earlier iPods.  A battery life of 20 hours is substantial (though I wonder if my device really lives up to that figure), but on a trip and with no way to recharge the battery, it's still not enough.  One is indeed forced to buy the AC adapter or a dock which charges the iPod.    All in all, this is a fantastic product.  Despite its minor drawbacks, I would still recommend this iPod to anyone who wishes to take with him or her a huge library of music.  For those who have fewer songs and want added mobility, I would suggest the iPod nano (which is also a fine product).  Either way, there really is only one choice in the portable digital music business: iPod...therefore I am.

<Title>Mike's iPod Odyssey revealed for the first time!
<Date>Tue Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Being an acknowledged Apple Computer addict, I purchased this iPod even though I wasn't especially interested in music. After being freed from its attractive packaging, my iPod's first use was that of a very cool looking, high-tech paperweight. Then came the iPod's debut as my alarm clock following the passing of my ancient and decrepit world war II surplus clock radio. After playing with the iPod some more I noticed that you can store notes, contacts, calendars, & to-do lists on it --- my iPod shortly thereafter was promoted to the rank of Substitute PDA (I probably won't buy a real PDA until Apple makes one). The iPod is very light and I hardly notice its weight in my front pants pocket (I haven't bought a third party iPod case for it as of yet as the cheap leather case that Apple throws in seems to be adequate to my needs). I began playing the games that came with the iPod whilst I was stuck  waiting in long lines at the post office and during traffic jams --- no great shakes these games but they're agreeable time filler when you're trapped someplace. The iPod's large and beautiful color display became a factor when I copied my photo collection to it --- I set up a slideshow and had something to look at besides the calorie counter while I was on the treadmill at the fitness center. I started backing up some of my most important files to the iPod when it dawned me that I still wasn't using hardly any of its 60 Gb hard drive capacity. The iPod's audio capabilities finally came into play when my buddy gave me a iPod cassette adapter. This adapter looks archaic but it does the job. I transferred my collection of audio books to the iPod (which I had never got around to listening to) and my hellacious commutes to and fro work became much more agreeable. I had trouble sleeping so I downloaded some relaxation and mediation music from Apple iTunes --- I wasn't comfortable sleeping with the headphones so I bought some JBL encounter speakers and hooked the iPod up to those. Night Night! A few weeks ago, I watched the movie "The Village" and became so impressed with the solo violin work of Hilary Hahn on that soundtrack that I downloaded all of her albums from iTunes. Finally, I downloaded some TV shows and Pixar shorts from iTunes and gave the iPod's video capabilities a work out --- The clarity of the images on the iPod's screen is nothing short of astounding. The iPod is easy and fun to use  --- I love the "click click" sound it makes when I'm navigating through its various menus. The look and feel of Apple computer hardware has always been superior to any other and the iPod is no different. The only caveat I can express is that there is no shortcut to the main menu (at least as far as I know). To go from my photo collection to my to-do list I have to click three or four times. Plus this baby will scratch if you look at it funny! If you buy one I recommend getting a case for it and keeping it away from your cat. Other than that it's been money well spent. I'm no longer missing appointments and forgetting friends' birthdays. I'm sleeping better. I'm better read. I feel more tranquil (music hath charms and all that). Looking forward to the 6th Generation of this miraculous device!!!!

<Title>Best overall and most user-friendly multimedia player available
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 60 GB Apple Video iPod is the best handheld device for listening to music, podcasts, audiobooks, storing photos, and watching videos that exists. It is also the most user-friendly handheld money can buy.  Apple includes iTunes CD with your iPod, and will alert you of any updates to the software. Once iTunes is on your hard drive (Windows and Mac compatible) it will automatically add your .mp3 files on its library. Load all your CDs onto iTunes, and simply download music from the iTunes music store (priced at around $0.99 per track or $9.99 per CD, generally). It literally couldn't get any simpler.  Your hard drive will also have a space for your picture library, which will also automatically load on the iPod. You can have tens of thousands of photos, which you can view individually or as a slideshow. Settings allow you to change the speed of the slideshow, or play background music over them.  Podcasts (audio or video programs ranging from comedy shows, sports talk shows, news, etc) are available all over the web and generally cost nothing. Podcasts update automatically, and when you update your iPod you'll get the latest episode of your favorite podcasts on your device. You will never miss your favorite show again.  Videos are available for purchase from the iTunes music store. Music videos, movie trailers, animated short films, and full length episodes of your favorite TV shows are available for purchase (usually $1.99 an episode). You can also upload your own QuickTime or .mpg movies of your own onto the iPod. This feature is very enjoyable, and you will greatly enjoy it on when you have 45 minutes to kill and want to watch Desperate Housewives or Law and Order.   Extras include a few basic games (Solitaire, Bricks, and Parachutes) and a Calendar/Contacts feature which will sync with Palm Desktop or Outlook.  Overall an absolutely wonderful music/video player and the best investment you could possibly make.

<Title>unreliable ipod
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I haven't bought the new Ipod.  I'm onto my third (yes, 3rd!!!) 40Gb ipod and it has just died, like its predecessors.  They won't fix it, but will sell you a "refurbished" model for $180 Australian.  This suggests to me that they will fix the duds I have handed in and then resell them to somebody else.  But don't try to buy one of these refurbished models.  They look brand new and are under half the new price, but they will only sell you one if you have a broken one to trade in.  I bet they do a roaring trade given the unreliability of these objects.  They look great and the interface is a work of art.  But zero reliability, zero support, and if you want it to do anything other than play music through cheap ear phones supplied with it, be prepared to pay lots extra.  I'm going to but some other brand.  Suggest you do too, until Apple begins to grow some consideration for its customers.

<Title>Makes all other forms of walkmans redundant
<Date>Fri Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>60gb!!  I have hundreds of CDs and I can stall all of them on here and still have a great deal more space for miscellaneous personal files, photos and videos!  iTunes allows you to update and organise your tracks either manually or automatically.  Automatically; it will retrieve and stall any tracks you have on your computer's hard-drive and keep them listed in convenient alphabetical order with all the track's info (including the date of production and the names of the producers and composers).  Manually; you can pick and choose which tracks you want, the display information and you can delete previous tracks and files and refill again without any messy configuration or error prevention. iTunes is free and is compatible with PC and Mac and it is the most efficient music sorting software I've ever used.  It also allows you to convert tracks into different formats, enhance the sound quality and burn them onto CD by simply clicking and dragging the tracks you want into a new playlist!  You don't have to type the track names in yourself because it will search the net for them and fill them in automatically and you call also change any inaccurate info manually. If you're a budding sound-artist or musician and you want to hear your own work in CD quality before burning it, you can drag it into your iPod and listen to it straight away without going through any tedious procedure. I cannot speak for those who have encountered technical problems with their iPods as I have not yet experienced such errors.  Anytime my iPod has frozen or turned off it has been because of low battery and corrupt sound files - both these incidents only occurred twice.  I've owned both a Sony MP3 walkman and MD walkman for less time and had more problems than what I've had with the iPod. The only disadvantages would be the low-quality headphones it comes with and the lack of accessories which really bring it to life.  I strongly recommend purchasing a cover or carry-case as the surface scratches easily and cannot be buffed or repaired.  Unfortunately most of the best covers and cases are expensive but it's a wise investment granted that they're not too bulky.  Definitely get a clear plastic screen-protector sticker as well. The iPod does cost a little more for maintenance but I don't know how much of an issue that would be to people who could easily afford to purchase the iPod in the first place.  I do feel that the device is ludicrously overpriced but at the same time it's still by-far the best portable accessory for music-lovers.  It also works well as an external hard-drive and is able to stall more files than more regular external h'drives at a close price range.  I have taken my iPod to university and I've saved large video, sound and document files on there and still have an abundance of spare room.  When I later copy those files onto my PC hard-drive, the iPod ram is replenished. I'd recommend this to anyone who carries and uses a walkman everywhere, almost all the time.  Also for those who regularly use a computer and keep an excessive amount of files on their d'drive.  You'd get more than enough use out of this.

<Title>Not much of an upgrade

<Content>I upgraded to the new 60gb iPod from a 3rd generation 40 GB model. I used to have a remote control I could clip on my lapel. No more. I used to be able to update songs at 400Mb/s with Firewire. No more -- I do not have the very latest Mac, and Firewire transfers are "not supported," so I have to update at USB 1.0 speeds. I am not sure my new iPod will be fully loaded by the time my flight leaves the day after tomorrow. I'm seriously considering returning this.

<Title>A delight to use
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had heard of iPod's legendary ease of use but I was at first skeptical. I am not a fan of iTunes, the software you'll need to use to transfer songs to your iPod. However, I decided to make the plunge and get an iPod. It's been a great move.   The iPod itself is much smaller than I thought and looks very good. Looks aside, it is much easier to use (transfer songs, videos etc) to the player than other MP3 players (Windows based ones). The iPod also has good sound quality and a variety of different utilities like the world clock make it fun to use.   The only gripes I have with the product is that the front and the back of the player smudge and scratch easily. I would recommend getting a cover of some kind for this problem. Also, transferring videos is a bit of a hassle as Apple only supports limited video formats. You need a converter to transfer videos and songs in other formats and the conversion process is not guaranteed to work.   But these problems aside, the iPod is a very easy to use player and performs its functions well.

<Content>The only reason I can't put 5 stars is that the screen seems to be easily scratched.  If this kind of thing bothers you (as it does me), make sure you buy a protective film.  That and a good cover will protect the iPod.  Having 60 GB makes it possible to put my entire music library (8000+ songs), several full length films and almost the whole season of one of my favorite TV shows (I bought extra software online to do this, plus use the iTunes Music Store).  It's a revolution in entertainment for me.

<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking forward to getting my iPod, because this should undoubtebly be the best mp3-player there is. The functionality is great, with both music, pictures and video. And it's easy to use. But a few disapointing things: Why isn't it possible to use both firewire and USB to transfer files? It recognizes a firewire cable and charges with it, so a step further to also transer files should be possible. But maybe it's not technical possible to have both USB and firewire, I don't know.. Second disapointing thing: I wish it was possible to have the music organized in the same folders and folder structure as on my PC. Mp3-tracks are not always labeled with albumtitels, and these track will disapere if you shoose the "Album" selection, even if it was in the same folder on the computer.

<Title>Don't buy for the customer service
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm just writing this to express my experience of how Apple treats its consumers.  5 weeks ago I returned my 2nd iPod to the store I purchased it from after I received the unhappy iPod icon. Today, 5 weeks later I went into the store to enquire on what was happening with the iPod and why it was taking so long. When I retuned the iPod there was 4 weeks left on the warranty. Today I was told that Apple is returning the iPod to the store and is refusing to repair it as it was out of warranty.  As you can imagine, being in such a situation then it's quite easy to get wound up and frustrated. But after being in a similar situation then I spoke to the store manager and told him to inform Apple that once the store receives the un-repaired iPod then I will collect it and issue a claims action against Apple under infringement of the UK consumer laws.  Later on this afternoon I received a phone call from the store saying that they would replace the iPod themselves and pursue this issue with Apple.  All in all I have now lost total faith in Apple products and services. This is the second iPod that has failed on me. The first one failed after 3 weeks and I was given a full refund at a different store. Now after my experience with Apple customer services I will never buy an Apple product again. The only reason I am accepting the replacement iPod is because the store says they cannot issue a refund, I would be much happier with my money back and to be able to wash my hands with Apple.  Anyway, that's my experience, to anybody who's looking at this and thinking of buying an iPod then I think it's pretty obvious what my advice would be.   My general review of the iPods I've owned.  Well, the first one died after 3 weeks so I cant really comment on it. The 2nd one, if there is one thing that's annoying about this product it's the fact that it is one big scratch magnet. After a week out of the box, even with the use of an iPod sock my iPod had a load of superficial scratches on the display, case and back.  Generally it worked well, I got a decent run on the battery, but what would put me off buying another one (.... apart from the abysmal customer service) would be that once the battery starts to die then you have to send it back to Apple, though this is now common with most other players.  Don't buy this model if you intend to do any physical activity with it. As it's a hard-drive then it has a buffer of about 25 minutes, if you use it to go jogging for example then it will start skipping after about 30 minutes. Check the support forums for more info - the Nano or preferably a non-Apple flash player will be much better.  Other negative is that once it goes wrong then there's pretty much nothing you can do, you just have to send it back to Apple and hope for the best, if they find anything wrong then they should repair it, if they don't try and screw you over as they did to me.  Other negative is that being an Apple product they introduce no support at all for windows media audio files, you can play them in iTunes, but the only way to get them on the iPod is to convert them.  60Gb is a lot of music/files. But I found it easy to fill once you build up a collection, this meant I was constantly having to swap files between computer and iPod as and when required. Could this have lead to it's downfall? At the end of the day having all of your media on your iPod sounds like a great idea. But believe me, you will have to keep a backup on your computer, meaning you could get away with having a smaller player. I'd be much more comfortable swapping files between a smaller flash player than a big 60gb hard drive model.  The positives, the sound is great, and the scroll wheel and navigation blows the likes of Creative away.   For me the negatives out way the positives, I don't see many others that I would go out and buy, but as I'd advise against Apple then the Samsung YP-Z5 looks pretty interesting.

<Title>It has exceeded my expectations
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been very curious about Ipods and was looking forward to getting one and I have to say, it's a fascinating device which changes my perspective on my music collection. I was surprised that it came with no instructions, but since it is so intuitive,and because I knew the basics already, that was no big deal (you can download a manual from Apple, which I did). What immediately struck me was how much music I never listen to, and how easy it is to explore now.  I have all my albums and MP3s at my fingertips (or thumbtips), and when you shuffle them, you find songs you might have forgotten about or never known about.  If you're like me, you have albums you haven't listened to in awhile.   So I found a couple of forgotten gems on a Carlene Carter album and an old rockabilly album and Duke Ellington just kind of sneaks up on you this way... Anyway, that part of this device fascinates me.  But then there are the playlists, and the whole world of secondary toys.  For instance, as soon as you get hooked, you'll want it in your car. I have moved all my albums, all my photos, a couple of videos, and quite a few podcasts to it, and have filled less than 15 out of 60 gigs. My only complaint is that the battery life for video isn't very long.  But the picture is very sharp, and if you buy an AC adaptor (should come with it) it's very nice for watching while your beloved sleeps. Okay, one other complaint.  Can't stand the ear buds.  They are simply awful. For me they are physically painful, and if you want to go deaf faster, then by all means put something inside your ear rather than on them.  I ditched them first day. All things considered, it is a very, very impressive product, and one I recommend without hesitation.

<Title>I'm such a trendy poser
<Date>Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I should be taken out and shot. Well, maybe not shot. On second thought, not shot, just beaten a little. I bought a Black 60 GB 5th Generation iPod a few months back. It is my third iPod. Yeah. My name is "Poser," and I have an iPod problem.  I bought a 20 GB 3rd Generation iPod two years ago (for non-posers, that's the iPod that at one time came with everything: dock, firewire cable, remote, belt clip...). I've never had a single problem with it, aside from Apple's terrible OS updates. It works great, still does, despite all of battery issues that sprouted up with that model.  A year ago I picked up the 1 GB iPod Shuffle, which is great for carrying music, carrying files, and for transfering documents quickly between computers, especially between my Mac and my PC. The battery life on the Shuffle has been great and I'm very happy with its size and ease of use.  And as far as my latest iPod goes, not a single problem with the iPod with video. Except for just that...it's not the video iPod. They fooled me, Jerry.  This is not the "Video iPod." It's the iPod with video capability. There is a very real difference between the two. This is basically a supped-up version of the pervious iPod; the true Video iPod is rumored to come out very soon. Rumors point to a widescreen display and touch-screen capability.  Now, don't get me wrong. This iPod is great. I filled my 3rd Generation pod with music and I only put video on this one. I recently took it on a flight and watched a movie and the "Superman Returns" podcasts on it without needing to recharge it, and that was far beyond the stated three hours of battery lifetime.  My caution is, unless you can't wait and gotta have an iPod with video right now, give it some time and perhaps you might get what you really want, or at the very least, get something better. Even though I know Apple lovers are going to hate me for saying this, Apple kinda blows. Sure, they release cool stuff, but they never announce anything.  Take the car industry for example. You're thinking about buying a new Camry, but in Detroit a couple weeks back they debuted the all-new 2007 model that'll be out later this year. All of a sudden you're like, "forget the 2006, I want the new one. I'll wait."  However, with Apple, you could buy an iPod with video capability today, but tomorrow they release the "Video iPod," and there's nothing you can do about it. Or say, you buy a $1400 piece of software, and then the next day they stop making computers with compatible processors. They do that.  All in all, I am entirely happy with my 5th Generation blah blah blah iPod, but what I'd say to you is not to get your name or "To Snoopikins, Love Pooh Bear" engraved on it so you can sell it on eBay and put that money toward the next cool thing.

<Title>Accessories 4th generation do not fit
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The only advantage of the 5th generation over the 4th generation is that it plays video.  Unfortunately, all my 4th generation accessories, such as italk, do not fit the 5th generation ipod.  Therefore I have to buy them again when they become available.  What a waste of money.

<Title>Delighted that I finally took the plunge
<Date>Tue Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I became the last person on my block to get an iPod.  I had been thinking about getting one since the third generation ones came out, came very close on two or three occasions, and finally took the plunge.  I toyed with getting one of the smaller iPods to start off, but because I have a very large music collection, I decided to go ahead and get the 60 GB.  I'm glad that I did.  After putting all of the music that I considered "basic" I had used up 47 of the 56 GBs of usable memory.  I can pare that down by deleting extra cuts (for instance, I have both original albums and greatest hits collections, and I don't need Dylan cuts from both HIGHWY 61 REVISITED and BIOGRAPH).  I haven't put a great deal of video.  I have a bit and found that the quality is surprisingly good, but I personally would rather listen to a Schubert string quartet and read than watch a video.  I have about a dozen audio books that I got from Audible (though for some reason my computer often crashes when I download after installing the Audible plug in for iTunes), four or five episodes of TV shows formatted for iPod, a couple of podcasts (Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse on LOST and Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant's bizarre conversations), a single movie (STEWIE GRIFFIN: THE UNTOLD STORY, which I keep mainly for demonstration purposes for friends), and several hundred albums in addition to a few hundred individual songs.  All in all, I can carry quite a cultural library around with me.  I chose to get a DLO leather portfolio to protect my iPod.  I am not sure if it is sold over Amazon, but it is readily available at Best Buy.  It is black so it goes well with the black iPod.  I haven't gotten a cover for the video screen yet, but I can tell I will need to.  I'm really hesitant to wipe the screen I'm so paranoid about scratching it.  No one, of course, should even remotely consider not getting a case to protect it.    So far I haven't come even remotely close to running out of the battery, even when I have watched a video.  If I keep it playing on music without switching songs I find the battery barely goes down at all.  As a complete newbie I was a bit worried that importing music was going to be a problem.  I had already cleared 60 GB of empty space on my second hard drive.  It was, however, remarkably easy to learn to do.  I'm now working on fine tuning my selections.  For instance, some CDs import with the name of slightly different than others.  One album can list the artist as "The Rolling Stones" while another is "Rolling Stones," which can separate the album listings in the menu.  So, there is a lot of fine tuning, but the main importing is straightforward.  It is, however, SLOW WORK.  I had stacks and stacks and stacks of CDs laying for days around my computer as I imported one CD after another.    Even though I have had my iPod for only a short time, it has already become an indispensable part of my life.  I absolutely love having hundreds of albums and thousands of songs at my beck and call.  Gradually I may come to use the other media as much as the music, but even if I never use it for anything other than listening to music, this was a purchase I absolutely do not regret in the least.  I will say that if you aren't a compulsive collector of music and don't have at least a thousand or so CDs, you will probably be happier with a smaller iPod, like the Mini or the Nano.  But for fellow music junkies, I give this a big thumb up.

<Title>Wonderful iPod....The best so far...
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a black 60 GB Video iPod this past Christmas to replace a 30 GB Photo that was stolen from me last year.  I read hundreds of reviews about this iPod and decided to take the plunge.  I'm a total music freak and I have a massive music collection, totaling around 150 GB.  So obviously I needed the biggest capacity iPod I could get, and the video function was a very nice addition.  I read that the iPod scratches very easy and that's certainly the case.  I found an excellent solution to this.  The invisibleSHIELD (www.theinvisibleshield.com)is an invisible clear covering that you stick on the whole iPod.  It is virtually bulletproof (there are some cool videos on the website) and you really can't even tell that it's on your iPod.  The video feature is pretty cool and  I've converted some DVDs to it and the quality is unbelievable.       Some cons of this iPod include the aforementioned stratch-prone material that the iPod is covered with (it's ridiculous), and it seems that this iPod has some software issues or something because it is slow to respond sometimes (such as when you change the song it takes a little while to get rolling).  The price might be a concern for some, but with all the features you get, it's a pretty reasonable price.  All in all I'm very satisfied with this iPod and I just bought a 1 GB Shuffle -- so far so good.

I would recommend buying a speaker accessory to enjoy your music without headphones. Any music listener, this is a must buy. You can arrange you music by artist, album, genre, create play list, play music videos, watch DVDs, etc. It's simply entertainment in the palm of your hand! It's light weight, small and sleek.

I wish it was a little easier to take music dvd's and load them up, I have several and it appears that you need third party software to get this done.  Also, if the ipod could be used as an extra usb flash memory stick it would add to the utility.  The memeory is sitting there to be used.  Podcasts are fun and easy to get and listen to.

<Title>Fruity Company's Rotten Apple had a Worm in It
<Date>Sun Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had the great displeasure of purchasing a 60GB Video iPod.  I attempted to play a few mpeg files and all these MPEG4 files failed to play the audio part of the video files.  After conferring with some workmates it appeared that only one other person had this same issue.  He too had a 60GB iPod with firmware version 1.1.  So a few of us gathered at our tech lab and devised a test to find the cause of our video iPods not playing our movie files.    We gathered together four 30GB iPods and three 60 GB iPods.  Two of the three iPods had firmware version 1.1 and the third used firmware version 1.0.  We had a single movie (Top Gun) which we ripped to an MPG format file and a National Geographic AVI file.  These are the files which we chose to work with.  We used IMTOO to rip the DVD to iPod MPEG4 format.  The National Geographic special was converted using Quicktime Pro IG3 and Videora iPod (3 separate files).  A single Windows XP Pro and iTunes version 6.0.4.2 computer running on an Intel Pentium D processor 950 with 1GB DDR2 RAM was used to conduct all the testing.  We found that all the 30GB iPods played all three video files without encountering any problem and so did the 60GB iPod with the firmware version 1.0.  One the 60GB iPods with the new firmware none of the video files played.  Behavior of both iPods were similar.  Audio and video plays well for about 30 seconds and then would stall for about 5 seconds and then continue without any sound. As an aside we found that the QuickTime compilation worked on all the iPods.  When we downgraded the firmware on one of the 60GB iPods to firmware version 1.0 it worked almost perfectly.  Almost, because my iPod radio I purchased failed to play.  Oh what a joy.    Worse was yet to come...  The next day I called Apple and spoke to a lady whose name I forget.  She let me know this is my only single incidence call after which every call would cost me $49.  She suggested that I purchase Apple extended coverage.  I explained to her the problem and our findings.  She informed me that it is not an Apple issue that my iPod was not working.  She blamed the use third party software.  She explained to me that the iPod is only supposed to work with software purchased from Apple.  She added that if I wanted my iPod to work that I should purchase only software provided by Apple.  I informed her that I am not about to purchase QuickTime Pro.  I again let her know about out tests and that we have narrowed the problem to the firmware in combination with the 60GB iPod.  She assured me that there was nothing wrong with the 60GB iPods and suggested that I take a look at the iPod tutorial.  This went on for about 20 minutes.  I asked several times to speak to a supervisor but she refused to transfer me as it was against company policy.  In the end she said that she will attempt to help me but would have to put me on hold.  I was on hold for about 5 minutes and the phone rings for about a minute, no one from Apple picks up and then it hung up on me.  I called back and this time the call was answered by a gentleman by the name of Demon.  I explained the problem to him.  He assured me that I was the first person who called regarding this problem and that it was because I was using third party software.  He said that I should be using iTunes instead.  Explained to him that we used iTunes for transferring the files and the final conversion was done by iTunes.  The files played perfectly in iTunes etc.  I was not getting very for with this gentleman either.  He too was blaming third party software.  He too made sure to point out that the iPod is designed to play only files converted by Apple software.  This conversation continued for about 15 minutes and he ultimately transferred me to another department which I believe was product development or production.  Matt answered the phone.  Without even me explaining what my findings were he quickly rattled away like a broken record that Apple is designed to use only Apple software and if I wanted to use it I would have to purchase QuickTime Pro.  I am guessing that Demon briefed Matt before transferring me.  So I asked if he was aware if what he says is true that Apple is in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.  He immediately stated that "let your lawyers meet with my lawyers".  I asked that Apple provide a copy of QuickTime Pro for my personal use if that is the only way to play the video files.  He informed that he could not do that as the products are not related.  I asked when the firmware will include the bug fix he again repeated that this is not a problem as I can purchase an iMac or QuickTime Pro.  Again I reminded Matt that if that is the case Apple is in violation of the Sherman Anti-trust Act.  He did not want to hear about an legal action, whereupon I informed him that I did not want to hear anything regarding how well an iMac or QuickTime works well with the iPod.  Then I asked Matt when the upgraded firmware will be released.  He could not divulge the information because that is considered a company secret.  So I asked him if it would take a year?  His answer was maybe or maybe not.  He reminded me that the iPod has not been designed to play ripped DVDs and have never been advertised as such.  He reminded me that is illegal, and I had to remind him again of the Sherman Anti-trust Act and about his not wanting to get into legal wrangling on the phone.    The problem here is that Apple will not take any responsibility and will not acknowledge there is an issue to be worked out.  All we want is a fix within a fair period of time.  However Apple's boneheaded stance concerning this issue should keep potential customers away from this product.  The prosecutors who are taking on Apple in the Sherman Anti-trust case should requisition all recorded calls into Apple support during the discovery phase of the trial.  Therein lies a virtual gold mine of evidence against Apple.  My case number is 60457090 if you are interested.  Yes I would be overjoyed to testify.

<Content>Great audio quality. Good video quality.  There are three additions/improvements that the iPod needs:  1. Better scratch resistance. The acrylic surface of the iPod is very susceptible to scratching. You definitely want to get some sort of protective cover for the unit. 2. Zoom functionality when viewing photos on the iPod. The viewable images aren't very large and it would be nice to be able to enlarge pictures from time to time.   3. Increased battery life. Video playback lasts between 2.5 - 3 hours. Audio playback is between 14 - 15 hours.

<Title>60 gig ipod  review
<Date>Fri Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ipod 60 gb is the largest that apple now offers, I selected this one over the 30 gb since I plan on putting lots of videos on it.  My family was sceptical at first that you could see much on such a small screen, but the picture looks great.  It is a bit of a pain however converting other forms of video for playback on the ipod.  After a bit of google searching, I was able to find a good converter and I transfered some of my dvd's onto it.  Also it is great in its primary function as a music player.  The number of songs it holds is astounding and the quality of the playback is great.  It is especially great for long car rides, I can just set a play list and let it go.    I would suggest this product without hesitation to any music lover with a large collection of music that they wish to listen to on the go.  The only thing is that you should also buy a case for it as soon as possible, the plastic is easily scratched and it would be a shame to mar that beautiful sleek new ipod.

[EDIT:  ETA 2007 WIDESCREEN IPOD so I have no regrets getting this one now.]   I am very happy that I bought the ipod from Amazon instead of from Apple.  Although I didn't get to have a free engraving on the back of the ipod, I did get a cheaper total price.  Also, Apple was a hassle to deal with when I had a problem with the original ipod I received whereas Amazon was delightful and sent me a replacement before I even received the mailing label to return the original flawed ipod.  I will definitely buy more apple products from amazon in the future to save money and to get better service.   Does this fulfill my why buy from amazon criteria? 1. Would I prefer to buy new vs. previously owned and cheaper from Craigslist?  yes 2. Is this a good price?  yes 3. Do I save on shipping? yes 4. Do I save on sales tax? yes

<Title>Submit to iTunes tyranny & you may be happy; otherwise look elsewhere
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>PROS: 1) Looks stylish & beautiful (which is not particularly important to me). 2) Tighly integrated with iTunes software (you *must* be 100% willing to let Apple/iTunes/iPod completely take over your music collection; I am not) 3) Good sound quality. 4) Long battery life. My test: nearly 14 hours continuous random play (songs ripped from CD at even a higher bitrate than iPod recommends, &lt;a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com">dpPowerAMP&lt;/a> "Alt Standard Preset" VBR vs. Apple's recommended 160 CBR). 5) Massive harddrive. You can use it as portable storage (outside of iTunes control or iPod access). But you must carry the special Apple USB cord with you.  CONS: Most importantly, watch how fast iTunes shills bury this review & stuff the "user" reviews with corporate hype.  1) iTunes/harddrive synchronization does not exist. iTunes will not detect any tag updates (song/album/artist details or pics) that you add outside of iTunes using your favorite tagging software, such as &lt;a href="http://helium-music-manager.com/">Helium Music Manager&lt;/a>. iTunes will not pick up these changes (& therefore neither will your iPod). Most likely, since iTunes/iPod synchronization separates album art from the music file, you will loose album art.   Even when iTunes manages to correctly associate song pics with the song file, iPod can only access one pic per file. Have artist & album pics embedded in song tags? You'll be lucky to see even one of these on the iPod, especially if you tag with non-iTunes software. Apple commands: Thou shall not break the iTunes/iPod monopoly. Arrogant! Complete lack of iTunes/harddrive synchronization is the deal-breaker for me.  2) Power adaptor, even though this is a "portable" device, is also an optional "accessory". Out of the box, you can only rechange the iPod through a computer (USB cable). And don't try to use a friend's computer. More than likely, the iTunes installation on the 2nd computer will hijack your iPod, delete all your music, and add the iTunes database from the 2nd computer. Again for basic "portable" functionality, Apple wants you to spend another $25 (plus tax) just to be able to recharge your "portable". Offensive!  Traveling outside America? Shell out another $40 (plus tax) for the travel adapter kit (99worth of plastic).  3) Oversimplified, poorly documented & buggy interface. For whatever reason, iTunes & iPod are convinced that there is no need for a "STOP" button. You can only pause, but not stop, playback. You can sometimes "Shutdown" the iPod, but the interface is incredibly flaky in this area. Much of the time the iPod will not shutdown ... unless you leave it paused for a while (total waste of battery).   In their attempt to make iTunes simple to use, they intentionally eliminate flexibility. To further the impression of simplicity, the documentation is minimalist & lacking. Several cryptic iTunes "preferences" or iPod "settings" do not even appear anywhere in the latest software or hardware documentation. See that "Compilation", or "Grouping" option? Even if you could find an explanation, the option is so inflexible as to be totally useless.  The iPod works great if you set it playing & leave it alone. If you try navigating around while listening, it can become confused, stall, loose album art, etc. Frustrating.  4) The Apple-or-nothing rule applies to video, as well. Buy videos from Apple? You'll probably be able to watch these on the iPod. Shoot home videos using common digital camera formats? Good luck. You'll almost certainly have to test a lot of 3rd party shareware before finding one that'll create a file that iTunes won't reject.   I have given up on viewing vacation video on my iPod; iTunes rejects &lt;a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=SupportDetailAct&fcategoryid=223&modelid=12074">Canon Powershot S80&lt;/a> video.  5) Screen & body front (plastic part) are incredibly low-quality plastic material and scratch instantly once you remove the iPod from its box. Even sliding it in & out of its own pouch creates micro-scratches on the screen. This is an incredibly poor effort by Apple. Nonetheless Apple considers a screen protector an optional "accessory" (read: shameless profit stream). For $400+ (after taxes) you don't even get a minimally protected screen. Offensive!  OVERALL: I would never again consider buying an iPod. iTunes' tyranical, arrogant lack of support for external (non-iTunes) ripping, managing, tagging of my music collection is unacceptably frustrating & time-wasting. If you also want the flexibility of managing your own music library however you choose, then do not consider an iPod; you too will regret wasting your money.  Apple have one simple rule: Submit completely to Apple (ie, buy your music & content only through iTunes), or suffer infinite frustration for every violation of this rule. If you want to hand full control & a lot of money over to Apple for low-quality, overpriced music (128 cbr), then you'll probably be quite happy with the iPod. I am not.

<Title>Are you really buying a new ipod or is apple cheating you!
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple may be selling you a used ipod. I found out today that the ipod I paid $299.00 for was actually refurbished. It had been repackaged, presented and sold to me as a new ipod. This company has a class action lawsuit against it for this, among other claims. You can view the class action lawsuit by googling "tell on apple."   Don't get cheated the way I did!   And if you do buy an ipod, keep the receipt.

<Title>60gb ipod
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my wife so she could show her friends her hundreds (even thousands) of photos of the babies and listen to thousands of songs and even see videos if she wants. She loves it , bit I'm the one who always has to do all the work figuring theses kinds of things out. Very good little device and sounds great. Pictures are crystal clear. Hard to beat. but nothing is perfect. This might be close.

<Title>iPod Devotee
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've always loved the iPod, but this model is the ultimate. I got hooked on iPod when I was finally able to get rid of my CD cases and put everything on the iPod. Playlists make it so easy to put together collections of my favorites for every situation. I have playlists for working out, studying or just hanging out. It was very easy to import all my existing CD's into the iTunes library, which is free software that comes with the iPod.   The video feature is the best. I can download all my favorite shows (Project Runway, Law & Order, Lost, etc) and watch them on the bus or wherever. I also have an AV cable and watch videos on my TV. Here's a tip, you don't have to buy the Apple AV cable, just use the one that comes with your camcorder but switch the yellow and red cables. The resolution is very sharp on my 19" television.

<Title>Gets the job done
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have to say that i personally feel that my purchase of the Ipod 5th gen was completely worth it. As a person that has been skeptic for years i could never justify spending 400 dollars on something like an mp3 player. Well i first handled one of these when i played with my friends. I fell in love fairly quick with it and i wanted one. The screen may be small compared to some other portable video players but it has very crisp quality. The subtitles are east to read and everything. Im not a master audio buff so as far as comparing this to other players and bose systems and this decibal is a little off i cant do that for you... I can tell that im happy with the audio quality in it very much so and i am also happy with my purchase of the transpod all in one FM transmitter/car charger thing as well. It works great and I can hear all of my music in the car.  Now... onto the bad part. This is a big enough con that it actually made me drop it down to 4 stars instead of 5. This thing is so dam vulnarable to scratches its insane. After the first few days of carrying it around in my pocket. ALWAYS in the little foam pouch that it came with it started noticing scratches.... i was angry because some were fairly big for always being in the pouch... One day i put it ipod in my pocket without the pouch because i was in a hurry and when i took it out to use at my destination there were very large scratches on it.... and im talking about every day walking here not jogging.. or running or wrestling or anything. So what i would recommend which i promptly did was to buy SOME SORT of protection for your ipod before you use it. ANYTHING will help just dont carry it around bare if your even slightly concerned about it harboring scratches.  Thanks that is all. I hope this review has helped you make your decision. From one MP3 player skeptic to another.

<Title>Ipod with Video
<Date>Mon Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm loving this product. I had the 4gb mini but needed more space so gave the mini to my wife and bought the 60gb Ipod with Video for myself. It works perfectly. Be aware that if you have accessories for other Ipods, they may not work with the Video. Firewire is one example, no matter what the geeks at Best Buy will tell you, Firewire currently is not compatable with the Ipod with Video. I'm sure it's only a matter of time till it is compatable. I also got the Apple remote control which gives my new ipod an FM radio. This is nice, but it think for the price of the Ipod, Apple should give you FM radio without having to purchase extra accessories. It's obviousley built into the Ipod. I'm 48 years old and have a ton of music. It's really nice having the ability to carry all of that music in my pocket.

<Title>Wait a few months . . .
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have one and I love it. BUT . . .  I almost decided not to buy one b/c Apple is notorious for releasing a product and then releasing another, better version of the product a short while later. The added functionality in this generation of the iPod is video. While this is billed as a music player with video capability, Apple sure does milk the video side of it as is evident by making one trip to the video section of iTunes. Apple has embraced video, and a better version of a video iPod seems to be right on the horizon, to the extent that this model may be phased out:  http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/21/technology/apple_ipod/index.htm  So, if you want a music player w/a ton of hd space, don't have one yet, and think video playback would be an added bonus, I recommend this. However, if you can hold out a few months, and already have an mp3 player, just wait for the all-video player.

<Title>uno de los mejores productos, que hoy pueda existir..
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>nunca antes se habia logrado combinar, movilidad, conectividad, tecnologia, sonido e imagen, en un solo aparato, es cierto que hay que ir agregando accesorios, para poder reproducirlos en otros equipos, solo si uno desea compartir, por que de lo contrar�o, se puede obtener eso y mucho m�s, lojos lo mejor que puede existir.
