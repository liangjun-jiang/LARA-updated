<Title>Not good enough for the money and absolutely terrible customer support
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For one, I am not a fan of Apple as a company and will always buy anything but an IPod.  From quite a bit of research I figured the Creative Zen was one of the better options.  This player generally works fine, but has two flaws that REALLY bother me!  One of the most important features of an MP3 player is the ability to put all your music in it and then hit "random play" to have it cycle through your music.  This does about as bad a job of that as could be possible.  It will constantly feed you some of the same songs on a regular basis while seemingly never getting to some of the others.  As a software developer, this really bothers me because programming a random search algorithm is generally one of the easier things you can do, and if you need to pair that with keeping a little document to reference of what has already been played so as not to repeat things too soon, that also is not hard for even the most junior programmer to do (i.e., Creative has no excuse why this feature is so bad).  Then the fact that it does such a poor job of this has to make you wonder about just what else doesnt work so well but isnt so obvious.  Some of the other negative reviews here indicate other problems that I havent encountered, but would be indicative of some poor programming by Creative.  I think the menu system leaves a bit to be desired as well and results in too much navigating and clicking around to do simple things (i.e., the software is not as well designed or configurable as it could be).  I am also pretty sure this unit doesnt allow you to record the radio, but it is so hard to tell because their documentation is thoroughly inadequate and doesn't even give a basic walkthru of 90% of the features.    Now to the thing that irriates me the most.  I am not one who cares to buy music online... so 95% of the MP3s I have come from being ripped from my CD collection.  The software program that comes with this, of course is geared to work with this particular player.  So, if you rip using it, it will do more work and can save a copy to your player and your computer hard drive at the same time at a very decent speed.  It is a much quicker process than using Windows Media Player or Music Match Jukebox to rip the music and then copy it to your player.  After spending 2 hours shuffling CDs and ripping directly to the player, I realized it was ripping in WMA format.  That sucks, because I want MP3s... as long as I am taking the time to shuffle CDs and rip, I want to be able to burn the SAME MP3s to CDs so that I can burn them to CD for archiving and play the MP3 CDs in devices that can do that... MP3s tend to work on all brands, not WMAs.  Anyway, I go to the settings area of Creative's software package and change the setting for it to rip to MP3... and low and behold, I can do that... ONLY IF I buy their MP3 ripping support package at an additional $9.99.  WTF?  Yeah... nice... it is an MP3 player, but I have to pay more to rip my CDs to MP3 format!  There is no TECHNICAL reason for this... it simply means Creative is using the opportunity to withhold a feature you will WANT so they can get more money from you.  There is no other way to put that.  It is pathetic and unnacceptable!    Contacting their technical support is absolutely useless because they clearly will not read your problem and respond to it in a personalized manner.  Instead, you will get form responses stating their policies or pointing you to "how to do it with Windows Media Player 10".  I am sorry, but if I am paying $150+ for the player, I certainly expect the software to do all the standardly expected things.  I did not see any disclaimer on the box about having to pay extra for MP3 ripping.  I went back and forth complaining to Creative about this particular issue and how I felt it was wrong for them to charge for it.  All I got them to admit was it was something that was available in prior versions of their software that is not available any longer without buying the package for MP3 support.  After many iterations, it got to the point where their responses didnt even match the situation... prompting a new term, I will call e-ignoring me.  ; )    This is why this player deserves only 2 stars.  The unacceptably bad Random feature (which requires you to skip songs regularly) is worth a star deduction in itself, but their terrible customer service and price gouging policies are truly unacceptable.  There has to be a better option than a Creative Player and I would recommend most people look for it.  When buying something like this, you shouldn't have to get additional software and I have talked to many people who own players from other companies where the software does rip to MP3 without further charge.  Ripping through an external program and then loading the player does work here, but it is certainly slower.  Windows Media Player makes the process too cumbersome for my taste.  Music Match Jukebox does ok, but they purposely make the ripping process slow and then constantly bug you with popups to try to get you to upgrade THEIR software with their own $9.99 (or more) purchase.  I am tired of companies always trying to make a buck at the expense of the customer.  With Music Match, I understand, the basic player is free... with Creative, sorry, we already had to pay for the product, to have to may more to rip MP3s is essentially making us pay $10+ more for a product we already purchased.    As others have pointed out... this will not hold the amount of songs they advertise because no one sane uses an 64KB rate... even 128KB is hardly good enough.  I do 160KB and will end up getting between 600 and 700 songs on this unit.  But, this "problem" is the same on all players, their song claims are just unrealistic to the real world... just know that going in... if you want oodles of songs, go for the hard drive models that hold 30GB... but, 700 songs is ALOT more than it seems and the flash memory players are still better for running and such... jolting and bouncing has no effect on them in terms of theoretical wear and tear.  If not for the fact that returning electronics is a pain and there are usually restocking fees, I would have returned this unit.  I bought my son one as well that has not been opened and since that will have the same problems I encountered with mine, we are returning it.  I told Creative I wanted them to give me the MP3 support I expected for free or I would return my son's unit and post this honest (but unflattering) feedback here.  They would not even acknowledge my request (which I think was reasonable), so here my honest assessment is.  You might disagree with my assessments, and that's fine, but if I read what I am writing here, I would have not bought this player... and I wish I would have at least known all of this before hand.  Then I could have made an educated choice rather than be so disappointed by the things this player and software do poorly.

<Title>Best tiny video mp3 player I could find
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My irrational desire to possess a tiny movie playing gadget eventually led me to buy the 4GB Creative Zen V.  Of the video MP3 players available on Amazon, it seemed to have the fewest negative reviews.  Other video MP3 players made by different companies tended to die quickly and could not be revived or fixed.  I've owned mine for about 3 months and it's still working.  I'm generally happy with it.  The positive:  -The controls are pretty easy to manipulate.  The manual teaches you the basics and refers you to a website for the complete controls -The software seems to work well for organizing songs on the player and converting 30 minute video files to be played on the player -It's impressively tiny -Good color and picture on the screen and good sound on the audio  The negative: -While the player's flash memory is large enough to hold a full 2 hour movie and more, the conversion software can't seem to convert a video that is longer than about 30 minutes -This last point is sort of moot if you consider how rarely you'll actually be watching something longer than a few minutes on a 1 inch screen.  So, the tiny screen could be considered a negative when you realize the actual experience of watching a video.  If you've read this far, you may ask yourself if you really want a tiny video player.  I'm still charmed by this gadget, but I honestly never watch videos on it.  It's not often that a tiny video player is useful.  It's just kind of fun!

<Title>Player for a Year...
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is very nice little gadget here (maybe even too small for me). It sounds fantastic, the earphones are pretty good, so is the radio. Video player though is useless. It is promised to have 15 hour battery life?! Might be so, but with embedded Lithium ion battery it is 40 % less a year from now. Since the battery is not replaceable, lifespan of the player is only few years. Before you buy, consider that after the battery is worn-out, so is the the player.

<Title>LOVE my Zen V!
<Date>Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got my Zen V for christmas and absolutely love it!  I got it mostly to download and listen to eAudiobooks and it works great.  You can download books from NetLibrary and [...]  Unlike listening to audiobooks on CD, you can set bookmarks anywhere you want to leave off.  You can also fast forward and reverse whithout going all the way back to the previous bookmark.  I find the buttons easy to navigate. I also received the Zen Aurvana headphones--they really do enhance the sound quality and block out ambient noise.

<Title>Zen V - Almost Like It A Lot
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen V mp3 player does the job.   The Good...it's compact, it looks great, it's convenient and provides a good sound. The Bad...the onboard menu / controls are not the easiest to master, the pc computer software (used to set up the Zen onboard menu) should show a simulated view of what you see on the Zen onboard menu.  What you see is not what you get.  I am not a big fan of ear buds...not the most comfortable thing, but the ear buds do the job. The Ugly...I greatly dislike the recharging system for the Zen V. The Zen V charges its battery through its USB interface with a pc.  The Zen V must be connected to a pc to charge the battery.  When I first got the Zen V, I connected it to a USB interface on my pc and thought that the Zen battery was charging.  Turns out that the pc's USB interface was not powered but I had no way of knowing that.  With continued use of the Zen, I eventually discharged the Zen V battery and then lost all the music that I had so meticulously loaded on from my pc.  After some research and some phone calls to Creative, I learned that some USB interfaces on the pc are powered but most are not.  Furthermore, I learned that the Zen V has a low blue light that dims in and out during charging.  This is how you know that your Zen is connected to a powered USB interface.    I travel quite a bit and cannot charge the Zen V when I travel (I don't lug a pc around with me).   Finally, I got smart and purchased an aftermarket transformer / charger  that charges the Zen V from a standard electric wall outlet.  I wish Creative had included the transformer / charger with the Zen V.  It would have saved me so many headaches.   Would I purchase the Zen V again?  Yes.  Could Creative have done a better job with software and the charging system?  Yes.

<Title>Zen V Hits the Mark
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zen V is just the right size for me, both physically and electronically. It has plenty of storage for my needs, since I only want it for music, not pictures, video, or as a PDA. It took me a little time to get things organized to my liking, but accessing it via my PC made things a lot easier. The included software is excellent, allowing the aforementioned PC access and  finding information on the CD being uploaded. I'm an online music novice, but this makes it fairly easy. Nice work, Creative.

<Title>WAAAY Better Than An i-Pod, But...
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Zen-V for my birthday this year, and it is WAAAY better than an i-Pod. There are some glitches, however: it only holds 500 songs. Also, it freezes up like a computer does sometimes. It's also a little harder to use than an i-Pod. The sound quality is really good, which is what makes it 432432432% better than an i-Pod. I reccomend a Zen to all music lovers.

<Title>Good when its working...
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this in Sept 06, and have had trouble from day one and since.  It freezes up, then it takes me 10 to 15 minutes to reset it.  Then several times I have got the message "no license to play".  It took me awhile to figure out how to fix that. I can't get it to fast forward to the next song.  And the tiny joystick fell off inside of the player.  So now I have to try to navigate it with my fingernail. I have emailed the Creative company several times, they are no help. I was almost ready to throw it away today because it froze up again.  But when it is working, it is great! I absolutely love having a MP3 player.  Does anyone know of one that is trouble free (or almost)?

<Title>I like it
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just bought this a few days ago. Everything is fine, but the battery seems so short. I charged it with an AC adapter from gomadic and I definitely don't get 15 hours! I goes past the half way mark in about 3 hours and that is lame, but I do play around with it a lot. I also don't like the volume control. It's really hard to press and it should've just been part of the joystick.

<Title>Small and beautiful
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product from Creative met and beat my expectations.  First the size, it was smaller than a credit card, then the ease of use and last but not the least the quality of the sound it produced.  I tried microphone recording which, even in an external out door setting with lots of other noise, was quite good. It is worth the money I spent on it.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had one of these players plus an 8 gig and the Creative Vision M for almost a year now and they are all excellent music players.  I have had no technical problems.  They are easy to use and have good sound quality however, I can't vouch for the earbuds that come with them because they were too big to go in my ears.  It is easy to download or transfer music onto them as they accept a wide variety of files.  Video quality is good even on the smaller players.  Creative gets my vote over IPOD everytime.  It's a superior product (or at least an equal one) that has more features (i.e. radio tuner and video capability on smaller machines) for a lower price PLUS they don't force you to shop at iTunes.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat.
