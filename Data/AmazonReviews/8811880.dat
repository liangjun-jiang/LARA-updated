<Title>Fussy Player 
<Date>Sat Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this little Rio over 2 years now, but have decided to move on.  The FM has never been good. Even in flat Chicago with powerful signals, the stations never came in well. The software interface is clunky - however the update I found on RIO's website is much better.  After it froze up recently, I called tech support and was recommended to purchase a "reconfiguered" replacement for half the price of a new one. No way. While the tech guy was reading through his manual, I ended up solving the problem myself. Don't look for help there. It's been spotty ever since.  It often stops and tries to "connect" to the computer - even when I'm miles away on a run. The headphones now only play out of one channel.  You've been OK for a little while, but never perfect. Time to move on, little RIO.

<Title>A must before you use the player
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received this player as a christmas gift. I found the sound is amazingly well for this small size gadget. It also has an equalizer to change the music settings. I strongly recommend you to visit www.digitalnetworksna.com/support/rio/ to upgrade the player firmware and the RIO Music Manager.   After the firmware upgrade, it will let you upgrade up to 1G of memory (SD or MMC memory card). I believe 512M is a basic necessity. It also let me play by my own playlist rather than all the songs I have in my player. I find this very useful, because I can organize the songs by album.  I love the sound quality and the small size. It is a good quality product.

<Title>There are better choices
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As my third MP3 player, I chose carefully, looking for excellent features on my runs. Unfortunately, I chose poorly. The clip broke quickly, making the poor-fitting case a moot point. Rio will not replace the case or the clip and you cannot buy a replacement. The capacity is excellent with the option of adding more memory a real plus. Battery life was reasonable. Sadly, the played completely stopped working after a few months. In a world where many companies have difficult customer relations, Rio stands out from the crowd in being particularly unhelpful. Though this player had promise, there are better choices. (I will be looking at a different company's players this time.)

<Title>Works Great Til It Doesn't...
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...then you are doinked BIG TIME. My S35S worked great for about the first six months; I had some of the same clip holder issues that others mention but I could live with those problems. What I could not live with was the unit's death and Rio's Customer DisService. I called and talked to someone who was pleasant enough and gave me a case number to fax along with the unit's serial number and copy of proof of purchase. This I did  according to their instructions. Waiting a couple of weeks I then called to get an update and was informed how busy they were and told to give them a couple of more weeks. A couple of months later I e-mailed them and received a reply explaining they were in the process of moving their warehouse and this resulted in the delay(???). Six months after sending them the information requested to implement repair or replacement I have nothing to show for my original purchase but a dead Rio and a worthless warranty. Ri(o)p-off. No more Rio in this household, period.

<Title>Does the job around the gym and outside
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Durable, light weight MP3 Player. (I must have dropped it around a dozen times in the gym, keeps working)  Good sound, after you replace the headphones that come with the unit.  To  enjoy the good sound you will need to get another headphone, (Sony and Panasonic have decent units for around $20.)    Poor FM receiption, limited playlist managment.  Volume not as lound if you plan to use them in the plane.  Could use a couple more dBs to be near perfection. Overall a basic, no nonsense,  durable unit to bring your tunes to the gym or outside.

<Title>Great little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I used mine over 8 hours a week for over two years in a gym.  It took many hard hits and continued to work.  It worked for 6 months even after the plastic case was cracked.  But the internal memory is starting to fail.  Perhaps using it in a steam room was just too much for it.  Very well made!

<Title>Great, But It Has a Few Flaws
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Sport is an excellent little mp3 player.  The sound quality is great as is the display. While, the original model came with only 128MB of internal memory, it has an SD slot making expansion fairly inexpensive, especially in 2005 when 512MB is available for $50.   In general, the construction is rugged with a rubberized enclosure apparently meant to reduce the affects of impact from dropping. It is also has a rather compact, odd shape that is probably less than ideal for someone wanting to store it in his pocket.    While there are a handful of small design flaws, two features that are particularly annoying.  First, it has a four position concave rocker switch that is extremely sensitive.  While this is great to use blindly with your thumb, it creates a real problem when placing the unit in a pocket as switch easily depresses, causing the RIO to change songs, stop, or pause.   In short, the Rio Sport is a decent mp3 player that could use a couple of minor interface modifications and feature enhancements  Pros Excellent sound quality Good battery life Rugged Compact  Cons Main concave control button very sensitive, too easily depressed  Plastic bracket interferes with buttons and jack Uses AAA batteries instead of AA    ****  Note that the technical description in Amazon is incorrect regarding the memory type and expandability.  It uses and SD card and can go over 128 MB in total.  My 512 MB card is working fine.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Rio for a couple of days now. It's been working great. The bundled software is not all that great, but if you have Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10 then you can use that. The player has good sound and is really durable. The armband took me a minute to figure out but everything works great. The internal memory is a nice starting size. I was able to fit 54 tracks on my internal memory (64Kbps - WMA format). I bought a 128MB card for $18 and that works perfect and now I have over 100 tracks on my player. I've been hearing that the player can handle cards up to 512MB despite what the specs say. I haven't tested it so it's still a rumor to me.   In conclusion, for the price this player is a very good buy. I use it when i work out and the armband is a nifty way to keep the player close but out of the way. I'm not sure is the USB interface is version 1 or 2 but the interface is really quick. When I update my track listing it takes about 1 minute and a half to transfer 54 tracks to my player. Check the Rio site frequently for firmware upgrades. When I got mine i had to upgrade the firmware which is a sinch and take about 30 seconds to do.   Just to add, many have complained about how the player tends to slip out of the armband when you move excessively (ex. Running or jogging). I have to say that I use my Rio everyday while running and have yet to have it slip out of the armband. I run just like everyone else, and wear it while playing basketball also and it has not fallen once.

<Content>Rio no longer supports this model and the Sports case is cheap and breaks easily. Once it breaks, you are out of luck because Rio only carries replacement parts for their newest models. Do yourself a favor and buy something dependable with good product support such as Ipod, Iriver, or CreativeLabs..Leave Rio alone.

<Title>Amazing lil device
<Date>Fri Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was getting fed up of the talkshows in the morning and the advertising tirades in the evening on my sony tuner while working-out. I depend on music quite a lot for my running, so finally had to break down and buy an mp3 player. I am so glad I chose S35S, because it fits everything I had in mind. Light, tough, efficient and trendy. I upgraded to 256MB about a day after the purchase. The 128MB MMC (card) is about 80 bucks, but a good investment as it doubles the song numbers. I have about 100 songs in .WMA(the only way to go, since mp3 is usually about double the file size as wma) saved with some space left over, and with the shuffle mode on, working out to music is a breeze. Battery life is very good, about 10-12 hours on 1 AAA. I also upgraded to a Sony streetstyle (MDR57 ??) headphones which are much better than the supplied ones. The back-lit display and menu options are very easy to learn and operate.<p>The set up software couldn't be easier to use, with downloading and managing the songs the fastest I have seen.<p>There is a mail-in rebate offered by SonicBlue till January 03, so go for it right now, if you're in the market for a mp3 player for the fitness minded folks, or anyone for that matter. <p>The only negative is an abysmal tuner that fails to do anything, and will probably recieve a signal if you operate this inside a radio station. So that is a waste. And hence the 4 stars.<p>Counting that out, this is a great product, and since I am not missing the tuner at all, I would highly recommend this product.<p>An Update: After about a couple of months, I managed to crush my precious lil mp3 player under my truck tires in a freak accident. May be this would be an attestment to it's toughness, the display was broken, but the lil thing has refused to quit playing..Lets see your cd player beat that.

<Title>Finally a good sport MP3 player
<Date>Sun Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've been watching the roles of MP3 players for about 4 years now, waiting for a good one in the application for which MP3 was conceived:  sport.  Requirements:  decent resistance to the elements/sweat, high memory capacity, immunity to shock, light-weight, decent sound, decent comfort.  The RIO S35S meets or exceeds all of these.<p>128MB built-in has me covered for 1.5+ hours of activity; plenty for most people.  I'll get an expansion card anyways, just to have the option of more.  It's light enough that I don't even notice it on my arm when running.  The headphones are extremely comfortable and, surpisingly, I don't even notice them when running either.  It's case provides ample protection from my prolific sweat.  The sound, while not audiophile quality, is perfectly good for exercise.  I've been using a NiMH battery with no problem (it worked even better once I found the battery setting in the menues and switched it from alkaline to NiMH  ;-P).  <p>The radio reception is poor.  I didn't get it to listen to the radio.  If I wanted to listen to the radio, the are many sport models available at far less expense.  For me, the radio is just a last resort if the battery gets too low to play MP3s.<p>In all a very good player.  Maybe a little expensive, but less than competing models like the Nike, which doesn't even have the option of a tuner.  Enjoy!

<Title>Review for XP users
<Date>Wed Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S with some reservations after reading a few reviews mentioning problems with the diver installation on PCs running XP.  I just installed the driver and music transfer software on my PC (running XP) and had no problem at all.  If you just pug in the device and let XP detect and install the driver automatically it will NOT work, because Sonicblue is in the process of certifying the Rio S35S driver for Windows XP.  Since this certification is currently only in process the diver will not be automatically detected.  What did work is to first install the music transfer software from the supplied installation CD (the music transfer software is a different piece of software than the driver), restart the PC after the installation of the music transfer software, leave the installation CD in the PC, connect the player to the PC, turn the player on, XP will tell you that an new device was found, select the detect automatically option and click next (or continue), XP will search the and find the driver on the installation CD (which you left in the PC as mentioned above).  After the installation of the driver is complete, XP will tell you that the driver was installed and that the device is ready to be used.  Launch the installed music transfer software and you are ready to roll...have fun!!

The memory is nice, the FM radio is bad bad bad unusable-it is a non feature and shouldn't be advertsided (really it's false advertising to say it has such a feature and it doesn't work), the headphones are average, the music quality playback ok, I miss the ability to replay over and over a song, the rio manager software is ok. The size is 2.5 times bigger than i thought. I should of checked out the specs better. But for [the money] I paid  a more accurate rating would be 2.5 stars. Very average at best for the price.

<Title>Rio S35S
<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>SONICblue Rio S35S Sport physical construction is ergonomic, nice looking and appears to be rugged. Exterior, made of a &quot;rubbery&quot; material, has a good feel and allows for a good grip when holding the unit. Lighted display is excellent and fairly easy to navigate through the menus. Joggers will have to stop and navigate through the menus to switch from player to radio (or vice vera) since there is no radio/player hardware button. Sound of audio player is decent.<p>Unfortunately, radio reception is poor. Earphone wires which serves as the antenna is sensitive to movement and the position of the device. S35S has a bass/treble equalizer but loses its settings in radio mode once the unit is turned off. Unit does not have much bass. When S35S is turned on, you may experience distortion for a few seconds, depending on settings. When unit is turned off in radio mode at a low volume setting, there is an annoying power/volume surge.<p>People considering purchasing the S35S will want this product because of its small size, nice exterior features and expandable player capabilities but will pass if an FM radio is important.

<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>If you're looking for a little MP3 player for the gym, or running, etc., the Rio is perfect.  The only problem I've really had with it is that the radio isn't very strong.  That is, the stations don't come in very well.  Also, there's no &quot;hold&quot; button, so if you acidentally hit a button, you may skip a track or change the radio station, etc.  In terms of functionality and usefulness though, it's been great!

<Title>Rugged little unit
<Date>Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. After much research (and knowing what she really wanted to do with it -- listen to music while working out) it appeared that this Rio model, although new, was the best fit.<p>My only beefs are with the included software. We should have been filmed by Apple as we were trying to install the software and connect the Rio to my wife's ThinkPad with Windows 2000. After about 20 minutes, I got so frustrated that I just plugged the thing into my PowerBook G4, downloaded the iTunes driver and let her load it up with songs from my MP3 library while I installed the various bits of Windows software.<p>The sound quality is great, the integrated radio tuner works well and its rugged design seems to be pretty, well, rugged. A good purchase!

The sound from the 35S was really annoying based based on the Real Jukebox files.  When I recreated the files using the Real 1 software supplied with the 35S, the sound quality out of the 35S improved dramatically!  All in all, the software package is is easy to install and use.  I use the player now have to admit it's a great unit for workouts.  If I were to suggest an improvement it would be to replace the headphones.

<Title>Extremely User Friendly
<Date>Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I transferred music to the player last night and it was extremely user friendly.  Anyone who has owned an MP3 player in the past knows that compatibility with your computer can make or break the performance of the player.  The box lists a minimum 64MB of RAM as a system requirement for this item, but I have an older laptop with only 32MB of RAM, and I still got the player to transfer music.  The only limitation was that I couldn't download the entire capacity of the player at once.  This is an issue that I believe would be resolved had my computer possessed the minimum system requirements. Overall, the software is intuitive and very easy to use.<p>The only negative feedback I have so far is that there appeared to be one flaw when I was setting the time and date of the player.  The player clock would not let me set a PM time in the 12 hour clock mode.  I had to change the clock mode to 24 hour (Army Time), and set the time that way.  Once the time was set, I changed the clock mode back to 12 hour and the clock reflected the correct time.  Overall, a very minor inconvenience.   <p>I have yet to use this player in the gym; however, I have found that this compact, light, and sturdy player remains secure when fastened by belt clip or arm band.  I will follow up in a few weaks to review the durability and playback performance of the player.

<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've owned this little MP3 player for about 3 weeks now and have spent about 15 hours in the gym with it.  It is extremely small and light weight.  It clips securly to my gym clothes (haven't needed the arm band) and doesn't get in the way no matter what excercise I'm doing.  The controls are user friendly enough that I operate it by feel.  The sound is very good and I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever.<p>If it can handle the gym, I should work equally well riding bikes or jogging.  The player itself actually snaps into a soft, shock absorbent housing that protects the player and provides the belt clip.<p>Downloads have gone off without a hitch and the process is typical of a Windows application making it pretty intuitive.<p>If I lost this player, I would replace it in kind without hesitation.

<Title>A great mp3 Player!
<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this mp3 player and I am extremely satisfied with it. The player has a lot of functions including a stopwatch, FM radio, equalizer, etc... There are definitly no bugs in the program and very easy to use. <p>PROS:<br>1. Small (very small!!!), durable and handy<br>2. The software was excellent, no crashing, no stalling, and a fast transfer too! The program split the window into two parts, one is my library and the other is the files on the player. All the ID3 tags (tags that display the name, author, etc of a song)should be automatically added if you label them in Musicmatch, Real jukebox, or any other player. <br>3. Water and compact resistant (extremely durable, i even dropped it a few times on concrete and it still worked!)I ran in the rain once, it was working perfectly<br>4. Big LCD screen to display time, battery level, song title, song artist, album, a location thingy to display how far u are into the song, volume indicator, how much time left, how much time already past, and date. The resolution is very fine so the date and the time is not all distorted. <br>5. There are amazing functions including a treble/bass equalizer that doesn't distort the quality of the sound<br>6. The stopwatch includes laps, an average time, and the difference between each lap<br>7. The radio has a search option with 3 savable channels<br>8. A power saving capability to save power (cutting off backlight time and a saving power mode that acts like a screen saver)<br>9. A menu option to browse all the songs<br>10. Light and handy, i ran with it and almost forgot it was still clipped on my shorts<br>11. The cd also comes with iTunes and RealOne, both really nice music managing programs<p>CONS:<br>1. The big round set that has the Play, FF, RW, and Stop is easy to hit so you can't walk around with it in your pockets, on the other hand it is a good thing for running because no one would like to struggle pressing the FF button while keeping a even pace =)<br>2. The earphones aren't as comfortable<br>3. There is no remote control...<br>4. It uses an MMC card for expansion and MMC cards are usually 10 more bucks than Smart Media<br>5. It's a little thicker than most mp3's players (u can check up the dimensions) and its round shape looks a little babyish & toyish...<br>6. SONICblue boasts up to 10 hrs on one AAA battery, I only get around 5 hours....<br>7. no microphone...<br>8. there are no detailed instructions, just a quick start. The detailed instructions are found in the CD program<p>Overall this player is outstanding and I think that SONICblue has hit the target. As a runner, no other mp3 player would match this player's size, weight, and ease of use!!! The package comes with an armband, a belt clip, a pair of earphones, a cd software, and of course, the mp3 player! Again I would definitly recommend this for runners, or people who do sports. I would not recommend this for people looking for an mp3 player that is cute and small with advance features.

<Content>This was my first MP3 player.  I bought it for its versatility with fitness activities.  So far, I love it!!  I like the FM radio option- although only stations with strong signals come in.  Most MP3's don't even offer the option.  I also like the stopwatch function.  Sound clarity is excellent, ease of use is great and fast transfer times for songs.  Backlit display is nice.  It is small, compact, securely stays clipped to your clothing (haven't needed the strap, but its nice to have it).  I also like the appearance.  I like the option of adding more memory later.  I'd definitely recommend it.

Outside is better but if you are skating or running expect the signal to fade in and out as you change directions.  As far as MP3 capability it is a terrific little device.  You could not ask for anything easier to download from the pc.  Point and click everything.  Let's you know how close you are to capacity.  If you can live without the radio portion buy this unit.

<Title>Any problems with the integrated DRM so far?
<Date>Mon Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Hi there!<p>A great player ... but what I'd like to know is, whether anyone out there is having problems with the integrated DRM. <p>In the description of the player is a feature called DRM (Digital Rights Management). Does that mean, that in the future I can only put &quot;legal&quot; MP3's into the player, which I ripped by myself?<p>Thx for answers!

<Title>Great for the gym: sweat-proof with a good battery life
<Date>Mon Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've used this Rio player at the gym for 3 times (1 hour session each) a week for over a year.  It has endured sweat, water and a few drops on the floor with no problem.  The battery life is good enough that I only have to change the battery every few weeks.  The player can fit a good amount of songs on it so I don't have to change them out that often either.  Yes, the holder is a bit cheesy but overall that shouldn't stop you from buying it.  It's so small that you can put it in your pocket if the holder really bugs you.  Great gadget!

<Title>Great little player!
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've owned other MP3 players before, but this one is the easiest to use.  The software is great -- just load it up and you're off and running, no instruction required, it's that simple.  The display is outstanding (whatever you do, don't buy one without a backlit display; you'll be sorry!).  The player itself is also intuitive; you don't have to be a mechanical genius to figure it out (yes,some of the other lower-cost players are that complex).  <p>As others have pointed out, the case doens't fit exactly, but it's not THAT bad, and the circular control is a bit sensitive so you'll want to use the lock feature, but everything else about it is so very user friendly.  I like the clip -- mine has held up through a lot of abuse, and it's just as strong as ever.  <p>As for battery life, I'm getting at least 6- 7 hours.  Maybe not as long as the manufacturers tell you it will get, but a lot longer than I got with my MTV player.<p>And, best of all, the sound quality is awesome.  I've had mine for about a year now, and use it for running, the gym, roller blading and yardwork, and have had no real problems whatsoever.

<Title>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE on this terrible product!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>DON'T BUY A RIO:  1st things first, if you plan on using the fm tuner, forget it!  It doesn't work at all, even after you upgrade the firmware at Rio.  That was the first problem, after using the player for several months it started going crazy and not working.  I called (not toll free) Rio, spoke to a person who barely spoke any English, spent 25 minutes (on my dime) uprgrading the firmware.  Tried it out, it didn't work.  Called back, on my dime, spent another 20 minutes diagnosing with another non-English speaking person.  I was finally told it was broken.  NO SH*T!  Now I have to fax (on my dime once again) proof of purchase (even thought the serial number proves that the player is in warranty! - now i have to locate the F'ing proof).  After they receive my fax, then they will send me a Return Auth number.  Then I get to send the player across the country (you guessed it, on my dime) back to them before they will replace the unit.  Give me a break.  Time to get into the 21st century of customer service.  DON'T BUY A RIO, YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!!!

<Title>great music, pathetic clip
<Date>Thu Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I should have listened!  I had the MP3 player for 3 days before the clip broke.  I was at the gym, riding the bike and it broke!  I just called for the replacement (which they only sell the whole case).  It's $10.95, plus $6 shipping plus tax AND THEY'RE BACKORDERED!  It sounds like there are a few others in my situation!  That's why I only have it 4 stars.  Other than the clip (you can put the player in your pocket, but many of the gym shorts I have don't have pockets) I LOVE the player!  I haven't had any problems with it--great music!  Do invest in a good pair of earphones, the ones that come with it keep popping out of your ears.

<Title>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, RIO NO LONGER WORKS
<Date>Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>At first I was excited with my new rio mp3 player. I downloaded my favorite songs, upgrade the card, etc. but then I dropped my rio player. And that was the end of it. I called customer service and was sent from one person to the next to the next to the next, none spoke English. I finally found out their customer service phones are answered in a foreign country. Ok, I understand we all need jobs, especially the third world, BUT they don't understand me and can't help me. Then I finally get someone who says I must prove I purchased the rio player to get a customer authorization number to replay my rio because "it can't be repaired and must be replaced." I only dropped it once on my living room rug -- how weak is this device anyway! This happened 5 months ago, I've yet to receive my replacement. I've lost my money. Hold off and save for a better quality player and better customer service. I do not recommend any RIO products because of poor customer service (which you will eventually need).

<Content>Have used this device for about a year now.  One of my highly valued possesions.  Clear sound, very portable.  I am in awe of the technical geniuses that came up with this device.  One of the first things I did with the player is drop it on a brick path while running and having it on my arm.  The player cracked right open on the ground.  I punched it back to gether and it has worked ever since (just lost my songs.)  What more can u ask for in toughness?  I will say that someone using the player will want to reenforce the band.  That way it will not fall of the clip when it is on your arm or something (I use string.)

<Title>Don't waste your money!
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had the Rio S35S for about a year, when for no reason it just stopped working while I was running.  The "USB connecting" message comes on and it won't play any songs.  The thing randomly started working again, only to stop again the next time I ran.  Now the bottons won't work at all, and it intermittently stops and starts working for no reason.  Overall this product is very unreliable, and having read other peoples' comments I'm not even going to waste my time calling the useless, non-English speaking Rio tech support.  Don't waste your money!

<Title>Small and durable, great for exercising
<Date>Wed Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had it for 8 months now and ready to upgrade my  memory a bit.  While running, I have yanked the cord by mistake with my arm and the headphones have stayed on my ears while the player hit the pavement.  This has happened a few times and it's still working.  My 140 lb dog has chewed it, only thing that didn't make it was the battery cover.  I'm very happy with it.  Radio doesn't come in that great.  My only complaint is that the cover for armband and waistband wear is difficult to get on and off the unit.

<Title>Durable & User-friendly
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Pros:  I've been using this little guy everyday as part of my daily fitness regimen; hiking, mountain biking, running, and into the gym for serious lifting... you name it, it's been there. It's very durable and on a couple of occasions while biking, I've fallen on it with not even a scratch thanks to its protective rubber-coating. I don't know how water-resistant it is, but I've put a good amount of sweat and some drizzle from the rain on it with no problems yet. The menus are very user-friendly and the LCD layout is clean, crisp, and can be read even when you're on the move. The sound output is great; I'd suggest using mp3 at a 96 bit rate to save on storage. The battery life is very dependable; on average I change out batteries once every one and a half to two weeks (I use it aprx. 2 hours a day). As for the software, I had some trouble getting it loaded up on my pc (b/c it's over 5 years old) but on my school's pc, it had no problems. The uploading of songs takes some time (depending on your CPU's speed), but it's not a big issue. The software menu layout is as easy as drag-and-drop and you're ready to go. All in all, I LOVE IT... with this little gizmo by my side, I've been able to lose 45+ pounds. Thank you Rio for an AMAZING product!  Cons:  The radio tuner is non-existant, not a big deal since I don't listen to the radio, but there are downloadable patches on the companies website to upgrade the radio signal. The in-stock earphones aren't that great, it's suggest finding ones that fit more ergonomically to your head anyway. Storage can hold 20 songs at 182 kbs or 40 songs at 96 kbs, although sound quality is still great at 96kbs.  If you need more than that, I'd suggest purchasing an add-on a memory stick.   NOTE: I bought this MP3 player when it originally came out (almost 2 years ago) for full price.  Now, it's less than half the original price and still a better deal than most sport MP3 players today.

<Title>Good Sound - Poorly built
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased 2 of these believing that they would be great for working out (one was for my wife).  They sound good and the software is easy to use. However - I would not buy this item again.  The supplied sleeve to carry the player on your belt or in the supplied arm strap is not cut properly to access the buttons properly.  The arm strap is not well designed to hold the player - the player will actually flip out with repeated arm movements(runners beware).  Then, God forbid you drop the thing at all it will fall apart.  It is not durable and the design creates situations where it will fall.  I've had mine less than 6 months and have not used it very much.  After it popped out of it's strap a couple of times, the unit began to separate at it's seem.  There is no way for a consumer to attempt to put it back together properly.  Too bad.  I strongly advise against this item as a sports mp3 player - it is simply not durable at all.

<Title>My first player---a great way to start
<Date>Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this primarily for my morning run.  It sounds great, and it is light as can be.  Some things to consider:<p>+ size and weight are small and light<br>+ stylish looking<br>+ easy to use. Once you tell it where you store your MP3 files, you just select, click, and you are good to go!<p>- At 128kb--a CD quality MP3--this does not hold four hours worth of music (as SonicBlue claims). It holds about two hours.<p>- Battery life is less than 15 hours, as advertised.  More like 7 - 10, from what I can tell.  To be fair, I've not used it without having it on to download new tunes. I'm sure this drains some battery life.<p>So do a little homework, and if you can live with a couple of hours worth of tunes, this may be a great unit for you!

<Title>Great player! Works fine right out the box.
<Date>Fri Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Opened it up, got the software installed and it worked! I was very skeptical after reading all the reviews on various web sites. The software is a little hokey, could be better. However, I put the disk in, installed the sw and was dropping songs onto the player in under 5 minutes. <p>Menu navigation is very intuitive and the backlit display is a huge plus in my book. Also, you have lots of information in the display(battery life, song title, artist, album, date, track time, bit rate, etc...)Another plus for me is the time is always displayed in the upper left. <p>After I did that, I flashed the firmware. This, too, went smoothly. Now I am running ver. 1.6 with no problems. And-In the README file it says it has been tested with sd512 cards successfully! That means that you could potentially have up to 640MB of storage. Pretty much the size of a cd. I'm very impressed with that feature(this is one of the main reasons I bought it). Between the size of the unit and potential memory capacity, you cannot go wrong. <p>One drawback is I can't figure out how to set FM presets in the radio. This really isn't a problem seeing as I did not intend on even using the radio feature. However, would still be nice to have. Tried tech support and was politely told by a robot to call back later. Oh well, I'm not too disappointed. <p>All in all, a great little unit for the price. If size, weight, large storage capacity, great display features, and upgradeability are a factor then this is the player for you(and me).

<Content>Let me cut through the chase....I installed and transferred my first track to this sporty little player in a whopping 10 minutes (on Windows XP). So for ease of use, can you say "simple"?  As far as the FM radio...it isn't very good. But then again, if I wanted an FM receiver, I would have bought one of those instead.

<Content>Pros:  Great little unit for my morning workout.  Lightweight, great sound, easy to attach to arm or waist, good volume control, easy change in song selection.  Haven't used the radio too much because of the great clarity in downloaded music.  <p>Cons:  Initial EXTREME frustration with software to get my Toshiba PS141U-01F3 Laptop (XP Windows version) to 'communicate' to the Rio S35S.  I had to wait on the telephone and eventually talk to a customer service representative, (2 occassions totalling 2.5 hours) to walk me through the software updates and help me get it to work. The company definitely needs to improve instruction manual that is included in the packaging.  It seems that others have had the same type problems as this.  However, once the computer and unit were compatable, it has worked well. <br>  <br>Would recommend this product.  I will be purchasing the extra MMC card next.

Everything she suggested I had already tried.  She admitted that there is a problem with Windows ME which I have.  It is unable to recognize current driver.  I would appreciate a reply to this if anyone has been able to fix it.  Her only suggestion was to try on a different operating system.  My USB recognizes it as the Sonic but that is as far as it gets.  Then the program stops responding.<p> I will now spend the rest of my time trying to return the product for a refund!

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player with plenty of room to grow!
<Date>Fri Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought my S35S because I wanted a small portable device that could hold a lot of data.  The RIO S35S is exactly what I was looking for.  It comes with 128MB intenal memory, and is also expandable through a MMC memory card slot.  The documentation that comes with the player and the box says it is expandable with up to another 128MB of memory, but once you have upgraded the firmware through Sonicblue's website, it can be expanded up to another 512MB! (and potentially even more depending on how large MMC cards get in the future!)  I have a Sandisk 256MB SD memory card in mine, and it works like a charm.  Some SD memory cards require firmware version 1.62 or higher, so make sure you have upgraded if you want to use that type of memory (check out www.rioworld.org if SonicBlue's website only has firmware 1.60.  Sonicblue hadn't updated their website as of this posting.).  Even though the FM tuner doesn't get good reception inside buildings, it works fine outside with local stations.  Also, because this device is firmware upgradable, future enhancements can be easily added as SonicBlue develops them!  I would highly recommend this MP3 player for anyone looking for a very compact and expandable portable music player.

<Content>This player is an incredible piece of machinery, despite the reviews to the contrary.  I run with my on a daily basis and it by far exceeds any CD player I have run with in the past.  The convenience of this MP3 player has made my protable CD players obsolete.<br>The only problem this player has is that there is no radio reception, but as a previous review said, who cares??  If you want a radio then buy a tuner instead.  I found the transition between my computer and the Rio flawless, and a lot faster than burning a cd.  If anyone has a problem using the Rio, then that problem probably lies with a defect in the particular Rio they received, or they own a computer incapable of handling the transition for one reason or another.  I use both the included software and RealOne, both have been equal in performance on my end!!

<Date>Tue Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had been looking for a mp3 player with a radio for about a year with no success.  So when I saw this model I grabbed it up right away.  After 2 1/2  months of steady use, it has not given me any problems.  The installation went off with out a hitch, and I've had no problems with any of the firmware.  It definitly sucks down batteries (AAA) so I recommend buying a set of rechargable batteries and charger.  Also the radio is not the strongest... it is crackely indoors, but no problem outside even in a modestly sized city like Boston.  It takes a little work to figure out the radio presets but if you read the instructions there shouldn't be any problems.  Have fun and keep running...

<Content>I've owned 2 RIO S35S MP3 players in the past 12 months.  Both of them started behaving poorly within one month of purchase.  The first one would randomly restart itself from the beginning of the playlist, and would occasionally just stop playing altogether, even with new batteries.  After 1 month, the 2nd one began locking up in the middle of music uploads from my PC.  Eventually it just stopped functioning.

It's very easy to trade music in and out -- the supplied software is just fine, and it also works well with the Musicmatch Jukebox package. It's not comparable to a hard-drive player, but it's a good little flash memory machine, with decent battery life. <p>The accessories are, as others have noted, terrible. The case doesn't fit, and the headphones are the worst I've ever come across. I sliced off the top of the case to unblock the buttons and still use the clip part, which I've found sturdy enough, and, with my own decent set of 'phones, it's a good item for the money.

<Title>Great Sound Quality, Wonderful Software & Extremely Durable
<Date>Sun May 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Rio Sport for about 2 years.  I've taken it across country (from California to South Carolina), I've dropped it, accidently sat on it, gotten it wet & it just keeps coming back for more!  <p>Other reviewers criticize the beltclip, and they're right.  The beltclip is lame.  I just put the Rio in my pocket.  When my wife goes running, it's so small, she just puts it down her sports bra.  No worries.<p>Now the good news!<p>The easily readable, brightly back-lit LCD is reminiscent of the "IndiGlow" wristwatch.  It displays everything you'd expect it to.  Song title and the names of the artist and the album.  <p>If the song title is too long ("Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars" for example) then the title slowly scrolls from Left to Right.  Mighty slick!<p>A small status bar shows how far into each song you are.<p>Pressing the Enter button toggles you through information such as file type (wma, mp3, wav, etc.), time remaining, time elapsed, KBPS Rate (32 Kbs, 64 Kbs or 128 kbs), Date, Pause/Play, Stereo or Mono and track number out of total (e.g. if you've got 100 sound files onboard, and you're listening to song number 38, the it will display "38/100").<p>If its time-of-day clock is too small (which it probably is), then use your wristwatch.<p>An easy-to see battery indicator estimates how much juice you have remaining (with about 6 increments inlcuding a blinking battery to symbolize a sort of "2-minute warning").<p>Battery life: I sometimes advance to the next song, max out the volume (or frequently CHANGE the volume), back up & play songs over and turn it on & off a lot.  <p>With all this activity - I can usually rely on about 8 accumulative hours of operation.<p>I would guess Sony's optimistic assessment of "15 hours on one battery" (or whatever) is based on putting in a fresh alkaline battery and letting the device play over & over until it finally runs out of battery.<p>Buttons are extremely responsive and there's also a "button-lock" (keystroke: MENU+ENTER) which means you need not worry about accidently bumping the advance button when you're right in the middle of something good.<p>This unit comes with good-quality Earbuds.  While there's nothing wrong with them, I personally don't care for the basic design of earbuds in general, even if they're the highest quality.  <p>My wife loves hers, but I'm picky so I bought wrap-around headphones (TDK/$10 such a deal!)  <p>Neato software!  The included "Rio Music Manager" is the main software used to get music FROM your hard drive INTO your MP3 player.  But wait! There's more!<p>If you prefer Windows Media Player, then you don't even NEED Music Manager.  From within Media Player, you just click "Copy To CD or Device."<p>Or by using the "other accessories" button, the Setup Wizard creates a Rio Player icon in your "My Computer" window, which allows you to simply drag music files onto the icon (the one drawback to this is you lose the tag information (Song name, artist, album, etc.)<p>The included software also comes with "RIO Taxi", which enables you to use the Rio Sport as a storage device!<p>For example - say you've got some big ol' 18 MB Powerpoint file you want to take to a friend's house.  Using Rio Taxi, you can put the 18 MB file on your Rio Sport, take the Sport to your friends house, plug it into his computer & download the file from your Rio Sport to your friend's computer!  FREAKY TIKI!<p>The SOUND QUALITY is nothing less than exquisite.  But the actual VOLUME output isn't always as powerful as you might like.  Sometimes ambient sounds (garbage trucks, barking dogs, police sirens) can drown out the MP3 music.  <p>SOLUTION!  An oft-overlooked FREE accessory that comes with the Windows Operating System.  It's called Windows Movie-Maker.  <p>In addition to being a darn fine movie editor, you can also use this Freebie to boost the volume of ANY sound (wma, mp3 or wav) and save it as a regular wma file.  It also allows you to adjust the quality from 16 KBS to 256 KBS!<p>The Drop-Test:  I'm not proud of this, but I am clumsy & subsequently very hard on my toys.  <p>I have accidently dropped the Rio Sport from a height of about 5 feet (chest level).  It has dropped, bounced & tumbled on asphalt, concrete & other hard surfaces.  I even dropped it water once (rescued within 5 seconds).   <p>This has caused a few minor problems.  About ever 3 months, I can't turn it off.  I need to remove & reinsert the AAA battery causing the clock to return to 12:NOON.  But I never lose files, and the sound quality is (& always has been) supurb!<p>In short, this is a wonderful little MP3 player & I strongly recommend it to anyone with an active life!

<Title>Big sound out of a small package
<Date>Fri Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have owned this item for close to a year now and I have been nothing but happy with this device.  <p>I think that this MP3 player is very well laid out.  I run quite a bit and it is very easy for me to skip through songs and adjust the volume while the unit is strapped to my arm.  The arm band that this player comes with holds the MP3 player very well, and leaves all buttons exposed so they are very easy to access.<p>The sound quality it one of the best I've heard from a MP3 player.  I recently purchased an IPOD Mini and I still find myself going back to this Rio to listen to during my workouts.  I feel that the sound quality of this device is steps above the IPOD.<p>The battery life is also impressive.  It takes 1 AAA battery which lasts me a few weeks with moderate use (an hour every other day).  <p>The software it comes with is decent but not the best I've seen, but it gets the job done and it isn't difficult at all to transfer songs to the MP3 player. <p>I only had one issue.  When I first bought the player it would sometimes automatically pause after certain songs were played.  I simply went to Rio's web site and updated the firmware, and I haven't had the problem since. <p>It's been about a year and I still can highly recommend this device.  It's easy to use and sounds great.

<Title>This MP3 Player is awesome
<Date>Wed Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When I bought this MP3 Player i didnt know what to expect.  I had heard from previous reviews that it was an alright gadget but after a few weeks of using the Rio S35S MP3 Player I have figured out that it is a great MP3 Player.  This MP3 Player can withstand any kind of activity whether its working out at the gym or just shootin' hoops in the driveway.  The case and arm-strap are great.  I have never dropped my MP3 Player because its so well supported by the case and armband.  It downloads songs from your computer in seconds.  My MP3 Player came with a 64 MB card which made the total megs 196 MB.  It can hold anywhere from 30 to 35 songs on it.  The songs sound very clear when played on this MP3 Player.  I have had a couple of minor problems.  ONe of the minor problems was that for a week or so my Rio wouldnt fast-forward or rewind any of the songs but that was resolved somehow and now it still works.  Also occasionally the MP3 Player &quot;lags&quot; going from song to song.  Other then that this MP3 Player is of excellent quality.  Because this MP3 Player is an excellentgadget i give it 5 stars because there are many good thkngs about it and almost nothing bad abomut it.

<Title>Great for everything but pockets
<Date>Wed Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Delighted with the Rio - I use it for my daily commute (either on foot, bike or bus) and for running. I had no problems with the software - interfaces very nicely with iTunes and am pleased with sound quality. My sole complaint is that the big round button is too easy to push - when i put the Rio in a pocket (coat or bag) it often get paused or skips a song just from touching the inside of the pocket. not an irredeemable problem since it comes with a nice clip, but i don't like it to be too visible... so: not perfect, but acceptably close.

<Title>No Driver problems here
<Date>Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>So I've noticed a large number of complaints about installing/configuring the drivers for Windows XP.  <p>Let's see, I installed the software, plugged in the device, and the driver was automatically found and installed.  Yes I can see how that would be difficult.<p>Anyway, yeah the radio is kind of pointless, but there's a reason why this is called an MP3 player, not a 'portable radio machine.'  <p>To store more songs, just turn the compression rate on your MP3s down a bit.  The difference between 128 and 112 really isn't noticeable for the most part.  <p>Overall it's a great little unit, perfect for tucking into my pocket while riding my bike indoors.

Two things that would make this product better. 1) Longer Battery life.( use the lithium batteries if possible)  2) A lock for the buttons, if you brush up against something, it may cause your music to stop. <p>Other than that great system.

<Title>Great Purchase
<Date>Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Let me start by saying that this is a FANTASTIC MP3 player!! I did not know too much about MP3 players but I have to say this one is pretty user friendly.  To clear up a few things, you can only get around 2 hours of music in the MP3 format, BUT if you convert all of your music into the WMA format like I did, you get OVER 4 hours of music without the use of a MMC.  The sound is just as good as cd (depending of the quality of your downloads) and the Rio Music Manager Program easily transfers the songs over quickly. A single AAA battery can also last about 10 solid hours, which is really good compared to other MP3 players and is not too costly considering you only use one battery at a time.  The only reason I gave this fabulous MP3 player 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because if its FM tuner, it conveniently can hold up to 8 preset stations, but its reception leaves a bit to be desired and is clearly this players only weak point.  All in all I strongly recommend this product, it is simply awesome and you will not go wrong!!!!

<Title>Could this be any easier???
<Date>Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was extremely concerned with the software issues when I first looked into this player.  If you have ANY computer sense at all, you will have no problem with this device (at least for XP users).  I was transfering music to the player within 15 minutes of putting the cd in the cd-rom drive.  It really isn't anywhere close to as hard as a lot of the reviews make it out to be.  <p>As for the player itself.. Its very easy to use and has all the features I was looking for.  The tuner worked pretty well and I didn't have any static problems (maybe I'm lucky).  I like the compact size while the belt clip and armband are a huge plus (especially for working out).  You never really know its there. One other feature I like is I can plug it into my car cd player (using a cable I already have) and play music that way too.<p>The only drawback I have is the headset.  They really are cheap.<p>Overall I'd highly recommend this player to anyone especially for workouts.

<Content>I bought mine at Costco on impulse and THEN I read the reviews here to see why this sucks. I agree with the bad reviews. The FM stinks, lots of static, the holder doesn't align with the buttons and the songs are played in the wrong order. I have a Nomad II but didn't want to spend the money on a SmartCard to get more songs on it and an arm band and... So I bought the S35S when I saw it starts with 128 had the arm band and was half the size. I kinda liked the headphones, they hold on to me nicely. The only reason I gave it 2 stars.<br>Oh well back to the drawing board. It's going back. Save your money, I'm still reading, maybe I can find a better choice, this time.

<Title>Nice Features and Design
<Date>Wed Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this for my wife in December and she loves it.  She works out at the gym 4 days a week. this little device is among the upper tier of MP3 players out there.  Yes there are other players, but they all have their own problems as well.<p>The Rio S35S does a great job of getting people who aren't really computer literate.  My wife is not so computer savvy, but she has managed to easily learn how to upload music into the player from our home PC.  The software Rio provides is well designed for novices in mind.  it has never crashed my PC, so anyone here complaining about software bugs may actually have their own unique hardware problems.  The software really makes it simple to add or remove songs from the player.<p>As far as the build quality of the player.. excellent.  All the buttons and casing textures feel very sturdy and well built.  However, the same cannot be said for the headphones (my wife replaced them).  Also, although the device holster looks and feels cool because it is made of a rubberized plastic material, it is a tremendous pain to get off the unit.  And when it is on, it is difficult to get it aligned with some of the side controls.<p>Playback quality is excellent, among the best in the business, and that includes the iPod.  As far as &quot;background noise&quot; with the FM Tuner, I haven't noticed that at all.  Might be a defective unit a user here had.<p>If you are not super-computer savvy and want Lexus-level build quality, this is the player for you.  if you are a computer geek who wants to use your own software like Windows Media Player, iTunes, or Real Player to manage your playlist and see the device as a &quot;hard drive&quot;, I would suggest you shell out the extra $200 for an iPod.

Comes with iTunes software, but isn't compatible with iTunes. And to add insult to injury, you can't return it to the store once you've opened it. You have to jump through hoops to return it directly to the manufacturer.<p>In short, save your money, this thing isn't worth it.

<Title>Lightweight Player, but flimsy, poorly designed - pain in *
<Date>Mon Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I own an iPod. I love it, but I don't like to take it running, too heavy, and if I drop it, oh no! So I bought this hunk of red plastic. It is definitely lightweight. But the buttons activate at the slightest touch, on a Windows machine it randomly connects via the USB cable or doesn't. It *DOES* work with iTunes, but only if you convert your songs to MP3 or WMA (which you cannot do with purchased music - protected AAC). The little carry case that comes with it *SEEMS* like a good idea. However, it's nearly impossible to remove it (I am afraid of tearing the player in half doing so), and it's so poorly desgined that I can't really push the buttons while it's in the case. AND, if I don't use the case, the battery/storage cover keeps falling off. Don't waste your money. If you can afford the iPod mini - go for it. Otherwise look elsewhere for your lightweight and compact sport digital music player.

<Content>After owning this product for about 2 months I feel I know it enough to write a fair review. I'm not too impressed with this MP3 player. This is the first one that I have ever bought and have found a few major things that I don't like about it. First the volume is not nearly loud enough. I'm listening to it in the gym and can hear outside noise even with volume at full on this thing. The plastic case that holds it does not fit the player. That means that the buttons on the thing are barely accesable. The radio part of it is garbage and can't really be used. It's like tuning into a distant AM station.  I ditched the headphones immediately and can't tell you if they are good or not. <br>Do yourself a favor and skip this one, wish I had. Oh yeah and if you buy something take a minute or two and write a quick review about it. It really helps people out.

<Title>Y'all are overreacting
<Date>Mon Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After mulling over the mp3 universe I bought this unit at Sam's Club for $89.  It comes with a 32 mmc memory card for a combined memory of 160 rams.  Plus I can use different mmc cards for infinite expansion, so to speak.<p>I knew what I was getting into when I bought this unit.  I decided that there's no way getting around buying 2 mp3 players.  One hd-based for storing large quantities of music, like an ipod, and another cheaper unit for jogging and moving around.  The rio s35s seemed like a good option for exercise.  <p>So far I'm not disappointed.  The sound is fantastic.  I LIKE the included headphones--why is everybody complaining about them?  The radio reception is adequate.  (I tried another pair of headphones laying around and that weakened the radio signal).  When the lcd backlight is on that causes an annoying hum in the radio, but when the light goes off after 5 seconds the hum disappears.  Also the firmware update notes promises to improve the radio quality--maybe that's helping mine. <p>I still might return this unit to the store, but not because of any inherent flaws.  I think it might be worth it to spend a little more to get a player with a voice recorder, like the iRiver or MPIO.  (Last night, I was playing with the unit when my 19-month old daughter started telling stories--it would have been fantastic to just to turn it on and RECORD!)  Also, it would be nice to be able to transfer files directly to the player without the go-between of the proprietary software (which is not as bad as everyone is saying, by the way).  <p>All in all, the player has delivered everything that i expected of it, and it's excellent sound quality has even pleasantly surprised me.  I'm listening to the Clash's "Complete Control" right this instant and I'm amazed at how crisp, clear and LOUD  it is!<p>epilogue: I did take it back and got an MPIO FL100 for about twice the price.  I'll write a new review of this player.

<Title>Surpasses all expectations!
<Date>Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I did a pretty fair amount of research before buying this product.  From what I had been hearing, I was concerned that I would buy a player and it would probably take several hours to install the drivers and get the player itself to work.  I narrowed my choice between the s35s and the Nike player.  I read every review three or four times and finally decided on the s35s.  Total installation time, including loading six songs, was 15 minutes.  I don't know if SonicBlue has made changes to the software or what but I am extremely pleased thus far.  I didn't even really need any of the instructions.  I will offer this up:  Once you get everthing loaded, restart your computer.  I am far from a techie, so I followed all of the on screen instructions and did not have any problems.<p>The radio is ok but that's not why I bought the player.  The sound is not great but better than I expected.  I'm sure this can be improved by upgrading the head phones. <p>Overall, I was a little worried when I started the installation process but as stated above -- 15 minutes.  Now it's time to take the dog for a walk and jam some Black Label Society.

<Content>I was sitting here wondering whether I should rate this a four star product, because while it's an excellent product it isn't mind-blowing, or a five star product because of it's overall great value.  In the end, the proximity of the mere quality of the product to five-star level and the great value swayed me to give it five.  The installation software is easy to use, as is the music transfer program.  The player itself is small and sleek, while the backlight is a fluorescent blue that makes me feel like this was a Christmas gift from Spock.  The accessories are nice: a nifty little carry-clip, a rechargeable battery, nice headphones anda USB cable.  The sound quality is pleasing, but not great, thus the four star rating for the quality.  Still, the sound is more than satisfactory while overall the product was a great, great deal.

<Title>Better than ever thought!
<Date>Sun Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was considering buying a Nomad IIc 128 MP3 Player but, then I saw this I thought it looked so awesome. So I looked at all the features and I decided I'd rather use this because it's made for sports and is so light. I read reviews and some people said it wasn't to good because trouble loading. Don't listen it is very simple and easy. Sure, you have to know a little about computers to do it. If you don't know anything about them it may cause a little problem with everything but, it is the best. The only thing is if the battery isn't over half full the tuner won't work and it will shut down don't worry if it happens. It did it to me in school and I thought it was broke, it's not. Overall, this MP3 player is way greater than I thought and you want to buy this. I love it so much. I've had it about 5 days and has no problems it's the best. You should buy 1 too.

<Title>awesome portable audio system
<Date>Mon Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This unit fits the bill nicely for me as a companion on my frequent cycling jaunts.  The unit was relatively simple to get up and running.  Uploading songs from my computer via Kazaa was a snap annd accomplished quickly.  That would be the preferred way to program music as uploading from audio CD's is time consuming.<p>The sound is reasonably clear although the FM reception isn't the greatest.  The size of the unit and the accessories allow it to be hooked up onto your person in a variety of comfortable locations.<p>Nice birthday present for a person that's hard to shop for.  Thanks sis & brother in law.

<Date>Mon Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I hunted for over a year for a light-weight, high quality MP3 player with plenty of storage to help me train for my next marathon.  After reading the specs and many positive reviews I decided to give the Rio S35S a try.  Having used it for 4 weeks now I can say that I got exactly what I wanted and expected.  The device has phenomenal sound while playing MP3's.  I admit that the radio is just okay, but I didn't buy the thing for a radio.  I wanted to play my music only not the garbage ad filled radio junk.  If you exercise and are looking for an MP3 Player I highly recommend this one.

<Title>RIO not good for me
<Date>Sat Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had an intel pocket concert which I thought was great.  My car got stolen and that was the end of MP3 player #1.  After doing research I purchased the Rio R35S.  Sound quality was average (not as good as the older and discontinued Intel Pocket Concert).  The Rio lasted a little over a year then many of the buttons stopped working.  I used it in the gym to work out and was very careful with it.  Was not durable for me.  Maybe this was an isolated problem but it was enough to keep me away from Rio's for good.  My third and current MP3 player is the IRiver 390T with 256mb.  This player is great.  Sound quality is great.  The player is small and user friendly for most people.  Based on my experience I would stay away from the RIO.

<Title>Rio Sport 35S
<Date>Mon Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was my first MP3 player, although I bought my father the RCA Lyra (128mb) for Christmas.  Although he enjoys it, I felt the battery compartment's door felt flimsy.  I did a lot of research and finally bought the Rio Sport 35S at Sam's Club.  It came with a bonus 32mb chip and an additional 1-year warranty on top of the manufacturer's warranty....$112 total.<p>It's very lightweight and I love the LCD display.  for me, the MP3 had to have an armband and have an expandable memory.  Rio has that.  The plastic case is alright, although I could have designed it a bit better.  I plan to buy some material and make a pouch that completely protects the player AND attaches to the armband.<p>The headphones (ear buds) are not the greatest...one bud keeps wanting to pop out of my ear.  The control buttons are easy to use, but if you bump the control button into something (wall, door) it is easy to fast forward/rewind/stop the player.  This is another eason I think the plastic carrying case could have been improved to add some protection to the face of the player.<p>Sound quality is great and the batteries last several hours at least.  I have only gone through one battery so far and I have owned this two weeks.<p>I would highly recommend this player to anyone.  <p>Plus - style, sound quality, functionality of buttons, display.<br>Minus - earphones, plastic case.

<Content>i've had mine for less than a year, and within the first couple months it started to break.  i've done nothing out of the ordinary with this player.  it shuts off mid-use, it refuses to play certain songs already programmed (that worked when initially downloaded into the player), cuts off in the middle of half of the songs (which were complete when first downloaded into the player), and now thinks that half of the memory is used up when there are NO songs programmed into it!  Oh, and the &quot;stop&quot; button stopped working and now i can't use any other function on the player or change any settings because it is also the &quot;down&quot; function on the menu.

I just bought new ones, I've dropped mine five or six times on concrete and there has been no change in its perfomance, the only problem is when using the belt clip when i work out, I sometimes bump the mp3 player making the song stop, I guess its because I hit the stop button, but other than that and those annoying head phones , its perfect. When I bought mine it came with a free 32mb memory card, so with out it , it'd probably hold 30 songs give or take a few.

<Title>Not What You Want
<Date>Sun Feb 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had nothing but trouble with my Rio Sport. First of all the internal memeory dosent really hold that many songs. You might get 33 songs on it and it will be full. I purchased another 128MB stick and that lets me get another 33 songs on it.<p>I have gone through one battery after another it just eats them up. The power button has had a mind of its own and doesn't want to turn on sometimes and other times wont shut off. Then the internal memory just wont play on mine. I have 33 songs on it and it can only find the songs that I have on my memory stick and when I connect it to the software it shows full but no songs on there to delete. So I have an internal memory that is useless.<p>Get a player that costs more and holds more songs because after you get the memory stick to add you will end up spending more and still end up with less music. The headphones that come with it are also worthless and uncomfortable so you will buy new ones of those also.

<Title>Terrible Design...Do Not Buy!
<Date>Mon Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Terrible design, short battery life, the tuner doesn't work, the holding case is awkward, and the headphones are cheap.<p>My wife bought me this player for Christmas.  It is very nice to be able to listen to MP3s (from my copied CDs) as opposed to the endless loop on commercial radio, however, that's the case with all MP3 players.  On the good side, the display is fine and the software is easy to learn.  Now for the long list of problems...<p>1.	Design - For years I've owned a Sony Sport Walkman (you know, they're yellow).  It has served me well, but it only has a radio.  This MP3 player has a raised circular Play-pause/forward/reverse/stop button.  I am constantly bumping it.  It is incredibly frustrating.  Like most people I listen to my "sport" player while I'm on the move (working out, mowing the grass, walking the dog, etc.).  My old Walkman's buttons are recessed and I never accidentally push them.  With the Rio, the slightest bump and the song will start again, stop, or pause.  What's worse is trying press the circle properly without looking at it (like I said, usually it's clipped to my belt and I'm doing something else, hence the "sport" part of this player's description).  No matter if I put it in my pocket, clip it to the front of me, side of me, or back of me I always bump it again and again.  It's so frustrating.  There's a "key protect" in the menus, but navigating to it requires you to stop what you're doing.  Not convenient!  With my old Walkman I could easily press the recessed buttons when I wanted without a key protect.  The design of the buttons makes this player worthless.  But, if that's not enough...<br>2.	Battery life - The player sucks batteries.  In my old Walkman I'd change them every six to eight weeks (two AAA's).  With this player I change the 1 AAA battery every 8 to 10 hours.  What a joke!<br>3.	AM/FM Tuner - It simply doesn't work.  Even the stations that come in crystal clear on my old Walkman don't come in at all.  <br>4.	Holding case - The MP3 player has an awkward plastic case (for clipping to your clothes).  It makes the on/off, volume, and menu buttons hard to push.  It also makes it hard to plug in the headphones.<br>5.	Headphones - Speaking of the headphones...they're complete junk.  You'll need another pair.<br>6.	Software - It was easy to learn at first and transferring files to the player is simple.  However, I can't pull over my play lists from Windows Media Player (maybe I'm just missing something) and each time I copy another CD I need to refresh the music library which takes a bunch of time.<p>In summary, this player is a complete piece of junk.  Avoid it at all costs.

<Title>Buyer beware !!!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The one good thing about this machine is that when it does work, and if you use a pair of upgraded headphones (not the ones supplied with the player), the sound quality delivered to the listener is quite good - superb in fact.<p>As for the bads, and there are many:<br>1. the plastic clip-on case (not pictured in the on-line advertisement on Amazon or anywhere else) doesn't actually fit the player, so if you want to press buttons during use, you have to stop what you're doing and remove the player to be able to access the buttons - this makes it incredibly impractical as a &quot;sports&quot; music player.<p>2. within 2 weeks the actual waist/belt clip simply snapped (during routine, ordinary use) because it is made of poor quality, thin rigid plastic.  Result: when I use the player now, I have to carry it in my hand or keep it in my shorts pocket.  I have called the company numerous times only to be told that no additional holders are available, they're on back order.  I guess other people have had the same problem as me!!<p>3. battery life is more like 4-5 hours if you use the player in a gym where it is likely to be noisy (often with background music, machines, people yapping) and you need to crank it up.  The advertised 14 hour battery life may be attainable if you are listening in a quiet room and not moving a muscle.<p>4. the headphones supplied with the player stink, don't even try to use them<p>5. the software interface for Windows is a disaster and has crashed several times, requiring time-consuming un-installs and re-installs, ultimately requiring that I ditch the CD supplied with the player and go to the company website, under phone direction from their help line, and download the on-line version.  Song order gets jumbled by the machine during transfer so the coherence of an album becomes unrecognizable.  Finally I learned to bypass the company software altogether - music can be downloaded to it via Windows Media Player, as long as you have the most recent version (which I needed to download for this sole purpose).<p>My verdict is that the device has promise - sound quality itself is great and the price is competitive, but there are so many bugs with the product (hardware and software) that I think the company should be allowed a hiatus to stop and figure out what it is doing, and come back to us 6 months from now with apologies and major upgrades.  They need to realize they can't skimp on the holder for the player.   Had I known all this earlier, I would have spent the extra $100 or so on the smaller iPod.   I have the bitter feeling that this was $118 poorly spent.   My advice to any potential buyer would be to STAY AWAY from this company and product.<p>I could go on but I need to go to work.<p>Good luck!

<Title>It's great but the battery life isn't
<Date>Fri Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 player is about perfect. The interface for adding or removing files is exceptional. A child could set up and operate this thing. The armband is a great addition but the ear buds tend to slip out when you sweat, I recommend getting different headphones. You can upgrade the memory which is a huge addition as it allows you to spend less money than just buying a 40gig I-Pod which is going to die after 6 or 7 months. My only complaint is that they say you have 10 hours of playing time on one AAA battery. Unless there are some nuclear-powered super batteries I am unaware of, that time quote is a farce. You're lucky to get half that play time on one battery. I switched to a new battery yesterday. Used it for 1 1/2 hours at work, 2 hours at home loading music (I'm picky about my arrangements OK, sue me) and the battery is half empty according to the meter on the display. That being the case, it looks like I'll get MAYBE 6 or seven hours..certainly not 10. Other than that fact, this thing is great. I use it for running and if I'm running for more than six hours its from the police, not for leisure so my problems are far beyond the battery life of my equipment if you get my drift.

<Title>Pay proper precaution before buying
<Date>Wed Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Generally, I like the player's size and how well it works while out and about.  But it's in no way perfect.  Here's what I've learned, having very recently received my S35S player.  <p>1.  FM Radio.  Everybody complains about it.  There's some sort of tuning strength function on this device, as when I press play while the tuner is active, a different icon comes up and the signal seems to change.  Hmmm...  <p>2.  Stopwatch.  Hard to get to for being a &quot;sports&quot; device.<p>3.  Battery strength indicator.  A lot of people complain about this one too.  For those people, note there is a battery type setting (Alkaline/NiMH).  Also, with NiMH, also note there's different battery capacities.  I've seen AAA range from 300 ma to over 800 ma, depending on who made them and what you paid.  Battery properties, such as voltage fall off rates in your battery affect how long this player will run on one charge.  <p>4.  Time and date.  Remove the battery and the &quot;tuned&quot; station is remembered.  But...the time and date need to be reset.  This MUST be fixed.  As a side note, the player settings also revert to default after battery removal.  Why don't they just save to onboard memory???  Time I can understand, but the general settings??<p>5. Installation.  I too had problems, which took 45 minutes to finally resolve.  You MUST install the Rio Manager software, which I found disappointing. All I know is that before installing the software the machine didn't recognize it, and after a couple reboots it did.  (As a USB storage device, Windows &quot;should&quot; have assigned it a drive letter automatically.) I use other player software, which may NOW work, but I just haven't tried yet.  Do NOT use Real One player.  It's just a conduit for being spammed with ads.  I used to use it, but found at least Microsoft didn't spam me with ads using Media Player.<p>6.  Menu.  Sometimes setting menu changes don't appear to take effect.  I have to go back in and double check the settings.

<Title>Great Player for Working Out...
<Date>Mon Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had this thing for a little over a month now.  The good things are that it holds about 30-35 average length songs, has an external card slot which can use either MMC or SD media, uses a single AAA battery, backlit display (with a lot of information, some of the cheaper MP3 players out there don't even display the song title), small form factor, belt clip, arm band, &quot;FM radio.&quot;<p>Some things that could be improved on are the &quot;FM radio.&quot;  Just like everyone says, reception is still poor, even with firmware 1.60.  The belt clip is cool, but it let the player fly off my sweat pants and hit the sidewalk while jogging (use the arm band).  The ear phone cable could be at least 6-12 inches longer.  The phones are decent, but another pair may be better.  The Rio Music Manager could be improved.  Doesn't display total playlist MB size.<p>Overall, I'm very pleased with this player.  Battery life is good for the battery size (have yet to replace the battery in a month of using it about 2 times a week for an hour).  The player case is nice, I'm glad to see the hold feature added (might be useful to still allow you to adjust the volume even with hold on, but this might make other people mad).

<Title>Coolest unit I could find
<Date>Wed Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have been doing tons of research on various MP3 players, and only about half of them are Mac friendly.  After concluding that this was the right model for me, I was a bit worried about all the reviews stating the reception is poor.  Well let me tell you, I live in Oregon, and I can't even get TV reception with regular or enhanced antennas.  The tuner worked fine from inside my apartment! And as for people stating there is no lock feature, THERE IS. Read the manual.  Press and hold MENU, then hit enter.  It locks the buttons in case of accidental bumps. My only complaint is that sometimes the sound (Bass in particular) during MP3 playback sounds distorted..  Then after playing around with the unit a bit, it starts to come in clear. Anyone else with this problem? Otherwise, I think it's a great, feature-rich, sleek-designed, sporty unit!

<Date>Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I give this little thing a 4.5, actually.  After reading some of the other reviews I ran across when deciding whether or not to buy this, I must point out that I'm probably not the norm.  I'm a licensed driver.  This apparently gives me an advantage with software installation and player operation.  I put the CD in, followed the directions on the screen, copied the songs to my player, and was done.  The longest part was waiting for the Rio manager to sort through my MP3s.  The FM reception picks up the stations I'm interested in, so I'm pleased.  I still haven't upgraded the firmware (the website is a little slow) - but everything works like I hoped it would.  I noticed a bit of the grainy reception in a station, but the tuner was just a bonus, in my mind.  The menu options are easy to use and figure out.  The sound is really good - I think some people expect too much when buying electronics sometimes.  I didn't give it a five because of its downside - requires batteries.  A perfect product would run off of oxygen in the air or something.  The only real difference I noticed between this and the Rio S50 is the included rechargeable batteries ...

<Title>Well Worth It!
<Date>Sat Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I love my new SonicBlue Rio!  After having read every user review ...I had some reservations with the key complaints (which were relatively minor to begin with):  FM radio, software use/compatibility, and headset comfort.  But given Amazon.com's competitively low price by far, I went ahead with the purchase.<p>When I received it (approx. 2 days - using regular shipping), I had prepared myself to encounter problems with the aforementioned.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the FM stereo feature not only works very well, but it did so both at the office (inside a 5-story building) and at the gym (converted industrial steel & concrete building).  While the FM radio feature is usually not the reason one buys an MP3 player, it does come in handy when tuning into the TV monitors at the gym.<p>The software installed quickly and is very user-friendly.  The downloads only take a matter of minutes for an entire playlist.<p>The earphones/headset is not only comfortable, but fits securely in both ears.  The overall quality of sound is quite good, but as other users have mentioned, if you're a real audiophile, simply invest in a better headset that provides the heavy bass, etc.  Otherwise, I doubt one would notice the difference much.<p>The unit itself fits ergonomically in either hand.  The backlighting in the display is very useful, but the text can be too small to read when engaged in rigorous workouts, but that's somewhat expected in such a compact device anyway.  The option to wear it on your arm or use the belt clip is also a big plus.<p>I don't know if it helps to lower one's expectations, but this unit worked out very well for me.  After thoroughly comparing it to others in and out of it's class, I'd highly recommend this product.  It's well worth the small investment!  The only thing missing is a "free set of Ginsu Knives" to accompany it!

Other than that player worked very well and had no problems with downloading music and were very happy with it other than what I thought was a minor problem....UNTIL....I called tech support and after 1/2 hour wait (no 800# so MY dime to boot) they tell me to send it back. That was on Jan 3rd...its now Feb 14th and still nothing! I finally call back on Feb 13 and wait on hold for another 50 minutes this time, and after reaching a person they agree that they recieved the player but couldnt tell me anymore than that and to just wait a couple more weeks! UNBELIEVABLE! I should have just returned it through Amazon. So beware...player works great when it works, but if it breaks and you need to send it back youll be very sorry. At least I know to stay away from Sonic in the future....good thing because I just about purchased a Replay last week, but went with the Tivo instead after this mess.

<Content>This player is fine as an MP3 player but the FM tuner is not really functional.  I live in manhattan where there are plenty of strong radio signals but the SONIC blue only picks up about 2 stations and they sound terrible. In contrast, my 10 dollar sony analog tuning radio picks up a couple dozen radio stations at least and it is about the same size. Also, if you do buy  this unit you should know to take off the wrap-around-ear plastic things on the earphones which are removable and very uncomfortable in my opinion.

<Date>Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ugh! Got this as an xmas gift from my husband (I recommended this specific player) and boy was it a mistake! It worked for about 1 week (5 hours of play) and stopped ('USB Connected' screen wouldn't go away) - reloaded the firmware as the website suggests. Worked for a week and went back to the same problem. Tried replacing the battery - again worked for about 4 days. Now even replacing batteries doesn't help. I have an email to their customer support, but from what I've read in these other reviews, I'm probably not going to be too successful. I can only guess from reading the incredibly mixed reviews for this product that when you buy it, it's basically a crap shoot. Hope that if you do buy it, you'll end up being one of the people giving this product 5 stars! If not, you've just thrown 120 bucks away....

<Title>Pricey for a bic lighter
<Date>Mon Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Basic functionality is adequate.  It plays MP3 files.  The bundled Rio software is garbage.  I have not found a way to reorder the songs on the unit.  The proprietary cable is a very stupid idea.  It makes a very strange buzzing (although not thru the earphones thankfully) and the &quot;menu&quot; button has stopped functioning after only 6 months.  I can't recommend this device at it's current price point.  If it cost under $20 it might be a decent value.

<Title>Not Recommended
<Date>Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I ordered this MP3 player a little over two weeks ago - and I am returning it today. I am an Industrial Engineer and my roommate is an Industrial Designer - and both of us agree that the plastic case that holds this player is one of the worst designs we have ever seen. I literally pulled off a fingernail trying to seperate the case from the player, not to mention that the buttons on the top of the player don't line up with the cutouts of the case, or that you can't dock with the USB cable unless you remove the player. I previously had an Apple IPod, but traded it for an MP3 player I could &quot;go running with.&quot; Big mistake - I will definitely do my homework next time.

Other than that, the ear phones are uncomfortable after about fifteen minutes, they started falling apart 1 week after new, it doesn't play iTunes, the FM tuner is weak, organization of songs is difficult and memory insufficient.  YIKES! Stay away from this one.

<Title>Cheaply made
<Date>Mon Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The armband container is awful.  The holes on it don't line up with the switches on the player.  The on/off switch is pathetic.  The battery cover is flimsy.  The overall quality is very poor.  My unit split along a seam for no apparent reason and became virtually unusable after only 4 months.  A mp3 player designed as a &quot;sport&quot; model should be more robust than that.  The whole concept is very poorly executed.

<Title>I never leave home without it!!!
<Date>Fri Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had this player for about 9 months now and there isn't a place it hasn't gone.  It has been tossed around, wet, dropped, and it still keeps on ticking.  I'm not saying go intentionally beat the crap out of it, but just know it can take it.  It's light weight with easy to use software depending on if you have even the most basic computer knowledge...i.e (how to turn it on and play solitare).  The expandable memory is a must have for me, and definetly a plus over much higher priced MP3 players without the feature.  I hear a lot of complaints about the plastic carrying case, but lots of people can't open child proof caps with ease either. Look at the whole product, nothing is perfect, but somethings definetly have more pros than cons. This player is a definite buy. I'm rough on my stuff and this baby has survived.

<Title>Not really a &quot;sport&quot; player
<Date>Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you're just sitting around or doing something low intensity (like lifting weights), it's a great player.  When I jog on the treadmill with it on my arm (at a moderate intensity), it stops playing mid-song and returns to the start of the playlist.  It's not the file, since the point at which it stops in the playlist is never the same.  I emailed customer support and was told to purchase the Cali player if I wanted a player that will work at a &quot;higher intensity&quot;.  If that's the case, then they shouldn't offer this as a sport player.  I'm going to try putting it on my waist, hoping it will help.  Also, the volume could stand to go higher; it's often difficult to hear over the clanging of plates or the music that my gym plays.

<Content>Oh my god, this product was the biggest headache. I received one as an early Valentine's Day present, and it quit working after a week, as soon as I figured out how to load the songs and bought the expensive memory card, it broke. If yours says &quot;upgrader&quot; then beware. I went through the upgrader process not once but twice, and it never would work. When I called support, they said to take it back to the store. So I did. I will be saving my money for the mini-ipod when it comes out.

<Title>Great size and sound--not durable or reliable enough
<Date>Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had four different Rios that I use running.  When they work properly, they are great.  My first two were Rio Ones and both stopped playing after being accidentally dropped.  I switched to the RioS35S.   I like the size, the extra capacity, the ability to upgrade memory.  However, the Rios just aren't as durable as the price warrants.  Both belt clips broke within a couple of months and replacments are not available.  The email support suggested I buy a leather carrying case with a belt loop.  Get serious.  Not only is that an expensive solution, but who wears belts running?   The earphone wires frequently come out of the channel in the part that wraps around the ears and they begin to make crackling sounds, so plan on replacing the earphones.  Also, as mentioned in other reviews, they turn off randomly and restart back at the first song in the memory, leaving you in the lurch without music, searching for where you left off while you're trying to keep running.  Sometimes the Rio goes two or three songs without stopping.  Sometimes the Rio stops several times before it makes it through one song.  My daughter also has the Rio S35S and has the same problem of the Rio turning itself off when running.  As much as I love many features, my experience with Rios would make me shop from a different manufacturer the next time I buy an mp3 player just for improved reliability.

<Title>Sports enthusiast beware!
<Date>Sun Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am extremely disappointed with the sports armband and belt clip this unit comes with. The belt clip is a flimsy piece of plastic that easily breaks off. I accidentally broke mine trying to simply pull it off my shorts. Additionally the arm band is nothing more than a cheap piece of cloth that wraps around your arm. To attach the player to your arm, you use the belt clip... obviously not much thought was put into the design. This use of the belt clip/armband combo makes the player jut out from your arm, and you feel the entire unit bounce like it's about to fall off while you jog.<p>I have one of the older Nike PSA 32MB units, and the arm-band is fantastic. The player is actually recessed within the band which is made of a thick durable, spandex-type material. I expected the same level of quality from the Rio.<p>The actual player is pretty good, though you can't easily manage the controls without looking at them... the Nike PSA has raised buttons. Though the sound and features of the player are decent, I'm giving this only 2 stars because I don't think this truly qualifies as a "Sport" unit. Rio needs to rethink their approach if they're going to target the sports demographic.

<Title>Great overall with one fatal flaw
<Date>Mon Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The products specs are fine. The playback is loud, the user interface is intuitive, and the software is problem free. Guess what, none of that matters. The product is as fragile as a egg.  I was very pleased with all aspects of the product until i tryed to actually use it where it was designed to be used, the gym.  I had previously owned a Intel MP3 player, which was fantastic and only became outdated due to its memory size. But took the typical beating that a product takes when jogging, or lifting with electronics. Nothing outlandish, but typical wear and tear.  Anyway, I have new Rio and its simply falls from my hip, at sitting level onto carpet (approx. 2.5 feet) and pops open, never to be properly closed again.  This product can have all the memory, bells and whistles, and ease of use. But hey quess what kids, if the damn thing shatters when you look at it funny it kinda negates its cutting edge features. Note to RIO: If your gonna built a product as &quot;Athlete friendly&quot; don't just coat it in rubber and have a well proportioned dude hold it up and smile on the website, make it so. If you plan on using this product for anything other than sitting stationary, or maybe some brisk walking while maintaining a deathgrip on the player, i would have to issue a no-sale on this product.

<Date>Tue Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I'm very happy with this MP3 player. I'm new to MP3, and I found the software installation and transfer of music to be very easy. The player itself is also very easy to use, creates great sound, and is very small and easy to deal with when exercising. The headphones are worthless - throw them out and make the small investment in much better ones (if you don't already have better ones). If they had excluded the headphones, I'd have rated it at five stars.

<Content>I own two MP3 players from Sonicblue/Rio and generally have been very pleased with the quality of the product.  Recently I changed computers and lost the software/device drivers for my MP3 players.  I've tried customer service twice; both times I was on hold for more than half an hour and - when I finally reached them - the people were not helpful.  I believe the company has outsourced all of its customer service functions offshore and drastically cut the number of people in this dept... so if you have any issues, you are out of luck!

<Content>After spending a lot of time searching for a MP3 player I opt for the Sonicblue. My thoughts are as follows:<p>1. I agree with everyone about the radio reception. It [is bad], but I mainly use the player for mp3s so it's a small complaint for me.<p>2. Customer service also [is bad] but I've only used it twice.<p>3. The player sounds great. I switched headphones and the music is awesome. It also can play WMA format so you can store a lot more than using MP3s.<p>4. Transfering music is fast and easy.<p>5. I reccomend getting NiMH rechargeable batteries. You can chose the battery type in the menu of the player from alkaline, NiCD, or NiMH.<p>6. The extra features on the player (stopwatch, bookmark, upgradeable firmware, lock feature, etc.) makes it worth the money.<p>7. The armband may not be for everyone but you can make your own from a velcro strap because of the belt holster that comes with it. I have no problems with the arm band.<p>I actually would give it a 4.5 because of the radio tuner but if I had to do it again, I would buy it.

<Content>I was really happy with how small and easy this is to use, but when the belt clip broke (easily) the customer service people told me I was out of luck because it wasn't a manufacturing defect. Without a clip it's not really a sport mp3 player, is it?  Now I can't even get through to customer service to even try to buy a new clip. Luckily, it's small enough to fit in a pocket, but I don't recommed this because of the risk

The only thing that I would suggest you buy with it would be a memory card.  128MB holds about 30 songs.  Get a 512MB extension card, and you'll be rocking on for hours.  Good buy, I haven't seen a reason to get another.  I love it, i think you would too.

However, I went on a long run with it and it rained during the run. The player was out of wack for a while. I had to reformat it according to the directions on the SonicBLUE website. After reformatting and letting it sit for a while it returned to normal. I would just advise that the company's claim that it is &quot;built to withstand the elements&quot; doesn't include rain as one of the elements that it is built to withstand.

The tuner doesn't pick up a lot of radio stations...that was a bummer, but the amazing sound quality of the tracks made up for what the player lacks. It holds about 30-35 songs depending on length, which I definetly found to be enough, but is upgradeable nonetheless. All around it is one of the best MP3 players out there for such a low price and stylish look.

Either that, or he's clairvoyant, and only buys things that he knows ahead of time he'll like.  Last possibility: he is extremely easy to please and has very low standards.<p>Me, I'm not going to pretend that I own this Rio S35 so I'll give it a 3 star rating just to keep it even.

<Title>Not Impressed
<Date>Mon Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>As a software engineer for embedded devices, I might be particularly critical to this kind of thing, but I also know that these little MP3 players are not really all that complicated, and they should be able to get these things to be darn near perfect.<p>My primary complaint is that there is a ridiculously loud buzz if you're listening to the FM tuner and the display backlight is on.  Backlights can cause a lot of noise which can be noticed on many devices that use them, but the effect can be controlled so that it's hardly noticeable - if it's there at all.  RIO, however, seems to have made no attempt to fix this - the buzz is many times louder than the static you get from the FM tuner.<p>My second complaint is the use of a non-standard data transfer mechanism.  They use a unique cable and you are forced to use their software (which has it's own set of problems).  So if you want to manage your MP3s from both home and work, for example, you need to bring the cable and software with you.  If the device acted as a simple USB drive, this would not be an issue.<p>Thirdly, the 'holster' that you use if you want to clip the device to a belt doesn't fit right.  It partially covers some of the buttons and the headset jack.<p>Overall, I was very unimpressed.  Ya, it plays mp3's, but big deal.  That's easy.

However, after only 8 months of ownership and use, the button controls quietly stopped working ... can't skip through recordings, can't go to the menu, can't change the volume ... can only get it to play, and but not always.  Warranty's short, and it's over, so I can't send it back.  Called support and they said they could trade me a refurbished one for $79.  I'm probably better off buying a new one, but if it's only going to last 8 months, why bother???

The buttons do not match up with cutouts in the case and make using them difficult if doing any kind of activity.  I tried to work with the Rio customer support, but after three weeks their response was 1)Yes, the buttons do not line up 2)It does make it difficult to use 3)They are all like this 4)Buy a better case through a third party supplier.  What a joke this is.  Admitting to the customer that their product is not up to par, and then suggesting I go purchase somthing from another company.  Sounds like Rio wouldn't even buy their own product.  I would not reccomend anyone to purchase this product.

<Title>Versitile, Rugged Digital Player
<Date>Wed Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Before I buy any electronic gadgets I always read as many reviews as possible, and from many different sources.  Many of the complaints I've read seem to have more to do with operator error than product failure.  After buying, setting up, and using the RIO SPORT S35S I have to say that most of the complaints I've read are probably the result of purchasers NOT reading the instructions.<p>This unit does everything it's supposed to do and does it very well, too.  Audio quality is very high and enhanced by the quality of your CD copying software.  Using Windows Media Player 9 (WMP9) seems to be the best out there as it transfers the music quickly and playback is very clear.  In addition, WMP9 sources CD data from the internet so the readout on the player contains all the necessary album and track information...very cool.  The included RIO software could not be any easier to navigate.<p>One thing I haven't read in any reviews is the fact that being able to change the song list easily and quickly helps one (me anyway) remain inspired to head into the gym with an ever-changing, motivating mix of tunes.  Buy this product, read the entire manual, and enjoy!

<Title>luv it
<Date>Fri Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this player despite what was said about the tuner.  I am a beginner runner and wanted something light.  I was afraid it might bounce around (what I hate about most little radio's etc).  It doesn't bounce around on my arm.  The clarity is great.  The earphones are just fine.  And as for the radio I pick up just fine.  Of course I live in a metropolitan area so I am sure that helps.  But I have nothing but praise for this little guy.  <br>The worst thing about this was trying to find them.  They are really popular.

<Content>I was looking for a good mp3 player for running. This is it.  The computer software took me 10 minutes to set up and to transfer music to the player.  So quick and easy.  The equilizer is great and the sound is amazing for its size.  No complaints at all.

<Title>Great player....
<Date>Fri Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this player with very high hopes. After reading all the reviews (there were more bad then good) I was a little skeptical about recieving my Rio player. When I recieved it I was blown away at how fast my music was transported onto the software and onto the player. It took no time at all but I was careful and I thought the instructions were very helpful. I am very satisified with my order. I was searching for and Mp3 player for a while and I decided to get this one. It barely weighs a thing and it fits in the palm of your hand. The belt clip and the arm band is definatly the plus. Every one was complaining about the headphones. I thought that they were nice and they worked really well. I decided to use my own pair only because they are headphones and not earphones. I have yet to try the fm radio. I have heard that it is bad but we'll see. I didn't buy this Mp3 player for the radio, I bought it for the use of the Mp3. I definatly would recommend this product to anyone. I didn't give this 5 stars because I don't believe that any product is that perfect but I have yet to find a problem.

<Date>Fri Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I read and read many reviews and tried several MP3's. I finally decided to buy this one. I love it, it's clear and easy to use. I found the software fairly easy to use, although, it could be better.<br>The radio is fuzzy at times, but, hey, you don't buy it for the radio features.<br>Throw away the headphones...! Get real quality headphones. <br>Overall, I'm very happy. I originally ordered from Amazon, but, couldn't wait, so walked in to bestbuy to buy one. <br>I heard a lot of complaints about the player braking down. I bought the extended warranty just in case, after all...if you're already spending this much.<br>Enjoy!

<Title>So Convenient
<Date>Mon Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased this from amazon.com and received it 5-6 days later. I then took it to the gym and was extremely impressed! The sound quality is superb and I love the backlight. It also possess a stop watch and I am able to listen to the radio; I just strap it on my arm and get my workout on!<br>It doesn't get in the way when I am doing cardio(running)/lifting weights nor does it skip because of the technology; unlike portable contraptions that use discs. I highly recommend this because of the price and the features. Other portable mp3's are more expensive and don't offer the same features. The software is also easy to install and easy to use. The next step is to get a memory card so that I am able to listen to more songs; the memory provided will allow you to listen to 22-26 songs, depending on length of song. Enjoy!

<Title>Great for Working Out!
<Date>Wed Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've been running for about a year now and have found that my endurance has increased throughout the months.  This meant that my time spent running became longer, which then lead to a need for keeping my mind busy with music.  In the past I've used several methods of listening while running (holding a cd player, making mixed tapes, radio sets) and they all failed miserably.  So I forked out the money to purchase this little guy because it was right up my alley: a. 128mb is more than enough music for me and b. my computer is my home jukebox, w/all my cds ripped to my hard drive.<p>Pros:<br>-rubberized casing that is part of the player (practical and stylish)<br>-came with an arm strap and belt clip, I prefer the belt clip  <br>-pretty small for an upgradeable device<br>-added feature of a stopwatch<br>-single 'AAA' battery<br>-nice integration with XP<p>Cons:<br>-stopwatch is a little difficult to access.<br>-&quot;lock&quot; requires holding two buttons...not that bad<br>-bundled software (Rio Music Manager) is not that great<br>-could've done without the display to make it cheaper<p>Bottom Line:<br>It's a great player for exercising, but I'm sure Rio could've abandoned the need for a display and backlight.  Personally, I feel there's no need to display the song title because I remember what I uploaded to the player.  But I'm happy because I have the opportunity to upgrade it in the near future!

<Title>Bad customer service
<Date>Fri Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased a Rio and it stopped functioning correctly after about a month. I have been on the phone with their technical support and customer service a number of times and they have not been able to fix the problem. They have basically told me that I need a PC, not a Mac to be able to fix the Rio. Had I known that from the beginning, I would not have purchased the Rio. They gave me instructions on sending it back an replacing it with a new one, but I have not received anything in the last 3 weeks.

<Title>Fits My Gym Workouts Like a Glove!
<Date>Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>First off, I'll say that overall, the S35S is great at its main function: playing digital music files in a versatile module. I have had it for a few months now, and I must say that it is superb in the gym (the only place I use it). I'm there 5 days a week, my circuits vary between weight training and cardiovascular workouts...and this player compliments those activities very well. <p>The shape is nice, very small and &quot;cute&quot;, and doesn't get in the way very often. At first, I was using the supplied armband alot, but lately, I have resorted to clipping it to my waist. It makes it easier for me to run the cord inside my shirt and keep it out of the way of weights, etc. Either way, it's so small and light, you don't notice it's on most of the time. It's kind of difficult to get the player out of its little case (which has the belt clip on it), which you have to do every time you change batteries...but not so difficult to make a difference. The player is also very versatile and rugged. 2 days after I got it, I was wearing in on my arm, and I accidentally ran it into a wall corner. I was about to kick myself, until I realized that there wasn't a single mark on it. Nice!<p>The controls are good for basic functions. Even under my shirt, I can easily blindly feel my way to the playback buttons (all located on the oversize main button) and volume control. And something most people who have reviewed this product seem to miss is the button lock feature. Read the directions all the way through, you'll see that holding down the &quot;menu&quot; button for a couple seconds locks the keys, preventing accidental pressing. <p>The RealOne software that comes with it makes it very easy to rip and upload music to the S35S. I have compiled a list of about 300 workout-oriented songs from my CD collection; RealOne lets you create random playlists with a specific time limit and/or genre/artist filters. Me, I wake up in the morning, plug the USB cable into the top of the player (which, by the way, was very simple to set up), generate a random playlist with a total length of about 130 minutes, the general limit of the player (using regular 128k MP3 encrypted songs), hit download, and walk away. About 8 minutes later, it's ready to go. <p>Using traditional alkaline batteries, or even the new &quot;E-squared&quot; or &quot;Duracell Ultra&quot;, you don't get a whole lot of time from a battery. Maybe 5 hours? So, I suggest that if you purchase the s53s, do yourself a favor and buy a AA/AAA charger with a few rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries (vast improvements over the old Nickel Cadmiums). Not only do they last longer than even the upgraded alkalines, but you save yourself mucho bucks in the long run. Energizer makes a nice charger, if you're interested. <p>The sound is great, but unless you have great headphones (which don't mesh with gym sweat very well), the bass isn't the best. The headphones that came with it were broken right out of the box, but who cares...I had a nice pair already. There is an adjustable digital equalizer, which is nice. Which brings me to the digital interface as a whole. It's alright, but overall, once you really start using the thing on a regular basis, you're bound to discover that the only controls you typically use are &quot;on-off&quot;, &quot;play&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;forward/reverse&quot;, and &quot;volume&quot;. Other than that, the rest seems a bit...superfluous. The radio reception is poor, but I didn't buy the thing so I could have a FM tuner. There are alot of options that I never fool with anymore; it's just set on &quot;shuffle-repeat&quot;. <p>The one thing that is a disappointment is the clock. I was excited to be able to have a clock at the gym at all times...but I've found that it keeps time very poorly, and after a few hours, it will be ten minutes behind. So, I've stopped using that...though, the stopwatch is great for running, etc. <p>Overall, like I said, it does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. The other features seem superfluous at times, and I'd trade the radio for extra memory any day...but regardless, the digital music playback and the versatility of the package make it worth the money in and of itself. For what I wanted, I absolutely love this player...I don't know what I'd do without it.

<Date>Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Hi people. I am not much of a review writter, in fact this is my fisrt one! And I just want to point out that the quality of this product actually made me wanna get out there and tell the world to buy the rio s35s. it does exactly what is advertised. I don't know about these bad reviews about the radio, it works fine for me, indoors and outdoors. fantastic capacity (hint upload your songs in wma [windows media player] format, you'll be able to fit a lot more on this little [...]!).the headphones aren't as bad as some described it to be. I guess if you don't like'em you can get hi-end ones, but that doesn't change the fact that the s35s is the bomb!!. I also got a sandisk 256mb sd card with it and so far it works perfectly! I have 100 songs on my player right now (internal and external memory combined) and I still have over a 100mb to play with! so bad reviewers, read your manuals before you screw things up and blame it on the product.

<Date>Sat Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've bought the sonic rio s35s about a month ago. When it was delivered to my home, I couldn't believe how small it was. The software itself is okay, it gets the job done.  I usually go weight-train with this and i use the strap for my arm. it works pretty well but sometimes it tends to slide the player out a bit. but u can readjust it. the only thing i can a problem is the arm strap. it works dont get me wrong but if they took a little time into it. they could've got a better one. the only reason i bought this is, its small, and u can strap it on ur arm for workouts. other than that it's probably my best purchase in a long time. plus u can expand the 128mb onboard memory with an external card up to 264mb! pretty nifty. oh and i like how if u drop it on the floor its not  big a deal cuz it has a rubbery interface its cool. better than carrying a heavy fragile ipod to workout!

<Title>Durable &amp; functional, even for an MP3 newbie
<Date>Thu Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was a bit hesitant in purchasing this unit, particularly as some previously had criticized the armband and included software.  Let me tell you what I've seen after 4 months of significant use (5 times per week in the gym).<p>1.  MP3 portion has worked flawlessly.  I personally found the software easy to use, and it worked immediately after installation on my Sony Vaio desktop with no problem. I had never &quot;ripped&quot; an MP3 before, and still found the process of transferring music from my CD's to MP3 a breeze.<p>2.  I didn't purchase it for a Radio Tuner, but this one does seem to leave something to be desired.  I never use it anyway, but it's inability to receive FM signals is the sole reason I rated this only 4 stars.<p>3.  Accessories.  I'm in the gym an hour and a half to two hours a day, usually 5 days per week, and have never had a problem with the clip and armband.  The armband is comfortable, and solid (even when running).<p>Overall, I love this thing.  It's one of the very best investments I've made in electronics in a long time.

<Title>Dissapointing
<Date>Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had a RIO mp3/cd player (SP90) that I absolutely love.  I adored its design, the ease with which I could 'load' songs or updates to its flash ram.<p>I was looking forward to a simlarly wonderful experience with the S35S SPORTS player.  But...   ummm....  nope.<p>I got my player about 6 months ago.  And gave it a good bit of use at the gymn and on my bike.<p>The Mp3 playback:<br>The playback of mp3 tracks worked very well.  No complaints there.<p>The Display:<br>The display of track info was clear.<p>In general, the display, the clock, and menu system on the unit all worked very well.   Menu navigation made sense.  No complaints there.<p>The stopwatch:<br>An interesting feature.  Not terribly convenient.  I didn't use it at all.<p>The Radio:<br>Outdoors, the radio reception generally worked although I would say it was weak and tended to come and go.<p>Indoors, the radio reception generally failed.  I found the player constantly trying, and failing, to auto re-tune the radio stations.  This is actually much more annoying than say, merely a weak signal.  One might bear to listen to NPR with a weak signal - but one cannot listen to ANYTHING when the player re-tunes every second.<p>Exandability:<br>I put an extra MMC chip in (16mb).  The player recognized it.  No problems.  (The add-on MMC is treated as a seperate block of storage rather than just additional space to the built-in 128Mb)<p>Upgradeability:<br>I loaded a flash update without any issue, aside from it erasing the handful of my player preferences.<p>Music Upload:<br>Whereas a simple, standard, 'removable storage' approach would've been an OBVIOUS approach to loading music onto this USB device, from Windows, the RIO team instead chose to implement a proprietary music upload software package that is both cumbersome and inelegant.<p>Frankly, the upload software is just awful.  The GUI interface is not compatible with standard PC drag-n-drop operations - it looks like something an immature programmer would assemble.<p>Durability:<br>After a few months of ginger care, the volume control broke.  No abuse.. no drops... it just broke.  The volume component on the circuit board just broke away from the board.  (A consequence of the design wherein the button does not press against the circuit board... but against a little part on the edge of the board.)<p>Overall: <br>With the poor upload software, poor radio, and poor durability - I found this product dissapointing. Those were the features for which I selected this product... and they all were failures.<p>Ironically, I was so excited about the S35S when it first came out.. and was so certain that this RIO product would work well... I even bought an extra one as a gift for friend.<p>I certainly regret it.  Lesson learned.

<Title>Very easy to use, and very great mp3 player!!
<Date>Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was looking at all the sport-type mp3 players this summer, trying to find the best one to take running each day.  I read the reviews here on Amazon, and learned that I definitely didn't want the Nike one (which I have also heard from many other people).  But the  reviews for this Rio one were misleading.  I'm not sure how other people have had problems with this player.  IT has been dreamy since I pulled it out of the box.  I hooked it up to the computer, installed the Rio Music Manager software, and I was ready to go with a few clicks.  A box at the top of the computer screen shows you your available computer mp3 files, and a box on the bottom shows you what you already have on your player, along with a bar that shows you how many more MBs you have room for.  You click which files you want, and unclick the files you want removed.  It really is that easy.  I did follow the review advice and bought a better set of headphones.  And the FM tuner seems to work fine where I live.  If you love running/walking in a gym or in the outdoors, this RIO player is a must-have.

<Title>Good Player Overall
<Date>Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've owned a couple of players over the year and I still like Rio's backlight display. It has a good shape to it and fits nicely in your hand. It has a good rubber casing and the buttons are easy to press. <br>The features are nice on this player, a stopwatch, time, equalizer and FM radio. It's size let's you but in you pocket or you can use the belt clip to carry it. <br>    The Tuner reception needs much improvement but still if out in the open or in a large gym it seems to get OK reception. To use the armband you actually use the belt clip to attach it to the armband and it doesnt feel too secure while on the tread mill so I rather just have it in my pocket. Skipping through songs is easy, on downfall is if you stop during a song it doesnt resume at the moment when you stopped itll just resume at the beginning of the song.<p>Overall its a good player and you get what you pay for but room for improvement in the rio music manager. Also this is for Sonic Blue: When are you guys ever going to change youre earphones, theyre one of the worst designs out there and it doesnt seemed to have changed over the years.

<Title>Excellent value for the money
<Date>Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I chose the Rio S35S because of three factors: value, value, value.<p>I was not disappointed.<p>The Rio S35S is a low-cost, full-feature MP3 player that delivers the best performance for the money that I've seen so far.<p>This is *not* a super-size dynamo like the iPod.  The Rio comes with only 128Mb built-in.  In other words, a 10GB iPod can hold roughly 70 Rios.  The Rio doesn't include all the neat features of an iPod, and downloading files takes longer. BUT, a 10GB iPod sets you back $300, while the Rio costs less than $120.  <p>If you have an extra $300 to spend on a portable player that you might lose or break, have stolen, or see obsoleted in a year's time, get the iPod.  But if you want something *now* that works fine and will last you until 10GB costs $100, then get a Rio.<p>If you're really hung up about the 128Mb storage, spend $80 and get a 256MB add-on card.  You'll have 384MB of storage.  Then spend an extra 2-3 hours picking out the songs you *really* want (instead of downloading albums at a time).<p>I like my Rio, it does the job with only a few minor hassles.  It worked right out of the box.  The sound is good, operation is dirt simple.  Next Xmas I am guessing that MP3 players will be twice as powerful for half the price.  And if you doubt this, I will tell you that my first Sony portable CD player cost $300;  today's equivalent Sony costs $100.  And that's for a device that has *mechanical parts* (the non-hard drive ones).  The economy of scale for a device with no moving parts is simply amazing, and the economies of scale for hard drives is pretty darn good as well (120GB hard drives for $100!?) I would be willing to guess that we'll eventually have flash memory MP3 players for $50, and hard drive players with 10-20GB drives for $100-$150.  Why pay primo for something before then?

<Title>Important note before buying - iTunes support only for Mac
<Date>Sun Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This product is probably one of the best solid-state MP3 players out there, especially for the price. Though I would like to mention a few drawbacks that aren't readily evident.<p>1. The package does not specify that the player only works with the Macintosh version of iTunes. I use iTunes on my PC as my jukebox software and was frustrated to find that I can only use Rio's proprietary software or Real's application to sync files to the player, both of which are mediocre applications.<p>2. If you are intending on using the provided arm-band, you should know that the player has to be placed in a rubber cradle in order to be attached to the band. The cradle makes the player a bit more bulky and also makes it harder to press the buttons and makes it quite difficult to fit the USB cable into the socket.

<Title>Pretty Slick Little Player
<Date>Tue May 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It's about time I finally found this little guy. Iv'e been waiting for it for some time and finally got one. I'm an avid excersise buff and although I just got it less than a week ago I have few complaints so far. Despite week sounding headphones and crumy radio reception it's been a real joy to use and does not interfere with rigourous physical activity. It's so light you dont even know it's there. I find myself checking that it's still clipped to me from time to time. I loaded basically 33 tunes on the Internal memory provided. The arm band is a bit tight if your an avid weight trainer but I found that I can slide it down below my biceps when running and it rest on my forearm which works well. I'm pretty harsh on portable players so I'm curious how this one will hold up. Maybe I'll write another review down the road. Word of advice: Get a new set of headphone. The Software was easy to load and use. It seems the biggest complaint with this player has been the headphones,Radio reception and Sonic Blue Support. I have not needed to call there support line as of yet (Knock on Wood) so I cant say much about that. I can confirm the headphones and Radio reception issues though but that was not the deciding factor as to why I made this purchase. So far no complaints :) Enjoy this rugged fun little player. Ciao!

<Title>Great player.
<Date>Tue May 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the Rio Sport player for running, and it has never let me down. It's durable, easy to learn, very lightweight, and has helped a lot in keeping me on the trails. The memory storage is perfectly adequate (especially if you're listening to speech, like MP3 ripped Books on Tapes - you can store almost a full days worth of audio!), and getting a whole new play list is a snap. The only down-side I can find is that it doesn't have an AM tuner (FM only); but I figure that's pretty much the minority these days.

<Title>Better than every expectation!!!
<Date>Thu May 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I love this mp3 player.  I read all the reviews and decided that I'd still get it and overcome some of the mishaps encountered by those who posted their reviews.  When I got my Rio and hooked it up to MediaPlayer, I was ready to go.  Very easy to use, very sturdy and durable.  Please ignore any negative feedback you've read on here and purchase this thing.  I run and lift weigts with this and never have I been disappointed.  I actually look at the other people at the gym with their other mp3 players and feel sorry for them - seriously!  It's great.  One recommendation, however, I suggest getting some sweet all whether headphones with some good bass, it makes exercising a lot easier.  Other than that, this unit is all you'll ever need.  So easy to use, I haven't needed to read the manual yet.

<Title>Great product, horrible customer service!
<Date>Sat May 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I wrote a review on this product some time back, with the highest rating.  I would like to retract that rating for one single reason: Customer service is the worst I have EVER encountered for any product.  I know I am not the first to have these thoughts regarding this company.  I will not bore you with the details of my experiences, but I will tell you that I have reported them to the BBB, and have taken the time to write this review, in other words it is that bad.  So bad, that I would not tell any of you to buy this product!  With the competitive market out there I suggest buying another product that does not carry the Sonicblue name.  Heed the warning now, trust me.

<Title>Great Player-2 hints for success
<Date>Sat May 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Heres the deal.  This is a great player if the functions meet your needs. Period.<p>But, do these two things.<br>1.  Save yourself the headache and just use RealOne player for all transfers and keeping your music library.  RealOne Player will walk you through the installing the S35S as a Device.  Its free.<br>2.  Buy a new set of headphones.  When I first upacked the player and started listening with the included headphones I thought the sound was truly bad.  Plugged in some new (old) headphones and viola. Rocks.<p>You will not need tech support, this is plug and play.<p>Enjoy

<Title>Good price for what you get
<Date>Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have had this mp3 player for about a year.  It stores abt 30+ songs for me, which is more than enough for my workouts.  The batteries do run out quickly if you use it fairly often.  It also fits in your jacket pocket or clips onto your front pants pocket, so it's a great travel companion.  Be careful of the keys though, they're fairly sensitive and sometimes you may accidently skip through a song, etc.  It's light and if you use it while you exercise, the arm strap works well.  I would highly recommend this for working out. I have had no complaints and use it daily.  I paid about $... (after the rebate), which wasn't too bad compared to other mp3 players at the time, so I definitely feel that it was worth the price.

<Date>Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is the best Mp3 Player I have had in years.<p>However, buy a new set of headphones. When you get the new headphones you will be very happy! There is nothing wrong with this product at all. I would love to have it louder but I am a sound freak! <p>I upgraded my memory and now I'm up to 8 hours of music. The arm band needed a little more work from Sonicblue, however what I did was I used my Sony Sports armband and replaced that one. In addition, am I the only one who says this, why would the player be red if the company is called Sonic Blue? Good point ??? :) <p>But who cares and marry this player like I have!

<Title>very poor customer service.  Poorly made
<Date>Thu Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Great MP3 player, very poor customer service.  I had to exchange my unit 3x as there were unit defects in the fm tuner and the control buttons.  I was glad that I purchased from a great retailer who made the exchanges as sending the unit to sonic is a nightmare.  (and the shipping is your responsibility). The tech support is in Sri Lanka and their grasp of english is basic at best.  Don't try to ask any questions that may not be on their script.  The U.S. corporate office was little help as well.  I believe that the company(which was bankrupt)was recently taken over and we can hope that a new management team can improve things.  Overall the unit works well, however the FM tuner is poor. There is not much else out there to buy that is similar in design (compact and sporty)so I continued returning my unit till I got a good one.<br>****follow up 3-15-04  Unit is dead again.  Many problems as noted in other reviews.  Support still outsourced.  Skip this and other sonic products.  BUY THE APPLE!!!!!

<Date>Sat Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>My MP3 shorted out for good this morning--after 3 whole months. It never worked well--it always took 3-4 tries to get started. I found it extrememly frustrating to have to stop and start a run several times to get the thing going. I had to change the batteries every several runs--at 1 hour per run, this translates into one battery every 2-3 hours.

<Title>Buyer Beware!  Not worth the price!
<Date>Wed Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This MP3 player does not have the performance for the price you would expect.  I have read many other reviews where people have the same problems as I have.  The thing konks out a lot, and you have to turn it off, take it out of its shell (which is looks like but is NOT a shock absorber) take out the battery and put it back in again.  I dropped it one time and now it has a huge black blotch on the screen.  I wear it on my arm a lot, and if I bump against anything, even lightly, it turns off and starts from the beginning.  My dad gave it to me after he couldn't use it because he wanted to load books on tape onto it and found out it would not pick up where it left off if it was turned off.  The battery doesn't last long at all.  The only advantage is that you can constantly change the songs on the player, but you can do that with any player.  For the price, don't beleive that because it's called 'sport,' that it's durable.  IT IS NOT.  It's a fragile little piece of crap.  I shouldn't complain because it's a gift, but when I found out how much he paid for it I almost had a heart attack.

<Title>My two cents.......
<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I'm amazed that there is such a variety of opinions on this device.  I've had mine for about a year now.  I use it mainly to listen to &quot;books on tape&quot; that I get from my local library and rip in WMA format as the file size is considerably smaller than MP3 format.  I purchased a 256 MB card which is a must for longer books (not enought for some).  I find the device easy to use with decent battery life.  My main complaint is that the text size on the small screen is difficult to see (must be my middle-aged eyes!)

<Title>Radio is useless
<Date>Sun Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The Mp3's play ok, but I found that the backlight actually produces a buzzing noise with the radio. So when you are switching stations, the backlight comes on and you hear a high pitch buzzing sound until the light goes off. I guess that doesn't matter much since the RADIO DOESN'T PICK UP A SINGLE STATION unless you are stading outside in line of sight to a FM radio station antenna. <p>The radio is totally useless in my gym. It won't even pick up the FM broadcast for the TV's in my gym. I'm seling mine. I should have listened to the other reviews that warned about the radio.

<Content>The Good-<p>easy to use, firmware updates go smoothly, easy to upgrade memory and download songs to. I'm overall pleased with the product, was what I had expected. I added a 128 mg memory card and it now holds about 100 songs in wma format.   <p>The Bad-<p>the radio is pointless, it probably would have been a better idea to just market product as a MP3 only player. as noted in many reviews, the radio simply does not work well. I use the player in the gym, occasionally the player will stop and the 'USB connecting' screen will appear on the display. I have no idea why this happens but it gets frustrating. <p>The Ugly-<p>the case, play dial and display screen easily become nicked and scratched. I've had the player for about 6 months and use it for all kinds of activities and have dropped it a few times on the pavement, player still plays but always another nick or scratch. the belt clip piece also nicks into the player b/c it does not cradle the player real tight. Just recently dropped the player and battery cover dislodged, called Rio, would cost $75 to repair.

<Content>I was VERY dissappointed when I drove 60 miles one way to get a mmc memory card for this player, only to find out that the player would not read it.  The quality of Rio brands products has dropped CONSIDERABLY in the past few months.  Their products used to be QUALITY! I own a rio 800 128mb player, a rio 600 64mb player, and a rio volt. All quality construction. But now the new rio brand stuff is cheaply made, not durable in my opinion, and lacking in new features.  Dont even think about trying to get them to service defective items.  Bottom line...pick another brand!

<Title>Great Deal and Great with Mac
<Date>Fri Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is the third mp3 player I have bought in 2 weeks to try and use with my Mac computer. While others claimed to be compatable, this one was far beyond the rest.  I had problems deleting programs from the other two, but with this one it was so easy!! It comes with a itunes CD to upload the program if it is not already on your Mac. You can also download itunes on mac.com for PC's or Mac. This program makes it simple, you simply drag the files into the rio folder that pops up and then arrange them. If you want to delete songs, you click on it and hit delete. That simple. The screen is great, it illuminates vibrant blue and scrolls the song and artist, along with the album. The earphones are alright, the sound is decent, and the size and weight is awesome, it is so small and light and super durable. It also comes with a great belt clip and armband. For around 100 bucks this is a great deal, esspecially if you have a Mac.

<Content>I have had my Rio S35S for a week now and it has exceeded my expectations. The software for managing and uploading the music in easy to use. The sound while not earth shattering is good for the quality of the headphones included. I was able to get 26 songs on the 128 MB internal memory with each song recorded at 128kb MP3 format. That is about 2 hours of listening. I will be purchasing more memory. The player itself is easy to use and works well in a gym environment - working out with weights, aerobics, etc. The radio reception inside a building is terrible and the armband needs to be larger.

<Date>Wed Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this player because I wanted to listen to some tunes while skiing and this player was described as &quot;built to withstand the elements&quot; - WRONG.  The USB connection on this player is not protected at all - not even by the &quot;protective&quot; cover that fits over the unit - forget the snow, all sorts of dirt could build up in this thing.  I thought maybe my unit was missing this part (required in my opinion to make it simply water-resistant) and so I e-mailed tech support and they stated that this &quot;sport&quot; unit does not come with a protective USB cover...therefore I have returned it and bought an MP3 player that comes with a protective cover for it's USB connection.

The CSR said I need a firmware upgrade. Why I don't know.  After she realized my PC had USB 2.0 she said the players do not support USB 2.0.  She suggested I use a friends computer to upload the new firmware and music.  Yeah that is a great idea.  How can they market this as new technology if it doesn't even support USB 2.0. She said they have no plans to support it now.  No remedy for someone who recenlty bought a new PC either.  What service.  The last product I will ever buy from them.  Hope they enjoy Bankruptsy.

It comes with 128 MB but can be upgraded to 512 MB with a firmware download from the sonicblue.com site.  I bought an extra 256MB for $ so just keep looking for good buys.  The radio reception is the only drawback, but chances are you aren't buying this for the radio!  Songs are very easy to download, the sound is terrific, the menu lists the song, artist and time of the song you are listening to and the random play makes it even better.  It's light enough to stay clipped to his nylon running shorts and he hasn't had any problems with the clip as other reviewers mention.  We take it with us everywhere.

It found all of the music on my computer and made it really easy to download to the player. <p>   I read several of the reviews that said the player didn't have a hold button.  I found in the manual that if you hold down the menu botton on top of the player and push the &quot;enter&quot; button on the front of the player it locks the player.  You unlock it the same way.  My cell phone locks and unlocks like this.  It's easy to use and works well.

And at this price, they are nice extras.  The screen gives you a lot of info on the music you are listening to, like time in the song, song name, artist and album, how many tracks you have, battery life, time of day, and volume level.  The rubber outside is nice and easy to handle.  A very good product from Rio.

<Title>Good mp3 player, but prayed that it will never break on you.
<Date>Thu Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Paid $130 here @ Amazon.  Had the S35S for a week now.  Like everyone else, i did a lot of research and settle on this model because of features, price, and memory expandability.  The player is awesome, good sound and LCD menu is easy to navigate.  I mainly use mine for working out at the gym so it get used up regularly.  <p>Things that i don't like are:  the technical support number is not 800.  when i first install the software, i just install the one that they said were &quot;requirement,&quot; mainly their music managnement software.  so i was off downloading songs into my player.  when i finished and tried to close it, the whole program locked up my computer.  turn off, then on...then tried it again...same thing happened.  Repeat the process one more time...same thing, but this time i'm getting blue screen from my Windows XP.  DAMN!  <br>That when i called support, waited around forever for no answer.  So i went online and search for more reviews, found some that had my problems.  and TO FIX IT, you have to install the &quot;recommended&quot; software too.  Pray that you don't have to deal with RIO directly.<p>One other thing that pissed me off about this player is the case.  i don't mind that it doesn't fit well w/ the arm band or it flop around on my arm, but the case doesn't quite fit the player and it's hard as hell trying to put it on and off, my thumb nail is really soared after the first day.  Eventually, the case will leave scratches around your player and start to scrap off the red paint.  <p>All in all, good player...but RIO doesn't give a sh*t about the people who buy their product.  Did they hired any monkeys to test these things out first?

<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  I bought it after doing a fair amount of research.  After seeing all of the gripes about all of the brands I was worried I'd be throwing away $130 and my expectations weren't high.  However, I'm extremely pleased with this model.  I wanted an MP3 player for running and working out at the gym.  The Rio S35S is the right size/weight and the belt clip/plastic holder works perfectly.  (I don't understand why any MP3 player would be made without a belt clip but plenty of expensive models don't have one!)  I found the whole set-up process very intuitive and didn't have to read the instructions/manual much at all.  The FM radio works fine - in fact, the reception is better than the Sony sport radio I used before.  I think this Rio model is great value for the money.  I wouldn't want to spend more than $130 for something like this, and 128K memory is definitely enough for gym workouts, esp. if you use the Windows Media Player format.

<Content>I bought one at Costco, and ended up returning it (thanks to their excellent return policy). Here are my thoughts:<p>1) It's pricey, and for the money the included headphones do not fit well, and fall off in sports activities.<br>2) The battery life is very short.<br>3) The clock/date resets when you change batteries!<br>4) The controls are very easy to accidentally hit in sports activity.<br>5) No crossfading of songs<br>6) The FM radio is difficult to use, and has poor reception.<p>And finally,<br>7) It may look rugged, but despite the fact that it is even in a padded belt clip, falling just 3 feet onto a carpeted floor made it break. Not very good for sports, eh?<p>In short, I cannot recommend this unit for it's intended purpose of a sports mp3 player.<p>A

<Title>Not perfect, but good.
<Date>Sat Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Actual rating is probably 3.5<p>I've had this player for almost 1 year. I also invested in a 256K expansion card. The included software is questionable but I use Windows Media Player which works seamlessly with the unit. (must get software patch from Microsoft). I think that a lot of the negative comments are due to lack of reading the manual (eg: controls lock/unlock via pressing two buttons on unit, not by navigating 10 menu screens). <p>To use the media player either requires having your songs in WMA format or waiting for the software to convert your MP3's to WMA. (it does not permanently convert them but does so as they are transferred to the unit).<p>The complaints about the earphones are valid. I did not like them but some reviewers did. This is a personal thing and you should be prepared to by separate headphones that suit you.<p>The sound is great and the FM radio works OK (although I find that I do not use this feature much). <p>There were a few glitches but nothing that couldn't be worked through. This, like many computer accessories, is not like a toaster that you can just plug in and expect to work. If you are tech challenged, by a cd player.

<Title>Good sound, durable
<Date>Tue Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Contrary to many opinions in here, I think that the S35S is a great mp3 player and great for sports. I'm just going to point some of my experiences.<p>  * The belt clip broke within a few weeks of use. It took me several months of effort, but Rio issued me a new belt clip free of charge.<p>  * The buttons are not easily hit accidentally when involved in sports. In fact, if you hold the Menu + Enter buttons, you can lock the player.<p>  * Have been training for a marathon with this player since I purchased it sometime in the spring. I have sweat all over it and brought it out in the rain many times (I live in Seattle). Still works fine and there isn't so much as condensation on the screen.<p>  * I have dropped, kicked, and banged up the player countless times while either walking around or running. I even managed to separate the two halves of the case (it snapped right back). Still works fine.<p>  * Battery life has been fine using NiMH rechargeables. No experience with other batteries.<p>  The supplied headphones are not great, but what do you expect? Go buy a decent pair of Sony's for $10.<p>  If you're thinking about getting one of the hard drive based mp3 players reconsider if you're planning on using the player for sports. The mechanical systems can be jarred causing skips and, more importantly, they may become damaged. The solid state device technology is what you need if you're active.<p>  My only complaint is that it's difficult to change tracks when in the stopwatch mode since you need to switch back to the player mode. However, switching tracks while running isn't exactly easy either.<p>Cheers

<Content>I am in the process of ordering my second RIO MP3 player.  I accidentally set the first next to an electronic device that seemed to interfere with the MP3 player's abibility to function.  I have been without for about 1 1/2 months.  Miss it a lot!  I thought it was easy to use, highly functional for workouts, and the sound was great.  I would recommend it to anyone who requires music in the workout regimen.  I also have the memory chip which allows for many more hours of music.  Loved it!  Can't wait for the new one to come in.

<Title>Faulty product, Extremely bad customer service.
<Date>Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased a Rio S35S through the RioBlue website last spring. <p>My first one lasted for 2 months before its &quot;system&quot; crashed and the customer service representative (after making me run though several month long hoops) finally said it was unfixable and replaceable. She had a new one shipped out to me after I sent in their faulty product at my own expense.<p>Their customer service correspondance was largely ineffectual and very time-consuming. The entire process took me about half a year to complete, so you can imagine I was quite dismayed when the REPLACEMENT PLAYER I received ALSO CRASHED in the same manner, not two weeks after I received it. <p>This was my worse internet shopping experience to date, and I warn you against dealing with this company and its products.

<Title>My First MP3 Player by Fisher Price
<Date>Tue Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The first question I have the ask the people who gave this POC a favorable rating is where the heck do you work out--the Boca Breeze rec center?  I worked out with my old Nike PSA MP3 player for the past 2 years without incident.  I have pulled 10,000 meter ergs, lifted weights, and run without a hitch.  <p>I tried to strap this thing to my arm and discovered to my chagrin that I had to slide the pathetic band through the clip of the belt attachement.  Now I'm not claiming to have the Guns of Navarone for arms--although they are pretty buff--but my pumpitude soon had the strap straining and the player bobbing around like the ridiculous toy that it is.  <p>I'm not kidding when I say this should be rebranded the Fisher Price My First MP3 Player--the only thing missing are the birds and lambies on the ridiculous red casing.  I'm trading this thing in for a real sports player--the Nike player by Philips.  HEAR ME NOW AND BELIEVE ME LATER, if you wear this thing to the gym, you are going to be laughed at as the puny girlie man you truly are.

<Title>Durability issues?
<Date>Thu Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have had my Rio S35S for about 4 months and use it pretty much strictly for jogging.  It holds anywhere from 15-22 songs, which is fine for me. I use a Mac, and I can't complain about how simple it is to get songs on and off with ease through iTunes.<p>The first thing I noticed when I got this out of the package was how cheap it felt. Compared to my friends Nike player by Phillips, this seemed light and plasticy, rather than rubbery and solid. Whatever, it worked so who cares. Anyway, now four months later, it shuts off on me once and a while, and I have to give it a smack to start it up again.  It could be because it has fallen once or twice while running, but as a "sport" model, it should be designed for a little jarring here and there.  Anyway, I can sense this baby is on its last legs, so I'll be in the market for a new one - not another Rio!  ..., they should build something a little more solid and it should last longer than 4 months!

<Content>The Music on this is great but dont expect to use the radio. The radio doesnt come in well at all so i never use it. You can see the date and time and it is really helpful. Its great for long trips since it can hold over 100 songs. Just get a big memory chip and then you can hold 100 songs. Just take out the songs you dont want and its perfect for you. I know i love it so you should too.

<Title>The best solid-state player on the market
<Date>Mon Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've owned 4 different MP3 players, included one of the fabled Intel Pocket Concerts, and this one has them all beat, hands down.  It has three major advantages over the competition.  First, it can support both MP3 and WMA file formats.  For those of you who may not be familiar, WMA files are roughly half the size of MP3 files of the same quality, which means that you can fit twice as many songs onto a WMA player.  With a cheapo 128 MB Secure Digital card installed, I can easily fit over 200 tracks on this player.  When 512 MB SD cards come down in price, you'll be able to better than double that.  You do have to go to 44Kbps WMA format, but when you're using earbud headphones you won't notice any difference between 44Kbps WMA and 320Kbps MP3 files, since the speaker just isn't up to a fully faithful reproduction.<p>Second, it has a -working- radio.  The big thing the Pocket Concert had going for it was its dual functionality.  I found that the radio in the PC wasn't all that great, the reception was lousy, and the volume level was biased so far that you had to crank the sound all the way up to hear anything.  Then, when you switched back to MP3s, you'd deafen yourself by mistake.  That's not an issue here.  This radio, while not perfect, works pretty well, and the volume levels are the same across both formats.<p>Third, this player is very speedy.  Files copy very quickly.  This player isn't USB 2.0, but with the latest firmware you can dump a song on in around 15 seconds, much faster than most models I've had in the past.  Songs also advance quickly, meaning you can skip past a song without a 5 second pause while the player looks for the next track.<p>On top of all this, you have all the advantages solid state players have over hard drive based designs like the iPod- enhanced durability, small size (this thing is about the size of a flattened walnut), light weight, lower power consumption (1 AAA battery will last you around 8 hours, I've found) and real sport functionality.  I can have this player in my pocket while running and forget it's there, which is great for people who don't like to be encumbered with things in their hands or strapped to their arms.<p>Still, the design isn't perfect.  If I had to nitpick, I'd mention that there ought to be an actual "hold" button instead of having to press the enter and menu buttons simultaneously.  The play/stop/forward/back buttons should be seperate as well instead of the large white directional toggle in the center.  It's easy to hit the wrong direction by mistake.  Lastly, there's no good way to shuffle through your entire library quickly.  If you're on song 1 and want to get to song 100 out of 200, you need to skip through all the intervening songs manually.  A scroll wheel would be nice in this situation, akin to the Pocket Concert's.  Still, all things considered, this is a great player, and a real step forward for the industry.  We haven't arrived at the perfect player yet, but we're getting close.

<Title>Doesn't Last Long
<Date>Mon Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got my Rio Sport for Christmas last year. I liked it a lot at first. It was very easy to use and held a lot of music. After only two months of using my MP3 player, it broke into two pieces. It still worked a little, but i counldnt get the battery out because it was jammed. When the battery ran out, I decided to call Rio. <p>After three phone calls and waiting on hold forever, I finally got through. After an hour of explaining what happened, they finally told me to mail my player back for a replacement. I did, and one month later I received a 64MB MP3 player instead of the 128MB MP3 player I had sent in and paid for. I needed it for jogging, though, so I decided to keep it. My new one has also recently broken. <p>The sport MP3 players are not durable enough to last through much, except perhaps walking. My advice would be to get a different MP3 player.

<Content>I have bought 2 products from Rio. The first (Rio 500) used to go dead every few months and I had to send it back for refurnishing. The second, Rio 800 138 MB just made a humming noise. Customer service? No answer to 6 e-mails. I tried calling. First, false information provided (deliverately?): just download the firmware and it will work. Then, they mock you: just send us the details and proof of purchase and we will replace. They do not (two attemps). Never, never buy anything from this manufacture or trust it.

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Thu Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is an excellant portable mp3 player!!  The headphones are ok but I found them to be a little big and loose.  The radio is ok with good reception on some stations.  The software is incredibly easy to use, it takes about 5 minutes to install depending on how fast your computer is.  When you want to put a song on the player all you do is check the box with the song title in it and hit transfer.  The backlight on the product is really bright and can be set to stay on for certain amounts of time.  The amplifer is powerful and loud.  If you want a portable mp3 player that's easy to use and won't make you broke this is the one.

<Date>Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This unit is the best audio device I have ever owned.  It is rugged, compact yet easy to use, and stylish.  I like that I can add SD and MMC memory cards to hold more music.  This lets me create mixes and store them without having to erase the unit everytime I want to change music.  The earphones are extremely comfortable, and the sound quality is top-rate.  The belt clip and arm band make this unit an excellent workout partner.  Downloading music to the Rio is easy and fast, and thanks to special drivers availabe from Microsoft at no charge, I can use Windows Media Player to organize and copy music to the device.  It also comes with Rio Music Manager, if you prefer.  The unit can handle MP3 and WMA files.  I find WMA files to be just as high quality, but smaller in size, so I can fit more music in the unit.  Other options include an FM tuner, Stopwatch, and flexible settings for sound quality.  At this price, there is no other option.  Buy this device!!  You will be satisfied.

<Date>Sun Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>A friend of mine and I both bought this product. The radio does not work and the headphones slip out of your ears if you happen to sweat when you workout. My friend and I both use ours for running Once it started to rain and mine got wet and it started jumping from song to song and then just shut down. After it dried out it worked again but just recently I was running and it just died again.This time it keeps looking for the USB port and I cannot change the display or get it to work at all.<br>My friends display is broken and it now looks like a creased line through the middle. She can no longer view the menu. She is in the process of working with customer service and it has been a total nightmare. She called and got an RMA number and sent it in with the RMA number. One week later she received it back in the mail with a note that she needs an RMA number!!<br>This product only seems to last about 6 months and is definitely not for anyone active! I would NEVER buy from Rio again!

<Date>Fri Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Bought an S35S in Feb 03.  Love the MP3, though radio reception is poor compared to other armband radios on the market I've used.  The fancy display is a waste as you can't see it on your arm.  Controls are not as good as the Nike.  But, I went through 3 Nike's rather quickly - they didn't take to running and sweat so well.  I use an armband 2 hours daily for running / exercise.  The Rio headphones wire broke quick and I replaced it with a good set of waterproof kind.  In July the MP# player started pausing by itself or dropping to the menu or even off.  Rio customer assistance told me to update the firmware which I did - to no avail.  Guess I'm out of luck again.  Will someone please make a quality armband mp3/radio for running!

<Date>Thu Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this last week looking for a rugged player.  I read the reviews here and saw some people say it stunk some people said it was great.  The first time i used it i was thrilled!  And thought the nay-sayers were idiots.  Well, after about 3 hours use it started to sound like an old walkman on low batteries.  You know, &quot;I got one hand in my pooccckkkeeettt annddd thheee ottther one haling a taxi cab&quot;.  Not only that but whenever the volume was at 25 or higher it randomly pauses!  Also, the casing is incredably cheap.  Anyway, I took it back to bestbuy (where i got it) and but the Creative Labax muavo nx 128.  So far, I highly recommened it over this product, even though you gotta pay more.  and oh yeah, ALWAYS buy extended warrantines on ANY mp3 player :)

<Title>Not bad, but not great either: a runner's point of view
<Date>Fri Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This product has been serving me well, though it is not perfect. The sound is fine and I love the expandability. With a relatively inexpensive 256 mb sd card I have more than enough space for my long runs (without having to convert my mp3s to a lower bit rate). The ear buds don't fit perfectly or sound fantastic, but they are adequate and stay put while running (e.g., during a 3 hour run I might re-secure them once or twice).<p>The physical quality is not that great. I am on my second unit (the menu button broke on the first one). To Rio's credit, getting the unit replaced was simple and painless. I dropped my second unit on a dirt road from about 3 feet and it popped apart. I was able to snap it back together but was not able to get it perfectly reassembled.<p>The controls are not well designed for runners who would like to skip ahead or repeat songs in the play list. It uses one circular pad for 4 controls: imagining a clock, press 12 o'clock for play/pause; 3 = forward; 6 = stop; and 9 = back). The layout is intuitive, but it is very easy to hit the wrong control while you are running (e.g., press at the 2 o'clock spot and you may get pause OR forward). Furthermore, it is easy to unintentionally hit the large pad while trying to adjust the volume. It would be much better if they used 4 separate buttons that were a little less sensitive (but I guess that would increase the cost a little). The controls can be locked by pressing menu and enter at the same time. Although this will prevent you from unintentionally hitting the controls while running, it is not useful if you want to make adjustments while you run. This has been a minor annoyance rather than a major problem. Most of the time I hit play, start running, and never touch it again.<p>The Rio does not currently support the ACC (MEPG-4) audio format, which means that users who buy music from the Apple music store or otherwise use the ACC format are out of luck for now. However, since the Rio is flash-upgradable, it is possible that it will be supported in the future. When I inquired with Rio about their plans to support the new format I got the useless response that, &quot;The Rio S35S supports MP3 and WMA file formats,&quot; which, of course, I already knew. They totally avoided my question and my follow up inquires have been ignored.<p>Pros:<br>- sounds pretty good<br>- expandability<br>- clips to running shorts or arm band<p>Cons:<br>- not very rugged<br>- poorly designed controls for runners<br>- does not support ACC files

I already had iTunes on my computer and when I went through the install process all of the music that I already had in my iTunes was still there and ready to go! I use my Rio while working out at the gym and running outside.  I have absolutely no complaints at all about this player. It sounds great, looks great, and is very functional.  I saw that some people were complaining about the earphones but I don't have any problems with them. They are small pods that fit into your ears with a tube that curls around the ear to secure it.   At first I thought it would be uncomfortable for me because I have very small ears but they don't bother me at all. The sound quality is not bad either. Also, I read some complaints about the Rio not having a lock or hold. Not true! You have to read the directions. BUY THIS PLAYER!!!

Use JetAudio, a media player for cpu, to convert the file types. if you add a 256 sandisc to the rio you can hold up to 123 high quality (96k cd quality) wmas.

<Content>Well, I researched MP3 players online and felt that this one was the best comprimise between price, weight, and storage capacity.  I liked the set up and ease of uploading songs too.<p>The problems!  It stopped working on day 3 of using it!  It was powering off in the middle of songs or when a button (volume, menu, etc.) was pushed.  The online support said to fix this:  download the latest firmware (ok, did that), and if it still 'locks up', reset the player by turning it off, taking the battery out, putting the battery back in, and turnin it back on!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  Real technical solution.  Well I had to do that every time I wanted to skip songs or change volume.  Then it just quit powering on all together!<p>I plan on getting another brand of MP3 player around 128MB built in with expandability or a Mini Disk player.  Taking it back to Best Buy!  My single experience with Rio has been bad, and for that price, it is not acceptable, so I am changing brands!
