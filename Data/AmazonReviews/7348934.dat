<Content>This mp3 was a very good purchase for someone just getting into these type products. It is reliable and functional. Good for take along music. Not good for books. Wonderful for kids and teenagers who want portable music. I really like it.

<Content>It arrived on time.  Worked well for a short period of time.  I purchased the product in july 06.  I used it for about 2 to 3 months and then stopped.  I went to use the product again a few weeks ago and the product didn't work anymore.   I wrote the review above in April 2007.  Just in case anyone needs any more information.  It is a cheap products which looks better online than in person.  It is not ugly by any means.  The products holds about 100 songs or so, it is not very user friendly.  If you want something to use occasionaly then this may be a decent starter if you do not have the funds for a better mp3 player.  It is small but there is not a carrier for it and it is not the size or shape of most mp3 players.   If you can do without it until you can save up for an Ipod or another mp3 player then do so.
