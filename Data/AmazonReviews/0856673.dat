<Title>Perfect for Audiobooks
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been in search of a perfect MP3 player for audiobooks.  I started with Cowon U2, great but lost it, bought Philips GoGear whose bookmark function only worked for music, not audiobooks so I had to start from scratch each time - gave it away, and Creative Zen V+, under the impression that was one of a few in the market whose bookmark function worked for audiobooks.  The last product, Zen V+'s bookmark worked only 10% of what I had hoped for.  Once you store in bookmark, it will lose tracks, which means if you put a bookmark in the middle of track 11 out of 40 tracks and start listening to where you left off, it will not continue to track 12 after track 11 completes.  I thought I could live with this limitation, but as a former Cowon U2 owner with which I had no bookmark problems, I couldn't help but try Cowon U3 and finally, it worked!  I can bookmark anywhere anytime without losing tracks.  I don't know why other products cannot provide such technology when Cowon could.  If you use your MP3 player for music only, aforementioned problems might not get in your way, but if you are an audiobook listener, just go for Cowon U series and your agony will end then.

<Title>Buy this over an iPod, or any other mp3 player.
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This mp3 player is awesome. Completely leaves the iPod nano in the dust. It plays music, videos; it even saves regular files if you need to have access from the office to home. I gave my daughter the iPod nano as a gift and she's always having problems, having to upgrade the software, the songs get lost in the software and she has to charge it every night, these problems don't exist with the iAudio. There's no software needed, it's plug and play, and I charge it only once a week. Once I bought it for myself, my husband wanted to one too. Now, we've both had ours for about a year and we're still very happy.

<Title>NOT the aural equal of the Ipod
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Contrary to what is said here, the iaudio products DO NOT have the digital to analog/amplification quality that the Ipods have.  I am a sound engineer with golden ears, and I am very critical of quality.  I was not impressed with the circuitry of the Cowon products.  The Ipods are still the finest I have ever heard.  Stick with apple, and use a proper music format for the finest quality.

<Title>Honest Review, 3 Years of Experience w/ Cowon
<Date>Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The U3 is not only the best player for the dollar, it is the best player out.  iPod fans, you are all oblivious and ignorant.  I'm sorry to say it, but you all knew what the iPod was before you knew what a mp3 player was and even afterwards you still didn't realize that the iPod is a mp3 player...just a stript down, simplistic,  Any player is better than an iPod other than the cheap mp3 players found in convenient stores like walgreens or cvs.    Pros - There are too many for me to go over, and everyone already mentioned most of the obvious, so I'll just name the greatest reasons and unmentioned/overlooked reasons that set this apart from the others.  -Sound Quality   --the 60Mw of power plus the jetaudio bass, equalizer, bbe, etc...makes the music/audio sound the better than other players.  You can really put the volume up high and it will be clear with the right settings. Far louder than some other players.  -Flash Drive/USB/Direct File Transfer/text reader   --no hassles. throw mp3s right on it fast, without any stupid programs like some others require like itunes(tss, i get so angry about the sleazy  marketing/business tactics they the other get away with). again, plug it into the computer, and drag and drop. then you can disconnect it and start listening to the muany computer files, like your excel sheets, word documents, txt files, programs, movies, anything from computer to computer.  Make sure to get an extra keychain usb adapter!  -Controls   --The little joystick on this thing is great. You can be running, lifting at the gym, laying down...and be able to change the track, volume, and pause, without taking the player out of your pocket.  -The voice recorder   --AWESOME. for all the reasons a voice recorder is. easy to use. you can record and listen to what you recorded right away.  record yourself   or your buddies freestyling or singing.  Have an instrumental playing in the back or karaoke, and record away, make your own just for fun songs.  do some private investigating, eavesdrop on people, catch your friends saying stupid things without them knowing, just use your imagination; a tiny recorder disguised as a mp3 player can be very handy/useful. i would buy this alone for just the great voice recorder it has.  (keep in mind, in many stupid states, it is illegal to record people without their permission...dumb hypocritical and crooked law, and oh ya, its fine to video tape though.)   -other features   --to make it clear, and again, this thing is so packed with useful and great features.  for example, all the formats it plays, .mp3, .wma, flac, .ogg, etc.  It has a RADIO, and LINE-IN functions.  The recording here works great too. Alarm Clock, Auto shut-off, Sleep, etc...  CONS   -Customer Service   --it's a shame this great product couldn't be better represented by its customer service. They don't believe in phones. And the turnaround wait for getting your player fixed or replaced sucks (same with most things you order but life without a mp3 player when your used to using it all day every day sucks.    Durability   --There is a better chance that you would want, that something will go wrong with your player within the first year. And it might happen more than once, whether, its the audio cuts out if you wiggle the headphone jack the wrong way cause something broke inside. Happened to me twice. Once, was sort of my fault for accidentally snagging the cord out of the unit once too many times or one bad time.  This causes the audio to only work out of one side of your headphones. Happens too easily in my opinion. Some part of the design or construction inside the unit is poor.  The screen can be broken easily by not even putting too much weight on it, like if its in your jacket pocket and you happen to barely sit on it. Also happened with me.  And there is a small chance of getting a faulty or defective one sent to you.  *I want to make clear though, that all this things are very possible with other players as well, just perhaps slightly better chance of happening with these players...Maybe because they are so complex inside or the quality of the components or design is not as great since this thing is so capable of doing so many things.  The software is also something that may crash or be defective, in which you would have to reinstall it.  Video  --The screen isn't that big but so what.  It's clear and does have good picture.  However, you do need to convert your movie or video clip with the program that is provided. And the audio and video may not matchup perfectly as there may be a delay.  Still serves more than its purpose for showing people homemade videos, or funny video clips, music videos,etc.  But then again....this is a primarily a music player.  Not a TV.  LYRICS  --It says you can read lyrics to the songs that are playing and that would be great. but i think this might be a lie because i've been able learn how to do everything else this player can do except for the lyrics. it doesn't work.  so what.    EARPHONES  --The earphones it comes with are average.  If you really love to enjoy music and want to take advantage of what this player can really make the music sound like....get a good pair of headphones.     OVERALL  Between the Iaudio 5, and then the big step up to U3...Cowon has made the best mp3 player products for the past 3 years.  Despite the customer service, and durability.  They do honor the 1 year warranty.  The battery life is good too.  The seem to last longer than the batteries in iPods, which also have a 1 year warranty but it's funny how their batteries seem to only last about that long or a maybe a year and a half then you need a new one which costs big $$$.  A little less costly when it comes to cowon and again they seems to last longer.    MORE IMPORTANT INFO  --I would like to say, is if you have illegally downloaded music, this player wont give you problems like ipod as it forces you to use itunes which again, is soooo dumb and unnecessary.  And, if you would like to be able to get songs from your friends computers or share yours, you can quick and easy. Forget about it if you have iPod, unless they have it too and have itunes installed.   Despite the cons, I'll take a U3 that is 100% over any other player on the market.  It is the best player. All this is coming from an EXPERT. Thank you and may the consumer buying force be with you. Don't do what everyone else does as they are dumb cattle herded through the system to something other than they would like in the end.

<Title>My favorite MP3 player - two years of use!
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had MP3 players dating back to the early Diamond Rio's and RCA Lyra's.   I've had iPods and just about everything else.  But the iAudio players are my favorites because they have the best compination of cool high-tech looking design (for those of us tired of the cold sterility of iPod designs), simplicity (you'll never have to open the book) and versatility that I've seen.    This little device works great both as a MP3 player and as a USB drive for general storage.  It's tiny and it sounds great.  It charges easily off any PC, and the battery lasts a long time, even after two years (it will probably start getting worse in the third year and beyond like most L-ion batteries).    The ear buds aren't great, but all ear buds are weak by design anyway.  They're no better or worse than anyone else's.  It's a compromise you have to make for the portability of them.  I prefer the noise cancelling on-ear phones that I bought from Bose.  But that's neither here nor there for the iAudio itself, so it doesn't affect the rating.  In short, if you want something easy to use and very functional, this is your best choice.  It doesn't have the iPod brand name "cool factor", but it's a superior product in all ways.
