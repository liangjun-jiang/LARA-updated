<Title>it can't be better!
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got one! it's just awesome on video playback, awesome! my friend insist that i should compare it with PSP, but here is my point: it's about two third thickness of old 60G, and it has 2.5 inch screen, it play awesome video. what else you want from an iPod?! To be honest, I gotta say that the video playback even clearer than most computer screen. No block at all!  But there are several thing to remind you, there is no POWER Adapter in case, and they trade off a like-leather case. check the size of the new iPod, i don't think any solid old iPod case fits perfectly.  New iPod has screen lock function, like chubb lock. that's interesting! Since i just got it less than 2 hours, i can't give more information about the battery or other new functions. But, no doubt, it fullfills me really well. Take it, it will never turn you down!

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my fourth iPod and definitely my favorite, it's a great player and I love the ability to be able to watch videos.  I'm not bothered by the fact that they left out the charger block as I already have two, plus you don't really need one.  For everyone who is considering getting on or already has one and doesn't know how to convert video to it here's a short guide (assuming you already have video on your computer, from wherever).  Ok, very easy, the PSP uses the exact same video format so use google to find a PSP video converter and make your video 320x240 and either 512 or 384 kbps.  Use mp3 audio at 96 or 64 kbps.  This will make video about 200mb per hour plus it looks great on the iPod.

<Title>Great player, hard to find Accessories
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my 60GB model through the Apple website along with some accessories.  This was my first iPod purchase and I am very happy with the unit and how easy it was to load it with my mp3 library.  The unit is small elegant and packed with features.  However, I was disappointed to find no AC charger included (I had wanted to use one in my office and the IT folks won't allow me to load the software to use the USB cable).  I was also disappointed to find out I could not easily find a case for this model (hopefully they will be available soon).  The biggest disappointment was that many of the accessories for previous models (including FM transmitters) are incompatible with this model since there is only a headphone jack and no charging jack on the top.  I'm sure the after market guys will soon develop more accessories, but it is frustrating to own the flagship model and not be able to use it in the same manner as people who own less expensive or older models.

<Title>Solid if not spectacular
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Had for almost a week now. Solid (first) attempt at place- and time-shifting video programming. Video color screen is vivid and rich. 60GB of storage is more than abundant (I honestly think 30GB will suffice for most users). Using my iBook, I'm able to convert full-length 8GB DVDs of movies into 600MB MPEG4's for "downtime" viewing (e.g., commute, slacking off during lectures or meetings) on my iPod using a free downloadable (Apple-only) program called HandBrake (available at versiontracker dot com) (this process takes 4-6 hours, and is something you start before going to bed....in the morning, just load the finished product onto your iPod as you would music files). Much more elegant and not as bulky or expensive as other portable video players, although not as flexible in terms of content sources either (see Archos' player).  No mechanical or cosmetic problems yet (see iPod Nano). Video capabilities would be better served if screen utilized more real estate (i.e., make it widescreen; but I suspect that's a technical limitation at present). Comes with USB cord, software CD, and earbuds, but no AC or desktop charger. Limited 5G iPod 3rd-party accessories at present.

<Title>Great product but can still improve a little
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just picked this up yesterday because my mini's 4Gb just wasn't enough anymore. The new color screen is extremely sharp, just like looking at my LCD monitor. I love being able to watch my favorite music videos on it although iTunes didn't have my favorite, Stacy's Mom. But I'm sure their video library will expand every Tuesday just like their music. It's also a nice feature to be able to download TV shows from ABC to watch at my convenience. But once again, the selection will need to improve on that one as well. I've only had it for one day and I bought a leather case with it but even the case made for it has already started to scratch the glossy black surface. So I'm disappointed with that. The operation of the clickwheel is slightly different than my iPod mini. When I'm scrolling through artists, songs, etc., it will scroll at normal speed and then jump maybe 4 times faster than normal so you're going from Aerosmith to Pink Floyd and the next thing you know you're looking at ZZ Top. On paper the feature probably sounded like a good idea but in reality it's just annoying and as far as I can tell, it's not an option that can be turned off. Overall I'm still very happy with it and highly recommend it.

<Title>pretty much a cynical rip off for the money
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this video unit very swiftly followed on the heels of the photo ipod which clearly was aimed at maximising sales for folks who wanted to put digital photos/power point presentations etc on an ipod, presenting them with another three-four hundred photo/video unit after they'd just bought a threee-four hundred dollar unit. After barely three months the photo ipod is now effectively discontinued and being discounted. I initially got a 60 GB photo which I discovered is incompatible - its just too thick for the docking station -  with the new Altec Lansing IM 7 - after establishing said incompatibility with Apple (obviously Altec's fault - not Apple's) I discovered that the new 60GB (slightly thinner) video was just about to be launched so I swapped my photo for a video only to discover Apples cynical exploitation continues. I was very unimpressed with the video ipod, the screen would have scratched very quickly and does according to many reviews, unlike the photo which happily is more durable, there was no mains adapter, none of the peripherals I have like iTalk work, you have to buy the new universal dock at fourty dollars a pop to make some features work. The better (20 hours) battery life is only for the 60GB, another deliberate cynical ploy. The video/battery capability is seemingly  pretty limited as regards watching films longer than 100 mins or so. I dont really see the point of watching vacuous mtveee type music videos on such a small unit - but each to their own. As for the limited TV series drivel currently on the itunes PPV web site, enoough said!!   I originally had a 4th gen 40GB which was big enough for my 5000+ songs. Each time they update the ipod they take something away from the package. This time with the video they've taken virtually everything away, no dock, no adapter, no peripherals, and added the crappiest thinnest case you could imagine which wont really protect the unit long term. Unless very small screen video is really tremendously important to you and you're happy spending two dollars on each music video/populist tv shows thus far offered buy the photo ipod and save fifty dollars and get a much better deal with a screen that will not scratch so easily and wont be such a problem even if it does scratch up a bit. I use mine exclusively as a music/audio player and now have a second photo ipod after swapping out my new vidoe player. I found the video player took thirty mins or so longer to download the exact same number of songs that my photo ipods took.  And I can still record speech/memos etc on my ipod, use an fm transmitter on the car stereo. Its funny how generally speaking the media just lap up whatever apple do and never seem to criticise the (to me) cynical plethora of products, many of which if you have a reasonable music collection are worthless, 1GB or less of music recorded at at least 192kbs to ensure reasonable play back sound is to me a waste of money and effort. If you buy decent headphones - at the very least Shure E3's or better, owning a 60 GB ipod is an expensive toy. Doubtless Apple will sooner or later launch yet another expensive video ipod update, presumably enough folks will want the kudos of having the latest model so Apple's profits will continue. Hopefully if this cynical product exploitation continues increasingly folks will begin to see through this creeping corporate cynicism. I make this observation as a free market loving Republican. I suppose as a proud non gamer and older geezer, with nothing but contempt for the vacuous mtveee and its ilk this product is not really aimed at me.  My music ipod is still by far and away the finest and most cherished toy I have ever owned.

<Title>Converting Video to 5G iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Don't let any of the reviews about difficulty of video conversion dissuade you. I found an app off of download.com called SUPER (freeware) that perfectly encodes videos of virtually any format for the new iPod. It's fairly quick, though CPU intensive. For the most recent version of the program, check out  http://fever.link.free.fr/SUPER.html#Dnload. Don't spend money for Quicktime Pro when better (and free) alternatives exist. Oh yeah...get yourself a new iPod in black. Sexy as hell. I'm the first of my friends to get one, and everyone is jealous.

<Title>APPLE IS AMAZING
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple has done it again with the new 60GB ipod video. This unit is beyond amazing because not only have they improved upon the size, color, function, and battery life of ipod, but what is great about this thing is that it plays VIDEO. The picture quality is crisp and clear, and so far, my only gripe is that the unit scratches too easily. I'm still waiting for a case that doesnt suck. Also, the fact that there is no AC adaptor that comes packaged with the unit should be a crime. But despite these gripes, its still the best music player out there, and now it plays video.

<Title>Awesome!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Can't mess with Apple!  For $400, you get 60GB, a beautiful screen, and a cool black design.  As always, the major gripes are with the cheap earbuds and lack of early accessory support.  You do get a case with it now, a thin slip-on deal that does make it easier to put the iPod in a pocket or briefcase without scratching.  I would disagree with people who don't like the accelerated wheel scrolling.  At just over 30GB on mine, scrolling through the artists or albums would take a long time one-by-one.  The acceleration is fairly intuitive once you get used to it.  The screen is big and clear.  I seriously doubt anyone would watch movies on it, but I can see downloading news and half-hour shows to watch while on a Stairmaster or riding the train.  At this point, you're on your own for video content unless you're a Disney lemming.

<Title>Yes I Have This One, & With VIDEO, Now It's Worth It!
<Date>Fri Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got mine alittle over a week ago directly from Apple.  (Sorry Amazon, but it's the same price, + free laser engraving & shipping)  I HAD bought the iPod 60GB photo for about a week, but as soon as I saw these new ones coming out, I sold the photo on ebay and bought the 60GB video in black.  I got the new one for 3 main reasons:  1: The iPod is finally in BLACK!  2: It's thinner = more portability.  3: Yes, it plays video.  Now these reasons are listed in order.  I didn't get this new one just for the video.  I got it as a music player first and a video player second (or third).         First off, since it's the new feature, lets talk about the video.  The video quality is excellent!  (considering that the screen is only 320x240 pixel)  I say this from putting my OWN videos on it, meaning videos that weren't downloaded from iTunes.  $1.99 isn't too bad a price for a music video or an episode of a TV series, but at the same time, most of the music videos and TV series episodes they offer aren't everybodies can of beer!  (I don't care for Lost and especially Desperate Housewives...unless the 4 women did the show nude!)  All I did was rip the DVD of a TV series or whatever I want, then transcode it into a format that the ipod can read, and Presto!  Now I know while your reading this your thinking, "If I get this iPod, how can I put my favorite stuff on it the way this guy is talking about?"  No problem, I'll tell you!         First, if you want to get a movie or a TV show off a DVD, chances are it's probably CSS encrypted.  (Pretty much any movie or TV series DVD you buy at any store)  To rip these type of DVD's into a video file, you'll have to get a DVD ripping program that can decrypt CSS.  You can find a number of them online for free or cost alittle $ to download.  My experience, most of the freeware ones can't rip any decent quality video, so you'll probably have to shell out afew bucks to get a decent one.  I had already downloaded one called AoA DVD Ripper afew months ago for about $25 or $30.  (Do a google or yahoo search to find the site)  It does a really good job of ripping the DVD's and the video/audio quality is great.  (Especially using the DivX 6 codec)  Next, you'll need to transcode the video file into a format the ipod can read.  (Go to apple's website for video specifications)  I already had Quicktime 7 Pro, which comes with a setting to save videos it can open to the proper format.  I tried using it; it took an hour just to convert 5% of the video!  It was only a 22 minute video!  WAY TOO LONG A CONVERSION TIME!  (would have taken almost a day!)  So I went searching online for another program that would do this faster.  I found a freeware program called Videora iPod Converter.  (Again, do a Yahoo search to find the download site)  It comes with a number of options and it does a great (and fast) job of converting the video to the right format.  TIP: When using this program, ONLY certain video settings can be used for the converted video to work on the ipod.  Check the forum of the website you download this program from to see what other settings people have tried to get it working.  It may seem like a lot of trouble, but if you want to be able to watch certain videos, it isn't that bad once you get everything set up.  (It only took me a total of 30 minutes to put an episode of Chappelle Show on my iPod using the process I described above!)      Now that the video is out of the way...The sound of the ipod is excellent.  I read somewhere that they also fixed 3 minor sound bugs that were present in the earlier versions of iPod.  (Another bonus)  Overall, there isn't too much more new about the new ipod besides what I talked about.  One drawback that people have mentioned, but hasn't affected me; the 4 prong connection that was on top next to the headphone jack is gone.  So if you already have ipod accessories that use them, tough luck, they won't work on the new one.  They'll be coming out with accessories to replace the older ones sometime though that exclusively use the dock connector on the bottom.  (Already have in some cases)  Also, if you don't like using iTunes to transfer music to your iPod, there's a program out there called Anapod made by Red Chair Software.  It integrates into Windows Explorer and just drag and drop!  Has a lot of cool/handy features, and they just put a new version out that supports the new ipod!  (Namely transferring video)  It costs about $25 -$30 depending on which version you get.  Well worth it though, I think.  Hope this review helped you out!

<Title>Ipod
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My ipod changed my life.lol  Im in the navy, so everything has to be compact.  No more carrying around CD's DVD's TV's etc.  Now it is all in one place.  I can watch movies in my rack now without a bulky laptop.  The picture is so crystal clear.  i fought the hype for a while by buying a creative, a gigabeat, a lyra.  They cannot compare by far.  Having an ipod is like belonging to a club.  Trust what ever you want a mp3 player to do the ipod does.  A little advice though, learn how to use itunes fully.  People at work are always asking me to hook their ipod up like mines.  Itunes is simple.  It will organize all your stuff for you if you take the time to learn how.  Fyi don't buy that 100 dolar cable to hook your ipod up to your tv.  Just go to walmart or somewhere and get a 20 dolar cable that plugs into your headphone jack and converts to audio and video rca's.  Normally these cables are for digital cameras/cams.

<Title>One of the greatest devices ever w/ a couple of pleasant surprises.
<Date>Mon Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all I've owned this 60 GB 5th gen Ipod for over a year now and it's been a blast to own. I often tell people that if it were any more versatile that I'd consciously use it in my sleep :). During the time that I've owned it it has been a snap to operate. ITunes is very easy to browse through and buying and transferring new songs to your IPod likewise is a snap (you can make $$$ disappear really quick while browsing ITunes :)).     So far it's held up remarkably well I have my IPod in a simple case and I've dropped it a million times and thankfully it hasn't given me any problems. The worst was when I accidentally dropped it into a bucket of water I freaked out (naturally when you pay as much for something like this) the rest of the day it didn't work and I was bummed and thought I'd have to send it in, but remarkably the next day it worked again :). So in closing this is one of greatest devices ever is quite durable, worth the money, saves you the risk of sifting through 10 million CDs while driving, and is among one of my most valued possessions as in if I lost it I know I'd have to have another ASAP. After owning this wonderful device it's no wonder that there is so much competition trying to compete for a slice of the Apple pie.

<Title>The care needed for this amazing device
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After purchasing the Apple iPod Black 60GB last September 2005, I noticed that once the clear seal which protects the screen and iPod wheel was taken out, I found the surface to be very sensitive. The surface is succeptible to scatches easily. If you are planning to own this device, I suggest that you purchase adhesive plastic cover or iPod skin to protect your investment. Other than that, the iPod 60GB is an amazing device that can fit approximately 20,000 songs depending on track lengths and MB size.   Looking for new music? iTunes, the desktop companion to the iPod, offers one or two free songs every Monday online. Want Podcasts on your favorite topics? No problem, just use iTunes search engine to see if it's available in the iTunes website.   Planning on using your iPod during long drives? Purchase the iPod iTrip which easily fits underneath your 60GB player. Look for a clear station on your car stereo and start dancing or singing away!

<Title>Best iPod Ever
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my 60GB Video iPod- there's plenty of storage room with all my music, photos, videos and room left over to backup my data.  If you look at the price per Gigabyte, this is without a doubt the most cost-effective iPod model. The Battery lasts for hours upon hours when playing music and still for several hours when watching video. I love the fact that I can hook this up to my TV with a video cable and watch my video on the big screen. It also works great when coupled with the dock and remote, before the Apple TV, this was the best way to watch my iTunes movies and videos on the big-screen from my sofa.   The iTunes software works great for managing all my media and the sync process is easy and fast with the USB 2.0. Just plug it in and go. I was really surprised at how clear the video screen was - yes it is small, but it's fine for occasional viewing such as when on a trip. Made my 8 hour overseas flight much more enjoyable. I also bought an iPod compatible stereo for my car and now I rarely use anything else. Great for podcasts and audio books, especially for long commutes.  Oh yeah, and last but not least- it's absolutely gorgeous.

So, first things first, I recommend searching for a smaller-sized model if you don't have a very large collection.  I have owned a 5th gen 60 GB iPod video for almost a year now and felt that it was a good time to write a review about it.  I've read reviews from people who have complained about their iPod breaking and freezing, and I have my own input regarding this.  One of the abilities of the iPod is to play videos.  The iPod will only play .mp4, .m4v, and .mov format videos, so be careful!  iTunes DOES take care of converting videos for use with an iPod, but I'm not reviewing iTunes.  Assuming you've converted your home movies for the iPod and have downloaded the latest season of your favorite TV show, it's now time to put it onto your iPod.  Once you've got it sitting nicely on the 60 GB hard drive, you can access it in the menus and begin to watch.  On a fully charged iPod, video playback is noted at up to 3 hours, and I've found no problem with this, though over time that length might decrease just like most electronic products over time.  The video quality is superb on iTunes purchased movies and shows and the audio quality for those shows is just as good.  With your own movies, it can be a different story.  Basically you just need to make sure that the audio quality is good enough and the video resolution is good enough for the iPod.  If you've succeeded in those two areas then the video should view GREAT!  I have found that, over time, my iPod was filling up with shows and movies and I had little room to store other new videos.  I would recommend regularly updating your iPod.  This means that once you've watched a movie, if you have no future plans to watch it again, delete it off of your iPod.  This way you can always save space for videos you may want to put on your iPod in the future.  But remember: ALWAYS make sure to keep a "hard copy" of the video on your computer.  Otherwise you may find yourself an unhappy camper.  Music has always been the main focus for the iPods ever since day one.  My music has always worked GREAT on my iPod and I've never been failed.  Many people have complained about the lack of an option to use alternative audio formats with the iPod.  Unless you're looking to put all .wma files on your iPod, you won't be disappointed.  The iPod works well with most usual audio formats.  Just as long as you keep your non-iTunes Store music as mp3 audio you shouldn't have any problems.  Audio quality is great for great quality audio.  It all depends on the kpbs.  160 kbps is nearly indistinguishable from CD quality for most people.  192 kbps is a much larger file but is just the safer route.  iTunes Store music sounds great at the quality they have set for all the music.  Podcasts work great with the iPod and work very similarly to music on the iPod, as they are all audio files.  The only difference is that the iPod treats podcasts as they are and they have a separate folder within the iPod.  Photos work fantastic with the iPod too, and the picture quality is great for the most part.  The size of the image you upload to the iPod has a lot to do with the quality.  But for the most part, your standard digital camera pictures will look great.  I have not played any of the iTunes Store games that are available for the iPod but have heard good things about them all.  I don't think this is a relevant feature for the 5th generation iPod at this point seeing as how there are so few games available for purchase.  No outside source games are compatible with the iPod to my knowledge.  My only complaint with the iPod is the occasional freezing/slowing down of some media when playing it.  This is largely due to the fact that this is a hard-drive based player, and most problems can be solved with a reset (pressing the menu and center click buttons at the same time and holding).  My iPod has also been scratched a bit on the screen, even with a case.  With proper care and treatment, this should not be a huge problem after prolonged use, and the scratches on my own iPod are due, for the most part, to my carelessness with where I put the iPod.  If you put the iPod in a backpack that has dirt or sand in it, it WILL get inside the case you bought for the iPod, and WILL scratch the iPod if you do not remove it quickly.  This is just common sense.  Overall the iPod is an extremely fun player to use and can be very easy to use, given that you actually read the instructions.  Make sure that your bases are covered and you will be fine.  I would also like to add one last bit of information that will help some people, I'm hoping.  The Apple iPod has a TV-Out feature that is extremely useful for when you would like to hook it up to a TV and watch it at home with the family.  Apple has a sleek little RCA cable that you can buy for a pretty penny to be able to hook the iPod up to your TV, but be assured that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY IT.  With these steps, you can have your iPod playing on your TV in NO TIME:  1) Go to a local electronics store and buy a standard RCA cable with the red, yellow, and white plugs on one end and a 1/8 inch plug (headphone jack) on the other.  Again, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THE APPLE BRAND RCA CABLE FOR THIS.  Don't waste your money.  You can pick up a great RCA cable for a few dollars that will work fine for this feature. 2) Turn on your iPod and select your desired settings concerning TV-Out.  I enjoy the Widescreen format and the "Always Ask" option ON.  This ask option is just so that whenever I choose a video to play, the iPod will ask me if I want to turn TV-Out ON or OFF. 3) Once you've selected your desired settings, grab the RCA cable and plug the 1/8 inch end into your iPod's headphone hole. 4) Locate the analog input holes on your TV (red, white, and yellow) and grab the RCA cable.  Here's the tricky part that Apple "accidentally" forgets you to tell you.  Instead of matching colors and plugging the RCA cable into your TV, you've got to switch colors around.  Plug the RED END into the YELLOW INPUT, the YELLOW END into the WHITE INPUT, and the WHITE END into the RED INPUT.  Apple switched the way the composite video signal and analog audio signal comes out of the iPod on us!  Once you've switched the colors around and you're plugged in, switch the TV to the channel or mode that matches with where you've plugged into, select a video to watch, select TV-Out ON if you haven't already, and sit back and relax!

<Title>The iPod revolution continues...Great device
<Date>Sun Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's a GREAT device.  On a Mac, it's a snap to load videos to watch on the go, and has the usual superb iTunes management system for music, not to mention the iTunes Music store for downloads, music videos and limited at this point TV episodes.  A few downsides keep this from being a 5 star device...It scratches from the moment you pick it up, which you will do a lot to watch video...In a week waiting for an Invisible Shield (which does protect - albeit in a cumbersome fashion) it had dozens of scratches on the black finish and screen.  When more cases are available, this should get better, but Apple's stock case is suprisingly shoddy for the usual Apple elan...And besides looking horrible, the case doesn't allow you to use the player, at least for video.  Accessories are pitiful, and you will probably need at least one or two besides a halfway decent way to protect this.  So add another hundred dollars for a charging unit, and a dock...But whatever you do, DON'T buy the Apple remote.  At least as of this writing, it's not designed to do anything other than turn the unit on and off, volume  up and down and skip to next music track.  NO video controls, NO menu screens, NO playlist management.  It's also a surprise for Apple to be so irritatingly poor.  But this is another groundbreaker...Not the first Video player, but the elegance, ease of use, and absolute superiority of the iTunes management system are all top notch.  Highly recommended.

<Title>poor user instructions
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>yes, it's nice but how does it do all it's suppose to do?  I downloaded the user's manual and looked at the video demos and they mainly tell you what it WILL do but not how to do it in detail.  For instance it says in order to download music to your iPod after the data has been stored to your computer "go to 'source' in iTunes and find 'options'" and then it continues it's instructions.  I CAN'T FIND the 'OPTIONS' they are talking about.  Does somebody know of a more detailed user's instructions I can get that is NOT distributed by the Apple people, just some 'good ole joe/jane' that can talk people talk and not company advertising talk?  Thanks, Sub

<Title>THE Case
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are some good reviews here already on this great product.  I want to address the case issue. The iPod WILL scratch. It comes with a crappy, discardable sleeve (along with discardable earphones, but they're another issue!) that will provide some false assurances of scratch protection. However, if the tiniest bit of a foreign substance with a Mohs Scale of Hardness number of 2 or greater gets inside the sleeve, your 'Pod is scratched.  I recommend the purchase of the "invisibleSHIELD" (google it) to protect your 'Pod. I installed it on mine and couldn't be happier. This product is a tough plastic "decal" that is almost bullet proof! There is a video of guy using a car key to try and scratch a protected iPod. This stuff is tuff!  Application can be a bit tricky, but I got excellent results the first time. The screen is still crystal clear, but I'll have to admit that a "protected" iPod is slightly less beautiful than a new, "bare" one. However, it's still way more beautiful than any case can be and it will stay scratch free!    When it's time to sell your iPod, it will still look new. InvisibleSHIELD says that their product is removable, but I can't attest to that personally. I would think that a buyer would want to keep it on anyway.  Bottom line: I love my iPod. I would never want it to be without this protection.

<Title>READ before you spend your money AGAIN
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I went to my local Best Buy today after reading the reviews, and almost bought one. BUT, then I came to my senses.   Let's see, I purchased the 20 gig Ipod, then the 40, then the 60. Then I had to buy another 60 gig cuz the screen on my first got crushed (totally my fault). Was happy again for the most part, but had some problems with the video screen darkening (which I never had on any of the previous) and Apple was not at all helpful. So I went on, enjoying my music, but not my screen and then the Nano and Photo come out. Someone bought me the Nano as a gift, but I decided to buy the Photo because I am a photographer (amateur, but...).  And now, Apple wants me to spend another hefty chunk of cash to buy the video Ipod. Well, it looks great, sounds great, and love the black case, BUT......  I refuse to spend anymore money until they get it right. I am tired of having to dish out a few hundred dollars every 6 months or so to get their new product that does basically the same thing as the previous version.  I am going to wait 6 months or a year or however long until they get it right. An Ipod that continues to play music, shows photos, plays video (for longer than 3 hours, I mean c'mon), has all the normal cables and hookups and software, doesn't scratch with the slightest bump (or comes with a protective case that works). And something that is UPGRADABLE would be nice.   At this point, Apple is starting to look like Microsoft. They know they have the most popular product, so they feel they can just keep releasing new versions every few months and people will keep spendingthe money toreplace the perfectly good version they had before, for an inferior upgrade. Well, not me. Get a stable platform, with upgrade capability, and a decent battery life, and no constant extra cost for me and I will be happy to buy, but until then, this is getting stupid.  Imagine if you had to do this with your TV, your Microwave, your Clock Radio and every other electronic device you own. You couldn't afford it and you would say no. Say no to Apple until they get the product right.  They make great stuff, but this is getting stupid.  Just my opinion. I am not a paid Apple employee like some of the reviewers on here.

<Title>Beautiful screen, huge hard drive
<Date>Sat Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I upgraded from the U2 black and white iPod mainly because I wanted a color screen. The screen is a major reason to get this iPod. It is crisp, sharp, and the font is much easier to read than the B&W models.   The video ability is a nice add-on, but not really important for me. I have an Archos PVP and found that watching videos longer than a few minutes on a small screen is annoying. Plus without a backrest, I can't imagine watching a movie with the iPod -- holding it in the hand for 1 1/2 hours doesn't seem like much fun.  The 60gb space for me is fantastic. Although I have over 60,000 songs in my collection, I am able to put tons of songs on the iPod.   One note of caution: a few hours after I had mine, I noticed several hairline scratches all over the front of it, from the left of the wheel all the way onto the screen. I'm not sure if this is a nano-like issue, but it scratched easy and fast.  Apple needs to address that issue. Otherwise, this iPod is a work of art!

<Title>Smaller, Sleeker, Massive Space and Great Display
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my 60gb black video iPod for about a week now.  I upgraded from a 1st or 2nd generation 20 gb iPod, which was an upgrade from an old Archos Jukebox.    When first announced, I didn't think the video feature was cool enough to upgrade for, but after taking a look at the product in the Apple store, I was amazed and had to jump on board.  The display quality for such a small screen is wonderful.  When not playing video, having the large color display makes for easy visualizing of what songs you are playing.    I do think the hard drives moves a bit slowly.  It takes longer to load up the next song when fast forwarding.  My older iPod would do this seamlessly.  Now there is about a once second delay.  This is a bit disappointing, but doesn't really change my favorable opinion of the iPod.    I'm not sure if the unit will scratch or not.  I'm not chancing it, so I've left the plastic on that it came with it until my case arrives.  I don't think the scratching should be a deal-killer either.  The sound-quality, ease of use, small size and great looks makes this the best mp3 and now video player out there.    This also integrates seamlessly with iTunes, of course.  It's nice buying some of the older music videos I grew up with.  Apple needs to get a bigger selection of video quickly, but for now, it's a pretty good range of videos available.    So overall, this is a great product.  It's the best out there, and will satisfy most people's needs for the next couple of years.

<Title>The best iPod so far!
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros:  This is the ultimate iPod, for example, the unit itself is slimmer and more updated.  The screen is huge and bright, the storage capacity comes in either 30g or 60g.  It also comes in either black or white, I got a black one just because it looks different from the older iPods.  The screen size is humongous compare to the previous iPod.  The unit plays music videos, videos, pictures and the normal mp3, which are AAC encoded.  And the function is all the same with the usual iPod, click wheel and games, with the addition of a clock and stop clock.  Overall best iPod so far...........  Cons:  But it has some flaws.  The thing is a scratch magnet.  I really hate the scratch on the screen because it makes the screen look distorted, even though it is not.  Second there is a timing lag when switching songs, the title takes longer to load than the music, and mine crashed or stalled when I switch to a previous song.  When a certain song is done playing it will not switch to the next song because it is a different artist.  The music videos look fantastic, nice and clear, yet the music for the music video is less than great.  The battery life is said to be at 20 hours, but I think it might be less.  Maybe I touch it too much.  And last is the price.  It is quite hefty, and only comes with the basic accesories, ear buds, USB cord, and the CD.  Overall this might not be the iPod for everybody.  If you have thousands and thousands of songs, love music videos and have the funds for it, I recommend the 60g iPod video.

<Title>THE BEST TO DATE.......
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the 60 gig Ipod photo first and was blown away by the sound, size and scroll wheel. I decided to get the 60 gig Ipod with video and I'm glad I did. I wanted to put my home videos on a portable device. I was reading more reviews after I ordered the ipod video and realized that not many people went on record saying they had put home videos on their device, so I got worried that it wouldn't be right for this application. It came, and within a day I found PQ DVD to iPod Video software. It works like a charm and converts any movie file into ipod useable ones very quickly. The movies are great on the ipod and it really is amazing to watch and hear your videos on this unit. The screen seems so much bigger than the Ipod photo. NO PROBLEMS CONVERTING YOUR MOVIES OR VIDEOS TO PLAY ON IPOD!! Could use sub files to make things easier and Apple is just too concerned with making as much money as they can to be a user friendly company, but they make a great product anyway. GET A CASE BEFORE YOU GET THE UNIT! DON'T BOTHER WITH THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AS THEY GIVE YOU THE RUN AROUND AND DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON CUSTUMER SATISFACTION.

<Title>Best ipod yet! Can't they fix the screen scratches?
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this ipod. I have the second generation, and this was a great improvement. The battery life problem seems to be fixed, as I have had this for 6 months and haven't had it die on me during a long trip yet. The video looks great, the audio sounds better than ever, and the click wheel is a nice feature, although I miss the touch sensitve buttons. The menus are very nice, and everything is organized very nicely. One thing I'm not sure about, there's a place in itunes to add the music lyrics, but i don't know how to locate them on the ipoid, maybe it doesn't display them? My biggest issue here, the screen scratches very easily. Please make sure to buy a protective cover, or leave on the one that comes with it, or something. I was VERY careful with it, had it in a case and everything. I took it out one day to check a couple things out, and when I looked at it later in the day, it was scratched!! Bad enough that I notice it when I'm watching video. I don't think anything even touched the screen except some paper that may have been on my desk. It was very strange... Itunes integrations is as good as ever, and it's very easy getting ripped or purchased music onto your ipod. PROS *Best sound quality of any ipod yet *Video screen looks great *Click wheel is pretty responsive *Battery life is fantastic *Factory headphones actually sound pretty good CONS *Screen is very susceptible to scratches *The entire body of the ipod will be scratched and/or smudged within a week, don't expect it to stay all nice and shiny forever. But get it in a good cover ASAP and just take care of it as if it were a nuclear bomb just waiting to explode on impact! :)  All in all, this is a great player. Apple haters everyhwere will tell you it sucks and battery life is terribe and screen is too small, blah, blah, blah.... but the fact of the matter is it works. It does what it's supposed to do, which is play music VERY well, and it also plays movies, TV shows, and other video surprisingly well.

<Title>A must for every music collection
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my 60 gb iPod several months ago which was definetly money well spent.  I take it with me everywhere.  I have loaded over 500 CD's of every musical genre and have only filled up a quarter of the capacity.  One of my main pleasures has been rediscovering CD's I bought many years ago which had long been forgotten. Having them all available at the spin of my thumb makes them instantly available. I recently took a trip to visit my sister and and brought a connection cable so we could play it through her Bose radio.  It became the main entertainment through ten days of partying and relaxing. I can also play it through the car radio.  I am thinking of making an iPod input a must-have feature on the next car I buy. A big advantage of the iPod is iTunes, a free software from Apple. This program makes it so easy to load and classify my music on my computer.  And all I do is plug in my iPod and it immediately begins to synchronize the iPod to iTunes, copying any new music or changes I have made.  And it does it all by itself without any input from me. Unless you are planning to store lots of videos and/or photos, I think a 30 gb unit would be more than adequate for most music collections.  I could probably put a couple thousand more CD's on mine before it got full.

<Title>I bought a fad
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My impression of the iPod after all these months is I feel ripped off. The only good thing about the ipod that's not available from much cheaper and simpler Mp3 players is the memory size. The iTunes software is like paying to be spammed. You have to learn magic if you want to use music from another source other than iTunes or direct from the CD. "Video" has to be bought from iTunes. Some quicktime clips below a certain size can be loaded on but others can't and there is no telling which ones can and can't until you just try.   I have a 1 gb player of some generic Chinese manufacture. I plug it in and it shows on "my Computer" as another drive. I copy and paste the music I want on it and poof! I am ready to go. Loading the iPod the first time is an hour long ordeal using the UI of iTunes is for "Mac" people ( you know who you are) and it is maddening.  Last thing to address in my rant is the fragile nature of hard drives. A hard drive has moving parts and they don't do well with shock. A drop of 31 inchs to concrete will kill your iPod forever. Just one is all it takes. a good rap and your $260.00 is gone. Treat your ipod like a raw egg and it will last. Take some advice though, buy a flash memory based Mp3 player. Sure you can't load 60 million songs on it but you will be happier and more trouble free with ease of use plus less drop stress.

<Title>In Short - It's GREAT!
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll keep this short and sweet.  The new video playback iPod is worth the money.  It has a lot going for it - and all of it is positive.  To get to the most important point first, yes:  I downloaded an episode of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES and watched it on the iPod.  The clarity and color were nothing short of High Definition TV quality.  Others saw it and everyone was knocked out on how sharp and clear the video is.  The rest remains just as good:  You can download your CD's onto the system; use the iTunes store to buy new songs, etc.  It's quick and easy.  And burning a CD of your favorite tunes is so effortless, that nifty feature practically makes up for the cost of the unit.    Battery life has seriously improved as well.  The bad points?  Apple could be more generous with what they pack in the box.  First time iPod users are going to have to get a lot of the essentials as Apple really gives you nothing more than a standard set of headphones, etc.  It was disappointing when you realize that they even skimped and did not include a manual (although you can print one out courtesy of Amazon).  But, the high caliber performance more than makes up for what was not packed with the unit.    In short, the video iPod is fantastic.

<Content>This new iPod is an excellent piece of equipment. This is my first iPod and I am impressed with the features. It is a must have for music lovers and video lovers. The only thing that I can complain about is that it could be a little more durable. I say this because it scratches easily but that is nothing a case could take care of. Another flaw that I seen is that it is not compatible with Windows Media Player. That is really a preference though but I think I can adjust to iTunes since it is easier to use. Other than that this new iPod is great and I don't regret purchasing it.

<Title>Great iPod version but video drains battery quite fast
<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's nice to be able to play videos and I can even rip a DVD movie using third party shareware/freeware software and play it on the iPod. Although the screen is much larger than prior iPods, it's still a bit uncomfortable to watch a movie on it. Also the battery will only last about 2 hours when watching video so it would probably be better to just watch TV shows and music videos when using the battery. If you want to watch a full length movie, you should probably plug the iPod in to a power source either using the included USB 2.0 plugged into your computer or using an AC Adapter which costs extra. Apple absolutely should have included the AC Adapter/Charger with this iPod like they have with the previous 4th generation iPod.   The good news is that for music, this iPod lasts quite a long time! And it sounds great (better than prior iPods) and it's physically much thinner (with the same outside dimensions). Most of the accessories that I already had for my prior iPod work on this 5th generation video ipod (such as my Belkin Tune Doc and power adapter). If you use a case for a prior iPod, you will probably need a new one though.   I like the Black color and think it looks cooler than the White one however it does show up scratches more than White so beware of that.  While I recommend and like this iPod, if you plan on doing a lot of video, be prepared to have some other power source available. Music is still the main thing it's good for, with the video capability just being a secondary extra.

<Title>The future of buying and listening to music
<Date>Sat Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned my video ipod for a little over a week and love it.   As a classical musician, my main concern was music and not video. I look upon the video capabilities as a nice extra when I want to use  them. Also, the differential in price between the video and non-video ipods is minimal (I suspect that a LOT more programming will be available for it in the not too distant future).  Because I have sensitive ears, I also purchased a pair of noise-canceling headphones. I have never found the popular earbuds comfortable or capable of producing the detail that I like.  I can safely say that the tonal response of the ipod was nothing short of excellent. I hear every detail from the source recording. Even demanding organ recordings come through with the full dynamic range.  A word about compression is in order. The ITunes software makes importing your CDs, as well as purchasing music from ITunes, seemless and easy. I prefer using the Apple Lossless method. However, this produces about 5mb per minute's worth of music. This means that you can get about 200 hours worth of music on the 60-gig ipod. Music transferred from the ITunes Music store uses AAC-128kb. This produces about 2mb per minute. For jazz and smaller ensembles, it is fine. I downloaded some chamber music and it sounded fine. But for larger works, you will want the Lossless reproduction.  200 hours is a LOT of music. Plus, you can always take things off of the ipod as you need too.  The video reproduction, even with the small screen, is excellent and there is even some free network programming available.  In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with this purchase. I suspect a huge 3rd party market will quickly grow around this device.  I heartily recommend.

<Title>Apple doesn't stand by it's product
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>amazing what 2 months can do...if i'd left this feedback when i first got my ipod, it would've been 5 stars just like everybody else.  i loved it.  Now, 14 months later, i wish i could get my $300 back.  Apple idea of tech support is to charge you $50 just to ask your question, then they have no repair department, so you're issued a new ipod for $300.  That's a little bit off, because you do get 1 FREE call to apple in the first month....WOOOPEEE!!!!!  And after that first year, forget it, they might as well laugh at you on the phone.  My ipod wasn't mistreated, in fact, i babied it.  wasn't dropped, didn't get wet, left in cold, and of those scenarios they throw at you.  Then on that 14th month, it's quit.  And i'm not talking about the usual problem Apple claims which is battery loss(yes this is a major issue and another $50), but quit as in doesn't want to work.  When i contacted Apple, i was told that it would cost me $50 to talk to tech.  Then they told me that no matter what the problem was, if i were to send it in it would cost $300 to "repair".  i will NEVER purchase another Apple product, i've never seen a company care so little about their product after so short a time, my loss, hopefully you're gain.  Just shows that they knew their product was junk and that's why they put such a tight "warranty"(if you can call it that) on the product.  my advice, DO NOT BUY!!! all these 5 star rating customers will find out in about a year just how 5 star this company is.

<Content>The new ipod is fantastic.  The storage space and thin design are the best yet.  Many of the other reviewers have mentioned that the new model is not as durable as the old one, but the added features make up for it.  If you are into sports, try the ipod shuffle, it's smaller and easier for exercise.  Also, I got my ipod for 10 dollars off a promotion on premium ipods site.  It worked great and cost me 10 bucks (much better than 300) check it out: [...]

<Title>Reassurance on the scratches
<Date>Wed Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have the white 60 GB ipod video and my husband has the black. We purchased about 3 weeks ago. We both love it.  Feedback on watching video: There has been much feedback on the product not being a good option for video. I do not have the flexibility in my schedule to watch TV. I bought the entire second season of Desperate Houswives (8 episodes at the time of writing this review) and watched it on the ipod. The clarity and experience was amazing. The video quality is exceptional. I can watch during my ride to work or at any point when I have about 15 minutes to spare. The ipod memory feature picks up at the point where I stopped watching when I click on the episode. Fun! For me, it works very well as a video device too.I have ripped my workout DVDs to the ipod. I bought the TV connector. No more excuses not to work out when I am traveling.   Scratching: Neither my husband's nor mine are scratched yet. Please dont be scared to buy because of the feedback on the product being prone to scratches. I was concerned because I read this. All it takes is a little extra care - I keep it in the pouch as far as possible.   The only flip side - the battery life is not 20 hours. Mine runs out of charge much faster (about half this). But then I use the back lighting a lot even when listening to music because I have loaded album art or pics of the artist in lieu of boring album art and I still cannot get over staring at the awesome screen when listening to songs  Edited after a few more weeks since buying to say - Still no scratches! I recently picked up up a skin with a lanyard (available in Asia). Even wothout the skin, we had both managed to keep our heavily used ipods scratch free though.

<Title>Fantastic!
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This iPod is everything I hoped it would be.  Go for 60 GB because of video.  Note: you will want to get Quicktime Pro on mac to convert your movies into iPod videoes; however, that 30 dollars is well spent if you have video in unencoded formats.  It takes a good while for QT pro to "export" the unsupported video to iPod size, yet it's worth the wait.  I let the CPU purr while I do something else.  Caveat: muxed audio in MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 must be converted!!!!!!!!  Third party utility required.  This is true because of Quicktime and iMovie limitations, not the iPod itself.  Thus, the trick is to convert from a muxed file then export.  BTW -- I was in a waiting room for an hour+ yesterday, but thanks to my iPod, I did not realize that the time went by until I got in my car and looked at the clock.  UPDATE:  get iSquint to convert the muxed files.  Its free.

<Title>I'm now one of them
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my new ipod. It was a gift for me and I couldn't ask for anything better. I am a design student in college so I have to bring large files to and from school. I was looking at getting another flash drive because I need about 1G per class. But now I just use my ipod as a portable hard drive. I don't have to worry about erasing files everyday to make room. It is amazing. I work on a Mac at school and a PC at home and it goes back and forth perfectly. The video is so clear and the sound is even better. I don't leave home without it. It does scratch even if you are so careful...it's my new baby. I would get a good case to protect it. If you would have asked me a month ago if I could use an ipod I would have just laughed at you, now it is always in my purse. I am remodeling my mother's kitchen and put an image of the wood molding that I needed to match into my ipod and used it at the store to insure that I didn't buy the wrong item. I would recommend this to anyone.

<Title>HEAVEN IN THE PALM OF MY HAND
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just received this as an early holiday present yesterday and am in iPod-induced bliss.  This is my third iPod - I have the 2nd generation 15GB model and the 4th generation 40GB model.  While I am still in love with them, this was more than a step up in so many ways.  If you already have an iPod and have iTunes already set up with most recent version of iTunes software, all you literally have to do is connect this to your computer via the USB cable (no more firewire!?) and it is off and running.  Seriously, it is that easy.  It only took about an hour for it to load all 6,100 songs in my iTunes library.  SCREEN: The color screen is insane, almost otherworldly in its clarity.  While small, of course, it completely pulls you into whatever you are watching (the world around it seems to fall away, somehow) and it has almost a 3-dimensional depth to it.  I was surprised by how great it was to watch video on - already downloaded a few videos and shows (The Office) from iTunes.  Very quick and easy download.  CAPACITY: The 60GB drive was a big deal for me.  If it seems unlikely to you that anyone would need this much space, you would be sadly mistaken.  You will find it amazing how quickly you use up the space if you have a significant music/photo/video collection.  While I am really in no danger of encroaching upon the 60GB of memory (especially since my computer currently only has 40GB capacity), I am sure the day is coming, probably sooner than later.   CASE COLOR: While beautifully designed, I could never get past the white color of my previous models.  I am NOT a fan of white, so this glossy black (my favorite color, of course) is perfection.  That said, I must admit it has already proven to be an incredible smudge magnet.  It also seems very fond of any dust of fine hairs that may be in the air, static charged particularly to the screen area.  Thank goodness that when the backlight is on, you can not see any smudges, dust or the like.  The screen just blows right through it.  Still, this is an area where the white model is superior, it just never showed any of this stuff, with the exception of the metallic backside.  Still, I will happily take the smudgy black model over the white any day.  It isn't horrible, very much like owning a black car - harder to upkeep but well worth the effort.  It's the price you pay for aesthetic.  Still, it would be nice if they could somehow figure out how the treat the surface to limit this effect.  Three complaints/observations:  NO FIREWIRE, CRADLE, OR PLUG ADAPTER:  While all of these came with my previous models, they were nowhere to be found with this one.  All you get is a USB cable.  Nowhere to place your iPod (safely) while charging, unless you have a cradle from a previous iPod as I do.  Still, very inconvenient to switch them out and the cradles from the previous models don't fit perfectly since this model is a thinner and slightly wider.  Also, with no plug adapter, I am more than a little confused as to how one is to charge their iPod with any level of ease.  Is there something I don't get regarding how you're supposed to charge your iPod with only what is provided?  Again, thank God that I have my hardware from my previous models.  NO PROTECTIVE CASE:  While I understand that they are trying to keep the costs reasonable, which I do greatly appreciate, I am still somewhat dismayed by the discontinuance of a proper protective case.  The somewhat odd, thin protective sleeve which was included with this model may help reduce scratches when the iPod is not in use, but it is by no means a carrying case and will not protect the device at all from any accidental bumps or drops (God forbid).  It just seems like there would be something a little more substantial included with a device of this cost and sensitivity to scratching.   BATTERY LIFE:  While the battery life does seem slightly better than that of my most recent iPod model, I think that the 20 hours advertised seems very optimistic, even if just playing music with the backlight off.  If you scroll around often, like I do, use the backlight to any real extent at all (the screen is VERY dark without the backlight on), or view videos, you may be looking at 3-8 hours realistically depending upon whether you are listening to music or watching video.  Even with the complaints listed above, I must say that I am completely blown away by this latest model already and only anticipate my love affair with it to grow.  I completely recommend this model, just don't expect to receive much beyond the actual iPod device itself.  All other hardware now appears to be a la carte.    Can't find it at your local Apple store, Best Buy, Circuit City, wherever for Christmas?  Contact Apple directly, through their website or by phone.  Mine was apparently purchased just last Thursday and was delivered in less than 24 hours the next day (this last Friday) by FedEx.

<Title>Get a Protective Case
<Date>Fri Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Anyone who wrote the review before Oct 18th hasn't even seen the thing live. They are probably cutting and pasting the specs from from Apple site. So beware.  I placed the order as soon as it was available on Apple store. It will be shipped before Oct 21. My two concerns are: Is it going to scratch like the black Nano and is the screen going to crack. Will update as soon as I find out.  I am a Windows guy with extensive collection of music in WMA lossless. After waiting for the wma camp to come up with something good, I am finally giving up on them. Toshiba and Cowon seem to be on the right track but everytime they try to do something cool, Apple comes up with a stunner and leaves them in the dust.   In anticipation of this, I converted my entire WMA lossless library into an additional 192kbps AAC library (keeping the lossless archive, ofcourse). With only 60GB, I have to reconvert some of them to 128kbps - which is a slight disappointment.  I wish Apple had put in an 80GB drive (Toshiba has one that will fit this model) that will allow use of lossless or higher bitrate AAC.   UPDATED Oct 25th: Got mine yesterday and downloaded the entire library. The screen froze with a do not disconnect message. But this was resolved by holding the menu and the center key for about 10 seconds and waiting for Apple logo to reappear. The manual says to keeep the hold switch on. The reset works only with the switch off.  I haven't taken off the plastic clear cover on the front yet as I am scared of scratches. In addition, I got a new Ipod 4G 40GB case to fit it (the 60GBs fit very loosely inside and the screen is not fully visible). 5G cases are not available.   My wife was surprised that I am treating an electronic gadget with this much respect not accorded to far more expensive pieces. I don't know myself. May be I have an emotional connection with music that I don't have with the others.  I visited the Apple store yesterday to see how unsheathed iPods are faring with scratches. While all of them show some scratches it doesn't appear to be as bad as some I had seen on the internet.  But the only thing that really matters is the music. The music is spectacular. What more can we really ask for?  Updated on Nov 6th:  I finally finished installing the so called invisible shield. This is made of 3M scotch cal and is not made for iPod but serves to keep the pod scratch free. The installation is a NIGHTMARE.  Key tips to remember: (a) Do NOT use soap and water as their website says. Use Windex spray (a tip I heard from ilounge forum) (b) Do Not try to squash air bubbles - they cause snow flake like appearance that stays forever  The shield is expensive (almost a rip off). Apple should really research into a non-scratch resin protection for its pods.   BTW, after researching through various speaker systems, we bought the JBL On Stage. This has some kind of a circular woofer, which gives superior sound compared to others like Altec Lansing or Creative.

<Title>Let's get some things straight...
<Date>Fri Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all, I don't know why people say that it's wider when it isn't. As far as I can tell from the spec page, the new iPods are the SAME height and width as the old 20 GB ones that it replaced. Both of the new models are actually THINNER and hold more capacity. What's not to like?  I think the confusion lies in that the screen has increased in size from 2" to 2.5" WITHOUT changing the actual width and height of the 4th Gen 20GB iPods. That's why you see the screen covering almost the entire top from edge to edge. Because of the increase size of the screen they no longer could fit the original dial on the front. So the new models have a smaller dial. Not as small as the Nano but definitely smaller than the older iPods. The effect of these two modifications gives the ILLUSION that the new iPods are wider or taller but it's NOT.  The other thing I hear people complaining about is how it's not good for video. Let's get something straight. This is a REPLACEMENT for the older iPods, not an additional model introduced for the sole purpose to playing videos. Like Jobs said, the video is just an ADDITIONAL benefit of the new models. You're actually paying the same prices as the old AND you're getting more capacity and video functions to boot! Again, what's not to like?   As they become more successful with video, they will introduce models that will showcase more of the video but what's the point of introducing one at this juncture with no real programs for you to watch??? Remember boys and girls, Apple is a business and as such they want you to replace your iPods over and over as technology improves. The current product cycle for Apple seems to be every 12 months. That means you should expect a really cool video iPod by the same time next years IF they are successful with this video experiment. Let's hope that Jobs will be successful in getting more studios to sign up!  That brings me to the other complaint I always hear: that the iPod/Nano scratches too easily. Come on folks! This is not a device you're about to keep for many years, do you really care if it gets scratched up if you're going to replace it every few years??? Instead, just enjoy using it and then replace it as newer and better ones will continue to be introduced. Enjoy life!

<Title>Greatest music player, with video too!
<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.   The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.   I have owned the 60 gig iPod with video playback, for several days now, and I continue to be impressed. Its physical appearance, quality, craftsmanship, and the wide array of features are keeping me entertained!   Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.   Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, even this 60 gig is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.   Capacity - This 60 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 15,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or 150 hours of video. The great thing I love about my 60 gig iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. Furthermore, with the video capabilities on the new iPod, you may find yourself needing the extra space that this 60 gig iPod provides.   New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.   Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 60 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 20 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of three hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.   Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.   Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.   Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car. Apple is including a small sleeve-type case, with this iPod, to help you keep it in good condition.   Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.   Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.   Value - This 60 gigabyte iPod is priced at $399, which is a great value. It provides a huge amount of storage space, and more features than ever.   Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.

<Title>What about the peripherals?
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Many have lauded this as being the best iPod yet and most of the things said so far are true. The wider screen looks great, the video function is cool, and the battery life is much improved. However no one has mentioned the one major drawback to this new iPod-the peripheral jack located next to the headphone jack on every other iPod is not on this iPod. That means that all the cool peripherals like the Griffin iTrip and the headphone remote control are now completely obsolete. Apple didn't mention this at all in any of their advertising and I didn't know about it until I got my new iPod in the mail and opened it up. I don't know why Apple would do this or if they intend on releasing any adaptors or anything like that in the future but it sucks for me because I constantly used my headphone remote with my old iPod. I listen to my iPod at work but I constantly have to pause it in order to talk with people so it was great being able to keep my iPod in my pocket and just clip on the remote. In my opinion removing this peripheral jack is completely pointless and keeps this from being the ultimate iPod.

<Title>nothing THAT new!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I think there's alot of hype over the video feature of these ipods- keep in mind, theres nothing new about video playback and plently of other products do this and have done so successfully for sometime now.  What is the feature that should be focused on is the storage capacity of ipods -much bigger than other products and the relative sizes of the ipod body - much smaller than other products on the market.  But dont be sucked in by ipods "now it does.....video playback!!!" - it should have had this feature a long time ago! but then again they wouldnt make all that extra money!! also be aware that other reviews state older peripheries are obsolete with this model... you will have to buy all these again when they come out.

<Title>I actually DO have one
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unlike a lot of reviewers who post reviews on a product they've never seen or held (Apple Stores were told they wouldn't get theirs until the end of October--per Charlotte NC store) ----- I actually have one.  I ordered mine on Oct 12, and it arrived Oct 20. I of course ordered the 60GB device.  It was easy to swap out my old 40 GB device with this new one. I'd previously installed the new iTunes and the iPod software version 10-12-05 that I'd downloaded. It was plug in, register, and download. (And I had to swap cables on my dock***.)  Some observations:  The screen is very bright when you turn the backlight on and leave it on, it's very dim if you don't (probably how they get the stated 20 hour battery life).   ***No more Firewire connections. I was sad to see that, as the Firewire connection saved me from getting a new USB hub.   The Holy Grail is video here...however, converting it to iPod standards isn't easy. I have a lot of DiVX video, to which the QuickTime Converter isn't up to recognizing, much less converting. Forget about 3rd party converters that you already own, it seems the iPod only wants Apple-converted video. But rest assured, there are software developers frantically scrambling to solve this. I have a couple of beta converters I found, but with very mixed results. I'd give it a couple of weeks then good software will be available for converting video to the iPod.  The sound is as good as ever, no worries there.  It has the same width and height as my 40GB iPod, so your cases should fit nicely, and maybe a similar thickness to the old 10/20 GB iPods. It fits in my auto transmitter/charger, but I have to slightly angle it back as I'm inserting it to hit the dock squarely.  All in all, the video situation was disappointing, but with lots of money at stake, it will get worked out by all these 3rd party developers. I did manage to get a couple very short preexisting QuickTime videos converted successfully to the iPod standard, so I know it DOES play video - the problem is just the conversion process. Not necessarily Apple's fault, except that their video standard is maybe a little too rigid.

<Title>Worth The Wait
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the iPod I've been waiting for since the first generation iPod was released. I bought an 40GB iPod for my wife almost 2 years ago but held out for myself because I knew this day would arrive. So the moment Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod video I went straight to the Apple website and broke out the Visa. I've had it for 4 days and so far it has exceeded every expectation. Unlike many, I didn't buy it for the video because I just couldn't see myself watching anything of significance on a 2.5in screen. To me, the value was in finally freeing those thousands of digital pictures from my computer and being able to view them on a screen that actually does them justice. Unlike the iPod Photo, this screen is about the size of a small wallet size photo and serves up the pics in beautiful detail. You WILL be impressed. The slimmer profile, 60GB of storage and 20 hour battery life of the iPod Video are several layers of icing on the cake. Co-workers, friends and family can finally stop nagging me for the latest baby pictures - now they can scroll through hundreds in just a few minutes. And now that I've seen the quality of those pictures first hand, I might have to download a few episodes of Lost.

<Title>Great player, no charger
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just received mine and am very impressed by the display.  I had suspected that video playback on this machine was merely a gimic, especially the television downloads, but it is surprisingly watchable.  Note to Steve Jobs: I need Sopranos downloads!  The problem with this package is what's not in the box.  There is no charger, no dock, no decent case (which given the propensity to scratch is a clear and present danger).  Apple is well known for scrimping on required accessories, but they have sunk to a new low with this package.  Let's face it, they kept the price at the previous levels only by eliminating essential components and forcing us to buy them separately.  Summary: Buy the player; you'll love it.  But make sure you've got a hundred bucks left over to get the rest of the stuff you'll need.

<Title>Great hadware, software could be better
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my new iPod. I bought this one after my 60GB iPod Photo was "misplaced". I had a library of about 6,000 songs (small for what this thing can hold) and the first time I updated the new iPod with the library I got error messages every 700 songs or so. I had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until I finally got al my songs into the iPod. This was problem number one (which I don't expect to happen again unless I update the iPod whith more than 700 songs at a time).   Problem number two: if I'm searching for a song by artist, it won't display all the songs I have by that artist in the iPod. Say I have like 20 songs by Madonna, and I search for Madonna on the artists menu, I only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are. That didn't happen with my old iPod.  But all in all, it's a great product and I would buy it all over again if I had to.

<Content>First off--I'm old(ish) in my 50's and I watched my daughter using her iPod nano.  Then she started playing me songs from her iPod, then I started really liking some of the songs, then I got jealous, so I asked for my own for my birthday.  So I got the biggest and newest, and I love it.  It has fantastic sound.  I play it in my car.  I also use it to listen to audiobooks.  I can't wait to watch movies on it.  It is also very easy to use.  So I give it 5 stars.

<Title>Now that I've had this...
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>for over a year I think I can give a fair review.  Although this is a nice little machine it's got its problems, problems that shouldn't occur in such an expensive product.  But first, the positive.  I listen to alot of music, I've already had to delete about 10 gigs to make room for other music so the 80GB is looking pretty tempting right now.  Actually, I heard that a 100GB is coming soon, I can only hope!  Anyways, everything you might have heard about the iPod being hard to use with PC is untrue.  If you have any computer skills at all it should come as no problem.  iTunes is easy to use (although I hate all the music on iTunes), adding songs, pictures, movies and text are simple enough.  When you first get an iPod you may struggle for about 2 minutes.  The mp3s sound good although I with there was a function that kept all the songs at the same noise level.  It sucks when you have it turned up very loud when a low sound level song comes on and then your head explodes when the next song comes on!    Okay, so now some of the negative.  First, battery life.  I turn off my backlight because it will eat the battery in about 4 hours!  I forget exactly how long it says the battery life is supposed to last, I think 12 hours, but it isn't close.  And, it only gets worse the longer you own it.  Okay, another thing that I hate.  I'm not sure if this happens to everyone but my songs will duplicate, meaning that I'll have 2 of the same album instead of just the one.  This is very annoying because, like I said, I put alot of music on this and having double of an album only takes more space that shouldn't be taken.  I have to go through my iPod about once every 2 weeks to get rid of doubles.  Sometimes when I try and turn off my iPod it won't respond.  So I have to hold down play once...twice...thrice...foursies...five'ins...you get it.  It'll respond after a bit, but this is annoying.  And finally, my biggest complaint of all time, the 5GBs that you don't get to use!!!!!  This is such a pain because I bought a 60GB not a 55GB!!!  If iPod has to use 5 gigs to put memory crap on here then make it a 65GB and sell it as a 60GB!  Don't cheat people out of 5 gigs, I need the space!!!!!  Okay, I'm calm now.  So, all in all this is a good piece of equipment if you've got a whole lot of music and don't feel like carrying CD books around.  When I do get another MP3 player, I don't think I'll be going to Apple again though.

<Title>Good little gadget, but not perfect
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod came into my life about a month ago.  Learning to use the iPod has been a battle at times, but overall, it's been a battle worth fighting.  So far, the iPod itself works fine.  It charges relatively quickly, and plays many hours on the battery between charges.  I've heard the screens are easy to scratch, so I've been careful with mine, and I haven't had any problems with scratching to date.  My main problem has been figuring out the software.  On the same day I got the iPod, I also got a Sandisk 512 Mb MP3 player.  Without reading the instructions for the MP3 player, in less than 15 minutes, I had it loaded with music from Jukebox software that came with my computer, and playing tunes on my new iFi system.  It took the better part of 2 days to get that far with the iPod.  I had heard that iTunes can screw up your filing system in your music folder, so I tried connecting the iPod to Jukebox.  Several hours after starting the download to the iPod, the system froze, and I found that the download was aborted.  Then I found that the iPod had put the music files from Jukebox into its Notes folder, and didn't recognize them as music.  It seems an iPod will only talk to iTunes (although there was no documentation saying so in the packaging), so I had to install the iTunes software.  Fortunately, the software does give you a choice about rearranging your folder system, so my initial fears were unwarranted.  When I went to download my music from iTunes onto the iPod, however, the system reported that there wasn't enough space because of the files Jukebox had put in the Notes folders. I had already deleted those files by moving them to my desktop recycle bin, but some trace must still have been left in the file system.  As I tried reloading the music from iTunes, the system froze.  And the iPod froze.  And the only way out was to reinitialize the iPod.  Due to my unfamiliarity with iPod technology, it took several hours of studying the online instructions for such a procedure to understand how to do this, which buttons on the iPod to push and for how long.  Finally, I got the iPod back to its initial state and could begin to download my music, which took 6-8 hours for 35 Gbs.  Since then, the software has run more or less OK, although it's not very intuitive, and takes a bit of a struggle to figure out.  I think Apple thinks it's cool to provide a minimum of signage or instruction and let people figure things out on their own.  Perhaps the mystery of a device or software without instructions is supposed to be endearing, but I just find it frustrating.  It took me several days to figure out how to turn on the shuffle feature on the iPod.  As far as I can figure, every time you begin to play a shuffled playlist, you always have to start with the same first song.  Stupid design, if that's true, and stupid documentation if it's not.  I'll never figure out why people are so loyal to Apple anyway if this is an example of what customers have to put up with. Not only does Apple have an overwhelming share of the hardware market for music players, but they also rule the software, and through it, online sales. Smells of a vertical monopoly structure to me.  Good for business, bad for customers.   Since iPods are known to bad for your hearing, Apple has provided 2 volume "safeguards".  The first is through the iTunes software which has a tool to analyze all songs and put them at the same volume settings.  I tried this feature, and my music is still all over the place in terms of volume.  If the software did anything at all, I think it amplified applause and drum solos.  The other is a setting on the iPod where you can choose a maximum volume.  It would be great if the iPod software could look ahead at a song and make sure that it doesn't play it back with a decibel setting over a certain level.  Instead, the volume guard simply functions as a stop on the dial, so that you can't turn up the volume any higher than the setting you define.  But since music can come into the playlist at a variety of levels, if you set the volume guard in a quiet piece, when a loud piece comes on, it will set your eardrums afire.  And if you set the guard in a loud piece, you won't be able to hear the quieter pieces even with the volume turned up all the way.  In other words, the feature is useless.  Basically, Apple still hasn't done anything meaningful to address the volume problem, although a software solution wouldn't seem that hard to implement.  The iPod ships with a set of earbud headphones (with little black sponge caps that are impossible to put on and fall off all the time), a faux velvet case for the headphones (not for the iPod itself, which I mistakenly assumed, so I ripped out the seams of the little case trying to stuff the iPod in it), a CD with the iTunes software, and a short cable for connecting the iPod to a USB jack.  At a minimum, I would suggest investing in a tape adaptor for your car if you are lucky enough to have a tape player (the Sony tape adaptor works great, and is under $15), and a car charger.  Not only are tape adaptors cheaper than FM adaptors for the car, but they also are a lot more reliable and don't have the channel changing problem as you drive long distances.  You can connect your iPod to your existing stereo system with a Y-cable.  Or get an iPod ready sound system with a built-in charger.

<Content>This is an awesome gift. I use mine primarily in the vehicle and at the gym. While i'm doing my cross-trainer, I watch TV shows and listen to music. In the car, I just flip it to whatever playlist I want and continue my jams. The screen is delicate. I suggest you immediately purchase a clear screen protector or some kind of jacket so your video quality does not diminish. I can watch about 3 tv shows before I need to recharge the battery. The battery is great when listening to music though.

<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the first Ipod I've  bought and I'm pretty impressed. I put about 1000 songs and 200 pics on it and only used about 5 gbs. The sound, even thru the earpieces, is excellent and it has tons of space for all kinds of stuff from podcasts to music and pictures. Itunes software is also great and makes downloads a breeze. The one problem though is that it scratches in it VERY easy so if you buy one get a good case to go with it. Mine had several scratches on it within a few hours of having it and I even kept it in the case that comes with it. Also, unless you buy the adapter for $30, the only way to recharge it is to hook it up to your computer. They say that the battery can last for 20 hours on a charge, but I think its probably less than that. Still a great product!

<Title>Great screen! Enormous capacity! I love mine!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I absolutely adore my iPod with video. I have had a Nano and the B&W 20GB one as well. This video iPod is my clear favourite. I have had my iPod for over a month now (kind of a Thanksgiving present to myself).  The music runs great, as it did on the other ones. I have been fortunate never to have had a problem with my iPods yet (knock wood), and this new iPod is no exception.  I had reservations about the screen's being small at first, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I watch the iPod on the train in the mornings on the way to work, and I think the detail on that small screen is exceptional! True: you can't read, say, subtitles or small credits, but it's great just for good ol' TV- or video podcast-watching.  One drawback: the number of video shows available is limited. However, even in the short amount of time that I have had my iPod (around one month), I have seen the number of shows available double. I imagine that this number will continue to increase.  I think the size of the iPod is quite manageable as well. Although not nearly as small as the Nano, it's still a tiny size. I think it's still small enough when working out or running.  I love my iPod. If you have the money and the inclination, I would recommend getting one for yourself.

It works wonderfully and i will never use anything again this is a must buy!!!  the only reason i gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because of 2 things.  The "video" part is not that great its not like you can download the matrix onto your ipod and watch it when ever you want.    and also it says that i should have like 20 hours of battery time or constant use time and i sit at work for about 8 and a half hours and the battery bar goes down to the small red part wich means its allmost out so unless it stays like that for another 11.5 hours than its very very wrong and that is dissapointing.  but other than that its amazing!!!

Of coarse its not going to have all the battery life that it says onthe commercial, do you believe everything you hear on TV? If you expected everything cool to come with it you do not need to be getting anything because you WILL need to buy accessories for things, thats why they are called accessories, duh! And people, if you read the specifications before bought it, it tells you all about the movie thing and how you need to change the file types. So next time research before you buy the newest thing on the market!

<Title>Works great, scratches easily
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Actually, it's more like 4 and 3/4 stars, but Amazon won't let me do that.  Onto the review:  My first piece of advice for everyone buying this is to buy a case along with it, because the one in the package is almost worthless.  With mine, at least, scratches have been a problem, though a minor one.    My second piece of advice is to be on the lookout for some black headphones, because Apple packs this device with its trademark white ones.  (They sound pretty good and are attractive, but they are also a theif magnet.)  That said, everything else works like a dream.  Battery life has been as good as promised, maybe a bit better.  I managed to get two full viewings of Star Wars: Episode III in on it before the battery went, which is about 4 hours and 20 minutes of video in total.  The only thing that's a drag about getting video on the thing is that Apple doesn't have a conversion utility built into iTunes the way it does for music, so you have to find a third-party alternative.  I've been using Videora and it's been working great.    Finally, onto the music.  It sounds fantastic.  That's about all I can really say.  Plus, iTunes makes it so easy to manage what music you want on the player.  (It's been eye opening for me since my last mp3 player was a Rio Cali with what I realize now is awful software.)  All in all, a great machine.  (And yes, I think it's worth the extra $100 for the extra capacity and battery life.)
