<Content>I've had this iPod for about 3 years. It is still running great! The sound quality is awesome and it hold all my songs with no trouble. I've never had any major problems with it. The games feature is nice. It's a great music player - you won't really find anything "fancy" on it like what the new iPods (video, color, etc.). For me though, I didn't really care about any of that stuff - I just wanted something to play music. I do recommend that you get a case for it to keep it from getting scratched.  
<Overall>5
