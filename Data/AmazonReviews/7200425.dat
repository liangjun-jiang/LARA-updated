<Title>Terrific item!
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a terrific piece of technology. It improves on its MuVo precedessor (I bought a 128 MB player 16 months ago) with a longer battery life, larger memory, and LCD window, while retaining the immense advantage of a digital music player *without* moving parts.  To my mind the iPod is overrated -- too expensive and too fragile. Plus the MuVo plugs directly into your USB port.

<Title>Great Device, Bad Ear Buds
<Date>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first MP3 player.  I researched this model, and found that others thought it was good.  I agree.  The sound quality is excellent for such a small device -- better than CD and tape players I've had in the past.   The software makes it very easy to download songs to the device, as well as rip from CDs I own.  Takes some getting used to in regards to playing different folders (have separate soft and workout music folders), but quick to navigate once you get the hang of it.    Would definately recommend it for someone who doesn't need all of his music stored on one device and who wants to play for 1-4 hrs at a time (anything more than this, would recommend a hard drive device.)

<Title>great
<Date>Tue Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought this player about a week ago. My computer at home is only operating on Windows 98 but it still works. I wasn't able to use the software that was included but instead used windows media player to change my cds into .wma files. To organize the music I just created folders by double clicking on the removable drive (mp3 player). The music sounds wonderful and holds tons more than if I had converted into .mp3 files. I had to check out a lot of players due to my older computer set up. This was the only one that I saw that could work on my system. If you're a little slow in the updating department I would highly recommend this player.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently puchased the 512MB Muvo TX FM so I could listen to music while running. This model comes with an armband (some don't) and is great for the job. It took about 2 seconds to figure out. I simply plugged it into a USB port, copied some MP3s onto it and I was off.  Like anothe rreviewer mentioned, the earbuds aren't great, just OK.

<Title>More than the iPod Shuffle (but not so Mac-friendly)
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You can read about this great little device's many features in other reviews, so I'll mostly direct this to Mac users.    Apple claims that iTunes supports this mp3 player, but it really doesn't.  You can load mp3's onto it using iTunes on a Mac if you download MuVo Helper, a little freeware application you can find online (search on "muvo helper").  Even with MuVo Helper, however, iTunes can't transfer its playlists to the MuVo; nor can it transfer Audible spoken word files.  Of course, the MuVo won't play Apple iTunes AAC files either--just mp3's.  With a Windows computer (98SE and above), you can upload mp3's and wma's (drag and drop using Windows Explorer, and create playlists by grouping files into folders) and also Audible files (with Audible's Manager program and Creative's new MuVo firmware, which you'll need to download from creativelabs.com).  You might also check out Red Chair Software's Notmad application (redchairsoftware.com), which helps you order songs into playlists.  Otherwise the MuVo can play songs in a few different ways: the order in which you uploaded them, or alphabetical order, or shuffle play.  So... if you have a Mac and no access to a Windows machine, you won't be able to take full advantage of this device.  However, it still makes a worthy alternative to the iPod Shuffle if you don't buy from iTunes: similar price, similar size, removable battery, a pretty good radio with autoscan and presets, and pretty good radio/voice recording as well.  If Creative were to offer a real iTunes plug-in, this would be a little treasure.

<Content>This is a great product in terms of price and ease, and better than the IPOD Shuffle, I might add. The price is very affordable. It is very easy to use, just plug and play, the person doES not even need a software.... it acts as an external drive.  Moreover, it tops the IPOD shuffle because it has an FM, fm recorder and voice recorder. I read somewhere that this product does not have a shuffle feature. Well, I beg to differ, just go to the play mode and select shuffle once, then it would shuffle all the music folders saved.  With all the assertions above, it is viable to say that this is a great product.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>I love this thing....
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my MuVo TX FM in the mail this afternoon, and it is a delight to use. I was copying MP3's onto the device, and playing them, within 5 minutes of unpacking. I'll also point out that I only have USB 1.0 ports on the system I am using right now, and the transfer speed was still very managable. (About 8 minutes to copy the entire 512 megs, around 1 minute for a single album). As several people say, the earbuds are so so. The belt clip is really nice, and the armband is cool. (Although, as a bigger guy, it might be a little snug if you wanted to wear it on the upper arm.) The display is great with a nice blue backlight, and the interface is very intuitive. The FM reception is great. (It's much easier to let it autoscan and assign all the stations to presets. If you try scanning around on your own without doing this...good luck) The voice recorder works fine, and I have already tried running the output to my car stereo. All you need is a little two ended cable if you have a line-in on your car CD player, and it sounds great. I'm no audiophile, but at least at a casual listen, the sound quality was the same to me as a CD in the player.   The software is OK. You can import an external playlist, and it will transfer a playlist to the player, which is cool. It does seem to take a while to import tracks, and it would be nice if the autoplaylist had a little more control.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the device. I have a couple friends who already owned them, and they are also very happy. Bottom line, why pay the same money for an IPOD shuffle with no display!?!?

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I considered many different mp3 players before purchasing this one.  Several things made the Myvo tx fm 512 standout from other similar products.  First was the durability, I am not the most careful person, I have accidently dropped it on a few occasions, including once from the car onto blacktop, but if you look at it you cannot tell that it has ever been dropped.  Next was the storage capacity.  512MB is plenty of storage space.  I have yet to run out of space, I am now up to 38 different bands with about 3 songs apiece.  The price was very good.  Even though the iPod shuffle may be a few dollars left it is a little less reliable and lacks a screen to tell you what song you are on.  Another good feature is the navigation, using windows I made a folder for every band,  it is very easy to move from folder to folder using the small joystick.  I had two slight complaints with this little gizmo.  The first is that the included headphones are very small and uncomfortable.  I replaced the included ones with a pair of my own and and now happy.  The other complaint I have is the included software.  It probably works fine, but I don't have much patience and after a few minutes when I couldn't figure it out I decided to drag and drop and it worked perfectly.

<Title>Great product, poor build quality.
<Date>Tue May 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Must have bad luck with this player.  The first one I received had a problem with the earphone jack, in that if the supplied earphones were inserted in all the way I would only get sound faintly from one ear.  If I held the jack in 1/2 way is sounded great, but definitely wasn't of practical use in this condition.  So I returned it and got a second one which had a different problem.  This player made a loud hiss/screech sound in the earphone whenever the backlight was on.  Very annoying whenever adjusting volume or changing tracks.  This one was usable, but shouldn't have to make sacrifices on a new player.  Overall it has great functionality and sounds good and is the pefect player for my needs (jogging), will try one more player to see if the plant that was manufacturing these players was just having a bad week.  If you get one that's well made, I'm sure you will be happy with your purchase.

<Title>fantastic buy
<Date>Wed Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i bought this item shortly after christmas and it is a brilliant buy and reasonable value for money. i listen to 'audio books' as opposed to music, so i cant comment too much on the sound quality, but the mechanics of it are great. it is very easy to use as it only has a few buttons and the dispay is easy to understand. regardless of how many tracks you have, the player recalls where you left each one so you can easily skip through them all (unless you let battery run out while youre listening to it, then it will out you back to the last time you turned the player off.). the earphones could be better as they dont stay in my ears very well, but from reading other reviews that seems to be the case with most mp3 players. the battery lasts for a long time but rechargable batteries are definately recommended to keep your cost down in the long run (and save the environment). the player is compatible with mp3 and wma and takes many hours worth of tracks in wma format- i have around 25 hours worth on mine at the moment and still have loads of room left! (this does depend on the 'quality' level of the tracks you download though, so again, it may be different if you want to listen to quality music.) basically, depending on the format and quality you want, you may need a player with less memory space than you realise- ill never fill mine! i thought id use the radio and voice recorder but havent really utalised either much. its a bit of a gimick and i could have got another 'creative player' cheaper if id chosen one without these features. the radio signal isnt great either and the auto scan only manages to pick up a few channels in most areas. overall i would recommend 'creative' as a make. when my first player arrived faulty i returned it directly to them instead of through 'amazon'- they swapped it quickly and without a fuss. i did have to foot the initial cost of the return postage, but other than that it was very good prompt service.

<Title>Easy to use
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been very happy with the TX FM 512.  I thought about buying the creative muvo micro because it was supposed to be small, but I think that TX FM is about the exact same size.  The thing that I really like about he TX FM is that it is very easy to plug-in to the computer and transfer music files.  This is nice because there is no need for extra cables to keep track of.  The other thing that I really like is that the MP3 functions are very easy to use.  I'm not much for boring instructions, so I went ahead and checked out the MP3 player without them.  I think that I knew everything that there is to know about it in about ten minutes.    There are a couple of things that could be improved about the TX FM.  The first thing is that the earbuds are big enough to fit in an elephants ear.  There is no comfortable way to use these earbuds.  Also, I really don't like hanging the player from the neck band.  If using it for running or working out, I would reccomend using an arm band.  As for any other issues that other people have mentioned, I believe that the firmware download fixed all of them.

<Title>Dead after 6 months..
<Date>Tue Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have the Creative MuVo TX FM 512 MB MP3 Player. After 6 months of no problems my player just shut off on me yesterday. It would turn on, then after 20 seconds, it would shut off. I swapped out the battery, still nogo. I formatted the drive and tried listening to just the radio, nogo. I loaded the new firmware from Creative's site, nogo. So now I'm stuck w/ a broke MP3 player. Creative wants $50 to fix it. BEWARE: Their warranty is good for 90 days (not 12 months). I went to Creative's forum and it seems that ALOT of people have this same problem but yet Creative does nothing about it.  I wish I had bought an Ipod. Creative sucks. Their products work for a few months then crap out on you!!

<Title>Tx fm vs N200
<Date>Mon Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was deciding between the MuVo tx fm and the MuVo N200.  The basic difference between them is the N200 is smaller, lighter, lower cost, and has an input jack to record from an external source.  The Tx fm is slightly larger and heavier(but still very small and light in my opinion), and does not need a separate connector to hook up to the computer to download.  So for me it boiled down to an external input or convience to download.  Eventually over time I tend to misplace the external connectors so I chose the MuVo Tx FM.  So far I am very happy with it.  I just plug it in to download new music (I don't have to search for the extra cable).    It is kind of a pain as someone else mentioned to switch between FM and MP3, but I don't change over that often so it's not really a problem.  Amazon might filter this section out so I separated it.  It has to do with price and convience.  In the end I did not buy it from Amazon due to the price difference.  I had sent in several "found a cheaper price elsewhere" but the price was never adjusted.  I was also worried about service if it came D.O.A.  Amazon actually had the advantage there since they ship this product out of Office Depot, but the price difference almost paid for the extended service contract.

<Content>El reproductor de mp3 muvo 512MB es un excelente producto, las canciones se escuchan bastante bien. El mendel reproductor es muy intuitivo y tiene varias funciones adem�s de reproducir FM, entre ellas, ecualizador (incluso lo puedes personalizar), cambiar el idioma, bloquear los botones, entre otras.   Lo que me agrada es el software organizador que trae consigo, ya que compila bien las canciones incluso a 128Kbps, dej�ndolas con un buen volumen. Sin embargo siento que no es buen reproductor ya que no he podido conseguir el ecualizador.  Lo que no me agrada son los aud�fonos, pensque iban a ser m�s ergon�micos. Otra cosa que no me agrada es que por lo menos el que comprtienes que subirlo por lo menos 2/3 partes del volumen para escuchar algo, es decir que m�s de la mitad del volumen es in�til, sin embargo la �ltima tercera parte tiene lo suficiente como para poder escuchar tu m�sica favorita bien alto.

<Title>Great mp3 player for ppl who are active and want the basics
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>There are a lot of mp3 players out there nowadays, and I think it's just a matter of finding the one with the features that you want/need for the best price...  What I like most about this mp3 player is the fact that it does not need xtra cables to transfer data files.  I also like the way it navigates, like how it uses the scroll wheel for skipping tracks, as well as a separate volume button (though some ppl might prefer the joystick-type controller that other players, e.g. iriver has).  It is very light, and since there are no internal moving parts, like all other flash players, it is highly appropriate for active tasks, such as working out.  The player is also great in that it has an FM tuner that works well.  One bad thing about the player: the backlight causes high-frequency background noise while a song might be playing... in other words, if you are playing a song, and decide to change the volume or change a setting, or switch to the next song, the backlight will turn on and you will hear a tiny noise in the background.  Of course, I don't really need the backlight on anyway, so I turned it off completely (this also conserves battery life ;) )  Overall, I've only had the player for a couple of days, but I am highly satisfied.  It is light, it is thin, it does not need cables, and it takes in standard AAA batteries that can be found anywhere.

<Title>Excellent sound and features for the size and price
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own two Creative Muvo TX FMs and I am very pleased by the performance and features.   Pros: - Excellent sound - Equalizer with custom setting and presets - Ability to delete files while playing them - Comes with software but you can use it with other programs like Musicmatch, or simply use Windows Explorer to drag-and-drop files and folders onto the Muvo like any other drive  - It keeps the folder structure you create - Fairly fast USB 2 file transfers - Uses standard AAA battery so no waiting for it to recharge - Several playback modes; shuffle, repeat, play one folder, play all folders, others - Amazing number of settings and ease of use for such a small player having only 4 buttons - Easy to skip songs or adjust volume without looking at it; good for jogging or for driving while playing it through your car stereo - Good FM radio  Cons: - Tiny display - The maximum sound output is fairly low. Okay for the furnished ear buds or the lightweight headphones I use but a bit weak for driving an FM transmitter or the powered speakers I use with it. - It can't compete with hard drive players that store thousands of songs; but then it's 1/5 the price and not intended to hold a big music library.  I first bought a 256 MB version, then a 512 when the price came down. I don't need a 1 GB version, though the price of them has come way down, since it is so quick and easy to change files. 512 GB lasts long enough for most trips.

<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own 4 different generations of the Muvo devices.  I started with the Muvo FM 256 for use[...]  Loved it in everyway.  So much that I bought a Muvo 128 on sale somewhere for my son to use.  Then, I bought the Muvo FM 1 Gb to get more room and then bought the 512 when I saw it on sale as a backup.  Only 1 drawback I can see, the sound isn't as loud as I would wish it to be, but hey!  It's only got 1 itty bitty AAA battery... whadda ya' expect?  15 hrs of playing time is worth the tradeoff and the thing hardly weighs more than a pack of gum. PS  The included earbugs stink.  Most of them do.  Get a pair of Sony's fontopia (sp?) and you really 'see' the sound the Muvo's can put out.

<Content>Any kid could figure out how to use this, which dosen't say much for us adults. I did manage after some playing around to see how easy it really is. It will do folders so you can drop whole albums straight from your PC or single songs if you like. It will show up as an external drive even without the software which I have not even loaded. While the WMA files I am using save space even at the highest quality they still sound slightly compressed, this tells me the unit will give you all the detail in the music you need. It seems durable as I have droped it and it still works fine. The battery life is slightly less if you play it at high volume, If you run it into a sound board you will need the extra drive, also if your headphones are less efficent. Overall the best feature is it plugs straight into your USB with no cables. This is a good unit I fit seven complete albums on the 512 I think I need a 1g now. Have fun! Ray

<Content>Google the MUVO for memory problems, and you'll find several bulletin boards complaining about dead MUVO players with no acknowledgment of a systemic problem from Creative. I also had an external USB sound card up and die one day from Creative. They are not yet good at making external audio devices.  Don't buy unless you want a cheap MP3 player and you don't care if it dies. Otherwise you will spend half its cost ($25) on a replacement after 3 months, even if it is still under the hardware "warranty".

<Date>Sun Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>its a little bigger than a lighter. learned to use it within 10 minutes without even reading the manual. good sound, not overwhelming but nice. the volume does go up to 40, but volume 0-20 is barely a whisper. i usually leave it at 25 or above. FM radio, and u can record it! u can delete songs on the fly. long battery life. and it has a usb plug on it. NO CABLES to funble with or lose or misplace. just seperate it from the battery part, plug it into a usb port, then drag and drop songs. u basically operate the entire mp3 playa with a little jog dial thingy. its super easy. also has a couple EQ settings. the software that came with it is not needed at all. oh and the earbuds that came with it are kind of bulky. too big to stay in my ears when tugged on even just a bit. but i bought new headphones when i got my muvo so i didnt mind. LOVE IT!

<Title>Nice Little Player!
<Date>Thu Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I shopped around for a while before deciding on this player. I figured 512MB was enough storage space for me. It's very simple to drag & drop files into it from either the supplied software or right from Windows. A couple of minor complaints - first, it could go a little louder. Whenever I'm outside or in a noisier place, I have the volume near max. Also, and I don't know if this is common to all flash-drive players or not, but it sorts your files (album tracks) alphabetically, so the tracks play out of order unless you rename them as 01-whatever.mp3, 02-something else.mp3, etc. Other than that, I'm extremely pleased with the player. It gets good battery life from the 1 AAA battery, it's easy to connect to a computer - no cords required, the display is small, but very functional, and it's pretty easy to use.

<Title>Always getting better
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Just got mine. In response to a few of the other reviews, note that a recent firmware update (as of 9/19/05) allows for folder navigation three deep from the root. Terrific sound, and so far, easy to navigate.  However, the installation was a mess. The Install CD mine came with wouldn't work with the newest version of Quicktime. Nothing I tried would get it running, including uninstalling and re-installing QT.   Eventually I just installed everything directly from the Creative webpage, including the firmware update, and that worked fine.  It comes with a bunch of very helpful software, including one that batch-translates audio files from one version to another (including mp3 to three different flavors of WMA).   I would give it 5 stars, but the messy install drops it to 4.

<Content>Have been very happy with this little player.  Like others, I am thrilled with ability to plug the player directly into the computer.  Great design.  I did have one problem with the first unit I purchased, so be sure to thoroughly test during the trial period!  The first unit would slowly increase in volume from 1 to 30, then when it hit 31 it would make a huge jump in volume!  As luck would have it, the volume at 30 was way too low and 31 was way too loud.  Back it went for a quick and easy exchange.

<Title>Great little device.
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing is about the size and weight of a cigarette lighter, and yet holds a huge amount of music that is as simple as click-and-drag to load onto the thing.  It has a wonderful and easy-to-use menu system accessed by the toggle wheel.  The FM radio works really well and I have had no problems with reception.  I have not used the audio recorder part of it, but it is cool it has one.  It is astonishing to me that so much can come in such a small package.  Most importantly, it SOUNDS really good.  The sound I get through the earbuds seems better to me than my son's ipod shuffle.  For the money, I do not think this little thing can be beat.

<Title>It's a great gadget but ...
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>try it in the store first.  In order to make it so small (like a pack of gum), it only has 3 controls.  On/off, volume up/down, and then the magic scroller thingy.  It's the thingy that controls all the features they have crammed into this marvel, and it's both a blessing and a curse.  I purposely bought this for a recent trip to Japan because I had to have tunes on the plane and then on the trains, it had to be light as can be AND I didn't want to have a rechargable battery to have to worry about.  Blessing because it gives you access to everything the Muvo has to offer, curse because it can be pretty tricky to use.  If you are, shall we say, somewhat clumsy or have large fingers or even just plan to continually access features like change folder or random access or changing radio stations, you could be in trouble.  I'm considering getting an iPod simply because the controls are so much easier to access.  I also have the volume control problem mentioned by others (at a certain point the volume jumps dramatically, I should have done an exchange but the trip was looming).  FM reception is amazingly good, and it stores a whole bunch of presets.  I haven't had the problem others have mentioned of tracks being loaded alphabetically, alhthough I did run into that with another MP3 player.  With the Creative, I use Windows Media Player to rip my CDs, it creates a file folder for each CD and the tracks inside stay in original order.  Drag the icon onto the Muvo, no problem.  So to sum up, you get an amazingly versatile MP3/radio player in an incredibly small package, but you trade off easy access to its many features.  Apparently it records as well.  You really need to test drive this puppy before you buy.  The AAA battery is a lifesaver if you plan to do any travelling, easiest thing in the world to replace, and since it's a USB unit you literally just plug it into your computer's USB port and lock and load.

<Content>Don't bother with this player.  I've had mine for 5 months and it has stopped working.  I run with it so it gets jostled around, but that's the beauty of this design -- it's supposed to be able to handle that.  NOT TRUE.  I have not dropped it or abused it.  It started turning off on its own.  I replaced batteries and no change.  It stopped savings setting changes.  Now it has just stopped working.  Save your $100 and buy something else.

<Title>Excellent, better than an iPod shuffle
<Date>Mon Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>have been using creative products for over 10+ years - started with soundblasters and now in mp3 and they have been making excellent products from then to now.   What do I love my muvo ?  + Cute and compact  + Nice looking LCD display (ipod shuffle does'nt have this)  + MP3 & FM (ipod shuffle does'nt have FM)  + Record FM radio into mp3 (not in ipod shuffle)  + Record your own voice & lectures (not in ipod shuffle)  + No need for custom software(ipod shuffle requires custom s/w)  + FM Presets - store your favourite channels  + Easily available batteries (AA)  + Flash drive, no micro drives (which have moving parts)  + International FM tuning support - US FM channels are like 101.3, 97.3 etc, but in India, frequencies are 91.0, 101.0. Some FM tuners do not even tune to .0 frequences. But Muvo has been made flexible enough to tune to all frequencies   What I do not like about muvo ?  - Wish if they had made the mp3 player seperate from the USB memory so that you could plug any memory card into the mp3 player. So I buy a 256 MB player, but if I want to expand it to 1 GB, I just buy a different memory stick.   - Better quality earphones with volume control in the earphone cable   I also own an ipod shuffle 1 GB - which is pretty good as well, but i like my muvo better.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My husband has the 512 MB version (blue), and I've been messing around with it when he goes to work. (Ha!) We have similar music tastes, but I tend towards harder rock and Rush. So, I decided to get my own...but with larger storage capacity! (I just received my Creative MuVo 1 GB player yesterday, and I LOVE it! It's the same as the blue 512 MB device, but it's red and has greater storage capacity.)  We both shied away from MP3 players because we didn't think we would use them much and that they's be difficult to use. Not so! My husband, who is not computer tech savvy, figure his out in a day! And he showed me how to rip and transfer last night, so now I'm good to go, too.  The 512 MB version comes in a beautiful blue color, is very slim, light as a feather, and very easy to use. It also comes with a clear plastic case for slipping onto jeans or pants. Also included is a black velcro band in case you want to attach the player onto your arm while jogging. The earbuds that comes with the player seem a bit big for my ears, so I'll likely buy a headset to replace them...but the earbuds sound great!  You can use the backlight, but I shut mine off to save on the battery. I've listened to my husband's for hours and never saw the battery go down, but he says that the battery life isn't that long (we'll see!).  If you're hooked up to the internet while ripping your CD's to something like Windows Media Player, then you get the titles of the songs which will show on the LCD screen. (Otherwise, you'll have to tag them manually by typing in tht titles. Ugh.) Getting music on your player is easy as:  1. Ripping CD's/songs to Windows Media Player (or other program) 2. Plugging the player into the USB port on the front of your harddrive (I have a Gateway PC. You can use the ones in the back, too, though.) 3. Choosing which folder or songs you want from My Music in your documents 4. Send to E: drive 5. Safely remove hardware 6. Enjoy your music!  It's really that easy (for those who aren't technically inclined when it comes to MP3's.)  You can skip entire folders with a touch of a button, shuffle, repeat songs, repeat SECTIONS of songs with an A-B mode, and more. I haven't fiddled with the EQ yet, but my husband says that the pre-sets (Rock, Jazz, etc.) are horrible. Mine are flat in the middle and sound great...but I'll mess with that later today.  In addition to music, I look forward to using this player for audio workshops (especially as a reviewer) and for meditation/guided imagery tracks. I don't think I'll use the FM or voice recorder, but those are a nice bonus.  In my opinion, the Creative MuVo 512 MB player is well worth every penny! However, if you want more storage capacity and don't mind paying around $30 more dollars, you may want to get the red 1 GB version which is *exactly* the same except for storage capacity.

<Title>Great until it stops working
<Date>Sun Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wasted so much time on my Muvo that I didn't want to spend any more time thinking about that blasted thing. But I have gotten so much from other people's reviews on Amazon that I figure I should donate my 2 cents worth.  It was good in the ways that have been listed in other reviews. But then the on/off button stopped working. You can't reset the player or upgrade the firmware or anything if that happens. This is a common problem; Google it if you doubt me.  It works as a flash drive, FWIW. But I could have bought one much cheaper, and not been disappointed when I lost all the other functionality. The functions I wanted in the first place.  Needless to say, Creative doesn't care in the least. They pretty much expect you to throw these away after 6 months. Good for their business, but I'll never buy another Creative product again. Used to be a fan, but that was before they ... oh who cares? Just don't buy anything from Creative unless you buy an insurance policy as well. And factor that into the cost of the unit.

<Title>Really nice & features packed
<Date>Tue May 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player for my son (16 y.o.) in Jan 2006. It is a small little marvel of technology packed with features. It has many things going for it, like an audio equalizer with preset modes or completely manual control on 5 bands, nice LCD display, and of course has a radio FM receiver built in. The nicest thing is that you just plug it in the USB port and it appears as another removable drive on your computer Explorer. No other software needed.  Oh, yeah, it also records sounds as it has a built in microphone and it can even record from the FM radio directly. However, it has a few negative things, which are the reason I gave it only 4 stars. For one, do not expect the controls to be very easy to use, after all it is kind of hard to control so many features with basically 4 buttons. Nevertheless, it is doable but it helps if you read the instructions. Secondly, after three months, my son started to complain that it does not &#8220;connect&#8221; to the computer all the time and he had to push it toward one side in order to be &#8220;seen&#8221; by the computer. I was able to open the case and re-do the soldering joints of the USB port (I have the equipment & knowledge). It did work and at the end was worth it, but looking at the insides, I am a little disappointed at the USB connector not being better mounted to the printed circuit board. Had I not been able to fix it, it would have been a &#8220;throw away&#8221;. Also, it does not allow you to choose which song you play from the folder (but you can choose which folders you play).

<Content>A waste of time and money. The player stopped working after less than a month. Creative sent me instructions to download new software, which I did (wasted an afternoon), and it still did not work. I e-mailed them, but with little hope, given the reviews I just saw on Amazon. It seems like they intentionally put defective products on the market with no concern for their reputation, which used to be good and is now going downhill. Do not buy this product. Save yourself a headache. There must be a better use for your money than throwing it down the drain, which is what you'd be doing if you purchased this MP3 player.

<Title>trouble from the start
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>From the beginning I had connection issues with the hardware and software - my system hanging on me for no good reason.  On a couple of occasions I had to reformat the player, but found that even that was difficult to do (worked on WinXP but not on Win2k).  Maybe used it 10-15 times total over the past year because it's been so difficult.  So tonight I decided enough was enough - I downloaded the latest driver and firmware and installed (or tried to).  The thing hung (once again) in the middle of installation and now is completely dead.  No light goes on, no device recognition on my computer... just dead.  And conveniently, of course, 3 weeks after the warranty expired.  Creative Labs just lost a long-time customer.

<Content>I won't harp on the fact that mine went dead within an hour of using it requiring me to call customer support (at my expense) and download new software to get it up and running again. I Bought mine to listen to downloaded newscasts and music on my way to work. It's fine walking down the street but on the bus or wherever there is any external noise you can't even hear the thing! I read reviews about this product here and there before I bought it. People mentioned the low volume which I didn't think would be a problem because I have sensitive ears to begin with. But, I hear music coming out of the headphones of the person sitting in the seat behind me with their ipod or whatever drowning out what I am listening to! I've tried a couple different headphones as well as boosting the EQ. This thing just ain't got it! If it is not loud enough to hear in these situations what good is it? I have considered buying some of the more expensive ear-plug type in-ear headphones like shure but they are quite expensive and I would probably rather buy another player that works in the first place. This is maybe a good player for someone who lives in solitude or in the country where it is quiet. Not for us city dwellers.

Better sound quality but you can't determine the order of the playlist and the software is awful.  Neither the owner's manual nor the website give much guidance on using the software to transfer music.  And, matching my experience with Apple on the iPod, the first 3 Tech Support - using that term loosely - people never told me I couldn't determine the playlist order and none of them could walk me through how to get the software to work on my computer running XP.  I could have continued to hassle it but life is too short - I went out and purchased a Panasonic Shockwave CD player that plays MP3 files and the sound is shockingly excellent!

Make sure not to just stick this in a full backpack that you'd be inclined to throw on the ground every once and a while.  The armband sort of sucks too.

<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like the design of this player.  It's simple and easy to carry.  I own this thing for almost 6 months and the best thing so far it's it acts as a removable drive and USB key.  Whenever I need to transfer any data/songs I can just plug it in a USB, no cables needed or what so ever.  The sound quality is decent with above average earbuds, but they are a bit big for any human ears and the cable is too long.  I don't like the swing around the neck earbuds, I snapped one earbud already.  Customer service is quite responsive through email, except when you request an RMA.    Navigation of this player is quite simple and easy to use.  No need to use the manual.  Like I said, it also acts as a removable drive, so you don't even need to install its so so software, just copy and paste or drag and drop files.    The only things it lacks are line-in recording and a hold button.  Yes, the Creative nano plus has line-in and everything the MuVo has, but after 6 months of use, I can not emphasize enough the importance/convenience of the USB key function.    All in all, I'm please with the MuVo and I bought another one of 1GB, 512MB didn't seem to be enough memory, but 1GB appears perfect.  If you want a player with decent sound quality that's easy to use and convenient to carry this is it.  If you want more function and features look at iaudio U3/G3 or Samsung T8.

<Content>The product is great, I am surprised the audio recording is as good as it is since the mic is small and integrated into the small gum stick size player.  I love the FM broadcasting, wish it had AM radio as well since I like to listen to sportscasts, the next evolution probably would be an XM version.  The 512mb is good for the average user and the media player also acts as an additional temporary USB storage device you can store documents and files to transfer as well as regular music media files.  My only recommendation to improve the product is possibly Creative can provide a player in a sturdier case since the plastic is very light weight and gives a impression it is easy to break.

<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This mp3 player worked fine for the first few weeks after I purchased it.  It was everything I had wanted in an mp3 player -it was light, small, and came with a strap to put around your arm during exercise.  The FM radio signal was perfect - I never had any problems getting reception and it was really easy to download music.  Having said this, about a week after I started using the mp3 player, I had to change the battery!  I don't use this player often - maybe only an hour or two per day.  I was willing to live with the fact that I had to change batteries every week.  However, approximately 2 months later, the whole player just died on me - it ceased to work.  I sent it back to the manufacturers only to have them tell me that I can't exchange the player for another one - I can only send the broken player back to them for them to fix it.  A month later, they sent the player back to me - only it wasn't the player that I had originally bought!  They sent me a mp3 player 3 times the size of the one I bought and it weighed about 10 pounds heavier!  The customer service was horrible and I am completely disappointed at this product.  I am never going to buy a product from this company again.  My word of advice - stay away from this product - it's not worth the headache.

<Content>I received this mp3 player as a gift, and thankfully I hadn't spent any money on it. I use it when I run, and I love the design, it nicely clips to my belt, and even came with an armband I could clip it to. For some reason, no more than 6 months after I got it, it would randomly turn off, and go through bouts of rebellion where it would work for 5 seconds, then stop, then go again. Very frustrating, indeed. I still use it, because when it decides to work, I'm satisfied with it. I noticed other people have problems with it turning off...has Creative become aware of this?? Also, the headphones are completely unremarkable, and the volume does not go high enough for me! Kind of expensive for being crappy!

<Title>Great affordable MP3 player for active users
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is very well worth the price. Look for Cambridge Soundworks Sale Events and you will get it for much cheaper price. They normally have factory sale every year. I got mine for $70 a year ago. Following are the Pros and Cons about this player  Pros -VERY SMALL size and no moving parts make it ideal for active sports like jogging -VOICE RECORDING works very well, I tried recording some FM stations and the quality was more than acceptable. You can record both voice conversations and FM Radio songs, shows that are being played on this player -IN LINE recording, you can connect other music device or player and feed its output to this player and record the music. Personally I did not use this feature but it could be very useful to someone -FM Radio works well the FM quality is acceptable, features like FM radio and voice recording are not available in leading players from Apple. -Very USEFUL USB CONNECTOR attached to the player itself, so you don't need any usb cable in order to sync data with any computer. -Works on standard AAA battery. If you have NiMH chargeable batteries you are all set. Typical iPods run on proprietary re chargeable batteries and these lasts only 200-300 charges as per their manuals. After this period you have to purchase another battery -Software that comes with MuVo players is really very good. In fact in terms of features its very powerful compared to windows media player, iTunes or real player. You may not find the software as user friendly as iTunes or some other players -Great price for all the features it provides -Best of all since its USB based flash drive, you don't need any software like iTunes or real player. You just drag and drop the songs in the player and you are all set.  Cons -Sound quality and equalizer options not as great as iPods. -User interface ie. buttons on the player are not as good as iPod -No "on the fly" playlists like the one iPod.  Overall this player ROCKS ! If you are looking for neat user interface and on the fly playlists, this player is not for you. But if you are looking for a cheaper player for your jogging, workout times and you also want features like voice recording, fm radio this is THE player for you. If you are looking for greater storage there is a version with 1GB storage available  Remember to update your player's firmware. Creative periodically releases the firmware. Firmware is a software that gets loaded onto the player and gives you all the features, options that you use in order to listen to your music or record music on the player.  HTH

<Title>MUCH better than an iPod (aside from storage space)
<Date>Fri Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>For me, 512 MB is enough.  I just got it today and i can put 110 songs onto it.  It doesnt sound like much, but if an average song is 3 min long, thats 110 x 3 = 330 min which is 5 1/2 hours of music.  Thats a mix of MP3's and WMA's (more mp3's).  Pleanty of music!    Now lets see, does an iPod have an included arm band? NO.  A protective case with belt clip? NO.  Voice recorder? NO.  Radio? NO.  Flash drive? NO.  1 AAA battery (instead of a rechargeable battery that runs down after time) NO.    My roomates both have iPods (a 20gig and a 4 gig) and they spent so much more money on those, and I have more features than they do (i got mine at J&R computers for $110 shipping included)!  Sure, I have less space, but if you need more space, get the 1gig version of this player.  I dont see whats so special about iPods, I think its just the new trend.  The only downside of this player???  No clock?  I guess a clock could be nice...  Overall I LOVE THIS PLAYER and will cherish it for a LONG TIME!  FORGET THE DUMB IPODS!

<Title>Good product; poor instructions
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It took me a long time to get this device going.  Even after downloading the detailed instructions, I found the directions inadequate. An error message I got was not explanatory. I admit I am a novice with MP3 players, but I have used computers in my work for over a decade and I have an advanced degree. Finally, it was a little annoying to see the price had dropped significantly from the time I ordered it until now.

<Content>Easy to use, CD quality sound, good battery life.  It comes with a nice arm strap and carry case, but I like to use a lanyard.  That's the only thing missing from this excellent product.

<Title>great deal- just a few quirks
<Date>Sun May 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>BATTERY LIFE - great, not exactly what they claim, but i like that it takes one little AAAbattery so i can carry an extra and swap out anytime rather than worry about recharging. i would like if the removable flap wasn't so flimsy. i'm afraid i'll break it when i change batteries.  DESIGN - i LOVE LOVE LOVE the built in USB! i use it for emergencies when i need to save computer data as well as for music... but alas, as everyone says- get the biggest one you can- 512 fills up fast!   SCREEN - don't be fooled by it's size- the quality is excellent for black/white! it even has a variety of language fonts- that come in handy for my korean music!   -you don't need the software, drag and drop is easy enough. my complaint is that i can't rearrange the order of my songs within a folder- previously i had an MD-player which let me edit songs and rearrange order AND folders -all without linking to a computer!   -needs- a HOLD feature. i have already wasted a few batteries when it accidentally got turned on in my pocket.  -the CASE it comes with is USELESS also- it only covers the one side of the player! my screen had a crack in it within the first month- as it was a gift, i was caring for it like it was made of glass! -but left it on my desk one night- and the next morning i had a heart attack! ...fortunately, it hasn't disturbed its functioning properly. -just a superficial scar~  still- i LOVE it! perfect size -perfect functionality -perfect gift for anyone who wants gadget sure to get ooo's and ahh's!

<Title>ATTN. MAC USERS
<Date>Sun May 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a Mac user and was not sure this player would be compatible with my system because no where in any product description does it say Mac compatible.  HOWEVER, it does work with my Power Book G3, I did not even have to install the software, I just plugged in the USB and dragged and dropped my MP3 files.  Works great!  I had a SanDisk Cruzer Micro and although that worked with my Mac, it was a piece of junk.  Bad quality etc.  This Muvo on the other hand is a much nicer piece of equipment, no battery cover issues, gets loud enough, easy to use and small but not too small!  I did A LOT of research before buying this one and am very happy with it.  I am a runner and needed something reliable that would not break down easily unlike the SanDisk.  (...)  The reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because the software that comes with it is for PCs only and it's website should be more thorough in listing compatabilities.  As a Mac user, I get tired of being left out.

<Title>flimsy
<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have this player for a couple of months now, and also at first I liked it, now when I compare it with my old MD player I see it's not as good I guess it's main problem is rather poor design: - It takes a while to steer to a directory / folder using the scroll wheel. You have to constantly check your progress on the LCD Try to do it while jogging - you're garanteed to bump into someting.  - Speaking of the LCD, the plastic cover over it have cracked within two months. I didn't drop or misused the player but of course wasn't able to convince the Creative warranty service to replace it. Again, my previous player was much sturdier. - Because of the way the on/off button is located it happened many times that the player would turn on while in my purse, draining the battery. Also, if you try to remove the USB unit from the player unit you end up turning the player on.  Summary - buy something sturdier if you plan to use your player every day

<Content>Great Item. Compact, functional, with radio, light and solid at the same time. Quality/cost ratio higher compared to other mp3 players of the same category. Just one small defect: the AAA battery gets exhausted very fast even if the player is off.
