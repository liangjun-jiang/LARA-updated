<Title>Another Sansa winner?
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product tonight to use with the SanDisk FM transmitter for use in my car. I store a lot of streaming audio, plays, books, radio talks, etc., from the BBC and NPR, and they're great to use on a long car journey.  The player was a refurb and cost me all of $17.00 - gotta be great value, especially with the ability to use a 2GB card. Some people have complained about the sound quality - I wonder if they've discovered the equalizer and WOW sound augmentation system. And I use it with a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones as well, so flights are a breeze.  Only negative so far is those floppy covers for the MP3 and mem card slots.  But for the price, you can't beat it.

<Title>Rip OFF!!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this Mp3 player a year or so ago.  The first time I left it in my care over night when it was between 45-55 degrees.  It never came back on.  I then returned the product because I had bought the extended warranty so I got a replacement.  I then gave the replacement to my father in law.  He used it inside and when he went to use it the next day the same thing happened.   These are cheap and terrible.

<Title>Terrible product. Poorly designed, poorly made, don't buy!!!
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife owns the Sandisk 256k (red) flash player which is great, so I figured I'd try this one. After all, it's the same company. Plus, it's a 512k flash player plus expansion at virtually the same price as the standard 512k flash player. What a mistake! The standard Sandisk flash player is solidly built, has an intuitive design, easy to use buttons (even if small), a clear bright blue display, and great sound quality (even when using MP3s at 128kbs). The Sansa has none of these virtues. It is incredibly flimsy; the buttons are nearly impossible to use, the battery door is made of tissue thin plastic and constantly falls off, the sound quality is rotten, and once you put the plastic case on you'll never get if off. Further, while the SanDisk MP3 Flash player plays tracks in the order you place them in the player (very efficient), The Sansa seems incapable of playing songs in anything but alphabetical order, a real problem for someone like myself who likes eclectic music: (one track "Paint It Black" by the Stones; next track "The Prophecy" from "The Fellowship of The Rings Soundtrack"!) On top of this my unit was defective. The lock would lock the sound volume only temporarily. Suddenly music would blare out and nearly bust my eardrums; next I could barely hear a thing. Pure garbage. Get the regular Sandisk MP3 Flash player or get an iPod for twice the price and a thousand times the value. This product is pure junk!!!!

<Title>Not great, but works for me.
<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Tight case and terrible headphones aside, for 81.00 dollars, I was pleased with the product. Using a different pair of headphone I thought the sound quality was good.  I stretched out the case alittle and have no problems there.I generally use mp3 that are 160 or higher so I was pleased with the sound.  A firmware upgrade would make it a better player. I have contacted sandisk about the upgrade. Hope they are listening. Great for playing audible books on tape (you can use the highest quality file format). Transferring all files was quick and easy. I'm using a 512 mg card that I already owned and can fit tons of songs. The sd cards can be found for low prices if you shop around. All in all for the price I am very pleased with the player.

<Title>Not as bad as I thought at first
<Date>Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I still like the their joystick players better, but I need to modify some of my previous comments: 1. The sound quality is pretty good - after you replace the headphones and fiddle with the equalizer and SRS settings. 2. The click wheel for changing volume and settings operates raggedly.  3. It is much clumsier when strapped to your arm than the joystick player. 4.It is extremely difficult to get out of its clear plastic case without damaging the case - but you can correct this by wiping a very fine layer of talcum powder on the inside (got that from a forum).  5.Most annoyingly, whenever you turn it off and back on it forgets all of it's settings.  You have to reset the volume, the equalizer, and the play order - you can correct this by reformatting the flash memory.  It must be formatted in FAT 32.  It comes natively formatted in FAT 16   I'd bump it up to 3.5 stars but they won't let me change that on an edit.

<Title>good quality, good value, great "starter" mp3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the sansa for 3.5 months now, and have had no major complaints. Works well, easy to use, battery life is above average(I am still on 1st battery, and I use mp3 all the time). It is great for running or working out, won't skip like some hard disk mp3 players.   Is it the best sound in the world? No. But it is adequate, and other buds or headphones can be purchased. The only thing I would change is the playlist function. But putting songs in folders in order and renaming can fix this. It really does not bother me at all. How many entire albums are you going to listen to in a row anyway? Most times it is used while exercising, on the subway, on a plane, etc.  Overall, I highly recommend this little guy, you won't be disappointed!

<Title>Simple to use, inexpensive, and good
<Date>Mon Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After reading some of the reviews, I hesitated before buying this.  I've been looking for a flash drive to store more audible files and finally decided to buy this. I haven't had it long but I'm delighted with it.  The player is simple to work without looking at the manual.  It uses only 1 battery. I've replaced the enclosed earplugs with better quality ones and the sound is excellent.      I know some have complained about the wheel.  This is the first player I've had with a wheel and, possibly because of this, I've had no problem with how it feels.  My other flash player is an Iriver which has some additional features but is more complicated to use and far less intuitive.      The player is very light.  There are few parts to break and it seems sturdy. It also comes with a one year warranty.  Most other players I've checked out have a much shorter one.      A final plus is its exapandability.  I've been using a  512mb player for some time and haven't needed more space.  If I ever do, it's nice to know I can add it.  Addendum:  I've been using the player daily.  I still love it and find it easier than my iriver.  There is 1 glitch I've found re auto-resume.  Several times, while listening to an audible book, the player has come on back at the initial index instead of where I left off in the book.  It appears that to auto resume the book I need to press the start button very briefly.  If I press it for several seconds, the player opens at the settings index instead. Those having problems with auto resume might try this.

<Content>I have been satisfied with this product. It was simple to load songs on to the player. The operation is very straight forward and easy to understand as well as implement. The ear buds were different than I was previously acquainted with but after a short time, they were comfortable. They also provided an excellent quality of sound reproduction. All in all I am very happy with my purchase and would make this same purchase again if I had the need to do so.

<Title>Nice little player...
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Nice mp3 player, gets the job done. The FM tuner is a definite plus. The user navigation is ok. There is an upper right click-wheel is for scrolling and another button on the side to select a menu option, and the buttons on the front for song/radio navigation. Call me spoiled but I've gotten use to the consolidated buttons and menu navigation of my Ipod. I'm more comfortable navigating this with two hands, but that doesn't bother me.  The size is small; it fits in the palm of my hand. I actually like how this player looks. The main reason I got this was because it is flash-based and I can work out with it without worrying about jostling parts. And also because it's expandable. I use it with a 1GB SD card. That's a BIG plus.  Drawbacks are ones that have already been mentioned by other readers, e.g. doesn't have an auto-resume reader, but I don't listen to audiobooks so that's not a big issue for me. One minor annoyance is how the songs are automatically sorted by song name ascending. I know I can rename the songs with a number in the track title like others have mentioned, but that requires more work than I'd like. Also, I haven't figured out how to create a playlist, or if that can even be done. It allows the user to choose from album, artist, songs, and some other options, so I don't think there's a way to make a mix of various songs. If anyone has figured it out, please post it.  Uploading songs is simply enough. Connect the USB cable from player to PC and create folders and just drag and drops songs with Windows Explorer. You can also copy songs off the player back to PC, which is nice.  Battery life is fine with me. I used up the batteries that shipped with this in about a day I think and shortly after got NIMH rechargeable AAAs. If you use this with an external SD card, it's going to consume more battery power...  Headphones are ok; I've never been a fan on the in-ear design though.  The plastic case that came with the player drove me nuts the first week or so. It was skin-tight and I almost ripped the case the first few times trying to get the player out to change the batteries. But now it's loosened up and works fine. I'm withholding a star on this review for lack of belt clip on the case. This might sound minor, but I'm not a fan of the included arm band when working out and so I have to put it in my pocket or hold it. It's small but not ultracompact so a belt clip would have been nice. I haven't found another case that would fit this that includes a belt clip either. If Sandisk offered one, I would purchase it.  And something I found out when I first got it...you need to leave about 4MB of space from the Sandisk 512MB that's included on the player for its software to work. (And note to Sandisk: you have a spelling error on the error message that comes up if there isn't enough space).  Let's see what else...I took the plastic port and SD card covers off, those aren't going to stay on, but no biggie. It also comes with a stopwatch function in the software. I like the Sound Effect and Equalizer features of the software, and that it can also play WMA files. And I don't know if I am the only one experiencing this but sometimes when I listen to the radio, the volume level seems to drop about two levels on its own. It happens rarely though; not yet to the point where it's become an issue.  Overall, I like this player. I looked at various models before deciding on this one because it had both an FM tuner and was expandable. Compared to other players in its price range, the included features are great. I would purchase it again.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was quite disappointed with my purchase.  Cons: 1) I could not figure out how to control the order of the song playing.  It would only play in random or alphabetical order.  I would have to change the file names for all the music files to make sure that the files play in the same order as the CD. 2) The SD slot was practically useless.  I have a 1GB chip and everytime the player powered-up it would spend about 5 minutes examining the files on the SD looking for new files. 3) This is the big one.  I was listening to the player in the car when I dropped it on the carpetted floor - it went dark and has not worked since.  New batteries could not bring it to life.  After spending a hundred on this, I have a dead MP3 player.

<Title>Pretty good piece of music equipment
<Date>Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This mp3 player is pretty darn good.  It is light weight, easy to handle, and fairly inexpensive ($103 from Amazon).  I bought the Sandisk over the Rio and RCA offerings because Sandisk, at least in my research, didn't seem to have the number of complaints about product quality and lack of customer support that the other two brands had.  Also, it seems as if getting at least a 512MB flash memory player with an expansion slot is going to cost around $100.        This player represents the second Sandisk mp3 player in our household.  We were impressed with the ease of use and tranfer speed of the 512MB flash memory player (with no expansion slot).  The Sansa player is no different.  It is literally drag and drop on to the Sansa.  The number of features also put it over the top versus the RCA and Rio.  Overall, you can't beat the usefullness of this little gadget.  Pro's:  --Small size, light weight --USB 2.0 file transfer speed (transfer 100mb worth of songs in seconds) --Backlight display --Plays mp3 and WMA (you can put both on the player at the same time and it doesn't even blink) --Radio reception is fairly decent here in the hills, but still won't pick up all of the available stations in your area (none of the small mp3 players on the market get anything more than decent reception so don't use this as a selling point regardless of what you buy) --Sound quality is decent even when playing songs at 64Kbps.  If you use this compression level, get good earphones. --Lots of features including a customizable 5-band eqaulizer with presets, WOW surround sound simulator, and other sound effects.  Also, has stopwatch timer and a host of other settings you can play with. --Battery life is excellent.  Not as good as some, but still near the top of players that have good battery life. --It comes with pouch, armband, earbuds, usb cable.  Minor Con's: --When you purchase this player, buy headphones.  The included earbuds are pointless as the sound quality is barely adequate and the included 3 sets of earbud covers can't keep the earbuds in my ears. --The battery cover door comes off fairly easily.  It looks like it's on there pretty tight but it's not.  I think Sandisk did this because of the many complaints that the battery covers on their mp3 players were too difficult to remove causing many people to break the battery cover (like my fiancee did with her own player). --Your music files need to be properly tagged. I thought my files were appropriately named but this player doesn't seem to recognize the songs.  I think the ID3 tags on my music are not correct as the player will display the music title you typed in but it will also show the album, song title, and artist as unknown. --The buttons on the front are hard to push if you are not expecting it.  You just have to adapt to pushing the button deeper than you would think. --The volume is controlled by a rotary wheel on the top right side of the player.  It is very difficult to turn, especially when it is in the holder.  I would have preferred two more buttons on the front or side than the wheel. --Getting the player out of the holder is incredibly difficult.  Wipe of the display of the player and the inside of the plastic holder before putting the player in the holder.  The plastic film that protects the display during transport leaves either static or a light adhesive film on the display that makes it stick to the plastic holder after you put it in.  It took me five minutes and many attempts to get it out before I realized what happened.  Also be careful not to yank off the battery door when pulling the player out of the holder.    There you have it.  None of these gripes add up to more than a minor irritation which is why I gave it five stars (I would have given it 4.5 starts if I could have).  However, having experienced other mp3 players, this one has the best combination of manufacturer product reliability and product support, versatility and expandability (up to 2GB SD card), features, and sound quality.  My finacee has started using my player instead of her own player.     Added on 4/25/05: In my initial review, I forgot to mention two things.  The Sansa ignores your file organization so don't bother trying to setup seperate folders for different genres of music.  This is why I warned before to make sure that the music you have is named and tagged properly because it does allow you to play songs by artist, album, date added to player, and so on (let's hope SanDisk fixes this with some software upgrades).  Also, there is about a 1-2 second lag when switching between songs.  This can get a little annoying at times but you will get used to it. To be fair, one more upside is that I added a 1G SD card (SanDisk Ultra II) and after the initial 60 seconds to read the card and update the playlist, it doesn't miss a beat.  I still really enjoy this mp3 player.   Added on 05/02/05: My Sansa has started to drink batteries like I drink Coke.  Not sure why; it could be using extra juice to read music on the SD card.  I may have to purchase rechargeable batteries if this keeps up.  I got 6 hours of playing time out of my last battery.  My fiancee's Sandisk (a flash memory player, no expansion slot) goes about 15 hours on a AAA battery.  Not sure why the huge discrepancy between our two Sandisk players but my best guess is that my batteries are being drained reading the memory card.  It would be helpful if someone out there with some knowledge about this would write a review.    Added on 0725/05: After having a chance to live with the player for a few more months, I have to downgrade the rating to 3 stars.  The player has become harder to live with.  It plays reliably and the sound is good but it is still drinking batteries like crazy and the rotary volume knob hasn't loosened up much.  Sandisk hasn't offered any software upgrades to address the lack of being able to organize your files any way you want to and it is still very difficult to remove the player from its holder.  Having owned several makes and models of players before, this is still better than those players because each of those players died 2-8 months after purchase.  Shop around and get what sounds good to you.

<Date>Tue May 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this player for one reason:  It's the cheapest device compatible with Audible and AudioFeast.  The integration with AudioFeast isn't elegant, but it works and I'm happy I can now easily use both services without all the workarounds necessary on my other player, which I now just use for music.  The interface will never be confused with that of an iPod, but with relatively limited memory that shouldn't be too much of an issue.  It's a pleasure to now be able to listen to public radio programs like This American Life and Talk of the Nation whenever I want.  I can highly recommend this player for users of Audible and AudioFeast, but if you don't subscribe to those services and just want it for music, there are better designed players available.

<Title>Close but no Cigar (or iPod)
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the e130, for about a month, it is a small light weight player that works well enough, but has one MAJOR draw back for me, it is unable to play tracks in their album track order. Basically this player only plays tracks in a shuffle mode or in alphabetical order.  You could rename all your tracks (as SanDisk support suggested to me) but if you have a large MP3 collection, this would be absurd.  Also you need to plan to spend at 1-2 times the cost of the player if you want to add an additional 1-gig or 2-gig memory card.  Use of the memory card also uses up the battery faster.  If you're not using the memory card, take it out.  I would suggest that if you are considering this player, plus a SD 2-gig card, you better be prepared to shell out at $250 dollars or more.  For that that kind of money, ante up another 50 dollars and get a 20-gig iPod, if size is not an issue or an iPod Shuffle if it is.  Sorry SanDisk, but you missed the mark with this one.  Maybe they can create a firmware update and fix this issue.... Who knows?

<Title>5 stars???  Are you kidding?
<Date>Fri Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I simply cannot believe this unit got rated 5 stars.  Those reviewers probably never owned a decent MP3 player before.  This player is mediocre at best.  Pro: NONE  Con: 1) Loose battery door, it falls off easily without even have to pull on it 2) High-tech lookin' but lousy earbuds, they can't even take the bass produced by the WOW enhancement; there are sooo much distortion when WOW is turned on. 3) horrible sound quality, I can hear every bit of artifacts of a 128kbps MP3 track; Sony network players can process it so well that you can't even tell it's a MP3, but this Sandisk can't 4) 1st grader UI.  The programmer designed the UI for this device must be novice at best.  This is the most cumbersome UI ever, you can't jump/seek/select easily.  You can't play by albums easily.  Thank god it's only 512MB of storage, if I have a 20GB disc-based player using this kind of UI, I would kill myself in a heartbeat. 5) tacky weird buttons, the up down left and right buttons are NOT responsive at all, because they are not discrete buttons, they are actually part of a cutaway plastic. 6) flickering blue backlight, when the output sound is power demanding, you can see the bluelight flicker, very very irritating. 7) non-attached rubber seals (USB and SD doors), you will lose them within a few uses; why bother supply them when they are not attached to the unit? 8) horrible menu nagivation: menu, tracks, album, whatever it is, you will always start from the 1st item; it doesn't remember previous position. 9) ear piercing tremble introduce a lot of high frequency into the sound, I get a headache in 10 minutes everytime 10) the scroller volume control lags like crazy.  in general, response time from button push or scroller clip is very long.  You have a much higher tendency to think "oh that was not loud enough, let me turn it up" yet in fact it takes almost 1 sec for the player to actually ramp up volume, your previous clicks will register when you do the second/third click, which then can over-ramp up the sound and it's way too loud 11) you can't put the unit in "STOP" state, PAUSE is the only state it will be in.  Which explain why skipping track takes a long time, because the unit is trying to load the next song.  Had it be able to stay in the STOP state, it would be a simple quick seek through files without the need to load the actual track. 12) the battery life is no where near what's claimed.  I think the unit is poorly designed that even at its OFF state, it drains significant amount of power.  I had an AAA Duracell Ultra, the battery mysterious drained about 1/3 while in the OFF state for a couple of days...  Sandisk: hire some real engineers and released a version 1.1 firmware soon!!!  Fellow customers: skip this, try a Sony, iRiver, iPod, Creative... anything on the market is better than this.  This unit excels in NO area at all.  There are flaws in every aspect of this device, and those flaws really make this unit a crappy product.  BTW, I don't work for any of Sandisk's competitor, I am just an engineer with a very fine tuned taste and have seen a lot of better players.  UPDATE 6/26/2005: I am now downgrading this player to 1 star.  It seems like at least 3 people found my review "not useful", oh well...  I am surprised that while I read the 5 star reviews, those people are generally complaining about the same things I am, yet they generously give this unit a 5 star.  After a few more days of usage, I am convinced this unit doesn't even deserve 1 star.  A good mp3 player should function well in core areas: sound quality, user interface, battery life and etc...  Unforunately, this unit doesn't do any of that!!!

<Title>Bad Sound Quality, Stupid Software

<Content>I have been using Creative Muvo for a while, which allow you to play songs in a folder. But this stupid Sansa only wants you to sort your music by Artist, Album and ... Anyway, I like to edit play list on my computer and selete maybe only one or two songs from an album. I like to listen to difference singers. But this become very tough with Sansa, you have to either listen to all songs or you have to edit your Tags.   I hope there is a firmware upgrade soon, which allow you to play a specific folder.   The sound quality is so lame, WOW is totally a joke. It is not even comparable with my old Muvo.  The only good think I can say is the SD expansion, but it looks so ugly when you put a SD card in.

<Content>Really ugly mp3 player.  Did the Sandisk designer ever check out the ipod?  Features are just average.  No surprise.
