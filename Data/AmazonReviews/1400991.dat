<Content>If you are a Mac user be careful how you burn mp3 cd's otherwise the samsung MCDHF920TH MP3/WMA/Music CD Playback will surprise you with no disc! Make sure your music "has been converted to MP3 an the extension .MP3 is at the end of each song on the playlist to be burned. Other than that, I do like the unit, don't really care about wma (because Iam a Mac guy) sorry!. I like the 3 way of powering this unit. regular AA or rechargeables, (outside the cd player., nice), proprietary rechargeable,small and thin,very nice. It's own AC charger or without any batteries, acts as a main power unit, that I really like.Also the remote control is handy. In the future I would prefer a unit with only cd,RW,R, and straight MP3. the fm tuner works very well. another plus is the thinness of this unit.  
<Overall>4
