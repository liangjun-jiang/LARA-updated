<Title>Good buy
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought for my children at christmas. Both were able to work the player with no help from me on downloading or settings. (kids are 11 & 14) Sound was impressive with clear highs and good bass. I enjoy the rechargable battery so now my remotes for other devices dont get robbed for their batteries!!! Everything I wanted at an affordable price what more could you ask for?

<Title>PERFECT!
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After listening to my sister-in-laws player, I had to have this!  I got it for Christmas a little over a year ago, and have used it a LOT.  I love the great sound, the tiny size, the radio, the CLIP and the rechargeable battery, easy of use, I could go on and on.  This little player is getting harder and harder to find, and I haven't found anything else that compares!  Why isn't Samsung (or any other manufacturer) making items like this anymore?  I absolutely LOVE this MP3 player, and I am considering a second one just as a backup for when I need another one someday!

<Title>Just Right....
<Date>Mon Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Samsung MP3 player almost a year ago and have been nothing but pleased with this item.  I use it practically everyday, mainly when I'm at work or when I run.  I bought an adapter for my car and use it there as well.  This MP3 player is tough and does have a good battery.  I was a little disappointed at first with the battery life but the longer I've had it the better the battery has performed.    It's perfect when I go running, I just clip it on to my short pockets and forget that it's there while I run.  There is a downside with that, which I've found out twice the hard way, the metal clip is rough and will rub against your skin if you clip it to the top of your shorts.  I still have a bruise from this past weekend from it.  It's my own fault so I wouldn't hold that against this item.  If you're like me and don't need 10,000hrs of music, just a few of your favorties then I recommend buying this.  The screen is bright and also has a clock screensaver, which is good for runners that don't wear watches.  I also like that fact that I can charge this on any computer with a USB, plus I can play my music through any computer by using the USB and the MP3 player.  Great for public libraries or switching between computers.

<Content>Great item with great sound.  Very small and easily clips onto clothing while working out.  The headphones that came with it have very good sound, but were fragile (had to replace it after it fell apart).  Would definitely recommend this MP3!!!

<Content>This is a fabulous little product.  I have an ipod which I use as my home stereo but, the Samsung is what I use for my portable music player as it is durable.  Whether I am jogging or in the car, I grab my Samsung.  Sleek, durable and &lt;$100, what more could you ask for!

<Title>YP-F1X  worked for only 4 months, but worldwide warranty works
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The bad: I bought a YP-F1X (512MB) mp3 player with, FM, voice recording, built-in battery, and a bunch of more features, It worked for about 4 months, after that, it did not work at all!.  The built-in battery which charges only by conecting to a usb port of a computer is good, the bad thing is that you need to have a computer necesarly to charge the battery.  I'd rather have a AA battery compartment to put them in the player, insted of using a computer.  The good: The GREAT thing I have to admit from Samsung, is, the warranty is worldwide and covers all the parts of the player.  Another great thing the player has, is a clip. so you can put the player on your shirt using the clip and works perfectly.

<Title>Unresolved problem
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought one of these players because it is supposed to be able to play Vorbis files (.ogg).  It can, but there is a problem--it hangs at the end of most 160kbps files, requiring a "hard-reset" with a paper clip, which loses all the setting on the device.  I spent two hours one morning trying to get Samsung tech support to acknowledge the problem.  The first hour and a half was spent getting through the "level 1" tech support person.  She kept telling me "we only support Windows Media Player," and I had to keep telling her that this problem had nothing to do with my computer at all.  After a long time, I convinced her to pass the problem up to a higher-level of tech support.  She did, and I spoke with a very gracious and knowledgeable gentleman who tested the problem, and found it to be a real problem on not only my player (the YP-F1X) but on another player he had.  He said that it looked like a problem in the firmware.  That was a month and a half ago, and there has been no fix, nor any contact with me.  All my e-mails have gone unanswered.  My recommendation: nice device if you want to play MP3s.  If you want to play Vorbis (.ogg) files, go elsewhere until they fix the firmware.

<Title>High quality player for the price
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this as a Christmas present and I've been nothing but satisfied in the month since then. I use my player to listen to saved CD tracks as well as downloadable audio books from my local library. The player does just fine with the audio books, which are in the Windows Audio (.wma) format, as well as my CD tracks in .mp3. The audio sounds great and the FM reseption is good when the player can lock into a stereo signal.  With 512MB of space, I have room for several dozen mp3 tracks and a couple of the audio books. I still have room for files that I may want to transfer from my office computer back to the house. Data transfer is easily achieved using the supplied USB cable.  The cable also recharges the built-in Lithium Ion battery and I have found that the advertised play time of about 10 hours is a good estimation. I've found my player particularly nice for long trips when I want to keep myself occupied.  The only thing I have not figured out is how to bookmark places in the long audio book files. I am almost certain that the player supports this function though; that I need to learn how to use it. Also, I have had the player freeze up a time or two when forwarding through tracks. I have always been able to get it to reset though without too much difficulty.

<Title>"Cute" with Ogg Vorbis support.
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When we had some spare money in mid-2005 my wife asked me if she could get an MP3 player. I told her that I would find her players she could pick, because I've already ripped most of our music collection and encoded it using Ogg Vorbis. She said that she was fine with that, on the stipulation that the player we select is "cute". This lead to consideration of several products in the iAudio and iRiver lines, but the YP-F1X was the winner the moment she laid eyes on it.  The YP-F1 series is tiny. They're literally the size of my thumb. The only drawbacks to the form-factor are that it's a bit thicker than players like the iPod Shuffle and the controls are pretty small. This just means that it's probably best used if it's clipped somewhere that you can either see it or easily feel for the controls. The couple of times I've used it I couldn't easily skip tracks without removing the player from my pocket and looking at it.  As mentioned, this player has Ogg Vorbis support. That makes the deal. Ogg files are typically higher quality than an MP3 of the same size. Some notes should be made, though. I've noticed that the higher the ratio of Ogg files to MP3 files the lower the battery life. I'm assuming that Ogg files take a bit more processing to decode than MP3, so that probably translated into more power consumption. A recent roadtrip saw a playlist with mostly Ogg files net a playtime of 5.5 hours from full charge. Also the included PC software does not support Ogg, I don't know why but they simply don't allow you to select Ogg files to put on the player. This typically would not be important, but it appears that the player loses your settings each time you write directly to the player. I did not experience the problems with Ogg files that a previous reviewer did. Most of my files are encoded at quality level 7.  Overall this is a solid player, especially for active people who need Ogg support. If you're going to buy this player I suggest you also purchase a USB charger (search for it), unless you own a laptop. Otherwise this player is not good for travel.

<Title>Occasional problems
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All was well until about the third month of owning it.  It now gets stuck in start up mode every so often.  I have to take the cover off and hit the reset button.  Sometimes that doesn't work and it needs to be done several times.  Read more reviews and decide for yourself.  All in all it's not a bad player.  Simple, easy to use.

<Title>One Tough Player!
<Date>Mon Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm a runner and pretty tough on music players.  When I recently killed my iPod mini (drowned in sweat!) I was looking for a less costly player that I wouldn't be as distraught when I enventually killed it.  So I picked up one of these because the incredibly small size and built in clip.  Recently, I was in the middle of a run and got caught in an awesome thunderstorm that dumped 2 inches of rain in a mere 40 minutes.  I was beyond soaked and bumming because I thought this would be the end of the player.  I turned off the player right as deluge started.  I dried off the player when I made it back home and let it sit for a few hours.  I then powered up expecting the worst and found that it still works 100%.  This is the perfect player for my usage.  I'm gonna buy another and put it on the shelf for when I eventually wear out this one.

<Title>Better Than Expected
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: -Incredibly small.  Like thumb small. -Yet somehow they stuffed a very legible display that has all the information that one could want on it. -Powerful, it can get plenty loud enough to make your ears hurt & I'm pretty used to loud music. -Sleek (verified by 3 other people that saw me with it). -Earphones are better than I expected for being included -FM Tuner is hard to get & this has one (reception for me was pretty good & sound quality was good when station was strong) -Long battery life -Metal Clip, I can't say enough for a manufacturer that actually understands that a plastic clip will eventually break if used enough.  Cons: -New earphones are still recommended -Doesn't like USB hubs or front ports on computers -Small buttons (worked fine for me) -Hard to feel your way around the seek buttons, because they kind of blend in with the unit.  General info: I was more than impressed with this unit.  At first, I was doubtful, because it was so puny.  I started to doubt that the screen would be able to display anything useful.  However, upon plugging it into my computer I was amazed as the high resolution display poped into life.  Though the characters are small, they are very clear & the contrast is good (and adjustable).  However, I was quickly disappointed with the unit, because I found that though I could open the folder for it, I couldn't copy anything to it.  What could be wrong?  Fortunately, I read the instructions & they mentioned that USB hubs could make the unit unstable.  They should include front mounted jacks as well.  I figured that I'd try my rear jacks & suddenly, it worked perfectly.  After that hiccup, I have had no problems.  I proceeded to dump a full 500mb of various MP3s onto the unit & pushed play.  I like that you can set the volume at a certain level for startup, because I've freaked myself out a few times leaving the volume at max when I turned a unit off.  I found that the default sound settings were pretty good (not leaning too much to the bass like some do, but certainly can if you want).  Searching directorys was a bit slow, but not horrible.  The volume button is very usable (without even looking).  I could go on, but I can't think of what else to say, but it has been a great experience & it will be a regular part of my life from now on.

<Title>Pleased with everything about it.
<Date>Fri Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this for my wife for her birthday, and was a little worried about how she would like it as she is not very technically inclined.  She loves it and has completely mastered the various features quite easily.  The size is pefect for sticking in her purse or pocket, and the provided necklace is a much more convenient way to wear it than some of the lanyards that you have to buy in order to wear other MP3 players.  512MB holds way more music than I expected and I am glad that I didn't buy the 1G as I am sure she never would have used all that memory.  The rechargable battery is a big plus too It recharges off your computer through the USB, she simply plugs it into our PC everynight before bed and it is all ready to go the next day, way better than my old unit that requires new 'AAA's every month.  She is so happy with it that I am buying another for myself.
