<Title>Good all in one player
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this player, because this is a device that you can use it as a digital wallet, video player, music player, and pdf viewer.  I bought it at amazon with the price of $367, now is even lower....=(  Those of you likes to have one should get it now!  The speaker is not very good, but if you listen it from a headphone it is pretty good.  Fast download speed with the USB 2.  Battery life is not as long as it said on the techsheet.  My 504 freeze a few time...I think it is because I am pressing my buttons' too fast, you do need to wait for the HDD to run.  But overall I still love this machine...I've already get all the accessories.  You can get the DVR station at Walmart for $79 includ tax.  =D

<Title>Good for Recording DVDs and Television Shows for Later Viewing
<Date>Wed Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm going to keep this simple. I just wanted something that would allow me to EASILY record television shows (I have direct TV) and DVD's onto a portable video player.    I purchased the optional DVR station.    Within a few minutes, I had figured out how to record from my Direct TV satellite box, or from a DVD.  Screen quality is great.  Plus, right before you start recording the television show or DVD, you can adjust the brightness, color, contrast, hue, etc. to suit your tastes.  That is, your're not stuck with whatever the television show or DVD gives you if that's not how you want to view it on the Archos 504.  That's it.  I'm not using it for photos or music, so I can't comment on that.  What I can say is that I'm glad I didn't buy the 80gb iPod, as I didn't want to be limited to what they had for sale on iTunes.  The only way I was going to purchase the iPod was if recording shows was horribly complicated or difficult with the Archos 504.  Just the opposite. It was easy.  You just need to remember to connect from the audio and video OUT on your satellite or cable box or DVD player to the DVR station.  Intially, I connected the DVR station to the front inputs on my DVD player, but that produced nothing as those inputs were audio and video IN.  I had to connect to the BACK of the DVD player and the BACK of the satellite box in order to find the OUT connectors.  And there was no format conversion necessary.  Just recorded it straight off the tv and off the DVD and then watched it on the 504.  I love this thing.  I need to find out more about it, such as battery life, etc.  But for now, I couldn't be more pleased.  I like iPod, but I love Archos.

<Title>NO RAW SUPPORT
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>No RAW file support.  I was told by a coworker that these are great storage devices for a DSLR but if you shoot in RAW you are out of luck.  Now I'm looking in to Epson P-3000, P-4000, P-5000 units because they have RAW support as well all the other functions of this unit (as I can tell).  Perhaps these devices just serve different purposes.  This seems to be marketed as a portable media player whereas the Epson units will play video, audio/mp3, and store photos but aren't marketed as mobile DVRs.

<Title>Besides the unimpressive volume, this thing is great
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a mp3 player from Archos about a year or two ago (I think it was the Gmini 200) and I sadly dropped it and broke it pretty bad so it was time to get a new player.  I was really struggling between getting the Archos 504, Archos AV500, or the Cowon A2.  I ended up picking the 504 because of the extra 10GB of hard drive space and the sex appeal of it :).  I've been using it for about a week so far and these are my impressions:  Pro's: - The player have a very attractive design - hard drive size (40GB for me, but goes up to 160GB) was perfect for me, as I have PLENTY of music and videos to put on it. - The screen is very big, bright and crisp for playing videos or viewing pictures. - The GUI is slightly customizable, allowing you to pick your background picture from whatever pictures you put on the device, changing the color of the text, and the color of the theme. - Plays all my .avi files perfectly (90% of the vids on my comp are .avi) - The battery is a MONSTER! Tested it for audio and lasted 11 hrs.  haven't tested it for video yet. - One minor feature I like is when you're listening to music, it will show the usual info of the song your listening to, while showing what song will be playing next if you pressed the next/fast forward button. It also picks up on album art very well (looks like all that hard working collecting the album art worked out) - Like the fact that you can rate songs, and then play songs based on their ratings. The rating is from 1-5 and you can play all the songs that you rated 5 like a playlist. - can be connected as an external hard drive for drag and drop functionality, or you can connect it in windows media mode, using windows media player to transfer your files. The choice is yours. - and of course, one of the main reasons I liked this player, the removable battery feature  Now for the few things that stops this player from getting a perfect rating.  Cons: - its kinda big.  My old mp3 player could fit into the palm of my hand. to navigate this thing, you definitely need two hands, unless you have some skills i dont know about lol.  If you wear baggy pants, it shouldn't be too much of a problem to fit this in there, but otherwise you might have a hard time.  - there are 3 buttons you use to navigate up, down, left, and right which slows down how fast you can navigate the interface compared to a joystick that my old mp3 player had.   - The volume is not very impressive on this thing.  Granted I'm listening to it with some headphones I've had for two years and it might be time for me to get some new ones, the volume doesn't go as high as I would like.  Wouldn't recommend this for people who plan to listen to audio books as well as music.   - the built in speaker is useless.  You have the option to have it turn on automatically (whenever headphones aren't plugged in) or just turn it off.  I turned it off cuz the volume on it is horrible. it gets distorted at the highest volume, and you can bearly hear anything with the volume turned down below the highest setting.  At the end of the day, this player is pretty good. The low volume on it is VERY disappointing to me because i like to listen to my music loud, but i bought some noise cancelling headphones recently so maybe that will help.

<Title>NO RAW format Support!
<Date>Fri Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The following review is only interesting for photographer:  The main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my Canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. I shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.  I upgraded my Archos 504 from the former AV 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my Canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.  You don't find any Information about storing the .raw format on your Archos... I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.  Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...  Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative.

<Title>The 504 160 Gb is great
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I ordered the optional DVR with this and I think everything works great and is easy to use.  I can set all the shows I watch in yahoo and load them right to the 504 set it in the DVR cradle and it records all of my programs on its own. I just grab it as I run out the door and I can watch all of my shows on the run.  The case it comes with is worthless but I just went out and got a cheap $5.00 camra case and that works just fine.  With 160gb I'm able to carry all of my music and all of the movies I own in my pocket.  with the dvr I can play them on any tv.  So far I'm impressed with the quality of this device.

<Title>IT'S OK BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ZEN!!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product after Christmas and waited with eager anticipation. I also own a Creative Zen Vision W 30gb. I wanted this device because not only am i a music and photo junkie, i'm a video junkie, so i was mesmerized by the idea of all those movies on my portable device and being able to directly record video. I was eager to give this a try with 80gb and a video recorder how could you go wrong!? Out of the box the Archos is a well built attractive device. The navigation is a little tricky (it's not intuitive at all), but for 80gb, a recorder and the price, I was willing to sacrifice. Sound quality is pretty good, but i was shocked at the video quality considering the Archos is first and foremost a video device. I probably wouldn't have been so critical if i didn't own a zen, but the zen has spoiled me, because in comparison the archos lacked color, crispness and depth in both videos and photos. It was just unacceptable in comparison. I don't know what the actual difference in technology is, but they both have the same resolutions so that's not it. If you've never seen a zen vision upclose and personal, you should! But don't do it if you're looking to buy something else, because everything else will pale in comparison. I also purchased the dvd station. The archos is feature rich, so that's not the problem. Well after playing with it for a few days, i returned it. I'm going to purchase the creative zen v 60gb. I would rather do the conversions to put video on it than to sacrifice the picture quality, and the creative does have a compact flash drive allowing it to accept almost anything, the archos is strictly usb. But overall if you need a portable media device that records inline ausio and video, then the archos will fit the bill.

<Title>great PMP
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the PMP at a quite low price. it reads divx and xvid (but not quarter pixel), audio ... drawbacks: as stated on other reviews: the speaker is useless and it seems that the volume can be limited (but it's not greatly unconvenient). you have to buy an adapter for charging the battery (usb is quite slow and you have to rely on a nearby computer) ... seems that archos has learned from apple and the merchandising on ipod. Apart from that, it's a step ahead of other PMPs (great screen!). I'm considering buying the DVR station for recording tv or watching divx on tv.

<Title>works for video/photos, lousy for music...
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why I took a chance and bought the Archos 504 and docking station: -- High capacity storage (I have a LOT of music files -- over 30 gigs) -- Handles WMA music files -- can be set up with a dock and remote to play music through the home and office stereo systems (all while keeping its charge) -- Thought I might get into the video part of this thing in the future -- Hoped for a good screen to display some photos -- Liked the fact that file handling could be done as an installed hard disk using Windows Explorer  Really, I was looking for something primarily to make the home or office music experience really nice with a transportable, high capacity, dockable unit for all my (WMA) music files. The video and photo stuff was secondary, but an interesting plus. Though pricey with the dock, I was willing to buy this if it fit my needs. Alas...  Why I sent it back: After a good part of the weekend and then a subsequent 4 or 5 hours on the phone with Archos tech support, we could NOT get any playlists built (other than one on-the-fly one). Tech support was baffled by this, but the process was laborious even had it been successful. The file handling for photos and videos seems okay, but to do music file handling, this thing is pretty bad and much of it is not very intuitive. (And I am fairly tech comfortable in most regards...) The final straw was this lack of ability to construct playlists, one of the most basic needs of a useful and versatile music player. There was almost nothing about the process that tech support led me through that would have been easy to figure out (you don't wind up synching to Windows Media Player, but you somehow are supposed to use WMP to create the playlists and then save them to the Archos). The whole thing was a labyrinth, and then didn't ultimately even work, no matter how many variations we tried, including trying versions 10 and 11 of WMP. The paper manual was just a quick thing, so not useful at all. Unfortunately, the downloadable PDF manual wasn't much better: mediocre in some areas, terrible or downright wrong in others.   I have finally given up on it having the chance to suit my needs, which is too bad because it seems that there are some very good things about this unit that could make it a real winner. The dock was solid and has lots of connection possibilities, the screen is quite good and clear, and videos and photos seemed to be pretty well managed on some levels. As some people have noted, the volume is fairly low but not bad through earphones, and the quality of sound was quite good. (Don't know why they even bother with the external speaker; barely gets any sound at all, and quality is terrible.) Overall, if you primarily want to do photos and video (and are interested in the option for recording videos) and music is of vastly secondary interest, you might still find this to be a very nice unit. If you are also hoping for high quality, smooth management of music, you will likely be sorely disappointed.

<Title>Amazing, but.....
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Amazing picture and video quality. needs plug-in for certain video format ($20). Sound quality above average but not as good as the Gmini-120. slow charge time unless you but the power supply, an irritating way of Archos to make more money. the device is slow to load, but hey it is not a PC. Battery life is ok, need additional battery if you want to watch movies on long  flights ;-) 80Gb is a dream volume, much better than 20Gb I had in Gmini-120. can't think of a better player, much better than iPod, but Archos was very nasty having people have to buy plug-ins and a charger.

I got the 80 gig and have about 10 full length movies already saved on it for vacation. It's easy to download to, just drag and drop. Picture quality is great, sound great! i don't use it for music at all, only movies and it certainly does what i need it to do.

<Title>Like an exotic sports car - Great performance, poor reliability
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love it and hate it.  If I had to rate its performance, it's an easy 5.  I bought the leather case, the DVR station, and the travel adapter.  Would I recommend it?  Yes and no.  If you love being able to record TV, DVDs, and Video from tape, and of course, being able to watch it anywhere, then this is a great box.  But beware!  This thing broke twice on me.  Within three months the motherboard just went dead - for no reason.  I didn't drop it, submerge it, etc..  It just died.  Fortunately, they replaced it because it was within warranty.  They couldn't fix it, so they gave me a brand new one and even re-issued the plug-ins that I had purchased.  That was both annoying because I lost all my content, and pleasing because I got a brand new one.  Longer life - or so I thought.  They didn't hassle me either.  But the new one also died after about three months.  The second death was because the hard drive went bad.  I was forced to reformat it.  Now it just spins forever, but won't record and I can't copy anything to it.  In other words, it doesn't work at all.  For this to happen twice within such a short amount of time speaks volumes about the reliability of these things.  The warranty is just about over, but I don't want to replace it even for free.  I spent too much time loading the thing.  All that work lost - TWICE!  But I love PVRs, so I might buy the 605 or one from another maker.  So I'm not really down on Archos - I just think that this particular model is not to be relied on.  There goes my investment in the leather case, the DVR station, and the travel adapter.

<Title>Great PMP at what it attempts to do
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as a replacement for my video iPod, the second iPod I have owned. I decided I needed to replace my 30GB because I had WAY too much music to fit on it. It came down the the iPod, or the Archos (same size HDs, essentially the same price).  I decided on the Archos because the screen is SOOO much nicer for watching movies/tv shows then the iPod. The added size is anoying, but it's still small enough to easily fit inside my pocket (which is what matters to me).  The 504 is NOT a good media player for exercising, which is one of my primary reasons to own an MP3 player, so I got a shuffle to complement it as an exercise player. However it is wonderful the rest of the time I use it.  As other people mention in reviews of it, the navigation is different if you're used to an iPod.  But once you get used to it (which didn't take me long), it makes SO much more sense.  Absolutely no complaints other then the size larger then the iPod.  The screen rocks!!!

<Title>DRM Tips
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently bought the Archos 504, the DVR station and the extended life battery.  I also closely researched several other models and brands (604, Cowon A2, and Creative Zen).  What won me over to this model was the removable battery, the large hard drive capacity and the ability to not only listen to music, watch videos, but also read PDFs.  Although I will say I have not been successful with Adobe when attempting to register a new device for protected e-book files.  I tried transferring a protected PDF but was not able to view it on the Archos.  Hopefully, they will come out with a firmware upgrade or Adobe will wake up and recognize more devices soon.  While I love the Archos itself, I have had problems with using Windows Media Player (both 10 & 11) to transfer music and video files that I have bought online, despite the PlaysForSure deal.  I stumbled upon one suggestion that the music files needed to be played at least once through on the computer I bought them on to get the DRM license acquired (music was bought on MusicMatch & Urge).  I spent a few hours letting this music play through.  Although sometimes the music (on the computer) would only play a few seconds and jump to the next song (as though it couldn't get the license), if I went back and restarted the song that stalled, it would be successful the secord or third time, and then play all the way through.  I deleted all the music off my Archos from my problematic first sync and then started the process all over again.  This time (after letting the music files play through), the music transferred over and played on the Archos without errors.  Also, with the DVR station, I haven't figured out how to use Yahoo TV to schedule shows to record yet (the directions are a bit sketchy).  I have, however, been able to use my cable box DVR, from TimeWarner digital cable (a Boston Scientific model, I think) to record shows.  Once I have recorded them, I can select the "Record to VCR" option, hit record on the Archos videocorder screen while its docked and it will retrieve the pre-recorded show.  The transfer was slightly faster than the actual length of the show, but not by much.  Also, you can manually schedule a recording on the Archos itself, which would avoid the extra step of transferring a pre-recorded show and just record in real time when the show is scheduled.  I haven't done that yet, but will try it soon.    I have not tested the battery life (normal or extended) but fully expect it to be plenty sufficient (between both batteries) for my upcoming trans-Atlantic trip when I deploy.  I am thrilled with how easy it is to use in the hard-drive USB mode and transferred family pictures quickly and without any issues.  I also like being able to select your own color scheme and wallpaper.  While I have read some complaints about the screen's viewing angles, I think they're superb and easy to see from the side or tilted.    Also, one other thing to realize is that the USB cable is proprietary, so I'm not sure how you could accomplish using it as a USB host without involving the DVR docking station.  Overall a great, multi-functional product!!

<Title>Archos 504 is great personal media device
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've purchased the Archos 504 80GB PMP about 2 months ago. I was looking for a media player that could play video, store pictures and also music the fact that it also records is a big plus. I researched the video iPod, Cowan A2 and Creative Zen W. I have an older iPod and its great for music but its screen size and video ability eliminated it from my list. The Archos is a sturdy well built PMP with a bright 4+ inch screen. I think its features and capabilities (plays video, music, photo viewer, Adobe PDF viewer and Personal recorder) set it above the others.  Pros: Bright 4.3" screen, easy navigation once you get use to it, can record from any device that has audio & video outputs (component, composite, s-video), ability to play back video and music through you TV, home theater and/or stereo equipment, easily synch's with PC as a portable hard-drive or using WMP (I had issues using WMP 10 but upgraded to WMP 11 and synch'ed files with no problems) recording can also be scheduled but at this time I have not yet tried that feature. Photo viewing is very crisp and clean and I love the zoom capability. I've loaded the Archos with over 900 MP3 audio files, 6 DVD movies (loaded DVD's using AnyDVD and CloneDVD Mobile) and over 50 music video's and still have plenty of available disk space. I've purchsed the DVR docking station and during parties I have attached the Archos and DVR dock to my home theater system and play music videos throughout the night on the big screen TV.  Cons: Supplied case is useless and Archos should not bother including it, Users Manual provides only basic functionality and should provide additional information on synch processing (especially using WMP) and scheduled recording. I've loaded my photos into a series of sub-folders and the thumb nail viewer seems to have issues displaying all the thumb nails, when I view photos only the first 10 - 12 thumb nails are populated, to bypass this issue I use the browser to view a specific photo sub-folder. USB cable has a proprietary connector for the Archos forcing you to use only their cables. Built-in speaker is not very loud but I only use the speaker to preview sound after synching files.  Neither a Pro or Con: Adding DVD video is not a basic function and does require some computer savy. There are a some good Archos forums available on the internet to guide users through the process. I would not recommend ordering any optional accessories other than plugins from Archos. I originally placed an order with Archos for the DVR station and case. At the time of the order, the items were listed as "in stock" but the next day my purchase confirmation listed them as back ordered. I waited over a week for that status to change and when it did not I cancelled the order. About a week  after cancelling the order, the DVR station showed up at my door. I had to return it since I had already ordered and received the DVR station from another vendor.  All-in-all I would recommend the Archos 504 to anyone who is looking for a personal media player/recorder. It beats the ipod or any of the competitors in terms of versatility, capabilities and screen size.

<Title>Excellent, more than an iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 504 is an excellent portable media player, but its more than an iPod substitute.  The Archos' weight and size make it too cumbersome to go excercising with, but the Archos is a much better companion when you are commuting on the train or stuck in the airport delayed for 3 hours.  The audio capabilities are just as good as the iPod, but the video capabilites can not compare because of the much larger screen on the Archos.  Photos are vibrant and video is smooth.  The controls are very intuitive changing depending on what you are doing, but left-handed people may not like the placement to the right of the screen.  Great expansion modules and plug-ins.  I do strongly suggest getting the cinema plug-in -- it saves a lot of time because you do not need to convert to mpg4.  Also, the podcast plug-in allows you to play podcasts, which are starting to become the "standard" for some content producers.  I configured my iTunes to use the Archos to store music/podcasts so I do not need to manually move the content to the Archos -- I am always ready to pick it up and go.  Next in my shopping list:  the docking station to make my Archos a full-fledged DVR.

<Title>Maybe I got a bad unit - Updated
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm am a little disappointed with the unit. It does a fantastic job when it works (great sound with headphones and fantastic video & photo playback)but I have been experiencing a lot of glitches. The thing freezes and crashes a lot. It is extremely sensitive to static electricity (electronic phenomena as described in the user manual)and will friz out if you don't ground yourself before touching it. I've sent my unit back for a new one - hopefully it works better than the first and I can up the rating to a 5. It's kind of annoying that you have to buy just about everything as an accessory, including a power adapter.   Otherwise you have to charge through a USB port. I bought this so that I wouldn't have to lug my laptop on trips and not having a power adapter defeats the purpose. I knew that before I bought it though so I guess I can't complain too much. I also purchased the DVR adapter to record TV but It is extremely difficult to use. Archos advertises setting up recordings through Yahoo calendar, but they don't tell you Yahoo has done away with this feature. If you're not good with computers, you'll have a hard time putting DVDs onto the unit, but it's a cinch if you know what you're doing & have the right software. I did have problems synching through Windows media player, but transfers in hard drive mode worked fine.   Update:This thing is a POS. I'm on my second unit now, but am experiencing the same problems that I returned the 1st unit for. I have yet to get through an entire day at work without the unit freezing or crashing on me. The only way to fix the problem is to remove the battery and power it up again. This gets annoying real fast. Archos customer service was no help in the matter (but they are aware  that the units shock people). Stay away.

<Title>So far...IT'S GREAT
<Date>Wed Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit is great. Nice heft to it. Does not feel like a cheap platic toy.  The size is pefect and while it is a bit too big for my pants pocket, it does fit.  The picture and video quality is perfect. The films do not lag or pixelate in the least bit. Very smooth and easy instructions that will soon become second nature to navigate. Files are loaded with a very easy drag-n-drop feature. The photo viewer and slideshow are very nice as well.  The only negatives I have is that the sound is horribly low (even at full volume) you will HAVE to use earphones or buy an small external speaker at Best Buy for a couple of bucks. Also, in order to play VOB files you MUST download a CINEMA plug-in for $19.99 from the ARCHOS web page. Very easy to install and set-up. I just don't understand wy this wasn't part ofthe program to start with. Kind of cheesy on their part.  Overall, if you love to watch TV or movies...you'll really like this unit. I haven't recieved my TV dock yet, so I can't comment on that.   So far...I am really enjoying this. :-)

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Leave it too the french to make the most expensive media players that  break unbelievably easy. I had one for 4 days when I knocked mine off my coffee table on to my shaggy carpet. When I picked it up I was  amazed to see the glass screen was shattered. I immediately called customer service and then realized that in french customer service translated is f**k you. The company rep, who was very nice on the phone stated that this would not be a problem, and I should mail the  unit in for repair. After archos received it, I was e-mailed by the same rep who I spoke to on the phone, and informed me that this repair was not under warrenty and they would need $200.00. After several months of phone calls and e-mails they sent the unit back to me, and I threw the package away. Apple, Creative, Coby, & Microsoft all make a superior product, and actually know whats customer service is.

<Title>Archos 504 is a great gadget
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Archos 504 from Amazon about a month ago. The first one I received had to be returned since the screen continuously blinked on and off.  I called Archos tech support and even though they were very helpful, they could not resolve the problem over the phone so I returned it to Amazon for a new one. Amazon makes returning defective items VERY easy. The second one I received works fine. It does occasionally spaz out (freeze up) on me but holding the power button down for 15 seconds resets it right away. I find the 504 very easy to use. I've downloaded music, photos and video (from a DVD player) without a hitch. I would highly recommend the optional DVR station for ease of charging and video playback/recording.  I've read reviews which mention the crappy fabric case that comes with the 504, but mine came with a fairly sturdy "slip-on" leather type case which offers more protection than the old fabric cover. Maybe they decided to act on the consumers' complaints? All in all, I love this cool device. Despite being a bit on the bulkie side, I find it does what it's advertised to do. Even though I'm not a high level techie, I'm able to navigate the menus and operate it without much difficulty. I do suggest you read through the manual that can be downloaded from the Archos website beforehand. One last thing...I did have a problem downloading my second firmware update. The 504 was not recognizing the update. I called tech support and they told me to delete the older version on my computer and then download the newest version. Once I did that it updated fine.

<Title>Archos 504 Great Product, Support lacking
<Date>Wed Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the 504 now for about a month and love the product. After converting my old 8mm film and video tapes years ago, I was able to load all of my lifes videos and photos onto this device. The device has a great LCD screen for viewing the videos and the photos. I purchased several options for the device, the red leather case (for my wife), an audio/video output cable, and the Cinema player plugin. As far as Pros and Cons go, the Con would be the support I received. The Video/audio jack on the right side failed to produce Video or audio after about two weeks. Amazon, who is amazing, sent a new unit to me within 2 days! That was great. The Cinema plugin however for the old model would not work on the new one because of the code required to make it work. After receiving promise after promise from the Archos support for the new code, I still don't have the Cinema plugin working. Without this plugin, you cannot play standard mpg videos. I don't want to purchase another product to convert nearly 100 videos to AVI or mpeg4. My other knock on the product is the small keys. They are somewhat difficult to use at times. The new 704 which has a touch screen should fix that problem. Overall, I really think the product is worth the money. It was great when having parties to pull the unit out and show people. There are too many optional accessories for the device which should have come standard, such as the Cinema plugin and the cable.

<Title>I completely agree with Natrualgoodness the april reviewer
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the potential of the device but...  I have to add that my device seems to have a phantom owner that turns my device off whenever it please. Maybe I got one those defective models but I find this extremely annoying I will be sending this back for another as soon as I get my gmini 402 back because that is unexceptable.  While I like the devices Archos produce they should work out the kinks before going to market. Naturalgoodness hits it right on the head with his observations of the 504.   The case it comes with is not user friendly and the case you buy as a accessory is just ok at best, also it's alittle slippery.  It takes time for it to boot up / turn on  It doesn't always respond when you press the buttons or it just takes a long time for it to respond after you press a button.  The operating system initially dragged you have to use the firmware upgrade to clean up the kinks with the software issues. I have a gmini 402 camcorder and the firmware upgrade completely ruined and destroyed the normal function of that device but the firmware upgrade for the 504 did improve the operation of the device.

<Title>Nickel and dime stuff hurt a good product
<Date>Mon Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The basic unit is pretty good, but after downloading the first movie to the unit I get an error message that it does not play MPEG-4 movies without the optional plug-in, even though it is stated through the ads it plays MPEG-4. Well the MPEG-4 plugin is a additional cost item, as is the AC power supply. These are items that come free with almost any other player. I called Archos about this and they replied " we did not say you wouldn't need an optional for cost plug-in". Questionable ethical attitudes like this and their nickel and dime philosphy is often what makes or sinks a company. Right now I would say Archos is a sinker, even if they have a descent product.

<Title>Best PVP ever
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Archos 504 after I returned my creative zen vision w because lack of AC3 audio support. I definitely got the better product in the archos 504. It comes with 80 gb memory instead of the 60 gb for the zen. Archos is actually a little cheaper than the zen. Comes with more accessories and can record tv programs. The screen is about the same size as the zen, but can display 16 million colors rather than 200k for the zen. It supports more video formats than the zen. I bought the Zen believing it could play more formats, but it turned out to be the otherway around. The Zen vision W can't play divx 3, while the archos can play any divx format. The sound is a little soft on the archos.

<Title>New Model Brings Improvements/More Problems
<Date>Mon May 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've upgraded from the preceding AV500 model.  The new AV504 brings some improvements including a larger harddrive, dedicated on/off button, and an appropriately placed headphone jack.  In order to stay competitively priced, the AV504 does not come with a docking station and sadly you cannot record directly from an A/V source without the docking station.  No longer do the A/V out cables come bundled with the device for TV output viewing and charging is done either through the docking station or via USB.  USB connection is now through a proprietary connection (previously it was a universal USB connector).  The new buttons are much less intuitive than the directional buttons on the AV500 (The buttons on the AV504 are not directionally placed).  The AV504 uses a larger capacity laptop harddrives rather than the microdrives used in previous models.  This has lead to multiple issues, first issue is it has made the unit thicker and heavier.  Secondly, harddrive interference can be heard through your headset everytime it spins up, not to mention a much more noticeable "jolt" every time it spins up.  Finally, the AV504 does not come included with a protective leather case and must be purchased separately.  Overall, the fact that they proprietarized connections and removed previously bundled parts forces me to give 3 stars to this unit.

Some advice: Its nice to have a standard video format for all your devices. I choose wmv9 (make sure its 9 as the 504 can only play this format), I can use it on my xbox360, vista, and my pda phone, the perfect format (for me anyways)!

<Title>iPod killer
<Date>Thu Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If this device was marketed properly, it would blow away the iPod. It supports almost every video format you can think of. Windows Media, AVI, Divx, DVD, etc all direct out of the box. I put on about 10 divx DVD-Rip movies I downloaded and they played perfectly. The music storage is also very nice. 80GB is plenty of space for any music and movies you want to store. AVI/Divx is the best way to store movies since they are high quality and very small files. Easy navigation, nice buttons once you get used to them, and EASY drag and drop to put things onto the device. Only 2 drawbacks with this product: crappy, cheap headphones. You will want to use the apple iPod headphones. And the SIZE. It is a bulky thing to carry around. Back pocket is an option, front pocket is definately not. It feels about the size of a PSP or a gameboy from back in the day. Quality is fantastic tho and definately the positives exceed the negs. This has the potential to destroy the iPod. For $340 you get an 80GB video/audio/PDF viewer, photo viewer and external portable hard drive right out of the best. It gives you more for your money than Apple. Unless you need to be "cool" with your iPod, GET THIS INSTEAD.

<Title>This thing's pretty tight
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my arhos about 1 1/2 month(s) ago and i've already filled up 50gigs of it. This thing's video quality is really sharp and with the dock thru the tv its good too. Not hard to navigate after 1 week of use. You just gotta figure some extra options out, like how to create playlists and how to listen to music while viewing photos.   -Unlike a computer's hard drive once you fill up the HD it barely has any noticeable lag. The hard drive's speed can handle it.  -The screen can be viewed at any angle, but realistically no more than 3 people can view at one time comfortably.  -Mp3 is great quality as well  -Photo quality is totally kool, images appear crystal clear  -Doesn't support all file formats (But the support is sold by archos for $20 an upgrade)  -Can't really compare ipod woth archos, because the ipod is more of a sport mp3 player, while the archos is a "sit down and enjoy yourself" kind of video player.  Personal Opinion - My brother owns an ipod so i've tried both ipod and archos and personally, archos blows every compeditor out. There's only one thing holding this player back, and that's its thickness. Which isn't all that bad, but it isn't as athletic-friendly as ipod.  (One thing you should keep in mind is that it's a video player, then mp3 player, then photo viewer)

<Title>In depth review (long)
<Date>Wed Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the Archos 504 player for many reasons, and the removable battery is certainly one of them. Unlike iPod, Zune, etc., the Archos has a truly removable battery that can be quickly and easily replaced with a charged one. Not only does this extend the life of the product -- it doesn't need to be shipped to Archos, Inc. once the battery has died -- but also extends your viewing time as much as you want! Transcontinental flight? No problem! Just buy a couple of extra batteries to swap out on the plane. Removal takes literally 2 seconds!  Ok, so now that you know the value of the interchangeable batteries, let's go over the actually battery itself. I believe that Archos claims a 5 hour charge for these products, and while that's a bit generous, I regularly get at least 4 hours of continuous video playback. And let's face it -- we bought the Archos 504 to watch video, not listen to MP3's.  That's my cue to talk about this unit's video playback.  The only thing keeping me from giving this player 5 stars is the lack of supported video codecs.  Sure, it'll play .h264 or .vob (MPEG 2) files if you buy the extra software plug-ins from Archos, but come on!  Why nickel and dime us for these plug-in's when we're already forking over a chunk of change for the player?!?!  Clearly, you've already developed the software, just include it for cripes sake!  And what about Real Media?  I realize that it's not the greatest of formats, but I have a TON of South Park episodes in RM that I had to convert to AVI's.  It'd just be nice if there were more supported video codecs.  That's my lone diatribe regarding the video codecs, I promise.  It does play MPEG 4 .avi files encoded with DivX and XviD as long as you encode the audio with WMA v2 or MP3.  Basically, any movies that you've downloaded should play fine.  And the screen is pretty fantastic.  Not only is it bigger than any other portable player on the market, except for the Archos 700 series, but it also looks crisper than most.  I don't recall the resolution, but movies look great on it.  Obviously, you have to give it a good file to get a good picture, and I haven't viewed any MPEG 2 material on it, but AVI's look great -- good resolution and color.  One of the other areas that players can frequently turn me off for good is in the file transfer mode.  I hate iTunes with a passion, and it's one of many reasons why I'll never own an iPod.  I do NOT want to have to load files into a program that'll screw around with them in the process of transferring them to my device.  They're my files; leave them alone!  Thankfully, Archos provides two methods for file transfer: as an external hard drive or as a Windows Media Player device.  Personally, I go with the external hard drive choice because dragging and dropping files is quick, easy, and intuitive.  If you're into synching your player and want to use WM, great, but I love the fact that you can just drag and drop files into the folders that you want without using proprietary software.  Transfer occurs via USB 2.0, and the connection requires a special dongle that Archos provides with the obvious caveat that you can't go pick up a conventional USB cable to charge this sucker.  I don't know exactly why Archos chose this connection except for the obvious financial benefit of specialized equipment (an unappreciated iPod immitation).  Charging is very slow using this cable, but Archos claims that the docking bay or DVR station allow for much faster charging.  Like the file transfer system, the menu system is pretty intuitive as well.  Directional buttons as well as an OK (select)/back and tab/menu buttons comprise the column of five buttons that reside to the right of the screen.  These allow you to navigate through the icons on the home screen.  There are 8 icons for video, music, photos, browser, resume, tv scheduler, video recorder, and audio recorder.  Obviously, video, music, and photos will take you to their corresponding media.  Browser allows you to browse all folders in a file folder format (say that 10 times fast!) while resume takes you back to where you last left off, and the finally three deal with recording media.  I have yet to record any media on this player; so, unfortunately I can't review that aspect.  But the ergonomics of this player are easily a 4 of 5.  It's a little clunky, but for a player with an 80 GB HDD and a 4 inch screen, how can you complain?  The proprietary dongle that connects via USB is a bit disappointing as well as the lack of video codec support straight out of the box, but you are provided with the dongle (don't lose it!), and the AVI support will account for the majority of most viewers' videos.  My rating would breakdown like this:  design - 5 ergonomics - 4 functionality - 5 ease of use/format support - 3 value - 5  This is an awesome player and a great deal.  If you're a frequent flyer and are the slightest bit tech savvy, which you are if you're checking this out, I'd highly recommend this unit.

<Title>Solid performer but not perfect
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been waiting so long for Apple to finally come up with a wide screen video iPod.  I got tired of waiting and bought the Archos 504. It is a beauty.  The screen is wonderful.  My wife and I shared it on a recent long flight and we were both able to view the screen at the same time.  This was a bit of a concern. The unit is heavy but feels solid. I love Apple's and I have an iMac and two iPods, but they really are dragged down by some issues.  For example, I was able to buy a 2nd battery for long flights (for the 504) for a very reasonable amount.  Not only can you not do that with an Apple, if your battery dies, your iPod is a pretty paper weight.  This unit is much more user friendly in that department.  Now of course it isn't as user friendly menu wise.  The set of buttons on the side get the job done, but it is no Apple product.  And they need to have a back light.  Hard to work it in the dark.  The hard drive is easily accessed via the battery panel.  It may or may not be user replaceable, I have heard it is. It also works with both my PC and my Apple.  Just shows up as a hard drive and I drag the movies over. It has a speaker for times when you don't want to use a pair of headphones but it is tinny and not at all loud. The unit doesn't include an AC charger.  Just a USB cable that plugs into your computer.  Having said that, you probably have an AC adapter with a USB input somewhere in your house.  Your iPod, a Pocket PC, etc.  If not you can buy one much cheaper than Archos wants. It doesn't play MPEG2 files but can with a $20 plug in.  For another $20 you can get the Podcast plug in and play non-protected Apple videocast.  For example I download the NBC news on iTunes and transfer it to my 504 and it plays great.  Also, I was able to buy both for $30, don't know if that bundle is still available. If you are technically challenged and don't know how to get DVD's, TV shows, etc. onto this device, consider buying the DVR station.  Basically you can capture anything you can play on your TV.  Just plug the DVR station into your DVD player, play the DVD and it records it.  Same for a TiVO, Cable on Demand, etc. Basically I would not hesitate to recommend this to someone.  If you are comfortable with gadgets and don't need your hand held it is great.  I have filled mine up with DVD's and TiVO shows.  If you are overwhelmed by gadgets then hold out for a new video iPod.  You can pay Apple for a copy of a movie you already own and it will magically appear on your iPod.

<Title>I love it
<Date>Wed Mar 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have 26eps of Speed Grapher (an anime) and about 900 songs on it (I still have a chunk of cds to re-rip) and I LOVE that I can drag n drop instead of sync'g (a la iPlod) and can add album art, genre art, etc. Just make sure the firmware is updated and be leery of WMP10 and WMP11. I highly recommend a different media player to sort and tag your songs because WMP11 did nothing but try to 'help' me and it routinely hosed my archos 504 player. I switched to media monkey and drag n drop and it's been WONDERFUL. I get about 10hrs of  nonstop battery life (a solid work day) for music. I haven't tested the video stamina yet, however. I highly recommend this player especially if you can get the bundle with the dock (otherwise the dock is $100 extra)

<Title>Excellent unit after problems were resolved...
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had lots of problems with this PVP at first. I had it for two days and it constantly froze up while playing MP3s. Well, I thought I must have gotten a bad one. So I sent it in to Archos to have it repaired or exchanged. They exchanged it but it turned out the new one was just as bad. The Archos website was no help but after googleing I found a forum for Archos fans. I reported my problems and the guys there said that I probably have corrupted files on the device. After clicking on all files that I had copied to the Archos I found a few bad files and deleted them. Ever since the unit works just fine. The corrupted files were created by Windows Media Player and I'm not using the program anymore for ripping my CDs. Windows Media Player is supposed to work with this device but if you have problems playing your MP3s try ripping your CDs with another program. That might already solve your problems. Too bad that Archos doesn't mention this on their website. I think a lot of bad reviews could be avoided. Just for this reason I give the 504 a 3 star rating. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I use the Audio Recording feature together with the DVR docking station  frequently to convert my old records to digital files and that works great.  I play video files on my TV thru the docking station and it works very well with the remote control. Just like a DVD player. Unfortunately the manual is not very detailed so many functions will have to be found just by playing around with it.  The sound volume is very low by itself, but I use it with loud speakers that can be set louder or with my stereo amplifier. Works out fine. The sound itself is excellent.  Technical support is okay. They take a long time to respond by email. But they do respond and are helpful when they do. Phone support is available too.  The battery lasts a very long time. I play songs all day at work.  I haven't used the video recording feature so can't comment on that. All in all I can say, that after the first trouble I'm now very, very happy with this device. I wouldn't exchange it for anything else.

<Title>glad I bought it...
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>One of the most used items I own - "commuter companion". The few problems (occasional reboots - reseat battery), are well worth it. The video is awesome, the audio needs improvement (especially with videos) but is acceptable with music.   This should not be considered a pocket item. It is bulky (compared to iPod), but very stylish and attractive. I wish I could have afforded the 160GB model, but that would have been greedy. You should consider getting your own headphones.  I would highly recommend purchasing the optional DVR docking station, you will want it for faster recharging. Using the included cable with your pc takes "just under forever".

<Title>Best mp4 player in the market and the price is great
<Date>Fri Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>1. As a mp3 player it is still the best if you are like me who refuse to buy any music with copy protection. I bought a handheld device every 6 months and move my files all the time. The copy protected files prevent me from doing that so ipod is out of the question for me. The user interface is much better then creative lab.   2. As for pictures as other reviewer say it does not support raw format and if you need this go for creative lab and not the wolverine(very bad company will not repair under warrenty even if they admit it is their fault but they do not know why). otherwise it is great.   3. Reliability wise i have great luck with all Archos product and none have much problem. My 504 have lock up once for about 200 hours of using. I have to remove the battery to restart it.   4. The best part about the 504 is the mp4 support. I use CloneMobile to rip dvds for the 504. I actually do it mostly for music. So instead of just mp3 I have music videos. CloneMobile offer ripping by chapter which is a function I have not seen this in most other software. The best part about the 504 is that it allow me to play all the videos in one folder in normal order, shuffle or repeat mode. while you are playing your mp4 you can see a side menu which let you see and change parameters. The most useful one for me is the display format (auto,full screen, maximize, original) and the player is very smart when displaying the video. The fast foreword is good but only up to 8X. i wish it is 32x. there is no go to next video command like the mp3.   5. i highly recommend the dvr docking kit for use at home and the $26 small travelling adapter for traveling. The most important features lacking without one of the 3 adapter is a fast charger and the ability to use regular usb cables.   6. The little speaker is a convenient feature but useless as the sound is horrible. I hook the 504 to a device with a mp3 player audio input with a subwoofer. but the best sound is by using my headphone. I use the shure 500 when travelling and Sennheiser HD650 at home. It drives the Sennheiser HD650 without an amp with very good sound. I had a portable headphone amp but i find it too cumbersome to use it. It is possible that a headphone like the 701k that require less power to drive may be better for the 504 but i am currently very happy using the hd650. Also with the dvr adapter i can hook the 504 to my hi fi system but i just do not like to run long cables.   7. I upgraded the firmware immediately since someone said the sound quality has been improved with the newer firmware. The instruction given did not work. I have to click the firmware file manually after i copied it onto the 504 for it to run and then it upgraded fine.   8. Someone complain about the size of the 504 and i found it to be very acceptable. It is a lot bigger and heavier then my 400 but there is very little you can do if you want a large screen for the size. May be in the next few years they can cut down the thickness and weight but knowing what i know about hard drives that may take many years.   9. I still do not like the buttons and you cannot use them in the dark. I think some additional gui like the 400 that you push and small menu display on the side to let u pick choices will be a great addition for operating in the dark. This is not an issue if you are watching a long movie at night but an issue if you watch music videos. you have to turn the lcd to the brightest and keep some lights on to use the device. This is a bigger issue when travelling due to the drain on the battery. Talking about the battery it is very easy to remove, so an extra battery may be an answer.   10. I have not use the 504 to record anything because I have no need for that. I have other systems set up to do those task. Personally I have to say using a hand held device should be for travelling and I leave the heavy lifting of recording to my home video and hi fi system.

<Title>Good product.
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the 504, but It has a few disappointing issues with it:   1. Takes a while to start up.   2. If it starts to play a corrupted file, unit will cut off and restart.   3. Controls, while adequate, could be arranged a little better.   4. Archos "nickel and dimes" you by making you purchase everything separately.   5. Built in speaker useless, unless you're in a quiet room.  On the upside:   1. Display is large and bright.   2. Lot's of storage space.   3. Plays lots of formats   4. Good battery life. Got 9-11 hours playing music.   5. lots of accessories.

<Title>Archos 504 is pretty cool!
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Archos 504 Video player is almost the same as the 604 but is slightly thicker, heavier, has a bigger battery instead of the kickstand and, most notably, a larger harddrive (80GB instead of 30GB).  Archos has not officially even released these yet but, somehow, I was able to order this from Amazon.com and received it along with a U.S. serial and part number - cool!  Package contained Archos 504, 1 battery, nice ear bud headphones, 1 proprietary USB 2.0 cable used to charge the device and transfer content from your computer, setup guide and legal stuff, DVR station adapter and a storage sack.  The Good The screen is pretty nice and I am able to view it even at angles.  The unit itself is well constructed and is made up of a high density plastic and metal - a nice surprise when most people are using only plastic to save money and lessen weight.  Out of the box it came loaded with pictures, music and movies for you to play with which is a nice touch.  Archos technical support is easy to call and they pickup and give advice without putting you through the ringer or automated FAQ system - another nice surprise.  The interface looks really cool with lots of interactive items.  When connected to your computer it asks you what you want to do (charge only, synch or mount as hard drive) - this is a nice touch.  The speaker is small but actually sounds good considering its size - perfect for office/cube listening or to share video clips with friends gathered around.  The built in microphone works exceptionally well and picks up even the softest sounds clearly. The photo viewer is slick and is fun to use (slide show, rotate, etc.).  The Bad It came with no cables to play back video on television which is sort of lame since that is one of its most advertised purposes.  The instruction manual comes saved as a file on the device and while it provides a nice overview - it lacks any real depth or details.  The Usability on this device is very poor with inconsistent use of buttons and seemingly simple or repetitive tasks requiring too many steps.  No clear way to disconnect device from computer without it hanging up and requiring you to take off the battery to reset it.  I assume they will either fix this in a firmware update at some point.  While not expected it should be mentioned that this device does not support any iTunes formats (Podcasts, Video or Music) although they claim to be releasing Podcast support soon.  I personally feel that supporting these formats would be a smart move for them considering how many people have content from iTunes.  The Ugly (and there always is) Finding out what video formats are actually supported is being a real trial and error situation regardless of what the tech specs say/don't say.  You need a travel dock to charge the device using a wall outlet or the cigarette lighter in your car.  The storage sack is useless - it's thin, cheaply made and provides no more protection than a zip-lock bag.  Summary This is a very cool device and is certainly "Next-Gen" when it comes to portable video players.  The fact that you can use it as a Tivo-like device at home (record TV shows and movies) when you are not on the road and the approachable purchase price makes me very satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend it for anyone in the market for this sort of thing.

<Title>Archos 504 first and Second impressions
<Date>Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have only had the 504 for a few days but I am the kind of guy that likes to put a new electronic item through its paces early.  I purchased it to take on our honeymoon to act as entertainment on the plane and to dump my camera and hopefully our camcorder( JVC hard disk based) to for backup.  First impressions are very good.  I immediately upgraded the firmware and that went smoothly.  I have also added some movies and PDFs and pics in as well.  all worked very well.  Video:	Looks incredible!!!  I converted some DVDs using the Xvid codec and they play perfectly.. no stutter, great sound, GREAT picture and excellent loading times.  PDFs:	I converted some docs and some books in .RTF format with cutePDF and they look fine.  I suggest that you copy everything you want to PDF into word and do page setup, making the page 5" wide and margins of .5" or less.  This gives a nice look when reading.  My only small gripe is that you have to zoom in a few times every time you open a PDF to get it to a size that is easy to read. I would prefer it saved my location and setting when I close a PDF  Photos:	Like Videos these look great and are easy to view  Only two problem/issues so far are getting the504 to show up on a TV.  Although I am not using their archos to TV cable so that may make a difference.  I have a few more cables to try at home before I call this broken.  And I thought it also had the stand built in like the 604 but it does not and the case is not available to purchase yet so I am trying to jury rig a stand for it.   Over all a great little travel device.    Update:  I verified that I can transfer pics from my Canon SD300 and more importantly my JVC Everio-G Camcorder (GZ-MG77US) camcorder.  Bumping it up to 5 stars just for that feature alone.

<Title>Get the AV500.
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had the AV500 and then recently purchased the 504.  They're about the same size and the AV500 seemed more customizable, and was a better deal.  It came with a TV hub to record TV/DVDs for around the same price.  The 504 also had a few burnt out pixels, one right in the middle of the screen, so I had to return it.  The case that comes with it wouldn't even protect the player from  pocket change.  And for that built in stand that comes on the 604, the av500 came with a cover that could easily flip back as a kickstand.  The only improvement is the size of the buttons.  Visually, you can't tell the difference between a few hundred thousand and a few million colors on that small of a screen either.  And the AV500 comes with an AC Adaptor.  Overall it doesn't seem like the big improvement people thought it would be.  I would have given it more stars, but it's no better than it's older brother.

<Title>Another Archos Success
<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the 80GB 504 as an update to the Archos Gmini 400, which was a pretty awesome device itself.  The 504 is great.  Unlike certain other fine products (Ipod, Toshiba), the 504 is really a dedicated video device, with a huge screen that takes up most of the front real estate on the unit making the most of portable video.  The 504 handles video, audio, and photos wonderfully.  The screen is beautiful and vibrant and the interface is simple and effective.  I love the ability to customize the desktop appearance with personal photos and color settings.  Playback of video is smooth and I've had no problems with sound/video sync or file compatibility.  The operating system is pleasingly quick, especially when viewing photos.  A nice improvement on the 504 from my Gmini is the ability to view photos while listening to music.  The audio quality is very good.  It is worth noting that the CNET review mentioned poor audio quality as a downside, but Archos has issued a firmward upgrade that made noticeable improvement of audio quality.  Archos has taken a new approach with their pricing and design of the 504, primarily through requiring additional accessories for full functionality (audio and video recording, USB host functions, etc).  While some have complained about this, I like it.  The base units are priced very attractively.  The previous generation 100GB Archos AV500, for example, records video out of the box but sells for closer to $500.  With the 504 I can spend $350 on a wonderful video/mp3 player with a big hard drive and spend another $100 later for the optional DVR station.  I think Archos has taken the right step by offering consumers flexibility-a great base unit is now available for much less, but the full range of functionality is available to those who want to spend more.

<Title>Well made, but spotty support.
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Received my Archos 504 a couple days ago and I've been putting it through it's paces.  The player is very solid and well made.  The rocker buttons are easy to push with a tactile feel, but navigating the archos is anything but intuitive.  Having to use 3 rocker buttons to navigate up, down, left, and right does not work nearly as well as a directional pad.  The screen is very bright and crisp.  Unfortunately, out of the box, the Archos doesn't play certain video codecs.  MPG4 with AC3 and H264 with AAC both require codec plugins which are going to cost $15 per plug-in.  So if you want full video support, add $30 to the price of the 504.  The kicker, though, is that these codecs are not yet available and tech support has no idea when they will be available.  Also the internal speaker volume is not very loud.  Even at full volume, you have to listen closely to video dialog in a quiet room.  If there is background noise, forget about it, plug in the headphones.  I really want to like the 504.  The price is good for an 80 gig player, but be aware that Archos will nickel and dime you for accessories like an AC adapter (which is only available with the dock or dvr adapter), and the codecs.    If Amazon begins shipping the Zen Vision W 60 GB model soon, I may return the 504.

<Title>Very Impressive Device
<Date>Mon Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the good fortune of owning 3 generations of this device. Starting w/the AV320, then the AV500, now the 504. In my opinnion, this device is not a 100 out of 100, but pretty darn close. I got the 80g version from Amazon for the great price of $359.00 - a real bargain. I've converted a bunch of DVD's on my computer using iriverter, and just dragged and dropped them onto the player. Done the same with my music and photo files. All transfers were speedy and easy. The device works great for all 3 functions. The video is bright, sharp and seamless on the 4.3 in screen. Audio sharp and clear. Pictures brilliant. You can watch a slide show w/effects while palying tunes. Only minor drawbacks: Totally worthless carrying sack, lack of video codecs native to machine. Navigational buttons take a little getting used to, but not bad at all once you get the hang of it. I can't wait till the dock becomes available and I personally am not bothered by having to spend a few extra bucks to get it. $359.00 for a player of this caliber is more than worth it. I could go on and on, but I'll just say - I love this player.

<Title>Good PMP!
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the 504 80 gig a week ago now and I think it was worth every penny to me. I like having a good amount of storage capacity to store video and  music for my business trips. The 504 has everything I need.   Music playback is exceptional to me. I was able to transfer over my collection of music without a hitch. I love that I can hook this player as a mass storage device and not have to rely on windows media player to sync and transfer stuff.   Video playback is great. With a little conversion to a playable format everything works good. I have Tivo so I transfer alot of shows to my computer so that Windows media player can do the converison for you. There  are other options for this if you look around a bit. I can't wait for them to release the mpeg 2 plugin for the 504 that will really cut the conversion time of files.  Pictures look exceptional as well. Not much needed to be said about this aspect of the player.  The two cons that really comes to mind in my week of use is that it should have come with an AC adapter supplied and the case that came with it is useless. The case can only be used for carrying the device. You can't do anything with the player in the case.   Overall this player is exceptional in my opinion.

The not so goods : customer support is  very questionable , can not buy additional battery , cannot play many popular video formats without extra spending ( currently $ 40 ) and I have waited for  3 days but not yet received the activation code via internet download ( I wonder why it takes so long ? ).  In all , there are other products on the market with quite better performance and features that one should check out before buying this Archos . I am somewhat frustrated and probably return this product .

<Title>2nd One first one lasted two days
<Date>Tue Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this product with all the accesories and before I could even use the dvr dock or the travel dock my system failed. I downloaded the latest firmware from there support site, applied it ok and was using the device for about ten minutes when it froze on one of the demo pictures it comes with.  I was able to hold the power button down and turn off the unit.  I figured this was an anomally and powered the unit back up, while watching video on a full charge the system just fizzled out and the screen would not show anything.  Hmmm, phoned there tech support and the guy was real nice, tried everything, pushing the brass button inside beside the hard drive (which buy the way is a standard laptop hard disk, buy the smallest gig model and a seperate 160hd for cheaper and image the factory to your new one and replace) anyway we even tried the trick of holding both the power and the tv lcd button (some hidden menu it supposed to come up for diagnostics) but still nothing.  So he advised to send it back to where I purchased it from for replacement since I would get a new one that way.  If I sent it back to Archos you get yours back and have to wait for them to fix it, he said approx 30 days :( So now I got my replacement and so far so good, by the way the first one had two dead pixels and there policy is three or more they will replace.  The new had none :)  I also got the helmet camera, have not used it yet but it seems sturdy enough.  The origonal unit came with the cheap carry baggy, I guess there were enough complaints because my second one came with a carrier like that you would use for a PDA, still cheap quality but I guess a little bit better than a soft bag.  Hope this review helps you, if I come across anymore issues I'll post an update.
