<Title>Now a part of the iPod craze!
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Trust me, I was the LAST person to buy an iPod. I was perfectly happy with my iRiver H140 (which I still love), and was sick to death of seeing those white headphones everywhere! But then I decided to get a tinier player for my walks to class and such. I tried out different smaller players and they all had some type of defect. An iPod Shuffle wasn't an option as the thing doesn't even have a screen. When these second-generation minis came out, I was blown away by the specs: supposedly 18 hours of battery life, price cut down fifty dollars, etc. So I went ahead and bought the blue version and yet to have any regrets. My review:  PROS:  // I did a battery test on this the afternoon I bought it. It wasn't even charged to full capacity, and on top of that, I played with it a lot, and it still ran continuously for about 23 hours. Amazing. One of the reasons I was hesitant about getting a first-generation mini was its battery life (about eight hours, I believe). Apple has definitely improved on this feature.  // iTunes, the software that you use to put music on your iPod, is great. You can make it automatically sync to your iPod or manually update. I choose the latter option as I have more music on my computer than will fit on a 4GB player. I thought having to use software would be annoying in comparison to hooking a player up like a regular hard drive and using the file tree method, but iTunes is simple and gets the job done. There are other programs you can use to manage your iPod, like MusicMatch, but iTunes seems to be the least clunky to me. Also, you DO NOT have to buy from the iTunes music store to work your iPod. You can even hide this option on the sidebar if you wish and make iTunes solely a music manager.  // So tiny! I have to admit that when I opened the box, I exclaimed, "It's SO cute!" It's basically the size of a credit card. A little slimmer, a little longer, but you get the idea. Even the package it comes in is very compact!  // Sound quality is absolutely superb. You'll listen to songs that you've heard on your computer or other MP3 player or whatever and hear nuances that you haven't heard before. Like I said, I have an iRiver, and while that has amazing quality too, you'll be surprised how crisp this little device sounds.  // Plenty of features. Notes, contacts, games (Music Quiz, Solitaire, Brick and Parachute), clock, alarm... I have yet to use any of these extras but I guess it's nice to know that they're there in case you do. I think more efficient features would be voice recording, FM tuner, etc.  // Scratch-resistant. All of my friends' iPods are scratched up like you wouldn't believe. The mini has a lot more resistance to scratches as it has an anodized aluminum case.  // Inuitive design. Everyone knows about the click wheel. I've handled lots of different players and Apple really wins in this area. The controls are underneath the wheel, so you don't have to worry about buttons bulging out on the exterior.  // Colors-- this is a pretty trivial point, but I was initially disappointed when these "new" colors came out. I thought the earlier model pastels were much prettier. However, now that I actually have one (photos don't do justice), I think my blue one has a gorgeous, rich hue, and I imagine this is the same for the green and pink. No complaints in the aesthetics department from my end.  CONS:  // No support for WMAs. iTunes will import these as their own format, which might result in a sound degradation. I had to rip a bunch of my CDs as MP3s just to retain original audio quality.  // Apple really skimped out on the accessories. I'm used to getting a bunch of add-ons with my player for free, like a case and adapter. The mini includes a clip-on holder, headphones, and your charging cord, but that's pretty much it. HOWEVER, to Apple's credit, you can charge your iPod without an adapter (right from USB, or Firewire). Plus, to get these 4GB models down cheaper than they were before, it makes sense that they cut out the superfluous items.  // This will be a minor issue for most people, but when you're in your menus (like listings under Songs or Albums or wherever), the titles don't scroll. So if you have a lot of songs that start with the same string of words, you're going to have try them all to see which one you're looking for. On the actual now-playing screen, they DO scroll, it's just that in the menus they don't. Like I said, this won't affect most people, but it did kind of annoy me when I first saw it as all other players I've worked with scroll titles in menus.  SOME THINGS TO KNOW:  // The iPod never actually shuts off. I know that when I first got this, I was like, "Where's the stop button?!" You can put it to sleep by holding the play/pause button down for a few seconds, but it will never actually be turned off. This is a smart move made by Apple because if you were to continually shut off and restart everytime you wanted to use it, not only would it take a long time to boot up, but it would wear down its interior.  // iPod doesn't give you a straightforward way to copy your music back onto your computer after putting it on, but there's a way to do so without using external programs if it's enabled to disk usage. 1) Click on the iPod icon in My Computer. 3) Click Tools > Folder Options > View > Show Hidden Files and Folders. 3) A folder called "iPod Control" should appear. Navigate into that folder and all your music should be in several different folders within. If you don't want to do it this way, there are also third-party programs like CopyPod.  // For iPod support, Google "iPodLounge." Their forums are really helpful, too.  // Ordering from Amazon is probably your best bet. I ordered this on March 17 and received it the very next day on March 18. That was with Super Saver Shipping deal where it's actually supposed to take up to two weeks to get to you! This could just be in my lucky case, but even so, you can also always return your iPod if something is wrong with it with zero hassle and for free. Like with those other players that gave me issues? Amazon sent a UPS guy to my house to pick it up, returned it, and I got ALL of my money back. Just my two cents on that.  ---  Overall, a great player. Besides a few flaws, Apple has found a new iPod-lover in me which I thought NEVER would happen! Sorry for the length of this review but I hope it helped potential buyers. Happy iPodding. :)

<Title>Incredibly Fast Shipping!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Cheers to Amazon! I bought this IPod as a gift for my fiancs burf-day, so I haven't even taken it out of the box yet, but I had to write a quick note singing their praises. Amazon's logistics and delivery network is unbelievable.  I opted for the free shipping offer (Super Saver Discount), which Amazon claims will ship in two to three days.  I placed the order around 2:00 PM CST, yesterday (3/21/05), only to have it show-up on my desk at work at 10:30 AM CST, today (3/22/05). That's a total of 20.5 hours for Super Saver Delivery.  I will say that my home in St. Louis, MO isn't extremely far from Amazon's distribution center in Lexington, KY, where this package was shipped from - about 350 miles.  But still, I've ordered pizza's that have taken longer to get here.  Way to go Amazon!

<Content>I love the ipod mini it holds so much music and is so small. Also the 18 hour battery life is great. This is perfect for holding my hip hop music collection. If you dont have alot of music I would also recomend the ipod shuffle. But my ipod mini has been great so far. Go Ipods!

<Title>If It's Too Loud, You're Too Old...
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned a number of other MP3 players and have made a concerted effort to avoid "iPod madness."  But with the recent price drop and upgrade of the battery life, I decided to take the plunge.  I bought mine through the Apple store and got free engraving as well as free shipping.  All-in-all, I LOVE my new 4gb iPod mini.  I also like that I can import my MusicMatch Jukebox playlists into iTunes rather easily.  There are really, in my opinion, only a few negatives:  ~ Dock is no longer included.  However, the included USB cable works fine IF you have a powered USB port on your PC. ~ The included ear-buds are AWFUL!  Fortunately I had several pairs of good headphones floating around, so that was not a big issue for me.  I would recommend picking up the USB power adapter and the Insten iPod Sync & Charging cradle.  I would also recommend checking out the iLounge web site for lots of good information on the care and feeding of your iPod.  Oh!  One other negative is that these things ARE addictive. And I'm kinda thinkin' now that should have gone for the 20gb version.

<Title>"the next big" bogus offer
<Date>Mon Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let's face it, you can't get something for nothing!  The San Francisco Chronicle recently exposed the real story behind the so-called "offers" that are continually being posted here.  Do a search on Google or on sfgate.com for "iPod not really free David Lazarus" and you will see what the con artists running these programs are really up to.  In a nutshell, it's just another way for spammers and other sleazy people to steal your personal information.

<Title>Very disappointing battery life
<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I received my Ipod Mini last week (good job Amazon for the free shipping....which arrived very promptly) and I had a lot of trouble with iTunes. I had a 256 mb mp3 player before I bought my iPod and transferring music to that one was so much easier. With iTunes, you have to make sure every song you want on your iPod is in the library. Thus if you add songs from a different computer, the songs that are not in this new library will be deleted! I guess this protects illegal music sharing, but for something this expensive this is a very inconvenient feature. Basically I think iTunes is an inferior program for transferring music; on my old mp3 player you could just drag and drop music files into the player.  Most importantly, the battery life of my iPod is absolutely disappointing. I've had to charge it every 2 days since the day I received it, and it's not like I keep it on all the time. I just use it when I walk to class, and in a span of 2 days it is actually on for about no more than 6 hours. I don't even have the backlight setting on at all. I am extremely upset with this because the 18 hour battery life is what initially hooked me into buying this second generation version.  Apple is lucky the iPod has such a good interface. The scroll wheel I must admit is a very intelligent tool and the ability to make playlists is something flash drive based mp3 players can't do. For 190 dollars I got a second generation iPod that has EXTREMELY poor battery life and that's why I am so upset with this. If anyone else has had problems with their battery, please share. It's better to know I'm not the only one who got gypped!

<Title>What is Wrong With iTunes?
<Date>Sun Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my iPod and iTunes, and simply can not see why people dislike iTunes.  A previous reviewer said that they couldn't transfer songs from another computer.  BULL.  Just right click on the iPod, and change it to manual synchronization.  Even if you don't like iTunes, there are many other applications, such as iPod Agent, that can transfer music (and more) to your iPod that are available online for free.  Especially with the new price, IPODS ROCK!

<Title>Wonderful.
<Date>Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a tremendous amount of music - too much for an iPod of any current size - and so I knew that I would be moving music on and off of the device no matter what.  I chose the smallest iPod Mini because of its good price and physical dimensions (it's a lot smaller than most people think), and have been very, very happy with my purchase.  I am something of an audiophile, and yet have been very pleased with the Mini's impressive sound quality, its ease of use, the incredible battery life (18 hours is not much of an exageration) and the flexibility that the Mini provides me.  To be only slightly critical (and not to discourage anyone from enjoying an awesome device), I am not especially fond of Apple's ear-buds (and a bit uncomfortable, too), but they were easily replaced for even better sound.  Also, I do wish that I could turn off the "auto-pause" feature (the unit pauses automatically when the earphones are removed, but is so sensitive as to occasionally pause when the plug is inadvertently rotated).  These are minor criticisms, and I hope that everyone gets an iPod!

<Title>Great, but bruises as easily as an apple....  Poor for audio books (no bookmarks)
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first Ipod and I love it.  The functionality is excellent and I've found that it lives up to nearly all of the positive notes that others here and elsewhere have written.  However, I have two complaints: One that would not have changed my purchase decision, and another that would have made me buy an accessory earlier.  First, the battery life is nowhere near 18 hours.  I do not use the backlight, nor do I play it very loud.  Perhaps the best I have done with battery life is 7-10 hours.  I was so surprised at first that I thought I had accidentally purchased the fist generation Mini.  I confirmed that I had the second one. But again, I would still purchase this, regardless.  Second, get a case or some other protective cover!  I dropped mine twice outside.  Both times were from only a foot or two but were on pavement or asphalt.  The Ipod worked flawlessly without any problems at all. But, drops that may have only slightly scratched a plastic case resulted in several small but very noticeable dings and even an actual dent on the corner.  The metal used for these cases must be pretty soft or pretty cheap! If you want to keep your Mini looking clean and new over time, and you occasionally have two left hands, you will definitely want to get some type of case or cover for it.  8/31/05:   After using the iPod for months, I realized that it missed a great feature I had on my old Rio 500: the ability to bookmark!  I listen to audio books a little more than I listen to music.  Though I understand there is an ability to bookmark Audible books and that there are various hacks and tricks out there, there is NO way to easily bookmark an audio book that you may have imported from CD or elsewhere.  I cannot change my original rating, but: For music, I would keep it at 4 stars.  For Audio books, the iPod deserves 1 star!  If you listen primarily to audio books, look elsewhere for a player that allows you to easily bookmark your spot.  12/22/05:  Battery life stinks!  I use this mostly for audio books and podcasts, and the best I can get is 2-3 hours before the battery dies.  Apple support is the worst!  I sent it back to them for repair: they received it on a Thursday or Friday, and sent it back on a Monday, stating that it was up to their standards.  If I was not now "captive" by having converted many CDs to Apple format, I would dump the Ipod altogether.

<Content>Besides the owners manual, and the few problems you might encouter, the mini is great. Despite what other reviewers have said, I have had my mini for about two years, and the battery still seams perfect(I've never done a full battery life check) As for finding out how to upload, download, and use the mini at first,it's a little more tuff. I STILL LOVE THE MINI.

<Content>I paid $250 for this i pod. After about 6 months the battery went dead slowly and even stopped charging altogether. I could only use it if it were hooked up to a charger. I replaced the battery myself(it CAN be done, people) and it worked fine for about a month before it started freezing up. Now my computer doesn't recognize it anymore and the clickwheel doesn't work. I never once dropped it or got water in it. I ended up giving it to my friend who collects broken i pods for parts and believe me, he's got A LOT of them. These items aren't worth nearly what they cost. They break often they're expensive to fix. Why Apple gets away the obvious contempt they have for their customers by selling them over-priced faulty equipment is beyond me.

<Title>The second-generation Ipod Mini is a hit!
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I went into the Apple store this weekend, planning to buy myself an Ipod shuffle to keep myself under the $200 mark while buying an Ipod, and what did I see but the newly released 2nd generation Ipod Mini, selling just within my price range!  This mini is totally worth the added cost compared to the shuffle. While I envy the shuffle's extremely light weight and even lower price, I'm glad to have the extra storage space on my Ipod as well as a much-needed screen.  My ipod mini is pretty light, even if not weightless, and it has an amazing 18-hour battery life.  On the missing regular Charger: I haven't had any problems using the USB cable and connecting my Ipod right to my computer.  Plus, so many people have ipods these days that I imagine I could always borrow someone else's charger if I needed it.  And buying a new charger is always an option.

<Content>I just got an ipod mini tonight. Within 20 minutes of having it at home i already had about 2 gigs of music on it. Within an hour i was listening to my music. Plus the price point now beats out the zen micro, the mini's only real competitor. I have played with my friends zen micro and i have to admit I was going to get one before the price drop.But it takes time to get used to the touch pad and the fm reception is bad. Overall this is a great  product adn even better due to its price. my advice is to go out and get one ASAP. UPDATE: this thing is very sturdy i have left it in the snow for 5 inutes and it still works. I have left the headphones dragging on the road at speeds upwards of 40MPH and they still work great

<Content>everyone knows the iPod mini is a great player, but I was really amazed at the new battery life. I don't even have to care anymore, it lasts so long. I HIGHLY recommend the mini. Are you going to be one of the poor souls that end up with a zen micro that gets 10 hours battery life on a good day? --  Personally I think the zen looks like it came out of a cracker jack box and it seems to my ear that they use a bass preset as "normal" to trick the consumer-- just try amping one of those creepy zlooking zens! Whatever folks, thats up to you. However, you WILL NOT be dissapointed with this SUPER mini from apple whereas you may be very depressed if you buy one of the lesser players like the zen or dj

<Title>Revised: Good but could be better
<Date>Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Good  1.The new Ipod mini has made one major improvement over its predecessor i.e. a battery life of 18 hrs or more. My 4GB lasted for 22 hrs on the first go.  2.The looks are the best coz of the sleek anodized case.  3.Easy to use,Click wheel Navigation features are unbeatable. 4.Easy to use iTunes software and music downloads. 5.For students you can get this on the apple store for $179 and the 6gb for $229.  6.Good Customer Service 7.Anti-Shock memory good for those of us who drop things  :D  The Bad  1. The sound quality is not the best, PC World compared it to headphones quality while comparing the iRiver and Creative products to listening room quality. However for normal listeners this shouldn't matter. 2. It cannot play WMA tracks so it can store only half the number of songs that a wma player can for the same capacity. 3.Doesn't come with the wall charger now that the price is reduced  The Ugly  1. The ipods have to be returned to Apple to replace the battery which normally will run out in 6-12 months depending on use, that costs $99 besides shipping not to mention the waiting...it would have made more sense to produce them with replacable LiOn batteries.   My suggestion I would suggest getting creative's zen micro.They hav a 5GB version for $229 on Amazon .They are releasing 2 new models a 4gb for $199. A 6 gb for $249.They are equipped with replaceable 10-12 hr batteries which you can get for $40. Carry around an extra battery an you get 20-24 hr listening time.  The zen micros also have better sound quality as compared to the pods.  But if want great looks and not bothered by less than perfect sound quality stick to the ipod mini.

Music Quiz is the only one you CAN'T play while listening.  This is a must buy!

<Title>Simply THE best mp3 player!
<Date>Mon Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>iPod mini was the hottest gadget last year & the best mp3 player around. Looks like this will be true even in 2005. There is absolutely no competition for the iPod's, no other player is even half as good as iPod.  Pro's, 1. Very good audio quality. Support for normal mp3's (unlike Sony). 2. Small size (smaller than most cell phones like much-talked-about-Motorola-Razr) 3. Extremely well desgined (let's hope Apple makes a cell phone and PDA in near future) 4. Very intuitive interface (award winning touch wheel and minimal buttons) 5. 4GB hard drive (enough space for about 800 mp3 songs) 6. Available in many colors (hopefully Apple will come up with Nokia style faceplates for future Mini's) 7. iTunes is one of the best music software around (rate songs, keep playcount, easy-sync with the iPod) 8. Excellent screen for such small size 9. Recharges from a standard USB port with the same cable as used for the upload of songs. No need to carry around a charger now. 10. Tons of innovative accessories in the market (from Bose speakers to colorful socks!) 11. Good battery life, about 10-14 hrs depneding on how much you surf around on it. ofcourse we all want more and there is no end to that demand :) 12. Everything about the iPod Mini is designed to perfection (no other company has put this much time & effort into their mp3 players even in 4 yrs since iPod hit the streets)  Con's, 1. The battery is internal with no easy replacement chances 2. Colors on the new Mini, except Silver, IMHO, are all gaudy. Last generation of Mini's had much pleasing colors. Check out for yourself at a local store before buying. 3. Gold version has been dropped now, its become a collector's item? Instead of adding more colors they have dropped one! 4. Doesn't come with a wall charger any more and takes longer to charge from USB port. You always need to be around a computer or pay extra for the charger.  Its simply fabulous and I am running out of superlatives to describe it. Thanks Apple for the new iPod Mini!

<Content>last time I checked you could get an ipod for $180. i last checked about 2 weeks ago and i thought it was a rip off then. this is outrageous, apple makes their ipods for $30 and amazon is selling them for $200. they're earning more money than they need, yet people still keep buying them. Sure it's great with all the songs, games and features but, it's not worth the money your paying for it. IT'S A RIP OFF.

<Content>I don't like iPod's. I think that they're a total rip off. You buy an iPod for like $200.00, then you have to buy your charger, then you have to buy your headphones. Plus you have to pay for the songs you download on it. Thats what blew me away. I think that since you payed about $300.00 for your iPod, they should atleast give you the songs for free. I would advise everyone to stay away from them if they want to save money...
