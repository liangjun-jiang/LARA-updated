<Content>We originally wanted to get our daughter - age 8 - the disney tinkerbell mp3 and it was no where to be found in time for Xmas....so we found this Video Mp3 player which is a much more advanced version of the Mp3. It plays clear videos, movies, picture slideshows and ofcourse music. It's very much like an Ipod but also can play the Disney Clips. We highly suggest this gift for a child age 8+ as it is easy to use and is cute, but definitely not a toy. It is sophisticated enough to last well into the tween years. Enjoy!!!

<Title>Defective product -- not once, not twice, three times (so far)

<Content>Santa brought the Disney mix max Tinkerbell edition to my 7 year old.  She was thrilled with it, except for the scratched screen that flickered on and off while watching a movie.  So we took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one.  This one wouldn't charge.  We tried the USB cable that came with it as well as a wall charger, car charger, and another USB cable, none could get it to charge.  So I took that one back and exchanged it for another new unit.  This one doesn't flicker, it does charge, but it won't play any of the Disney Mix Clips we bought for it.  It shows "file not supported".  Instead of taking it back to the store, I called technical support and waited on hold for 32 minutes.  Once I got to a representative, I was told it should work so they had to refer it to higher level technical support and they would try to get back to me by Tuesday.  The product is a great idea for this age group if it works; I have spent a lot of time driving around to stores that have one of these in stock to exchange plus the time on hold, not to mention the disappointment of a child who should be watching movies on it right now.  Shame on you Disny and Memorex Electronics!

<Title>LOVE IT!  Perfect  for a child....

<Content>I purchased this item for my daughter this past Christmas.  She will be 9 soon and had asked for an MP3 player.  After looking into the players I ran across the Mix Max.  She went crazy for the idea and soon changed her list.  The picture quality is good for what it is.  Perfect for smaller hands.  More personal and the battery lasts a long time.  The benifit is, it can be used as an MP3 player if she wishes without the normal event of going song by song to find the right one because you don't have a screen.  Like the idea of no speakers, keeps it small, quiet for those around and light in weight.  Love the accessories to cary it around with all the movies in a small parkage and just over a pound.  And she can download her photo's to her player to share with her friends.  The very BEST part....  you can download your own movies too.  LOVE that idea.  I highly recommend this.  If you are thinking about the Disney Mix, go one step up to the Mix Max for a few dollars more.  Also, they have just started selling them in the Disney Parks as of last week.  I feel we will see more of them.

<Title>Wonderful for a little girl.

<Content>I bought this Disney Mix Max for my daughter's 6th birthday.  She wanted an 'iPod' just like everyone else at home.  This was a PERFECT music player for her.  It plays music, movies and holds pictures.  There is a remarkable amount of space.  After showing her which buttons did what she is very comfortable using it on her own.  Cons:  It is tricky trying to figure out how to add music to it.  The earbud headphones where to big (I had been warned about this in another person's review so I purchased Disney headphones that are much much better). It does not come with a case. Othere than that it is a great player well built and holds a battery charge for quite awhile.  The Disney Mix Max makes long drives incredibly peaceful.  Great job Disney.

<Title>Awesome!

<Content>My 6 year old daughter got one from the Easter Bunny.  It has been great.  We were able to load her own music fairly easily.  She can change the clips and navigate to find the movies on her own.  She can't really read yet, so she can't search for a specific song.  But, she can get to the songs and "mix it."  The ear buds didn't stay in for her either, so I, too, bought the ear phones that go with the mix max.  My "tekkie" husband approves of the mix max so much, we bought one for our other daughter!  I think it's terrific...especially for the price.

<Title>Great idea - poor quality and no customer service
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a fantastic concept, and our daughter loves it, when it works.    The first Mix Max had problems after 3 weeks - screen froze and the clock stopped at 5:33am.  I was able to return it for an even exchange.  Second Mix Max worked for 2 1/2 months, then it started having inermittent blank screens, the Disney card movies would not play ("file not supported" messages appeared) and the time locked at 5:33am.  The center > play button is not working properly - when pressed it does not always play until you find a "sweet spot" that it accepts.  We have tried calling Memorex repeatedly for support - they are "looking into" the problems, but have no fix and because we are out of the 90 days from initial purchase we are out of luck as far as a replacement or exchange.  Great idea, cool features - if you get one that is not a lemon.  Our only option at this time is to gamble another $100+ for a new one to see if we get lucky and get one that works for over a few months.  Not likely - will probably spend a more for a more stable player.
