<Title>simple but useful
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a long commute and now use this solely for Audiobooks and it is perfect for such a use.  When I first bought it I intended it to be used for my morning jogs but I decided that I wanted something that held more so I wouldn't have to constantly update it according to how I felt that morning.  However, that is pure laziness as it takes seconds to update.  The battery life is also more than sufficient.  I don't know about other 256 MB MP3 players but this one seems great to me

<Title>A great starter/responsibility tester
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player was everything that it said it was. My daughter wanted an expensive MP3 player but I wanted to see if she could keep from loosing it. She hasn't lost it yet. I really like the fact that this comes with the FM radio... they all should. I say starter in my title because with the limited memory it does not hold many songs. Another benifit to the FM radio..

<Title>Not too impressed...
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this unit for almost a year, and there are things I like about it and things I don't like...  Pros:  -good sound for the small size -good price -easy to use -I like the clip; I can prop it up on my desk.  Cons: -battery life is nowhere near 15 hrs -when I do change the battery, it resets and I have to skip around to find the song I was listening to. -putting it on shuffle or skipping through uses up the battery more.  I am planning on getting a SanDisk with a larger capacity; I am hoping it will work better for me.

<Title>MuVo TX 256 MP3 player - broken usb connector
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I saw another review with a broken usb connector problem. It happened to my MuVo too. The connector is not really broken but is cleanly separated from the player (and attaches firmly to the battery unit). My MuVo player is now completely useless. The CL "Award winnging customer service" web site has no address or phone number to call for repair. Needless to say, CR loses me as a customer.

<Title>For Beginners
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this about 2 years ago, when it was first released and very expensive. It is still the only MP3 player I have ever owned and does the job. Compared to newer MP3 players this is a `toy', with limited functionality, memory, and lack of video, pictures, etc. It is extremely basic. The biggest problem is with battery life - it is horrible!! Absolutely horrible battery life. It uses 1 AAA and it eats through batteries like crazy. That has been the biggest downfall. The software it's bundled with is ok, but not very intuitive; I still have a hard time figuring out how to transfer music easily. The player is extremely compact and the headphones are ok - nothing fancy. I've used the voice recorder a lot and also the FM radio, and both offer good reception. The on/off dial is a button that you have to hold down and it takes quite a while to start up/shut down. You can scroll through songs, fast forward, rewind, and the songs seem to be played alphabetically by song title (unless I just haven't figured how to change that). This isn't a player for people who love music, because it doesn't hold too many songs - between 60 and 120. I've outgrown this, and technology has surpassed what this player is capable of; this is a bare-bones player that doesn't hold much and doesn't do much. Great for a run in the park, but the battery probably won't even last that long. Unlike others, this has never broken on me or malfunctioned. There are much better options available now in MP3 players, so look around for something better.

<Title>Total Piece of Crap
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this player for a little over a year and have hardly used it.  It has never worked correctly.  When trying to switch tracks, it automatically shuts off on me.  Now, it won't even turn on!  Unfortunatly, I did not register the product or keep any of the original paperwork, so the company won't do a thing about it.  If you have this player, do not get rid of the paperwork!

<Title>Muvo looked to be a great deal until.....
<Date>Thu Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was a great little MP3 player. Great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. Worse yet, I call Creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. They said the warranty was for 90 days!  Huh? The rep at Creative said they'd give me a "discount" and only charge me $45 to fix it. I asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. He said he'd call me back today, but I'm still waiting.   Beware ... Creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from Creative. Sad.

<Title>Love it - Can't put it down
<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative MuVo is a 256MB Flash Drive that can be used to store music or data. All normal disk operations such as cut, copy, paste, delete, rename and also drag & drop can be used with folders or files. When you plug the MuVo into your computer USB, it will recognize and configure the MuVo and then lists on the directory tree as "Removable Disk (x)" with x being the next drive letter.  In addition to music, you can use the MuVo as a Secure Data Key. To do this, I am using a program called "Password 2000" which I have installed on the MuVo that uses about 625K of space. When used as a Secure Data Key, a double-layer of protection is provided. Two conditions must exist before protected information can be accessed. (1) The owner of the MuVo must plug it into the USB jack and (2) the correct password for Password 2000 must be entered. This is very handy since the MuVo's portability allows your encrypted passwords to be used anywhere, on any computer. Once unplugged, your data is off the computer and safely back into your pocket.  The MuVo lives up to it's reputation as outlined by other reviews on this web site so, I won't duplicate that information.   On the down side, I found the Earbuds to be difficult to use as they kept falling out. Also, they don't quite match the audio quality of the Radio Shack (Koss) "Pro 25" headphones I'm using.  For it's size, weight, portability, and sound quality, I highly recommend this excellent product. Be sure to shop around for the best price. I've recently seen this product at a local chain store for about 33% less than the typical price.

<Content>The Creative MuVo 256MB Player is a great all-in-one product.  I got it after losing my Otis player.  I listen to a lot of audio books from Audible.com and there is a firmware plug-in from Audible to support this product for their download manager.   After experimenting for a few minutes everything works fine.  I have experimented with all the features and they work fine.  To have in one small lightweight package a flash memory drive, radio, audio book player, mp3 player, and voice recorder/FM radio recorder is very useful.

<Title>First CREATIVE experience
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My life is full of first-time experiences.  As a oblivious infant, I experienced my first time walking. As a 5-year-old, I experienced my first time how to read, and speak cohesively.  As a adolescent, I experienced my unbalanced emotions that I couldn't understand when I'm around girls.  And now, as a modern electronic-enthusiast,  I experienced my first time purchasing an mp3 player...or in this case, FLASH mp3 player.  ~REVIEW~  Let me get right down to this:  I LOVE this device.  Any newbie who's under the same shoes I am, looking for good mp3 player at its core, should place this player on their electronics checklist.  This review probably isn`t going to be THAT informative, because I don't know got-dang much about the selection of mp3 players.  I took me quite a while to find the best player on the market with the green I little have on my wallet, and I believe this CREATIVE product is the right choice to make; right on the features, and right on retail.  The "CREATIVE MuVo TX FM" player is cool, because like what it says on the box, it's not only a mp3 player:  it's a mp3/FM radio/microphone hybrid!  The player is small, it can place well into the palm of an adult's hand.  The screen is small too, but the buttons are big, and the text on the screen are quite readable, so the size is not that big of a deal.  Plus, it shows how much juice the AAA battery got left.  Like every music player affair, it has a standard play/pause, and volume button; the play/pause button also acts as a power button, but it's one of those power buttons where you press and hold it for a few seconds in order to turn off.  The scrolling gray thingy on the black width side of the player controls the rewind and fast-forward of the song whenever it`s pushed either left or right, which also skips tracks the same way, and pressing it can activate the selection the screen highlights or go to the main screen.  On the mp3 side,...well, it plays mp3 songs obviously, and it plays well, and sounds clear and flawless (it also plays WMAs).  Since I bought the MuVo TX FM with 256 Megs (approximately, meaning between 240 to 250),  it can plays up to 4 hours of songs with 128 kbps.  This player also has its own Equalizer, which is basically a bunch of bars moving vertically so the adjusted sound placement of the songs can be just right for the listener.  It contains its own sets of EQs: rock, jazz, classical, or if you're a EQ pro, you can customized your own EQ to personalize.  I can pull the black piece out of the white area of the MuVo, and use it as a separate USB hard drive, which was the greatest thing about it, because it's the easiest way to drag in any files (NOT JUST MP3) from the computer and put it in the device shown as a separate drive without out all that yes-or-no legal-disclaimer nonsense.  And I couldn't believe how fast the transmission is from computer to device; it took me almost a minute to put in all 25 4-minute songs.  The MuVo package does include a CD program, and with it I can convert my CDs into mp3s; there are other programs that can do that, but I don't mind this one.    One thing must be notified:  Licensed music files CAN'T be transmitted through point-A-to-B dragging, so you must transmit these types of files through a computer media program.  On the FM side, albeit without AM to back up, it sounds just as fluid as an mp3.  I can save a  preset to the radio stations, using the in-device menu, and up to 32 presets can I automatically go to any of my favorite rock/rap/whatever station.  The reception is good; it's not great, though.  Sometimes I have to wave my hands around like an airplane director with diarrhea just to hear the local college jazz station.  Otherwise, the FM radio is a wonderful alternate if I don't feel like listen to my personal tracks.  You go to school, and you were snoozing while your algebra teacher is discussing about the Pythagorean theorem, this device is effective as a microphone.  I went through the same situation, and this device works wonders as a listening stand-in.  And up to 16 hours can I record any kind of situation I want to hear again, or forgot to hear the first time.  Just a reminder, this takes up the same amount of Megs as the mp3s, so record it wisely...or not.  I made so much positive facts, the MuVo seems perfect, right?  Sadly, not true.  When it comes to putting the music files in the MuVo, I can't sort the tracks of my choosing, because the tracks are always listed alphabetically.  For that,  it became a time-consuming process to rename the whole files on the computer so the MuVo can list them the way I wanted, and that's tiresome.  The play/pause button has a tendency to get a slow response when I press it, and like everyone who reviewed this product, the uncomfortable headphone included in this device can make a person spend 30 extra bucks on a new one.  THE FINAL WORD:  Value.  If a media player has a ton of features AND it cost less than $150, almost nobody would ever stop saying "wow!", and with MuVo, I still have the habit of keep saying that.  Okay, it's not an Ipod, a Rio, or a Sony network walkman, and what I say is no different from every other positive reviewer for this item, but another positive review is just another example of why this is such a good buy and a good alternate for those who just wants to listen to music, no matter how much it can hold.  Don't distant yourself on this one.

<Content>USB 2.0, light weight, awesome sound, FM radio, long battery life, quality ear buds, and it took a total of 7 minutes for me to be up and running with this thing. I cant stress enough how easy it is to load it up with music. The software is great, it rips CD's, organizes music, compresses files, you name it. No cords no funky wires, just plug it in and the transfer is so fast. I personally dont needmy entire music collection with me, this holds just the right amount of music for my train commute and my jogs at night. This player is awesome.

<Title>Size Matters
<Date>Tue Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>We all know size matters, and as tiny as the MuVo is, it's one of my sexiest gadgets. I've owned larger lighters.   This is my first mp3 player, so look elsewhere for comparison based reviews. As a first time owner, I am absolutely delighted. The sound quality is as crisp as a CD. The controls are simple and intuitive. It's tiny enough to fit into the smallest fashionable purse, but also comes with an easy-to-use removable belt clip and exercise arm band. What more could I want?   I bought the MuVo to go with Audible.com. At 256 megs, it will hold 2-3 medium length novels or one huge unabridged one. I could've bought a MP3 jukebox, but in comparison, even the iPod mini is HUGE. I don't need every song I've ever heard with me all the time. I'd rather throw on a playlist and a book and have a wonderfully tiny little device.  The software is so simple I never needed to open the manual. Plug and play, baby! The MuVo is also a USB flash drive, so no cords are needed. Just slide it into your USB port and you're all set. Loading files is simple and intuitive. If you already have audible.com, loading audible books is just as easy (IMPORTANT NOTE: This is only compatible with audible files at a 2 or 3 resolution. Higher or lower and they won't be recognized by the player.)   The biggest shock was the FM player. I owned a Radio Your Way for awhile and couldn't hear the songs over the static. My tiny little MuVo picks up even the faintest NPR stations with incredible clarity.   The included headphones are a bit uncomfortable, but headphones are cheap and easy to come by. I can't begrudge them that. Other reviews complain about low battery life. I get about 8 hours on my rechargables, which I find pretty reasonable since it's powered by a single AAA.   If you're looking for a small, inexpensive mp3 player/FM reciever, with great sound quality, you can't go wrong with the MuVo.   ***addendum:  The Samsung Yepp is, in fact a tiny bit smaller. For people out there who want to rub it in, the MuVo is the sexy thong of the MP3 world while the Yepp is closer to a g-string. Less is what you see and less is what you get - the Yepp is NOT Audible ready and does not offer any Audible support. In addition, the Yepp does not come with either a belt clip or an armband (MuVo gives you both) so make sure your clothes have plenty of pockets. The MuVo is still the tiniest MP3 player in it's class, but there is a less classy competitor out there if you're looking for sheer Geek Chick Size Coolness.  The size difference is pretty minimal. MuVo: 1.4 x 2.9 x 0.6 versus Yepp: 0.94 x 0.94 x 2.2. It's really more a question of whether you prefer your MP3 player flat (the MuVo) or cubical (the Yepp.)

<Title>File System Error Fix
<Date>Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>In general, I love this little machine.  It has all the right features.  It's small, but packed with goodies such as a FM tuner, a voice recorder, a 256 MB USB storage device with an integrated USB plug (no wires), and the sound quality is great.  A few small complaints.  First when the clear plastic belt clip holder is on, it's really hard to remove the MP3 player from the battery housing.  I guess it's not supposed to be removed with the belt clip on, but I'd like to be able to do that.  I ended up cutting a chunk off the clear plastic so I can unplug it easier.  Second, the headphones are poor.  The ear buds don't fit well and the sound quality is poor.  The wire has an asymmetric joint so the wire to one ear is longer than the wire to the other ear.  Ditch the headphones and buy a good one.  Third, I had the unfortunate experience of having the dreaded "File System Error" show up on the screen.  Don't know how I got it, but when it happens, you can't turn the beast on.  It just flashes the error message and turns itself off.  I can plug it into the PC just fine and it will work as a USB storage device.  Just won't work outside of the PC.  Formatting it didn't help.  Calling Creative tech support didn't help.  They told me to return it for an exchange.  I did a web search and found some people with similar problems.  They were all told to return it to Creative or to return it to the store for an exchange.  By an incredible stroke of luck, I stumbled on a way to fix this nagged problem.  I formatted it again (using windows explorer), but this time, I specified FAT file format instead of FAT32.  Voila!  It turns on and seems to be working just fine now.  So those of you who see the "File System Error" message, try that first.  You may also try to put a Label on it.  Perhaps that helps too.  Overall, I still love this little music machine and would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Great little gadget for the price
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I won't give all the specs because those are listed in the spotlight reviews. I got this for going to the gym, and it's pretty much just the right size for putting all of my favorite up-beat music on to exercize to. Also it's holding up remarkably well considering it gets thrown into my gym bag with my sneakers.  The controls are very simple and easy to use. And contrary to the first spotlight review, you actually can skip to the middle of a song, you just have to roll the track-skip wheel to the right and hold it for a while (it's just not terribly quick). The menu is pretty self-explanatory and includes all the features you would want without all the bells and whistles. Also if you turn off the player while it is in the middle of a song, when you turn it back on it picks up in the middle of that song and remembers your settings including playmode and EQ.  You don't have to download expensive software that takes up all of your memory, but you have the option of installing software that the player comes with, or you can just drag and drop from your computer to the player. However you can't create new folders once the music is on the player - files have to be in the folders you want them in on the computer and uploaded that way.  Two criticisms: one is the microphone quality. If you are recording a person talking, it comes out slightly muffled and quiet and you really have to turn the volume up to hear. However seeing as this is hardly the most expensive, high-quality mic on the planet, it at least does its job.  Second, and this is minor, the player hooks onto the armband via the belt clip. The belt clip is fairly fat, so although the player is tiny, it becomes quite a protrusion from your arm, as opposed to say, ipods which go into a case that's flat against your arm.

<Title>Great and Little!!!
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first bought this product, I was a little skeptical because some of the reviews on this site said that it breaks easily after six months.  So i finally decided to just buy the damn thing and take my chances.  However, I bought an extended warranty for 10 bucks (from amazon) just to be on the safe side.  I am happy to say that after 8 months my mp3 is still working just fine.  The only problems I have with it are the following:  It doesn't have much room, especially when you want to hold files and music on it at the same time, you have to keep buying batteries for it and since I listen to mine all the time I usually end up buying batteries every single week, and for some reason the button used to increase the volume is a little jammed (but that could be from me always raising the volume.  Other than that I would recommend this product to anyone.  I personally like it better than Ipod cause it is cheaper, lighter, it just better.  If your a person that NEEDS 1,000+ songs to listen to, then Ipod might be the way to go.  But if ur like me and 90 or so songs will do, then definitely buy this wonderful gadget.

<Title>Great Device
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great buy for someone who wants a device to play good quality music for an affordable price. I have had this for a little above 2 months.  This is my first MP3 player.  I have very little knowledge about MP3 players.  However, I can easily say this is a good product.  This is great for someone who wants to spend a resonable amount for a Portable music player.  The sound is great, plays beautifully with a good set of headphones.  Its easy, just plug in a USB port drag and drop your file and you're done, it comes with software, but its unnecessary to install it.  Sturdy, I've dropped it quite a few times and no problems what so ever.  As long as you have Duracell or Energizer batteries the battery life is exceptionally long, about 15 hours.  Carry one extra and you can go an entire day with skip free high quality music.  The headphones are nice, not great.  If you have a good ear you might want to get some better ones, otherwise they work fine.  I don't quite use the extra features, but to write a good review I check them out.  The Radio for the most part has good reception, not to mention you can record it.  Voice recorder does an okay job, gets about a two foot range and you can hear it well.    Either way if you are looking for a music player with no special features, such as watching music videos, then this is a great buy for you.  Great sound quality, FM radio, easy use.  This alone convince me to buy it.  Simply because I'm not going to go out and spend 300 to 400 dollars on an iPod.  This is great if you want small and easily portable music with great quality playback.  My only recommendation is that you get a larger storage size.  I found because of the quality of sound, it brings out the irregularities of shrunk music to fit on it, I keep my music stored on it about 5MB, so the number of tracks are limited for me.  Actually I've considered buying another Creative MuVo MP3 Player with a larger storage size.    I don't know your preferences, but I was very satisfied with my purchase.

<Date>Wed Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the MP3 player for about a month now, and overall Im pleased with it...it's lightweight, plugs easily into the computer, and has good sound quality. The earbuds are decent too. I've been using it in the gym and it works well for me.  I had problems when I downloaded music files using Windows Explorer...it's best to use software to download the files to the MP3 player. The software that comes with it is a little awkward to use, but not too difficult after some practice.   It does go through batteries rapidly! However, I've been loading MWA files on it, and they are supposed to drain the battery more quickly than MP3 files. I plan to experiment with this.  If you've got more money to spend (I didn't), I'd recommend an MP3 player with more storage...this unit holds the equivalent of about 4 CDs, so I'm having to periodically erase the MP3 player and load up different CDs. It doesn't bother me but it's something to consider.

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I wanted an MP3 player with a radio for my walks....this fit's the bill, althought I had another one that only lasted about a year.  For the money...it's s good little unit but I think the next one will be an IPOD that will hold a lot more cd's and work with my home stereo.  I would recommend this to people who want some tunes while working out as it's small and no to expensive if it's dropped.

<Title>Value for Money....better display would help
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This chap is sheer value for money, triple the features for half the price of an ipod. Quite easy to use for the average buyer....would have helped if the display was a bit more ligible and the menu would stay for a couple of seconds longer, I bought this for my dad who is 70+, and it took him a while to get used to it.

<Title>I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT...
<Date>Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 Player for my 10 yr old son for his birthday.  We downloaded alot of songs on it and it played for a week, then it would just turn off by itself while my son was listening to his music, so my husband and myself played with it a little to see if it was the batteries and it kept doing it even after replacing the batteries.    Finally, we just sent it back and got a refund.    After we got a refund, we went out and bought a SCANDISK MP3 player and he has been in music heaven every since.

<Title>Great little thing! Better than iPod nano
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is fantastic. Very easy to use, excellent sound quality, excellent battery life. The buttons are little small for those who have big hands, but it is extremelly light. The FM works great, and you can even record from the FM. It is really a pen drive, so you can just stick it in your USB port with no need for calbles to connect. I'd recommend, not only this version but all the others 512Mb and 1GB (blue and red)

<Title>Battery Life - Unacceptable
<Date>Fri Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have used the MuVo TX FM 256 MB for several weeks now and find that it does everything well except that battery life has never been more than 2 hours.  I have bought the best batteries available, not used the variety of functions available on the unit and the result is always the same.  Two hours or less battery life.  I've even used the "monster" batteries that are made for digital products.  Support from Creative labs has been a series of nonsensical emails that were obviously written by High School dropouts.  I would not recommend this unit to anyone.

<Title>Better by design
<Date>Mon Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like most who purchase from Amazon.com I do read reviews and try and help others who may come along. On the plus side I do like the small conveinent size,with easy to use controls. It would be perfect for cycling. I  did have two concerns.  1. On page 12 of the manual there is a warning notice to wash your hands after use, because you "may" have lead contact with the cords.  It does not specify internal or external. Based on how harmful lead can be I didn't want to take any chances.  I don't think it matters on the size of the product and its components that contain hazardous materials. Warnings are usually there for a reason.    2. The Sports Armband has a poor design.  Unless you have 16 inch arms than it may work for you.  Having to gather the fabric to make it work felt odd and noticeable.  As for performance I never go that far.

<Title>not bad
<Date>Wed Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had this for several days and overall I am pretty satisfied with it. I won't bother going through all the features here. The things I like most are: 1) pretty samll and light weight, good for taking it with you jogging 2) it's really a jump drive, so you can use it just like a jump drive  A couple of complaints: 1) The earbuds are very uncomfortable (at least for my ears), even though the sound quality is pretty good. I had to junk it and get a new one. 2) The belt clip holder could be much better.  Also, a previous reviewer complained about a warning label on "lead contamination", I believe that is the same "warning" they put on all Christmas lights. In fact, I think that warning is only for residents of California. :) The same reviewer also mentioned the size of the armband being too big, actually if you put it on the right way, it won't be too big.

<Content>After reading the other reviews, I selected this item as my first MP3 player.  I think it is great!  The sound is excellent;  it's a great size (for a 256 MB player);  it holds enough music to make it useful;  the radio is ok;  the battery life is impressive;  the price is right.  Some minor complaints:  the ear buds are too big to be comfortable;  the display is a bit too small;  the scroller is too touchy?  Overall, I'm satisfied beyond my expectations.

<Title>The earphones are large, but...
<Date>Sat Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe it or not, I'm on my second MuVu.  I bought the 256MB NX almost a year ago for a pretty decent $119.99, and then I just bought the 256MB TX FM not too long ago for $99.99.  I agree with what most people say, at least in the flaws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earphones are large, and I'm a pretty big guy with pretty large ears, etc., and even I find discomfort with them.  What I did was sell the earphones Creative Labs packaged it with (which fetched around $10 on eBay), and I went out and bought new earphones.  The included earphones are special because they use the metal Neodymium, but Neodymium earphones are readily available through other makers (although the Creative Labs one is the best fit for the Creative Labs player), so it shouldn't be a problem to find an ear bud that's the right size for you.  Any earphone/headphone with Neodymium offers crazy bass than if you use an earphone without it. I think Coss sells affordable ones for $9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, a lot of people were saying the buttons are too sensitive.  Well, the reason I'm on my second MuVo, and not switching over to something else, is because the buttons are simple.  I keep mine in my pocket, and I don't even have to take it out to see what it is I'm doing (unless I use something that requires the menu).  I mean, there are only four buttons (!)  I give props to whomever designed it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My only beef is that the new MuVos come with a white battery case, and I looked at Creative Lab's web site, and found them peddling battery cases in different colors (I guess to keep up with the iPod Mini fad), and I really wished it would've came in gunmetal black (the original black color the NX came with).  Some people won't mind it, but I use mine at work and I don't want it sticking out like a sore thumb because you see this chunk of white, so I'm going to have to dish out $9.99 for the gunmetal black battery case (plus S&H).  And the radio's not that strong, unless you're outside or the station you're listening to has a strong signal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even then, its positive traits outweight the negative ones.

<Title>Great product with only minor flaws
<Date>Tue Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the first mp3 player I have bought, but I am a techie so I know all about various computer related products. I had spent a couple of weeks looking for a decent mp3 player. I choose a Flash based player because I wanted to use it while I exercise (or when I start to actually) and a hard drive based player is just not a good idea for that. My requirements were that it have at least 256 MB of memory, have a FM radio and be able to carry more than just music. Having said that, I am providing a list of pros and cons.  Pros: Small Size: Smaller than my cell phone so it can fit in all my pockets and I barely notice its there. Connectivity: USB 2.0 is so much faster than USB 1.1. Loading music goes quick. Ease of Use: I opened it and within 5 minutes I had it loaded with music and playing songs. I give it to a few other people who wanted to look at it and they were able to do everything with it right away. Sound quality: It produces very good sounding music. I connected it to my speakers which have very good bass and all around performance and the Muvo was on par in terms of quality as my PC is. Buttons: The buttons are nice and big and easy to find. The power button has to be held in for a bit to turn it on and off. At first I thought this was a con but it is actually a benefit as it prevents accidently turning it on or off. One last thing, some people have said that you can't skip to the middle of a song, well if you press the dial forward and hold it there it will fast forward through a song. Same goes for reverse if you hold it the other way. Battery: The battery that came with it is a major brand battery and it has lasted a long time so far. I would guess at least 10 hours and its only half way done. Its only a AAA so thats pretty impressive to me.  Cons: Headphones: These things hurt! I have big ears and they still don't fit me. They sound from them when they are in is good but the discomfort of having them in outweighs this fact. Included Belt clip: The way the clip is positioned is great if you use it with the armband but if you put it on your belt it kinda digs into your stomach and I'm a really thin guy so its not my stomach causing the problem. It would have been nice if the player could be turned sideways so it is horizontal instead of vertical. That would have made the positioning much more comfortable while I am listening at work. Belt Clip Case-thingy: The rubber case covers only half of the player. Since it makes it really hard to take the USB part out of the battery pack, it would have been nice if the case covered more of the player to protect all of it or made smaller so its easier to take the player out. Lanyard holder: Creative could have spent the extra 10 cents and thrown a key ring in with this so you can attach it to a neck lanyard since there is a spot for one. Did I mention how uncomfortable these included headphones are?

<Title>An Amazing Thing
<Date>Wed Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The MuVo TX FM 256MB is perfect for listening to music outside your house.  It is practically weightless, at 1.5 ounces, and of course, it doesn't skip at all.  Perfect for if you are running, biking snowboarding, climbing, taking a stroll around the block, or sitting through a boring English class.  It is small and unobtrusive, easy to use and best of all it has an amazing sound. It can hold a surprising amount of music for its size and weight, right now I have about 4 or 5 hours of music on it.  But if you get bored of listening to your music, you can always add new stuff or switch to the FM radio.  it doesn't have a big antenna sticking out of it, it doesn't even have an antenna, yet it has amazing reception.  You can also switch from scanning mode, to preset mode.  It you ever have a quick though that you need to remember, but you have no aper, just record it, with 16 hours of recording time, you wont need a note book any longer.  So over all this is an amazing MP3 Player, that you should consider buying.  The only downside to it is changing the battery, but that is not too big of a deal, it has about 15 hours of it.

<Date>Sun Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After weighing my options whether to buy a dedicated MP3 player and an MP3-cum-USB storage disk, I decided to go for the MP3 USB disk combo. I shopped around and stumbled upon this MP3 player from Creative. It delivers good performance for its relatively cheap price. On the plus side, it is inexpensive, considering the fact that it is from Creative. It comes with features such as FM tuner, FM/Voice recorder and 256MB memory size for file/music storage. The software bundle is okay, although you may never need it if you know how to use Microsoft Windows media player 9.  On the minus side, the audio level is low, I wish the designers put in more power to its amps. Value for value, the Creative Labs MuVo FM MP3 player is a very good buy.

The creative media organizer is easy to use and has a good selection of playlists.  And, the computer treats it like just another folder when the device is plugged in to the usb port.  Upgrading the firmware is a little bit of a hassle, but not too bad.

<Title>Good value for the price
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I agree with the pros and cons the previous reviewer highlighted. This was my first MP3 player, and I bought it for two purposes: 1.) to listen to the radio while jogging, and 2.) to listen to mp3 files while traveling. It fit the bill perfectly for both. The only downside (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that the headphones didn't fit my ears well and didn't block out ambient noise. Honestly, for the low price I didn't expect the system to come with great headphones, so I wasn't too disappointed. I just purchased new in-ear, noise-cancelling headphones and "voila!" -- the perfect system for my needs.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player and i sure do love the features of this:  * 256 mb capacity * USB Connector * Small and sleek design  * Great quality earphones * FM Radio  However there are quite a few disadvantages also:  * Is it just me or when i'm using FM, shaking the headphones affects the quality of the music (??)  * The documentation is not very good...for instance, how to use FM radio is not clear as also the ability to move into the middle of a track (yes, this is possible unlike the previous reviewer who claims it is not -- you need to turn the "tuner" midway forward or backward depending on whether you're forwarding or rewinding and hold it there  * Finally, 256 mb might seem adequate, but trust me once you finish filling up the place, you might have a pretty difficult time trying to decide which songs to remove and which ones to keep (Granted this is not a mistake of the manufacturer, but be aware of what you're getting into.  All-in-all a product that's gives you full value for money, but then again there is every possibility that you're underestimating the amount of money you are willing to spend on a good MP3 player...

<Content>I got this little guy as something to use when I go to the gym.  I have a 30gb ipod as well, but that's not really something to be moving around and working out with.  I chose this player becuase it was affordable and had an FM tuner.  I like the fact that you can just drag and drop your files to it.  If you decide you don't want a song on it anymore, just drag it away.  Voila!  It also the shuffle option, which was the big thing with the ipod shuffle.  Let me tell you, I have tried my friend's shuffle and, to put it nicely, it sucks.  Big time.  No screen or anything.  Yuck.  Anyways, some people have reviewed this and said that it breaks easily and quits working and such.  I bought this back in November at Wal-Mart and have used it four to six times a week for a half hour each time and it is still working great.  If you need something to take to the gym or on workouts, get it!  It's worth it!  The only thing that I would do is get some alternate headphones.

No need to install crappy software or drivers to transfer files/mp3s 4. Customisable graphic equaliser 5. FM Radio 6. Dictaphone 7. Good amplification (can use low sensitivity headphones)  Cons 1. Included earphones are uncomfortable and have poor sound quality. They should be replaced. 2. Display is good quality, but unfortunately it only shows id title tag and time elasped. i would prefer it showed artist and title tags. 3. No way to skip through albums unless you store each album in a different directory 4. No dedicated hold switch 5. Only supports - mp3 / wav / wma. No support for ogg and monkey audio etc.

<Title>Perfect for Audible audio books
<Date>Sat Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First, a disclaimer: I didn't buy this to listen to MP3 music. I love to listen to audio books from Audible.com, and this is one of the approved players for that service (it uses a special audio format so you can't use just any player). But since lots of people want a device for audio books, I figured this focused review would be handy.  Setup was a snap: popped in the battery, and started exploring the controls. It's a testament to how smart the design is that I didn't have to refer to the manual at all. Once you figure out that the little rocker wheel can also be pushed in (like clicking the mouse wheel on a computer mouse) that's the "open sesame" to navigating all the menus.   I plugged it into a free USB port on my Windows XP PC, and the PC immediately recognized it; wonderful not having to install any drivers!  I got the Creative Muvo plug in from the Audible site to allow the player to be recognized by the Audible software on my PC, activated the player via Audible Manager (took 30 seconds) and then I quickly transferred a couple of audio books to the device. Easy, fast, and the audio is clear and high quality.  PROS Incredibly tiny.  No hard drive--durable.  Thoughtful design, like a power switch that has to be held in for a couple of seconds to turn on/off, so no accidental presses will affect it. Intuitive controls. No special software needed to use it. Easy to use controls without even looking. Bonus: convenient way to transfer files between PCs.   CONS The ear buds are junk. Toss 'em. It'd be nice if the display was a bit longer, but this is a nit. FM radio receiver is mediocre.  Can't force FM to mono; this is annoying with a weak signal.  Overall, this is the audio book device of my dreams. I was using a Pocket PC for the purpose, but it was bulky compared to this, and I was always afraid of dropping it because they're pretty fragile. And the software controls on a Pocket PC are incredibly awkward to use compared to the purpose-built buttons of the MuVo. This isn't a replacement for a really high quality FM reciever like a Sangean, but it's a nice bonus. I have no regrets getting this, and it's a great value too.

It allows you to customize your own equalizer setting to suit your listening preferences. I have tried other brands of MP3 players and I can say that Creative produces the best quality sound. For those people who complained about the limited number of songs that it can hold, if you cannot read the 256MB written on the packaging when you bought the player, it's not the product fault. There are 512MB and 1GB version of this in the market for those who requires a larger capacity.

<Content>i'll preface this by stating this is my 3rd MP3 player in 4 years. previously i've used Rio products - the 500 (which i still feel is one of the more aesthetically pleasing players ever released) and the s10. compared to those products the Muvo TX FM is by far the best flash player i've ever handled. it supports mp3, wav, wma and Audible books (with the latest firmware upgrade at creative.com). the user interface is nicely done and leaps and bounds above what i've seen from competing manufacturers. all the features touted work as advertised - the radio reception is particularly good (at least in NYC), and the radio recording is loud and works well, though the bitrate used makes the feature more ideal for talk show recordings than music. likewise the microphone offers pretty decent recordings, but it isn't going to replace anyone's tape recorder for clarity and reception.  though the device has a sturdy construction that feels completely solid in your hands (especially once you slide the device into its rubber casing), i worry about the longevity of its spring-loaded rocker wheel. i haven't had any issues with it in the week i've had the device, but i'm not sure it'll last through months scrolling and occasional drops. as is, the case is great (though it's only protecting 3/4 of the device) and the included armband is a godsend for me since i will be using the Muvo primarily when i'm at the gym. as some have mentioned the included headphones are garbage. jettison them quickly and get anything else.  the player installs as an external hard drive on Windows XP/2000 systems. this highlights a great design feature of the Muvo TX, as it's basically a USB keychain drive with a LCD screen, buttons, and a battery holder attached on. unplugging the usb drive from the battery compartment, you can plug the Muvo into any usb-capable computer and access your files. throw your word documents, pictures, anything really, into the device and you can still use it to hold music. as a college student i carry documents on the drive to bring it back and forth from the computer science labs to my home system. easy and no hassles.  putting music on the drive is as simple as dragging it in from Explorer. if you want, however, you can use either the included Creative media program (bloated) or Windows Media 9/10 to transfer music over to the device. the Creative does not accept playlists, which could be a problem for some. users can get around that by either grouping audio on the device by folders, or by renaming their songs to play in the proper order. the Muvo TX plays songs by alpha-numeric order on the drive, so filenames starting with A will be read before B, songs with 01 read before 03, etc. since most of my music is appropriately tagged with id3 and named properly (artist, song number, title) this isn't much of a hassle.  a bigger issue for me is that the device does not read music nestled under 2 or 3 layers of folders. you can section off your music by folder, but the folders must exist on the root directory of your drive. the player won't find any music that's buried inside two or more layers of folders, which is a hassle because windows media player 10 by default transfers music organized under a litany of folders. after transfering songs from WMP 10, i have to manually go to the drive and drag folders, delete folders, and other sorts of nonsense to get the device to read them all. this is nothing that can't be rectified by a firmware update, but creative is spotty in this area. the latest update available at creative.com lets the device support Audible books, but introduced some radio volume problems (seems to jump up and down occassionaly).  music clarity is great, and i have no problem whatsoever with the decoding engine in the player. replacing the headphones with a decent pair, music came out loud and clear on my sony earbuds. the included EQ is very adjustable and its settings make a definite impact on the music. the player has a minimal set of buttons, which is great. there is a play/pause button on the front of the device which also functions as the on/off switch if held onto for 3 seconds (you'll see a progress bar on the player's LCD screen when you hold down the play/pause button to indicate that you're bout to shut the devie down). volume is controlled by two sets of buttons on the player's side, and rewind/fastforward and song skip are handled by the rocker wheel. the rocker wheel also handles the menu and interface, which as i've said earlier is intuitive and quick.  the best is the battery life. my Rio S10 spoiled me with 20+ hours of playback on one AA battery, and i expected the Muvo to be noticably less since it uses AAA. to my surprise i've had about 15-18 hours with the included name-brand AAA, and i doubt it'll change much when i switch to my rechargables.  all in all this is a great player and i recomend it to anyone who is interested in a flash-based device. though there isn't any room for upgrades, the device has enough memory for the job, and its dual function as a USB keychain drive makes up for the loss.

<Title>The downsides to this MP3 player.
<Date>Mon Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Here is a small list of a few things I found annoying about this MP3 player:  1) The earbud headphones are bulky and the foam covers are rough, which cause your ears to hurt after about 15 minutes of using them.  2) The earbud headphones are very limited in terms of frequency range. The frequency range is very narrow, meaning you miss out on some of the high end and low end sounds. I bought a pair of Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones in order to hear what I was missing and the difference was astounding.  3) While using the MP3 player, there are no playlist features or folders available to help organize your collection. This means you can only skip to the next song, one at a time and in whatever order you imported them in. This is probably due to the 1-line, tiny screen on the player, which can display only one song at a time.  4) The maximum volume is not very high at all. I turned it up all the way and I can still hear my surroundings. Oh well, at least I'll never go deaf using this MP3 player.  Other than that, it's a sleek-looking, highly compact player that packs a punch. No complaints at all in the sound department. Also, the custom EQ let's you tweek the quality of sound EXACTLY the way you like it!

<Title>How to display more that the song title
<Date>Wed Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got this today, so I haven't had it long enough to give a review, but I noticed that other reviews commented on how you can only see the title of the song in the display and not the artist.  What is shown in the display is what is in the title category when it's on your computer.  If you go to the file and right click and go to properties, then clikc on the summary tab there will be a box for title.  Just type in whatever you want for the title and that is what will be displayed on the mp3 player.  A quick way to see what the titles are is if you look at the files using detailed list to view them (where it shows all the info about the files).  If you right click at the top where it says name, size, filetype, etc. it will give you the option of displaying the title.  This way you can easily look down your list and figure out which ones you need to change.  Hopefully this will help some people, I'll write a review of the mp3 later when I have used it more.

<Title>great little gadget
<Date>Mon Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got this item a couple of days ago and I'm pretty happy with it.  I really wasn't looking for an MP3 player, but I got sucked into the technology.  I'm nowhere near computer literate so it took me a couple of tries to transfer my music files on to the player.  For some reason I just couldn't just drag and drop so I had to use the software to get started, but I started flowing soon after.  The biggest thing I like about it is the size of it.  I can just stick it in my pocket and roll.  I didn't have any problems with the carrier as I've read some folks did.  The price is right if you're not looking at spending a lot of money and a first time buyer of this type of product.  I'm pretty happy with my purchase so far.

<Title>Outstanding overall and #1 jogging mate
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my second MP3 player I have owned and about the 4th I have tried...and it is the best. Creative has found their niche--high quality, reasonable price, good sound quality. Rio can't overcome their quality control issues, Iriver is high priced, and so is Ipod...and the rest are either low quality or low in performance value. This MP3 player is the perfect jogging companion, the belt clip is very tight (no worries of falling off while running), but also extremely comfortable...I don't even notice it is there. This MP3 player is so light, you can clip it on your running shorts, without worrying about the wieght draggin them down. If you prefer, it also comes with an very well designed armband. About the only potential drawback is if you like to listen to the music at levels that will guarantee to damage your hearing...this player doesn't go that loud, but it does get plenty loud enough where it will be impossible to hear anything but your music. Drag and dropping music via USB 2.0 makes this the fastest I've seen in music upload. It has all the features you want and 256 will hold plenty of songs. Best jogging partner on the market and one of the best overall MP3 flash players out there.

<Title>Excellent for Workouts
<Date>Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you are buying an Mp3 player to use while exercising, this is an excellent product for the following reasons: 1.) It is lightweight and durable. I have ran through some extreme weather (heavy rain, snow) without any adverse effects on the player.  2.)I am 5'8'' and 155lbs. The included strap kept the unit stable on my arm. People with wider arms might have problems with the strap, however. 3.) The software is easy to use. I was able to convert my CDs into Mp3 format within minutes of installing the package. Because a flash-based player, you just have to plug the flash drive into your computer and drag and drop the songs.  4.) The FM Tuner gets good reception in urban areas.  5.) Long battery life. I get about 16 hours of use before having to change the triple A battery.  Again, I only use it while working out. I can't give an informed opinion on the more advanced features.

<Title>MuVo TX FM / Enormous bang for the buck
<Date>Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The MuVo TX FM by Creative Labs is an exceptional digital audio media player. If you're looking for lightweight, good performance and ease of use in an MP3 player, search no more. Ruggedly designed for the person on the go. It can be attached to your arm with the armband for running and exercise or simply clip it to your belt.  Packing high performance and ease of operation into the tiny MuVo TX FM is what makes this baby a breeze for the novice user. You can drag and drop songs super fast with the USB 2.0 connection that requires no extra cable to tote along for transferring. You also don't need to install the Creative software that comes in the box if you have Windows Media Player. Just plug the unit into the USB port, drag and drop your songs, and you're ready to go. Storage on the 256 MB model will hold about four hours of MP3 music.   Other features include: voice recorder (16 hour capacity with 256 MB) with built-in microphone, back light, customizable five band equalizer, FM radio tuner and recorder, and it can be used as a storage device for other files and photos. Operating on one AAA battery will get you about fifteen hours of non-stop music.  After e-mailing tech support at Creative Labs questioning if this unit is compatible with the Mac, it was pleasantly surprising to get a response within fourteen minutes, however it is not compatible. For those considering this unit for use during running or vigorous exercise, you may want to purchase a different set of ear buds. The set included with the unit seem to fall out easily.   The multiple features and low price make buying this MP3 player an easy decision for those who are not so savvy with the new innovations in digital audio media. If you want a small media player but want giant, quality sounding music at a price that won't break the piggy bank, you'll want to give the MuVo TX FM by Creative Labs a try.    By:  Bill Bennett

<Title>Best Value for money. 
<Date>Sun Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player at walmart for 59.96, a bit cheaper than the price here.  I love it, it was very easy to use and although I couldn't figure out at first how to get my napster music into the library for it, I went to the creative website and it gave me a tutorial. Really nice and simple, step by step instructions.  To the person that reviewed this before me, you CAN skip to the middle of a song, my 3 year old did to mine on accident, lol.  Press the middle of the scroller button one time, and you can fast forward within a song using the scroller. Press it again and it reverts back to scrolling to the next song.  I agree about the earplugs on the headphones, they are quite big, so I will definitely be buying different ones for it.  But I still give it 5 stars for ease of use.

But it is loud enough for me, and probably better for my ears.  It comes with software, but none is needed. you can store data or music or any thing using windows explorer.

<Title>Muvo works with MAC but you must delete .trashes folder
<Date>Tue Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My girlfriend uses the MUVO with her MAC. she just plugs it in and drags files to it. the problem is deleting files, it creates a hidden directory called .trashes And puts the MP3s there. so they still take up all the space. you have to change your MAC to show these hidden files and delete the folder.  I usually just plugged it into my PC and deleted it for her.   this is a tiny lightweight MP3 player good for jogging or traveling with. i bought new headphones because I did not like the earbuds it came with. i love that there is no cable, just put in in the usb outlet and go. I also like the AA batteries, i use rechargables. so No charger. no cables. no docking station. it's a complete kit in one unit.

<Content>An excellent lighweight and cheap player with a decent receiver. The earbuds are not worth mentioning - I recommend e.g, the a cheap and comfortable Sony MDR-A35G S2 Sports Headphones, that one can wear for hours without getting sore ears.  My player started to shut down eratically and would not start on many occasions after about half a year, but simply installing a newer firmware fixed this problem: (http://dapjukebox.altervista.org/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownloaddetails&lid=232&ttitle=[MuVo%20TX%20FM]%20Firmware%201.19.01)

<Title>Like it, but it didn't hold up for the most part
<Date>Sat Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this item in the summer of 2005 and was quite happy with it and the reasonable price of it.  I had gone back and forth between getting this and the ipod shuffle, but I liked being able to have a screen.  This does come with an FM radio, but alas, mine stopped working 4-5 weeks after I bought it. Actually the radio might still work, but I can no longer get the MP3 player to switch to that choice.  I am continously stuck in play mode.  I can't delete songs (unless I connect to the computer), I can't shuffle the songs.  I can turn it on and off and use the volume.  Still, with all that, I like this little player, sound is nice and I don't worry about breaking it.  We recently purchased an Apple ipod 30GB and 4GB nano, and those seem to fancy for running around the block, and I would really be unhappy if I dropped one of those.   I don't worry about this one quite so much.  Still, the small capacity is getting a bit old.  I think it held 65 songs in mp3 format.  For this price I don't know if I would buy it again for the small capacity, but I have it now and I will keep it, as long as it keeps playing.

<Title>A basic mp3 player that exceeds your everyday needs
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative MuVo TX FM is actually very useful in my everyday life.  I jog with it, work with it, and if I need some relaxing music to lull me to sleep, this player has it all.    Some of its great features hold:  -Plays mp3 music -Has a FM radio -Can record FM music -Has a voice recorder -Can be used as a jump drive, in a way -Can store 256 mb of memory, although it actually holds 242.3 mb of space... -Ultra light {only 1.1 ounces without the battery (32 grams)} -Built in USB drive  -Simple and easy to use.  CONS:  -The memory is a bit small for hard-core music lovers, or people who store lots of files -The screen is a little small, but you don't actually notice that while you're using it -The color white on this product can get dirty, but that's just getting nit picky.  OVERALL:     I highly reccomend this product.  The features as well as the low price has me lured onto this product, and I wouldn't be surprised if you decided to make this player your new best friend.

<Title>I Bought 2 of Them!
<Date>Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For the price, this is a great mp3 player. Its competatively priced with other mp3 players, but offers a lot more. It can also be used as a flash memory drive, a recording device, and an FM radio. Its compact size and 256mb memory drive are useful too. The only downsides to this player are the size of the ear buds, which are a bit too large to fit inside the ear comfortably; and the fact that songs can only be arranged alpha-numerically. You can't randomize the order that songs are played in, or order them according to the order they appear in an album.  Despite these downsides, the advantages were enough that I bought one for myself as well as one for my girlfriend. I recommend it for anyone looking for an mp3 player with about 4 hours playing time (with mpgs), decent battery life, and versatility

<Content>I have had the product for several weeks.  I'm very happy so far with the performance.  I use it for the gym. The radio works well and sound quality seems fine to me. Loading music was easy.  Pros:    Price    Radio & mp3 palyer    Loading music was easy Cons:    Instruction manual is not very good    Limited song capacity    Headphones were poor.  I use ones I bought    Battery life is fairly short, but I don't use it for long periods.  (1 AAA battery)    Needs Windows 98 SE or XP to load music.  Be careful your operating system is compatible    When battery gets low, you have to be careful you stay out of the play mp3 mode.  The device will shut off immediately if the battery is low.  When you turn it on, it will start in the mode you left in.  It took me about 9 tries to pause play so I could switch to FM mode. Overall I am happy with the product.  It fits perfectly with what I needed. I would recommend it as long as the limitations above are not a problem.

<Title>Lots of features, reliable, great workout companion
<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my 2nd mp3 player--my first was an iRiver FP-190T which began having sound issues after about 15 months of use.  I was looking for a flash-based mp3 player which would be small and lightweight for use while working out, would have easy file transferability and would be more durable than my previous player.  After 6 months of use, it has met my expectations.  Size and weight is about as small as one can get, and the flash-based memory makes it perfect for use while exercising.  The holder and armband work well.  The FM radio has nice reception.  I've yet to use the voice-recording capability, but it's nice to have there, just in case.  File transferability is the strength of this device.  The iRiver software I had to use with my previous player was always kind of clunky.  The Creative is very easy--in fact, requires no software.  Just plug the USB part of the player into a USB port on your computer, and drag-and-drop.   In fact, it doubles as a USB drive to hold other types of files such as Word documents, so its versatility makes it even more valuable.  The cons are relatively minor quibbles:  --While in use, navigation among songs and folders is virtually impossible.  Basically you have "next song" and "shuffle" options.  This is a needed software/firmware upgrade, IMHO. --It doesn't have plug-and-play capability with all computers (e.g., my office computer).  It may require installation of the accompanying software before it is recognized as a USB storage device on other computers. --It is somewhat difficult to remove the mp3 player from the armband holder. --I don't care for the earbuds, but I've yet to find a set of earbuds that I care to use, so I don't hold this against Creative at all.  Overall, the Creative has met my expectations.  I hope it maintains its reliability longer than my previous mp3 player, and given my positive experience with other Creative products, I trust that it will.

<Content>I loved the unit. It just broke right away. The size was great although it is sparse on storagge.  However, my rating is based on a 3rd or 4th time usage problem that caused all the music to be distorted and unlistenable.I found nothing about that in any literature on the product and researched online as well.  I returned it as a result of never getting it to sound good again.  Get something with better reliability as the products are getting better all the time.

<Content>I really like the design of this player. Unfortunately both of the units I bought for my sons for Christmas skip during the song playback. At first I though it might be that the MP3s were encoded in variable bit rate format. I converted them to 128 bps and tried again. Both untis still skip. I then tried to download the latest firmware 1.12.04 [per another review here, thanks!]and format the drives. Even after all that both units still skip during song playback. I've contacted Creative support and I'm hoping for a fix soon!! I have two very dissapointed kids with what now appear to be $120 lumps of coal.

<Title>Great deal for a reasonable price...
<Date>Sun Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great little player... period. The fact that it can be had for about a third of a ipod mini is just icing on the cake. It's light, fast (due to it being a memory based player..  no skipping!) and packed full of features. Record a voice note? Check. Record off the radio? Check. Drag and drop your music files with no special software being required? Check. Organize them into folders for different music genres? Check. Backlight for easy use at night or in low light? Check. As you can see, a lot of thought was put into the Muvo TX FM to make it easy to use, but be flexible enough for the most savvy of mp3 owners. There is a lot of little features (most are easily custom tweaked to your liking, like backlight time duration, LCD display flip for lefties and righties, support for ID3 tags, etc..) that just add up to making this a great little player.   There are a few nits, tho. I'd like the navigation of folders to be more intuitive, the scroll wheel to be a bit more weighty (several times I tried to skip a song and I accessed the settings menu with a push on the wheel) and a battery life counter would be greatly appreciated.    But all in all, this is a great little player. It may not be as hip as a ipod, or have a revolutionary feature that marketing would play up but it has a lot of thoughtful "little" features that add up to a enjoyable musical experience.    Also, to the person who said you cannot skip forward into the song... You can access the Cue/Review feature under the Setting menu and set it to do exactly that... a quick push of the wheel to skip songs, and a push forward and hold to cue forward into the song and it even lets you hear the audio so you can stop where you want to. Like I said, lots of thoughtful features!

<Content>I want to express my satisfaction and correct a review I read before I bought this item. The instruction booklet is not very detailed but I learned that you can fast forward through a song. You just need to hold the button to the right vs. pushing quickly to go to the next song.   The only thing I wish this had was a charger or power connection. Otherwise, it lasts a really long time with one battery. I enjoy taking it in the car with my cassette converter, the gym with headphones and the beach with mini speakers. It is easily carried in my purse for use whenever I desire. I would definitely buy it again.

<Title>Easy to use, fun to own!
<Date>Mon Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a MUVO TX FM 256 mb mp3 player for my wife, a runner.  She's not too computer saavy so she had me get it set up, which took minutes.  Install the software to allow the MUVO to be recognized by your computer, drag and drop mp3 files onto the MUVO (you computer sees it as a drive), and you're ready to rock.  I found that it holds about 4 cds worth of music, plus a few single tracks.    The MUVO FM also holds an fm radio with more presets than you'll ever need.  I set my wife's up with the 5 fm frequencies that provide the sound from the TVs in our health club, plus another 8 or so local stations she would listen to when running outside.    The best part is the unit's very small size; its ability to play FM or MP3's; and ease of use.  It also comes with a belt clip and an arm band for use when exercising.  Downsides?  None that I have found yet...in fact, I bought another MUVO for myself!

<Title>Love this little thing!

<Content>I bought two of these little babies as Christmas presents for my wife and my son, and I am very impressed to say the least. It's been quite a while since I've come across a product that is this well designed. It worked out of the box, no software installation required, just copy your music files to it and they play beautifully! Everything about the player is intuitive - neither my wife nor my son bothered to even open the user manual, they just started using the player and got the hang of it in less than 5 minutes flat. That says something for the quality of the user interface, from both a hardware and a software perspective. The quality so far seems great, too, and battery life is incredible, considering it uses one AAA battery only.  And yes, the included headphones are not of the best quality but they are certainly usable. Overall, I am highly satisfied with this purchase - so much so that I have now gone ahead and ordered one for myself as well! You won't make a mistake choosing this player.

<Title>Creative scores another 10 from me
<Date>Thu Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I decided to go with a Creative device because a few years back I bought a sound card for my PC and was very happy with it&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; The MuVo TX FM is a great little device that burns all other MP3 Players in it's price catagory. I am able to store my files from work, record meetings, and hook it up to personal speakers in my office. The only problem is that the headphones that come with it are a bit too big for the avarege adult ear.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; I love the 5 band equalizer that lets me change the sound settings for diffrent kinds of music. It even has a custom setting where you can adjust it to your liking. The AAA battery last about 5 to 6 days if you use it regularly, so rechargeable batteries are a good idea. Overall, this is a great device for the music lover/computer guy.

<Title>Second One and Still great
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Creative Labs MUVO 64 MB a few years ago and twas great. Never had a problem with it, not once. Only that it could carry 1 hour of mp3's or 2 hrs. of wma's. But that was a lot then, for a flash memory mp3 player. Now, with the MuVo TX FM 256MB it's what was great before but with more memory, FM radio, Voice Recorder, and an LCD screen to let me know what I am listening to. In my opinion, more reliable then the ipods because who the hell needs 100 hours of continuous music play. Although I do have to admit that the ipod is good to backup your files, if you have a whole lotta files to backup.
