<Title>Two outta three ain't bad
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased three of these as Christmas presents. My eight-year old loved it...until she realized the lanyard clip didn't work (we then used a twist tie to hold the lanyard on), the key ring thing broke, and then the player stopped playing altogether! She did not abuse this in the least. We returned it for a refund. The other two are still working fine but don't get nearly as much use. I also recommend buying a rechargeable player, as this one eats batteries. We replaced my daughter's player with a ZenV by Creative, which I highly recommend.

<Title>GRAY Centon 1GB MP3 PLAYER FM TUNER
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like this product.  I have this small player hooked up to my car amp which is 1500 Watts RMS.  It really gives clean cound with the mp3 music downloaded.  Thge radio gives slight static where the signal is weak, but the radio plays OK with the supplied headphones.  Nice colors on the screan and nice features like equalizer, repeat, speed of sound play too!!!   My friends like it.  I will really like to get one with maybe 4 gigs memory.

<Title>Loaded with cool features that are hard to use. 
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're looking for a low cost MP3 player/ digital recorder you found it. I wouldn't recommend this product for its advanced features because they are difficult to use.  My Favorite feature: The Headset is built-in to the lanyard. This means the ear buds aren't yanked out of your ears.  Coolest Feature: You can record songs off the FM tuner and play them back later. ROCK ON! Worse Feature: Play/Pause button, if pressed for a millisecond too long, will pop you out of whatever you are doing and start recording.

<Title>LOTS OF FEATURES, CRAPPY DOCUMENTATION
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is awesomely loaded ... fm radio, voice recorder, mp3 playback, lyric display with .lrc files, multilanguage menus (including Trad and Simp Chinese, which is not on some of the other models? or was added to this model later?), multispeed playback (e.g. stretch an 1 min mp3 to 2 minutes or speed through in 30 secs) **BUT** operating it is not very intuitive and the documentation that comes with it is terrible.  Centon has an on-line forum to ask questions, but I was not able to register in 3 attempts.  Battery life is okay, at least 5 hrs on a rechargable AAA, I usually recharge before the indicator gets half empty.  There is an annoying pause with a 'Please wait' message when you first start it up.  Not sure how/if you can get the unit to play items in sorted by filename.  There is a menu item for a Playlist, which uses A3L format files.  I have no idea what that is but it is not plain text like .m3u.  If they would have thrown me a bone with the documentation (fix the forum or include a decent manual) or if it had an SD slot (it doesn't) I would have given it a 5 despite the boondongle operating procedures.  Oh yeah, the thing has a USB connector built-in (like a thumb drive), the cover comes off complete and is easily misplaced.  You need to remove the USB cover and another cover to replace the battery, but meh no big deal.

<Title>Good deal, limited driver support on Compaq pcs
<Date>Thu Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The mp3 player is great, it has a great fm radio with wonderful linear display of an fm dial, the mp3 music plays great, good headphones, and easy to use interface, generally speaking.  It takes a moment to figure out that you push down on the joysticky nob, but once you figure that out, it's very intuitive.  The overall feel is nice, and it looks good.  The one thing that annoys me is that on one of my computers, the driver software is wacky.  When I plug in the usb drive, instead of another drive ("drive f:") I get "TECHSPLOSION" and then two subdirectories, one for data and one for playlists.  So I can drop in files into the data dir.  The problem is that I can't find out how much free space is available as the right click popup doesn't show this!  Also, I can't delete files sometimes!  So I just reformat the drive and start from scratch.  I'm glad my other computer has better drivers, so I can see how much space there is and put new files on it without having to reformat the drive each time.  Both computers are WinXP, the bad one is Compaq, and the good one is my home clone PC from Microcenter.    I've tried so many ways to update the drivers on the Compaq, including going to the mp3 player's website, the compaq web site, the MS web site, etc.  I'm stuck there.  But luckily, I have my non-Compaq.  Phew.  Still worth the $40!

<Content>Usually you buy a MP3 Player only, but qhen it comes all included like this you really make a great buy. Great tuner signal, excelente quiality sound, good interface to data information y good voice recorder. The portability should enhaced because you can only  hang at you neck, maybe something to the belt or arm.

<Title>MP3 Review
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had one unit before this model and I am still using it. It is so great. The new unit which I bought lately has smaller font, hard to read, and harder to use. I still could not figure out how to listen to what I recorded and when I connect it to the PC it does not give me the option to open/view the files so that I can copy the recorded file to my PC. Am I missing something?

<Title>Cheap, not price
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Without a doubt this device is capable of emitting sound. For the price it is a decent buy, but the quality of the player itself is extremely poor. The menu button is very loose and is at times difficult to time the cahnge of a song or playlist. The playlist and menu itself takes time to familiarize yourself with. I would not recommend this product.

<Title>First mp3
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm over 50 and this was my first experience with Mp3 player. The directions were for someone who knew how to use this item. I't goes through a battery in about 2 hrs. I had to get an 18 yr. old to show me how to work it. For the cost it's okay nothing impressive. You get what you pay for.

<Title>Does not live up to spec
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It claims to hold 1 GB, and thsi is so, but it can only actually fit 512k of mp3s in the file that plays back mp3s.  It was a firmware limitation. Other than that it's cheap, and has nifty features.  But the short battery life is a bummer.

<Title>Firmware locked up
<Date>Wed Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player worked for about a day and a half before the firmware locked up.  Right now it will turn on and you can scroll through the songs, but as soon as the play button is pushed the player locks up and the only thing that can be done is to turn it off or pull the battery.  I've got an email into the company now to see if anything can be done to reset it or fix this glitch.  I've been waiting a couple of days now due to the holidays.  Hope it gets resolved soon.  It was good while it worked.  My daugher was happy with it.
