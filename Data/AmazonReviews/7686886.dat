<Title>Not working for me.

<Content>This is not working very well.  I got it for use with ebooks from The NY Public Library It's easy enough to load but often stops for no reason in the middle of a section and is very difficult to resume where you left off. It just doesn't seem reliable. It is quite inexpensive, maybe a more expensive model would work better.

<Title>Product with problems
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product because it is inexpensive and compatible with the New York Public Library's audio books. The first Colby I bought would often freeze randomly (I would have to remove the AAA battery to restart it) and the player would occasionally make a loud electronic squeal and fast-forward. The company replaced it quickly. The second one I received has the same problems, though they occur less often.   To be fair, I don't know much about technology; it's possible the problem is with the audio books themselves. However, I suspect this product has a lot of problems, because it came with a yellow flier in the box saying, "STOP. Need help? Call us! [...] CALL US BEFORE YOU CONSIDER RETURNING THE PRODUCT!"
