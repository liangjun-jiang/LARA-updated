<Title>Another Winner from Apple
<Date>Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased my iPod Mini two days after it was released and I must admit, I am blown away by the functionality and style of Apple's newest creation.  Just as a background, I also own a 20 GB third generation iPod, so my comparisons and observations are from a first hand perspective.<p>So, why on earth did I buy a Mini?  Quite simply, I was so impressed with this device that I had to have one.  First off, the scroll wheel is vastly improved over the standard iPod.  The wheel is still touch sensitive for scrolling, but the functionality of the four buttons has been placed around the wheel and can be clicked.  This makes for much easier one handed operation.  The screen is razor sharp and the backlighting is awesome.  The exterior shell is all aluminum and the screen is recessed in the front of the case.  This ipod feels much more durable and resisitant to scratching than my standard iPod.  The battery life is also improved.  This mini played for nearly 8 hours on the first charge.  I typically never get more than 4.5-6 out of my standard iPod.  The biggest difference is the form factor of the device (size and the weight).  At only 3.6 ounces this iPod can be carried in the pocket without noticing it is there.  As small as my standard iPod is, somehow, you always know it is there.  The Mini solves this problem.  After all, what good is an iPod that holds all of my music, if it is not quite small enough to have with me all the time.<p>Perhaps one of the coolest parts is the interaction with iTunes.  My Library is 7.4 GB, which exceeds the capacity of the Mini.  However, when you connect it for the first time, it automatically knows this and creates an &quot;iPod Mini Playlist&quot; that serves as a second library just for my Mini.  Just drag and drop from your main library and the songs transfer to the Mini in a snap.<p>Now, I know what you are all thinking . . . why pay $249 for 4 GB, when you can have 15 GB for only $50 more?  The answer is quite simple.  In life, purchasing decisions are made with emotion and justified with logic.  On paper, there is no disputing the fact that you get far more GB per dollar by going with the standard iPod; and the standard iPod is a terrific piece of equipment.  But beyond the logical considerations lies the iPod Mini.  The way it feels in your hand, the enhanced functionality of the scroll wheel, the great form factor, and the cool aluminum finish.  All of these intangibles create a product that transcends a strict price per GB comparison and makes this iPod worth every penny of its $249 price tag.<p>The bottom line . . . I have 1050 songs on my Mini with room to spare.  I bought the Mini because it puts a smile on my face every time I use it and it is just too darn cool to pass up.  I highly recommend this device.

<Title>The best player on the market
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Its amazing. I love it. I have the 40 GB Gen 3 and I want my wife's mini. The case is very well constructed, it feels solid. The whole thing is made of anondized aluminum and it feels super sturdy. The screen is crystal clear and the perfect size. The clickwheel is WAY better than the current Ipod configuration of 4 buttons above the scroll wheel. The clickwheel feels solid and the clicking is crisp. The wheel doesnt rotate but Im sure you coulda figured that out already. Its touch sensitive for scrolling with the select button still in the middle. And yes you can scroll thru songs super fast like a normal Ipod The color is vibrant and the mini is just the right size. <p>This thing fits in your pocket and you dont even know its there. I put my big ipod in my pocket and it feels like im smuggling a pack of cards. If you got the means, get this player. It doesnt disappoint.   Its like the Prada of the electronics world.<p>And dont let the nonsense you hear about battery life sway you.  The battery is fine, I regularly get 8 hours of play out of it.  Of course in a few years you will have to replace the battery for $59 but thats the nature of ALL rechargeable batteries.  They eventually die over their lifetime.  Its just a scientific fact.  <p>Get the ipod mini now...A++ would buy another one . This thing has COOL dripping off it

<Title>Way Cooler Than Expected
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After all the anti-hype surrounding Apple's &quot;overpriced&quot; low-end iPod, I expected to be very disappointed by this, especially since we already on a full 40G current-generation model; but I was very pleasantly surprised. <p>The mini's smaller size is far more of an advantage than I had expected, making it the first truly pocketable iPod, and one of the nicest pocketable MP3 players ever. The smaller display (which omits album name) is crisp and clear, and the new control, which combines the wheel and select control of the current generation iPods with the four function buttons, is actually an improvement over the full-sized version's controls.<p>In every other respect the mini is indistinguishable from its (surprisingly much) larger cousins, except for two: (1) it is still a bit overpriced (but those who must have one need not hesitate) and (2) it's much smaller capacity may not work for many users.

<Title>Great.. when it works
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my mini the first day it came out at my local store.  I've waited 3 years to buy a player of this caliber, and thought this finally was the one I wanted.<p>It's been 5 days, and its broken!!  It stopped in the middle of a song and froze.  There is no re-set button on this, and the battery is not one that can be removed.   Translation:  needs to be taken back.  This is the problem I feared when I saw that the battery was built in, and my fear was realized not even 1 week into it.<p>When it worked, it did sound great.  I had it hooked up with my Bose headphones and the sound was equal of that to my home stereo system, which is impressive.  <p>My gut feeling here is that it's new and the software probably has some bugs.  I'm going to exchange it and get a new one, and see if this problem recurs.  <p>My only other knock is itunes.  I just don't care for the s/w.. it's not very user friendly.

<Title>WOW.....thats a lot of money
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player.  I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more.  It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style.  I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion.  I just want to listen to music!!!!!

<Title>HERE IS THE SKINNY ON MY MINI
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been waiting for this to arrive and now I have it so let me share with you what I know. This is my first ipod and I am glad I waited. To start with I love the look of it. Pink is the color that I have it is sooooo cute. It dose not hold as many songs as the other ipods so that is something you should know right off. For the price I do think it should hold more. If you are using this with a PC you must have Windows 2000 or XP. It works smoothly and great sound so far, I am very pleased with it.<p>PROS:<p>1. The size, it is easy to carry or put in your pocket and you can wear it around your neck also.<p>2. If you buy this from the Mac store online you can get it personalized free. Wayyyyy cool<p>3.  Ease of operation and good customer help if you need it.<p>4.  You can download books as well as music from MAC.COM<p>CONS:<p>1.  It is pricey for something that can only hold 1000 songs.<p>2.   Would have liked to have  seen a color screen, something I am sure they can do.<p>3.   Headphones could be better. I don't like earplugs.<p>4.   Battery life is only 8 hours.

<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Either I got a defective one, but after 4 hours with 7 different techs on the phone and calls to Apple Corporate, someone has agreed to exhange my unit for another one.<p>My i-Tunes would load all the songs on to the i-pod, and you could pick a song, but it would never play, just go blank.<br>Waited a month, had it engraved, now I have to wait for a box to return it, and then wait for another one and start over.  I think it may be advisable to wait to they get the bugs worked out.  7 different techs could not figure it out.  Or, maybe I got a bad one.

<Title>P.O.S.
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman.

<Title>Great except when it sucks
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved it when it was working right, but 6 months after I first got it, Itunes crashed while updating the ipod and the hard drive got corrupted.  Luckily, you can still buy the AppleCare protection if it's been less than a year so I got it and they sent me a new Ipod.    That worked great for almost a year but then my battery life got really short (1 hour or so).  I sent it back again, since I was still covered by AppleCare, but they told me they wouldnt cover it because it was caused by abuse!  I never did anything "abusive" to it, I dropped it maybe once or twice, and I dont see how that would cause it to work fine except for the reduced battery life.  I realize they dont make this model anymore, but I'm definitely goign to look around at the other makers before I get my next MP3 player.  And apparently it's barely worth getting applecare for the battery issue alone.

<Title>The First Colorful iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Mini was the first iPod that came in colors. So, it was the first iPod I bought--It was pink. I could not resist.  When I first got the iPod, it was flawless performance and exactly what I wanted. The earphones work fabulously, I had all my favorite music, it was small and durable. Some people talk about glitches in it, and yes, mine had some. But my Applecare free warranty was still intact, so I sent it back and was sent a brand-new iPod in 2 days. That works for me!  The screen is old-fashioned nowadays, yes, but its low-key and still fabulous. Sadly my Mini got stolen, so now I'll be needing a pink Nano.   In conclusion, an amazing machine with plenty of memory and good looks to go with it.

<Title>Great....if you don't mind glitches
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first got this pink iPod mini for my birthday last year I was thrilled. The battery life was never ending, it was easy to use, and it looked cute and withstanded constant torture. However, a year later I am deeply dissapointed in this Apple product. I started noticing during the summer it downloaded songs very slowly and constantly froze on itunes. After disconnecting it from the USB it would freeze, just simply switching from song to song froze it. I noticed that the batter was much less than the promised hours and after a full charge the battery would go down after about 5 minutes of use. If I was to leave it alone a couple of days after a full charge when I would turn it back on the battery would be half gone. The earphones that are included with the iPod, just forget them, they are comeplete crap, they crack and break open, and the sound comes through all fuzzy. If the battery was to be completey gone and I would plug it into the computer to charge it would freeze right there and not chrage at all. I would suggest moving on to the more new and improved iPod's that work better and last longer. iPod mini's last a year, two at the most.

<Title>Not Happy with it
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Green iPod mini for my birthday in July 2005. I loved the easy to use clickwheel, and the shiny green color. But around October of that year, it started to have glitches and it would freeze up after being on for only 2 minutes! I took it to Apple and they gave me a new one because of a problem. Then in February 2006, the replacement mini died. It wasn't recognized on iTunes, and it finally showed the sad iPod icon. I put it in Diagnostic Mode (Press Select and Previous) and I did a HDD scan. The scan failed and when I reset it, it turned on to the sad iPod again and the hard drive started clicking and it sounded like it was abour to explode. I went to Apple again and they gave me another one. When I got home (thankfully Apple store only 15 minutes away from me) I charged it, and it worked fine. Now it's February 2007, and the warranty expired today. When I turned it on when I woke up, it wouldn't turn on.   What a waste of time. This is the most UNRELIABLE iPod out there. And Apple says they can only repair it for a fee of $[...]. That's how much I paid for it in the beginning! I'm just going to buy a new iPod nano.

<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is a good basic unit.  The controls are a bit touchy.  You have to get the hang of skimming you finger around the touch circle.  You also have to remeber to lock the controls while you are listening, or a slight brush on the control surface will change settings.  The iTunes software is nice.  The autosynch feature is easy to use.  Overall, a good unit for the price.

<Content>This was the worst electronics puchase I've ever made.  When I first got the mini it was great, looked nice and sounded great.  Within about 6 months battery life started to go way down, after a year it was down to nothing, didn't work properly, would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes.  If you're going to take a chance on an iPod, definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one.

It is very easy to use and unbelievably cool.  I use the firewire and the I-tunes software that came supplied with the player. For a first-timer in digital audio, this product makes it quite easy to rip a cd to your computer or download a song, and then put it on the I-pod (which is automatically done for you). Product design is flawless.  This is my first Apple product, and I am very impressed.  I've had no trouble using it with Windows XP home ed..  This product is well worth the price.  If you are considering one, buy it if you can.(I was lucky enough to pick one up the first day they went on sale)  You will certainly not be disappointed

<Title>Small in Size not in Functionality
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod mini is built from the ground up as a portable device for people with fast-paced lives.  It's small and lightweight physical dimensions are perfectly suited to be being placed in a pants or shirt pocket without being a burden.<p>But don't let its light weight fool you into thinking the iPod mini is a pushover.  The 4GB hard drive (3.7 GB actual) can hold about 1,000 songs - enough to last almost three full days.  The installed software includes four games; calendar; notepad; contact database; clock; backlight with timer; alarm clock; and the abilities to customize the main menu; create playlists; and rate songs.  All this is in addition to being able to be used as an external hard drive.<p>However, the most revolutionary aspect of the iPod mini (aside from it's size and weight) is its control interface.  Incorporating the `Menu', `Pause/Play', `Forward' and `Back' buttons directly to the touch sensitive scroll wheel not only creates simplicity from a design standpoint, but form a user one as well.  Accessing these controls is a breeze.  Thankfully the touch wheel is designed well enough that accidental pressing of a control is unlikely to occur since you have to press down a bit to activate the button.  I'd actually like to see the entire iPod line adopt this interface.<p>Some people complain that the iPod mini is only slightly cheaper than the 20 GB iPod and offers a lot less storage space.  But what you loose in storage space you gain in portability.  It is also important to consider that compared to other players of its size and weight, the iPod mini offers much more storage space, many more features, and a better music jukebox in iTunes 4.0.<p>I want to carry the most music I can in the smallest possible device that offers the best interface and features.  For me, that device is unquestionably the iPod mini.  If you have similar demands of a portable music device, the iPod mini is sure to become a permanent accessory to your lifestyle.

<Title>Apple has hit another home run!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had been reading about the iPod Mini for months, and with each passing week wanted one more and more.  I was lucky enough to live near an Apple store, and bought mine the second day they came out -- 2/21/04.  While I've only had my Mini a week, it looks to be a tremendous product.  The price may be a little higher than you'd like, but for an extra $50 or so compared to smaller MP3 players, you get more capacity than you really need -- I have over 750 songs on mine (about 36 hours worth!), a beautiful design (I got the blue one and it gets a lot of compliments), a small size that easily fits in a pocket unlike the bigger iPod's, and good battery life (I haven't really checked the 8 hour claim, but I got over 5 hours of continuous playing on just the quick charge which takes about an hour).  I installed iTunes 4.2 and the download from there to the Mini was done in about 10 minutes.  No problems with the download and no software/hardware problems either.  I have a Dell 4600, and iTunes and the Mini work perfectly with it.  RECOMMENDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY!!

<Title>iPod Mini in PINK!
<Date>Sat Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought one of these for my wife and she loves it.  I find it terribly over-rated.<p>I especially hate the software under Windows - it was probably the worst installation procedure I have ever seen - not allowing you to customize what or where it is installed. Its like they thought we all want to be Mac users and just automatically do everything for us even though we would like control!<p>It's also real buggy under Windows - always appearing to hang. And it is not ergonomic to update the iPod with new songs - it has to plugged in and out again constantly.  It will not recognize new CDs unless you restart the software. My advise is to have the iPod unplugged all the time until you are ready to update the songs.<p>There is a long way Apple has to go with this before it is as good as some of the other brands designed for Windows.

<Title>Ipod Mini
<Date>Sat Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>[The Ipod Mini]- The image and design of the Ipod mini is everything that it is hyped up to be. Once you buy it, and hold it in your hands, the design will send a chill through your body. The software is easy to install on the PC and the MAC and navigation of songs and other features are simple to use in both Itunes and in the Ipod mini.<p>[The main concern]- if you buy the Ipod would be the battery life. 8 Hours for the Ipod mini is a little short. If you play games, use the backlight or other functions, the battery life will wear out even faster. Leaving the Ipod mini off for a period of time will also drain the battery. In addition, the Ipod mini is slow to charge up. Although it takes 1 hour to charge it up to about 80%, it will take 4 hours to fully charge the mini. If you use your computer's firewire or usb cable to charge up the mini, it will take even longer, although I have not really been patient enough to see how long that takes, but whatever it is, its too long. The only way that your songs can be uploaded is through Itunes, and the Ipod mini does not play wma music files although you can easy convert those yourself with third party software.<p>[A little tip]- Keep in mind that by default Itunes will automatically update your Ipod mini. It will be important to know that if you delete songs in your library, the next time you connect the Ipod mini to Itunes, the songs in your Ipod will be deleted automatically. If you don't want that to happen, you should definitely turn that feature off. There are also a lot of awesome accessories for the Ipod mini and you should definitely go check it out in Amazon's recommendations

<Title>Mini iPOD is perfect in my eyes!
<Date>Sun Feb 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After spending hours searching for a mini iPod in stock, I finally located one at a local CompUSA and ran down to purchase it in my favorite color, blue.  After owning a 3G 20GB iPod for only about 2 months (after discovering the beauty of the iTunes Music Store), I wasn't really planning on buying the mini.  But after seeing them at an Apple Store a few days back, I was in love.  The sound quality is the same, amazing, syncing is easy as all things Apple, the design is gorgeous, the screen is beautiful (and I prefer it to the 3G because it's smaller and SHARPER, as well as brighter).  4GB of music is more than enough for me, and the style, quality (build is excellent), ITMS, and Apple name all justify the $250 price tag.  Worthy of being in anyone's pocket.

<Title>Joy to my ears
<Date>Mon Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great little device.  I should start by saying that I never owned the original iPod, so the only comparison I can make to the bigger one is the size, since I held both in a local store.  The iPod mini just feels great in your hand--the design engineers for Apple deserve an award for this thing.  Its a good bit smaller than the original, and oh yes, that clickwheel.  That is another design marvel, and one that I'm sure will eventually be on all iPods.  Setup was easy as well, just hooked up the Firewire cable to my Win XP machine (USB 2.0 is included as well), installed the software, and transferred my music.  Sound is very good, though I'm not a fan of the included earbud headphones (I much prefer my Grado ones instead).  As for people who complain about it being too expensive for its capacity, well they just haven't used it, plain and simple.  Apple has hit a home run, and its sure to strengthen their market share for MP3 devices.  Worth every penny.

<Title>i-pod mini is the best
<Date>Mon Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The i-pod mini is compact, and easy to use.  The software is also very easy to use.  I can download an entire album in under 30 seconds.  It is awesome!  The only bad thing is that the earbud headphones sometimes come out of my ears. In my mind, the problem is a small price to pay for the excellent sound that comes out of them.  Overall, this is a very good product.  Well worth the cost.

<Title>As much art as it is science!
<Date>Tue Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been an iPod evangalist since I first turned on the 5GB.  As you may know from my reviews of the 5, 15, 20, and 40GB models, I've owned (or given as gifts) just about every incarnation of this glorious device.  So, when Apple announced that it was releasing a dramatically redesigned version of the iPod, I knew right away it would at least be a hit, perhaps even enjoy the almost &quot;cult-like&quot; status of its larger parent.<p>So I pre-ordered 3 of them; one for each of my sisters and myself.  They arrived about a week ago and I'm happy to report that Apple has done it again with the release of the iPod Mini.  It totally ROCKS!  <p>There are allot of things I like about this model, but before I get into them A VERY IMPORTANT WARNING TO THOSE THAT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT:<p>YOU MUST CHARGE AT LEAST 4 HOURS BEFORE USE!<p>I, like so many I'm sure, was very eager to &quot;plug and play&quot;.  I did, without fully charging them, and they experienced all kinds of impossible to resolve errors.  <p>Now, in the event you've already bought one, or simply can't help yourself, there is a little known &quot;reset feature&quot; on the mini that will come in handy whenever you have an issue.<p>TO RESET THE MINI, PRESS AND HOLD THE MENU AND SELECT BUTTON (the middle round button) FOR SIX SECONDS.  <p>That'll bring your baby back to life.<p>The colors are awesome (I have the blue, silver, and pink), look very stylish, and will likely show less wear.  If you have the patience, consider having Apple engrave them for you (looks very cool).<p>The sound is excellent.  I don't have a testing lab, but I could swear that the sound quality is better; and I'm almost certain that they can play at a higher volume.<p>Another important improvement is the fact that when skipping forward more than a handful of songs the mini doesn't stall (for a second or two) like it's predecessors.<p>So, in conclusion, this is a wonderful new player that'll be sure to WOW everyone that owns it, and create envious spectators out of those that don't.<p>Hope this was helpful.<p>Christian Hunter<br>Santa Barbara, CA.

<Title>The ipod mini is awesome, but must be handled with care
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ipods definitely outrank any other mp3 player in quality. I know because I have had 3 mp3 players before this one. But the fact of the mattter is that the ipod mini is a hard drive player, meaning it has parts that move inside of the thing. Therefore, significant force will cause the hard drive to work improperly. But the ipod mini is incredibly strudy, so if you get one, don't TOSS it in your purse, or run 1o miles with it like these other idiots and you should be fine in the event of minor tremors. They wonder, "oh why is my ipod not working," well that's because you treat the thing like a frickin' baseball. If you want an mp3 to accompany you in an activity that will require a LOT of movement, then get the flash based ipod nano or shuffle, where there are no moving parts, but a smaller storage. But if you have a huge assortment of songs, then hard drives will sure as hell be able to hold all those songs. And that's the difference between flash based mp3s and hard drive mp3s. So, if you are willing to buy the mini, you have to understand that difference and the fact that the mini, despite how sturdy, will crash if you disrupt the hard drive inside by slamming it, trhowing it, dropping it every ten minutes, etc. And the batery, just get the third gen. minis that have an 18 hour battery life, and if it dies for good, buy a battery pack for about 30 dollars. That's all there is to it. Just treat your mini like you would a child and distrust these people who say their's doesn't work. That is only because they make it not work, not Apple.

<Title>Nice MP3 player, but it has some cons
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had my ipod mini for almost a year. I got it on my 18th b-day, I have a pink one. I love my ipod mini, but it has some cons. Ipod mini is very easy to mess up, so if your a clumsy person you might want to get another mp3, another thing it freezes or cuts off every now and then and the battery life isn't all that good. I love that the ipod mini can hold a lot of music, it comes in nice colors, and has many accessories for it, you can put numbers in it, used it as a organizer, and play games on it, etc. Overall I give it 3 stars cause I just adore it and a lot of people are jealous of me cause I have one,and plus it's pink.

<Title>It;s my baby!
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple's part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.  It holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it's still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother's mp3 player, needing to press "next" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it's job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.  Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod "family" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that's how much I love it!  For having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it's amazing!

<Title>How did I live without it?
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It was nearly one year ago when I first recieved a Green Ipod Mini for my birthday. Since then I am rarely without it. I'd been warned by a number of people that the batteries broke easily and that they got scratched like anything, but even so I decided it was the gadget for me. The risk payed off.  Holding 1,000 songs makes for a great deal of hours listening to music or podcasts. I am absolutely addicted to music and this li'l gem changed my life forever. The sound has stayed crips and clear, the volume is great and I haven't needed to replace the earphones. For me, this is absolute perfection.   The battery lasts for a LONG time and charging is simple and quick. Scratch wise, I invested in a good quality cover which stays on it all the time, so I have had no problems with scratches. The iPod is sturdy, (I admit to dropping it a couple of times) and the buttons and menus are easy and quick.  Downloading songs is also a piece of cake. Just plug your iPod into your computer or laptop and with iTunes I have been able to simply change around my songs, delete, add more, to my hearts content.  If you want something cute, colourful, stylish, easy-to-use and very VERY reliable, then go for an iPod mini. And with music downloading being so easy, it's more than likely that it will replace your CD's forever! So buy one, you will not regret it.

<Title>Mini IPOD - batter poop out
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an IPOD mini in February 2005.  Overall I have no complaints except for the battery life.  I have had five replacements since I bought the IPOD mini earlier this year.  The batter slowly looses charge incrementally, so by 2.5 months the batter time is down from its best of 4.5 hours down to 30 minutes.  When I brought the IPOD mini back to an APPLE STORE at the Genius Bar, I was told I was using the IPOD mini incorrectly, that it had to be my computer, which I bought in January 2005 (DELL), or it is my outlet socket, or that I am not following instructions.  The deal is this, they know that they have a defective product with IPOD mini with a 8 hour battery life, when I bought it they never told me that the upgraded IPOD mini was to be marketing very shortly with an 18 hour battery life.  In any event, they replaced the battery depleted IPODS, with refurbished IPOD minis that had the exact same problem and stated, and they clearly stated that there is no problems with the battery life.  My question is why do they have such a huge stock of refurbished replacement IPOD mini units, if there is no problem.  One replacement was a complete disaster, the wheel did not work, it was broken although it had been refurbished.  So yesterday I went back for unit number six, as it's battery has died over 6 weeks this time.  Well IPOD minis are no longer being sold as new by Apple, they have replaced with IPOD nano, etc, etc this month.  Poor folks who bought they IPOD mini last month and have defective battery problems also.  In any event, they replaced my IPOD mini again yesterday with a IPOD mini with a battery life of 18 hours, because they are no longer selling them.  So far, the battery life is much improved with the first trial with the 18 hour battery - but I cannot speak for 1 week to six months.  SO BEWARE if you are going to spend money on a new or refurbished IPOD mini, THINK TWICE, THREE TIMES, FOUR TIMES, and how ever long it takes to give up on this foolish idea.  I cannot speak for the newest IPOD's - nano, photo, etc.  But I am sure the batter problem continues.  There is no way to get the battery out yourself and replace it.  There are other brands of MP3's with replaceable batteries, you open the case, by a new battery for around $45 dollars, replace the battery and go on into the night with an MP3 player that works.  Apple please design units with replaceable batteries, and top lying to your customers.  Also there has been a class action suite filed against Apple whichshe lost, because of defective batter problems, and overclaims of battery longevity on early IPOD versions, that supposedly preceded the IPOD minis.

<Title>nice little thing
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>ipod minis are really neat and cute. they're also small and fit in my pocket, as well as being relatively lightweight. i like the way they come in a variety of colors because it makes them much more interesting than if they were just plain white. the sound quality is decent and i can hear my music just fine, even when the volume is turned down. i like the way i'm able to organize my songs and create different playlists made up of certain songs. it's very costly to purchase songs from itunes, though, and the battery life could be better. mine is the older version and is meant to have a battery life of 8 hours. i skip around a lot and battery life for me is more like 4 or 5 hours. overall, the ipod mini is a decent mp3 player, if thats what you would call it.

However, for an artist like me, it lacks some features, none of them a big deal.  - Lack of recording options. - So so Bass quality of sound. - Tightly tied to Itunes, which is a great software, but for one who needs some flexibility, well... Anyways, still a great product. No Doubt to be Recomended

<Title>Mmm not so good a product....
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod mini last in 04 for Christmas. It was so awesome then!! So pretty and good-working. Then about 2 months later i carried it around with me in my backpack in a special little makeup bag type thing and it didn't hold up very well even though i didn't move around a whole lot. Well i opened the bag up to listen to it on the bus and the entire screen looked awful!!! There was a HUGE crack line down the front and the screen had an awful weird blackish line down it and a few tiny black lines too. I was shocked because i thought it would hold up better! So luckily I got a replacement. But then about 4 months after i got the replacement, the battery life slowly dwindled down to about 1 and a half - 2 hours! I was on a plane for vacation and it died halfway through the flight! I brought my charger with me and charged it at the hotel, though. But i turned it on to listen to it, only to find that it only played 4 songs!! The 4 songs just happened to be the only ones on my iPod that i didn't buy and my friend later told me (after i got home) that i needed to plug it in the computer to fix that problem. But i didn't have my PC with me on vacation, obviously. And i don't have a laptop. So yes. I did that and it was all better! But as soon as i plugged it in my other charger and took it off after it was fully charged, it did the same thing again!! So unfortunately i have to live with it that way and take off my purchased music, otherwise, it's just wasted space. So I've ended up with an iPod that: - Can only last for 2 hours - Skips over all my purchased music and plays only non-purchased music - Takes 4 hrs to charge but only plays 2 hrs! So it's pretty much obsolete in my mind. I am sort of weary to buy the Nano, seeing as how it has had lawsuits filed on account of it, because of the easily crackable screen and it'd probably snap in my pocket. I am kinda leaning toward the video iPod even though it's huge and i'll never need 30 GB of music. But if i bought a battery pack for my iPod mini, it'd cost me an extra 80 or 90 bucks and it'd be double the size it is now, so why don't i just get a brand spanking new one?  I don't know. Apple is just sort of.......mmm.  So many problems!!! and since Apple makes you pay like 100 bucks for insurance and warranties and stuff it's like what's the point? I'm basically banking on the fact that it'll blow. Oh well. I don't know what to do. I have a useless iPod on my hands! Whoopie!

<Content>Let me start by saying, I am a Mac nut. I have an iMac, iSight, an iPhoto, iPod and two minis. I had the company I bought my car from, hook up my iPod in the glove compartment, oh how happy I am! I have never had a problem with the iPod and my car...never! I recently swopped my iPod with my sons mini as he has ten times the amount of music. Since I hooked the mini to my car, it has frozen more then 20 times. What a pain, it takes a good 5 minutes to unfreeze the silly thing everytime I get in the car!!! So I would recommend spending that bit extra on the iPod as I have never had a bit of trouble with that model.......... I shall be taking the mini back to the store. Another thing I can say is that Apple have good cust.serv. So mini freezes in cars, get an iPod!

<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a pink iPod mini for my birthday in April, and the only problem I had was this: On the way to Florida on the plane, my ipod just started skipping through songs and wouldn't play anything. So we got to Florida,I charged my ipod up (the battery was dead, too) with the wall charger, and it worked fine.. until the flight home. Same thing happened. I reset it with holding down the menu and select buttons, and it worked fine. Until about 2 weeks ago. I left my ipod mini in my glove compartment of my car for about an hour (I live in Wisconsin and it's really cold right now in December). I got back in my car and tried to get it to play, and no luck. I reset it and figured it would be fine, but I looked and the battery was dead even though I charged it before I left. So I recharged my ipod for a few hours when I got home, but ever since it's been working half the time and just freezing up the other half. I'm so fed up I'm thinking about buying a new iPod.. maybe the nano but I hear the screen cracks. Hmm.

<Content>I own a 10 GB iPod and it is an amazing machine. It has many great features that help me. Who wants to carry around a bunch of cds or only carry a couple? With the Ipod you have a vast amount of songs at your disposal. The great thing about the Ipod mini is <br>1. Smaller<br>2. Harder to scratch up (happened to me with my original Ipod. The originals get scratched easily) <br>3. More Durable<br>4. Has that Arm clip thing<br>5. Longer Battery Life<br>6. And the click wheel/touch wheel is awesome. At first, I couldn't understand the concept of this. I will carify since I have tested it out myself. To scroll, you rub the wheel around in a circle just like the original Ipod. But to access the buttons, you press down and click in the four cardnal directions.<br>It doesn't matter that it only holds 1000 songs because I personally  thought I would use that space up like that. But it actually holds a lot more. Its 1000 3 minute songs. So if a song is 1 minute, 3 of them will fit into 1 song memory-wise

<Title>this is too cool!
<Date>Wed Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The manufacturers explain all the specs very well, but if you're reading these reviews, you probably want to hear from someone who had used the mini.  I have been waiting for an iPod, but didn't want an mp3 player that was as big or as white as a regular iPod.  Minis have the bonus of being very small and come in different colors.  <br>The little cutie is so easy to use, skip reading the instructions.  I use mine with a Ti4 (that's a G4 Titanium powerbook to you Pentium users).  iTunes and iPod together make it incredibly easy to put your entire music collection on your computer and select which songs/playlists you want to bring everywhere with you.  The transfer of my small library of 1 gig took about a minute, and each time I add songs to the different playlists, it takes less than a second to update all the playlists.  I also imported my contacts and calendar from Entourage (or Palm Desktop works, too).<br>The scroll/touchpad is very senstive, but there is a lock button on the top so you can throw the ipod in a bag or pocket and your volume and other settings won't be affected.  I also purchased an FM transmitter to use in my car and my other radios around the house.  The earbuds for me were too uncomfortable so I got new headphones, and now life is good.<br>The games are crap, but who buys one of these for games?  I'm sure more people will add their own reviews which may give you different information than this.

<Date>Thu Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'd first picked up an iPod while in the Apple store in San Francisco 3 years ago and I was immediately impressed with its form and its intuitive user interface. I could never quite justify paying what seemed such an exorbitant price for what essentially is a sexy walkman, but when the new mini iPod came out I thought I just had to have one. I've been using it for around a week now and I have to say my affection for it grows by the day. Beware though!! You will spend a lot of time showing it to people because as soon as they catch a glance of it, they want to know what it is, what it does, how much it costs etc. I reckon Apple should give all the early adopters a heavy discount as I've already enticed 3 more people to buy one.<p>It syncs very quikly with the PC and the battery seems to charge quite quickly too (it's handy that it charges while it's connected to my PC, so I've only had to use the charger once so far)

<Content>The ipod mini has a lot going for it.  If your not looking to carry your whole cd collection with you, the mini is the way to go.  It's light and compact and makes carrying a substantial amount of music with you easy.<p>The whole ipod line blows other mp3 players away.  No one has yet to match the capacity of the ipod.  Apple has a big win with the mini for those of us who are satisfied with &quot;only&quot; 1000 songs in our pocket.

Filled half the mini, and will probably never fill the rest. <p>Love the small size, weighs a little more than expected.<p>Sounds great, and easy to use!<p>4.5 instead of 5 because of weight, and the fact that the ipod software takes about .3gb of the 4gb drive.<p>Awesome product!<p>Yeah, for 50 dollars more could get a full ipod, but this is plenty of storage, and I like the smaller size.

<Title>A good move for Apple...
<Date>Sat Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Apple's raved iPod that was praised for its portability and stylish exterior was taken to a new level late February. The new Apple iPod mini sports five new colors, this being my favorite. The ultra-slim, ultra-tiny mini has a mere 4 GB, but to those who only want to store their favorite songs and not their entire CD collections, it's great. The price is a little high for such low memory, but all-in-all, it's useful and great-looking.<p>The colors are what will attract most people to it, but it also has many other new features to Apple's iPod line. The new Touch/Click-wheel has the buttons under the wheel. The screen is smaller than past models, and it sports many new software updated features, such as a &quot;Music Quiz&quot; and Contacts that you can sync with your PC/Mac.<p>But, on a darker note, a day after I received it, it froze for two hours and then froze the next morning while I was listening to music. Either it is just mine or it is the quality of the product that bothers me, and that's why it got 4 stars rather than 5.

<Title>mini ipod rocks (almost)
<Date>Fri May 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Generally speaking, the mini ipod is great. I'm not an apple user, so I was hesitant to purchase it. Plus, the price is nothing to laugh at. It's very durable, and the user interface is pretty cool and easy. If your thinking of buying the 4 gig, I recommend springing for the extra cash to get the 6 gig. The ipod can hold a lot of songs, but mine is already full (4 gigs). You'll be wishing you had more space like I do.  Pros: - Lightweight - Durable - Small/compact - Easy to install (some people had problems, but my install was easy)  Cons: - You HAVE to use itunes (which comes with it) for this to work. Not a big deal. But I was so used to Windows Media 10, I thought I wouldn't like it, but itunes makes things pretty easy. It will automatically catalog and convert songs if you want it to. - There aren't many other worthy competitors out there right now, so if you want lots of storage with a simple sleek design, ipod is the way to go. - The sound quality has something to desire. With all the hype and the price, I was expecting a brilliant sound system. I've tried different earphones, but the sound is a bit tinny (metallic, harsh on the high end). This can suck when you crank it up and your ears are shattered by the high-end. The ipod does offer some preset EQs, but they should've offered a band EQ for those of us who really want to fine-tune things.  - The navigation wheel takes some time and skill to get used to. It's definitely designed for the nibble-fingered, and not for big chunky hands. So, you'll get used to it and get the feel of how to make this baby sing. - TERRIBLE stock earphones that come with it. Throw those out and buy some new ones right away.   Overall, I recommend, but be prepared to spend some money on the ipod itself, and another small investment in some quality earphones. I hope future models will include a detailed manual band EQ. That will then make this an ideal product.

<Content>I bought a crappy mp3 player ages ago (somewhere around 40 dollars) my brother gave me his daily planner that could play mp3s. Frankly I was tired of the both of them running out of battery power in less than 4 hours.  So today I ran into the store and decided to check out the ipods. I saw this beauty for $195 and thought "Why not" I am most throughly impressed. My other mp3 players could not get even near as loud as this one (I like blasting my ears). The headphones that came with it, while deceptive looking, are actually very good.  I was completely startled by the great sound quality, and how loud this little machine can get. The touch interface is gorgeous, it responds to nary a touch. No more fumbling around to get to the next song or change the volume!

<Title>Apple's iPOD = Creme of the Crop
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The biggest choice you'll have to wrestle with is size. Not the 3.6 inches long, or 3.6 ounces it weighs... rather the storage size. This model is 4GB - which will hold approx 1000 songs. The 20GB might be overkill, but it's fun to think about the possibilities. The Apple iPOD is easy to use - easy to add songs in, take songs out. The battery charge lasts approx 8 hours; takes 3-4 hours to fully charge again (80% charged in 2 hours I read). Unit comes with earbud headphones (delivering excellent full-bodied crisp sound), a belt clip, AC adaptor, as well as the hook up for your PC. Capable of playing MP3's. Very customizable: main menu features; playlists; shuffle songs or albums; repeat functions; alarms and sleep timers; 20 different equalizer settings; displays (date/time/etc); sound checks; etc. The size is amazing - the mini fits in my pocket with my cell phone and I almost don't notice it. In the dark, the display reads nicely. Only bad comment is that during the daylight hours, I wish the LED backlight was brighter. Max operating altitude is approx 10,000 feet (the thin air definitely effects the playback - found this out on our last Colorado vacation in the mountains). Overall an outstanding iPOD/MP3 player. Available in several colors (blue/gold/silver/pink/green). Apple still makes the best unit in 2005 and everyone and their brother is now trying to copy them. Toughest choice you'll have to make is whether to get the 1GB (250 songs), 4GB (1000 songs), or 20GB (5000 songs). Stick with Apple and you won't go wrong. Great unit!

<Title>I will never buy an iPod product again!
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My fiance bought me the iPod shuffle for my birthday.  We tried it on THREE different computers and it didn't work on ANY of them!  So, we tried to return it and bought an iPod Mini.  What a mistake!  Within the first couple of hours the screen's contrast went to nothing-- and we even had it on the darkest setting.  Then, the next morning the screen decided to be visable again.  BUT, on the fourth day, the thing just froze!  I couldn't turn it off or anything!  So, it made me feel like those days back in college when I had to use Apple computers and the disk drive would freeze.  They never had a disk drive eject button.  Why does Apple do this stuff-- doesn't make sense. So, this one is going right back to the store.  I would like a digital player, but just won't buy an Apple one again.

<Title>Too Darn Complicated!!
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I consider myself to be fairly electronically inclined.  I can read directions with the best of them.  But this?  The iPod mini?  Man it gave me the blues.  I bought it on Sunday at 1PM, by 3PM I was still goofin around with it, by 4PM I decided to take it back to the store, at 7PM I let my husband take a stab at it he finally figured it out after about an hour+, but by then I was through.  I returned it to the store on Monday afternoon.   So what's the problem?  The instructions are not very clear. The icons that are supposed to show up on your computer screen once you have downloaded the iTunes software, may not always show up, and you can't figure out why.  I have about 1500 songs on my computer, at this time I only wanted to download about let's say 200 of them.  But the iTunes program took in all 1000+ songs and put a check mark next to each of them as if I wanted to download them all onto the iPod.  I had to individually "un-check" over 1000 song titles in order to deliniate between those that I wanted and those that I did not want.  There needs to be a "check-all" button and an easy way to undo it. Also, I was not real thrilled with the actual buttons on the iPod, I suppose with time I could have gotten used to them, but they were just too touchy, although there is a hold button so you cannot inadvertantly push the buttons.   I think that for the money they could have also put in an FM tuner. Bottom line is I needed something more rugged that is quick and easy to download, light for when I am running and working out.  I had a Rio Sport a few years ago, it got stolen, I'll be buying a new one.  The iPod is not for me.

<Title>Consider iPod nano
<Date>Sat Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>People choosing iPod mini mainly because of its smaller size compared to the regular iPod. If you are planning to buy an iPod and choose iPod mini because its size, you may want to reconsider it.  The newest member of iPod family will be released to the market soon. It is iPod nano. It comes with two color, black and white. You will be surprised by its size! Yes, it is smaller than iPod mini! It is very slim, comes with color screen, and sexier design. The iPod nano will be available in 2GB or 4GB size.  Although its price is a little bit higher than the reduced price of iPod mini, there are some features that you would not find in iPod mini; completely free-skip feature. Because of its flash memory based storage media, it is not affected by movement. You can wear the iPod nano on your arm or just use it as a necklace.  There are lots of reasons for you to choose iPod nano and I cannot write it down here. I will write them down on the iPod nano review. So, will you consider iPod nano?  * You wouldn't find green iPod nano. So, if you are choosing iPod mini because of its color, you may stick at your choice.

<Title>Perhaps mine, one of the last of the minis,  is a lemon?
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When it works, it works great, but I've had to restore the software three times since I received it for my birthday two months ago. And I don't use it very often, because I've had nothing but problems with it from Day 1.   I had trouble installing the software originally (went through that annoying "Do not disconnect" Catch-22). Then I had trouble keeping the battery charged, even though I rarely use it! Today was the last straw: I plugged it in to download my latest purchases and was told to "update it." When I tried to update it, I got a "disk write error" message. Then I completely lost the ipod option on my itunes menu. I had to shut down my computer just to disconnect. Then when I turned on the ipod, I received that lovely folder with the exlamation point error message. So I went back online, followed all the help information offered on the ipod website, and finally got the dang thing to connect enough to get the "need to install and update" message again. Of course, once it initialized for the "update," the only option it would allow me to use was the restore one that wipes off everything! Then it tells me it couldn't even do that, due to another "disk write error"! What a lovely piece of dog-poo.   It turns out it did clear everything off, and I've reloaded all my music, etc., but the next time this happens, I'm calling Apple and demanding my money back. (I know, consider me delusional.)  I know I probably got the only "lemon" out there, but I could not possibly, in good conscience, recommend this thing. At least I can listen to the itunes music on my computer, which has much better sound anyway!

<Title>iPod Mini
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My third generation iPod has been having some problems with playing audiobooks lately, so I requisitioned an iPod Mini that has been sitting around neglected in my dad's office (with his permission, of course).   I never even came close to filling up all 20GB of my iPod, so the space constraints of the Mini are no problem at all. In fact, all I ever really keep on my MP3 player is whatever audiobook I happen to be listening to, unless I'm going on a long trip or something. On to my impressions:   This little gizmo is tiny! I don't know why that makes me like it so much more, but I'm sure we're all subconsciously aware that small equals cute. That, coupled with the nice silver cyberpunk finish, simply delights my aesthetic senses. For some reason, just having it in my pocket is a nice feeling. Oh, and the click wheel! Since I'm used to the 3G iPod, it comes across as marvelously innovative.   Sure, the same criticisms that have been leveled against the iPod can be leveled here. Mainly, the short battery life and the non-user replaceable battery. Features like an FM tuner are also missing, but I don't particularly care about listening to the radio when I can be my own DJ.

<Content>The iPod mini is small but still comfortable in my large hands.  It is very easy to use.  The scroll wheel works flawlessly and is easy to learn how to use.  The unit feels very high quality and is light weight.  Battery life has been between 7-9 hours for me.  With 3.7 GB of space, it is more than adequate for most people.  I have about 360 songs on mine, and I am only using about 1.5 GB of space.  If you think that isn't enough, buy the 15 GB + iPod for vast amounts of storage.  I am using with a Mac, if you buy for a PC, make sure your OS is supported.

<Content>Despite the problems I encountered, I do give this product four stars.  My problem was I could not turn the Ipod on.  I kept getting a folder and an exclamation point symbol when trying to turn on the Ipod mini.  I finally found the problem and solution on the Apple support site.  Support was very helpful in getting the problem resolved [had to reformat the Ipod mini].  Once this was done, no problems whatsoever.  The earbuds are not bad at all.  I purchased a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise cancelling head phones but prefer the earbuds because of size.  I'll use the Sennheiser when I take the plane.  Not crazy about the enclosed battery...Other than that, I really like this Ipod mini.

<Title>never thought I'd get the mini

<Content>I scoffed at the price of the mini when first announced like<br>the typical software geek &quot;Why the heck would I buy this thing<br>when I can get the 15GB iPod for $50 more?&quot;.  Then I went to the gym <br>while using my Nike PSA Play 120 with 128MB of flash.

I want something that I can use at the gym as well as <br>use for walking around that is small enough to strap on my arm and fit in my pocket with<br>my phone.  <p>I purchased this mini yesterday at the new apple store here in<br>SF (was surprised they had it in stock).  The only problem I've<br>had (thus the reason for only 4 stars) is that it locked up twice<br> within the first couple of hours.  It's been another day and while it hasn't <br>locked up again I think I'll still take it back and swap it out.  <br>Other users have reported the same problem with the mini so beware.  <br>If you do a google for &quot;ipod mini diagnostic&quot; you can find out how to run diagnostics and checkout<br>the drive and the disk to make sure all is OK.  <p>At any rate, the quality of this player is very nice all things<br>considered assuming there isn't an epidemic with the lockups.  <br>I haven't tested how many hours of battery I get but<br>I've had it on here and there all day today and am halfway <br>drained as I type this at 9:10 PM.  The sound is of decent quality to me at least.  <br>(I listen only to MP3s at 192 or higher bit rate and have a good quality stereo, HK AVR520 and Cambridge<br> Soundworks Newton SeriesMC300 speakers and P500 Powered <br>Subwoofer, and headphones (Sony MDR-V700DJ)) This gives a <br>reference for all you audiophiles out there so you know where<br>my opinion scales.  For small audio buds the sounds is very <br>good (among the best I've heard, usually I throw the headphones<br>out that come with any portable).  <p>The user interface is of course the best that can be had in <br>a portable device and better than the iPod due to the buttons<br>being integrated with the scroll wheel, meaning you never have<br>to leave the confines of the wheel searching for the right<br>button to press.  I'll go for a run tomorrow with it to test<br>out the armband but I don't envision any problems.  The <br>construction is very solid and though it doesn't weigh a whole<br>lot it feels very solid and of high quality.  <p>ITunes is a great piece of software and you can have it just<br>pick a bunch of random songs to dump on to your player if you<br>have more than 4 gigs like I do.  I get about 680 songs on the <br>player with my high bit rate rips.  4 gigs is plenty of room<br>and won't annoy me to change music every once in awhile.

<Title>SO darn small
<Date>Thu Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Honestly, to understand how cool the ipod mini is you have to hold it.  It is so small, light and solid feeling.  I can say without a doubt in my mind that as far as far as practical value goes, this is the best MP3 player money can buy.  It is small and light enough to disappear in your pocket, easy enough to navigate that about 5 minutes of use makes it second nature, and it is tough enough to stand up to any a lot of abuse without even showing a scratch.  You can buy an MP3 player with more space for a less or equal amount of money, but the hidden and most important value that a consumer electronic device can have is usability - what I mean is how seamlessly it can slide into your life.  If you get an ipod mini, you'll never have to deal with the frustrations that a heavier, less reliable and more complicated and not as smooth and agreeable looking device present.  In short, you'll take this whereever you go because its one of those devices that you'll never (figuratively) trip over.

<Content>Last night I went to my local Apple store, because I was thinking about buying some sort of iPod.  Because I am a student and do a lot of walking, I needed something very portable.  I came across a display with the 5 different colors, and I decided to try them out.  The second I picked it up I knew it was what I was getting. I go to buy it, and it was the last one in the store.  I have been using it the whole day, and it is almost perfect.  The &quot;ClickWheel&quot; is very convenient, and the sound quality is fantastic.  Although it is only four gigabytes, you can constantly rotate songs, and who needs 74 hours of music?  I would recommend this to anybody who needs a portable music player, and is willing to pay $250 for one.

<Content>This device delivers what it promises, up to 1,000 songs at 4 minutes a piece.  There is the online Itunes store where tracks of any sort can be purchased for 99 cents.  When exercising(jogging, staitrmastering, walking, cycling, or whatever) it doesn't skip and doesn't poop out during a long workout.  The battery life is much longer than a typical MP3 player.<p>There are some issues.  The front iPod Mini's buttons are sensitive.  I have found the batteries unexpectedly drained when carrying this in my handbag AND in a carrying case.  It takes little pressure to activate it.  I found the accessories at The Apple Store overpriced.  Furthermore,not all artists participate with the Itunes online music store.  I couldn't access Led Zeppelin, only bands that had done covers.<p>This has a nice small design and if you loaded it to the hilt, there will be approximately 3 days of music to enjoy at 3/5 of the price of the regular iPod.

<Title>lots of hype....
<Date>Fri Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like most people, I saw the ads and wanted an iPod mini, too. I liked the design, controls, and size. Then I did a little research, and I'm really glad I didn't rush out and buy one like I wanted to. Something none of the commercials tell you is about having to have an iTunes account and pay for the music you put on your iPod mini.   Second, iPod has that battery that you can't remove... when your battery goes dead and you need to replace it (as rechargeable batteries do from time to time, such as in your cell phone or cordless home phone) guess what? You have to go to an Apple store to get them to fix it. Ugh.   So while it may look cute and come in those nice colors, iPod is not the machine for me.

<Title>i love it......when its working
<Date>Sat Apr 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My ipod broke 2 times! 2 different ways, the 1st time there was a technical problem, i had 2 drive all the way 2 the only mall i know of that has an apple store (30 minute drive, an hr together). May i remind u, this happened 2 times. Now the second time it broke, it was my fault, i dropped it, but it should be durable enough for that. I love my ipod completely, and have since the day i bought it, but i am gonna take a hammer and smash it 2 pieces if i have 2 returned 1 more time. So i dont recommend this product to clumsy people, teenagers who aren't very sharp, and people with short fuses. And 2 ppl who already have 1 and are having problems, go 2 the support website. The website was SO helpful, and i promise SOME ONE has had the same problem, and will help with the problem. so good luck 2 some, beware 2 others.

<Content>I love my ipod, there are only a few things I didnt like. I had to re-install the software because the first time it didnt go right and itunes couldnt recognize my ipod.. no problem.. un-installed, re-installed, that time it went fine.. so it took some time for all this but its ok because the manual said to charge it for 4 hours anyway..  it is easy to organize my songs on itunes, i have several playlists so it makes choosing songs on the ipod simple. the earbud     quality is ok, not fond of them because they can fall out easily. the wheel is very sensitive and i accidently turned up the volume too loud, gave myself a shock! so I learned to use the lock feature so that wouldnt happen. love the smal size and easy to use, you can get lots of accesories for it. i've used it for 3 days now and still am halfway through the battery life bar. I like not having to eat through so many batteries. thumbs up!!

<Title>NEW GENERATION OF MP3 PLAYERS
<Date>Sat Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod Mini a few motnhs ago and loved it from day one. The best part about it is obviously it's whopping 4GB of memory, and the slim, sleek design. The screen is also very easy to read, and ClickWheel navigation is also very simple. Here's a short overview of my opinions:  PROS: - sleek design - lots of memory - you can put lrics on your iPod and read them on your iPod screen - worth the money - make your friends jealous  CONS (a surprisingly large amount): - poor battery performance. the box says that it can go for 18 hours on a single charge, but they really mean about 5 hours if you're lucky - annoying 'iTunes' is the only way to put songs on - not the simple click and drag method i used for my previous mp3 player - can't delete songs directly on the iPod - have to connect to your computer and sync it - VERY DIFFICULT to install software onto Windows computers  but overall, iPods are really cool!

<Title>Great for music teachers
<Date>Sun Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recieved the ipod mini as a Christmas gift from my parents and have really enjoyed it.  I am in the process of preparing for a spring musical program and decided to try using the ipod mini instead of the cd's.  With a little rigging (running the ipod mini through an inexpensive wireless karoke mic) I can move around the cafeteria as we rehearse on stage. I am no longer having to run back to the stereo to stop the music to fix a problem which allows me to better hear the students from all areas of the cafeteria for sound and balance. I have complete control over songs and volume and am very mobile with the ipod mini on the armband.  I also like the fact that the song titles are on the ipod mini so I do not have to worry about accidentally playing the wrong track. It is also a good way to introduce technology to elementary students as they all are curious about the box strapped to my arm.  The only problem is that when I am driving my car and listening to the songs on shuffle as I like to do, these songs pop up and they are not quite what I want to hear on the weekends and afterschool but I can bear with it for a few weeks then the program songs will be removed. Ideally it would be good to have one for home and one for work as I am really seeing posabilities in the classroom and the best part is that I no longer have to haul my boombox from my classroom to the cafeteria and back everyday.  Everything is on my arm. I just unplug and go.  Plus, it would be nice to have all of my CD's in one place in order to save time, as I said all sorts of possabilites for classroom use. The sound is great too, I hear things in songs I've never heard before.

<Date>Sat Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I adore my iPod!  I update it and charge it every day and I've become so protective of it that I'm ashamed.  The sound quality is stunning- the iTunes that it comes with manages to improve upon the digital music files.  The touch wheel will keep you amused for hours.  Plus, it comes with a calendar, a contacts list, and four games (solitaire, javanoid, a quiz on your own music, and "parachute"), as well as an alarm clock and sleep feature that I use every night.  If you are hesitant because of the amount of songs it holds- "only" 1000, let me tell you that I have had my iPod for almost 8 months now and I've only filled it halfway.  If you are a HUGE music buff, you MIGHT exceed the 4 GB limit, but I have a friend who is forever downloading music and has over 30 CDs, and she still hasn't reached 1000 songs.  The color never fades or scratches off, and now laser engraving is free on the Apple site.  (Buy it there- it's totally worth it!)

<Title>Wonderful product---when it works
<Date>Tue May 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received the 4gb iPod mini as a Christmas gift, and I must say I was ecstatic to get it. Shortly after, however, I started noticing problems with it. On certain songs it would play about 10 seconds into and then either freeze or pause and then skip to the next song. At first this was only a minor irritation, but it soon grew into a nuisance. It turns out Apple had sent me an iPod with a corrupt hard drive (which from what I understood from online forums and the tech support at the apple store is not a uncommon occurance). I was rather impressed with the speed at which they replaced it (especially since mine is a personalized one and I wanted to keep the personalization). I have recently encountered a new problem: the display is broken. It is, for the most part, blank (as if the iPod was turned off), when it is on and even playing music. This is most frustrating as it makes it very difficult to select the music I want to listen to. What makes it even more difficult is that the best way to get the display to turn on is to push the menu button (making attempts to select music even more frustrating as its sets me back a step). I have not yet visited the apple store in regards to this problem, but I will be incredibly irrate if they do not replace it, as I have done nothing to it to warrant such a malfunction. (I have also tried reformatting it and resetting it) Now don't get me wrong--the iPod is a very addictive device. Unfortunately it is this very quality that makes it difficult to live without it during repairs.   Apple also has horrendous tech support; the only way to get any useful information (i.e. anything besides make sure the hold button is not on if the it is not turning on) is to go to the apple store (an hour drive for me). Apple also charges 50 dollars for a call to their phone support after 90 days from the purchase. They do offer a support package (I believe it extends the warranty and gives you free phone support) but it costs somewhere around 70 bucks. Apple can also charge up to a 100 dollar diagnostic fee for iPods sent in for repairs that are not covered under warranty. I do not know if they would actually charge someone that, but I do no have enough money to risk it. I am then left with only the option of driving to the apple store, which is rather frustrating.  In conclusion, the iPod is a wonderful product--when it works. I also think that if Apple is content to sell such a shoddily constructed product, they should make their tech support a lot better. I would reccomend that anyone who is interested in purchasing a large capacity mp3 player look to other similar devices by other companies (i.e. dell).

<Title>My new necessity
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm glad I waited to get my iPod Mini cause the newer version of the 4GB is the best investment I have made. The Mini is compact enough to wear on your pants pocket or belt without much thought to it being there.   It has many uses, it can be used as an alarm, to hold contacts, important dates and so on...I was very impressed and not to forget it holds music too! I will probally not have more than 500 song on it but I'm glad I made the purchase I used it at work for the first time today and my ears did not hurt to much after 6 hours of constant wearing (make sure you used the ear pads included!).  Accessories: Grab a dock and iPod case (I like the Belkin Pink case), that's about all you need!  Battery: Make sure you go to Apple's website and check out the info on battery life and the to do's and not to do's it will truly help you and the life of your battery.   Warranty: I purchased mine at Best Buy and my advice is to go with their 3 year warranty cause they can replace your battery in store without having to wait 6-8 weeks for AppleCare to get back to you and Apple's cost twice as much as Best Buy's. Trust me it will be worth it!  Enjoy!

<Title>People Love Minimalistic Gadgets
<Date>Sat May 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The next big (little?) thing to take the world by storm is the Ipod Mini. I'm not sure what it is about small electronic devices that puts a giant smile on everyone's face, but this one definitely gets the job done. As soon as I heard about it, I knew that it would eventually be mine. A few days later I found myself standing in the store with a new blue Mini in my hand, ready to be paid for.   The Mini is great for people who need to move around a lot at work and can't stand near an outlet all day, just clip it onto your pants and crank the volume. Chances are, you won't even notice that it's there due to the almost non-existent weight of the thing.  My one gripe about the Mini would have to be the earbuds. They tend to hurt my ears after only a short amount of time with them in. However, I'm thinking the fit of them might just take a while to get used to since I stop feeling the pain after a certain period of listening. Then again, maybe my ears had just gone numb by then.   After all is said and done, the Ipod Mini is an amazing product that will hold your attention for countless hours. It becomes addicting very quickly, especially when you take notice of all the skins and other accessories out there for it. I think even moreso than loving minimalistic gadgets, people really love add-ons. It's an obsession.. why else would The Sims exist?

<Title>Why the hype?
<Date>Sat Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>One of the biggest problems that I have with the Mini is that it occasionally freezes. As I browse through the songs, the machine freezes from time to time with the backlight turned on and the title of the song displayed on the screen. None of the buttons work when this happens. Apple's technical support (less friendly than expected) says to restart the Ipod by simultaneously pressing down the &quot;Menu&quot; and the &quot;Action&quot; buttons. They say that the specific song that I've recorded onto the Ipod causes the problem. However, I still find the same problem after erasing the specific song that it froze on.<p>In addition, Ipod Mini is not THAT small compared to the other MP3s out on the market with similar memory capacity. Even against the original Ipod, the Mini is not significantly smaller to justify the hefty price tag.<p>So my recommendation is that if you are planning to spend $249 for the Mini, you might as well invest a bit more to get the original Ipod or other MP3s in similar memory capacity. To me, $249 for a tiny reduction in size and a HUGE reduction in memory (not to mention days and weeks of waiting for it in the stores or in the website) is just not worth it.

<Date>Sun Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was unsure whether I wanted an ipod mini at first because of it's smaller drive (4gb) compared to the similarily priced 15 gig iPod. I gotta say, after using it for two days I couldn't be happier with my decision. It's necessary to hold and use one of these to truly understand it's appeal. It's practically exactly the same size and weight of my samsung flip phone, which means I completely forget the iPod mini is even in my pocket alot of times...it's that small. The one-piece case appears to be so strong I wouldn't doubt it could stand on it as long as I wanted to without causing any damage, I would bet even a car wouldn't damage it much : if you are worried about protecting your investment, this is something to think about. I know I'll drop the thing at least a few times, and I dont doubt it'll hold up just fine.

<Title>iPod Mini - Small Is Beautiful
<Date>Tue Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Talk about love at first sight.  My friend Douglas and Chris each bought an iPod mini and the mere site of one will make you buy one.  Be warned, it's a hypnotic almost religious experience holding the mini in your hand for the first time.  The minute I held the iPod mini in my hand, I knew I was going to buy one for myself.   I already own the 30 GB regular iPod and I still couldn't resist this one.  Kudos to Apple engineers for designing a beautiful device that's incredibly visually appealing as well as functional.  The mini weights just 3.6 ounces and easily fits into any pocket.   <p>The iPod mini looks just amazing in its anodized aluminum case that resists stains and scratches.  The iPod mini holds 1000 songs or 4 GB of music and lasts up to 8 hours on a single battery charge.  Unlike the bigger iPod, Apple has moved the iPod buttons under the scroll/click wheel which makes for a better user experience allowing you to scroll single-handedly though your music collection.  Besides the smaller size and gorgeous form-factor, the mini has all of the same features of the regular iPod.  <p>The mini ships with an AC adapter, traditional white headphones, FireWire and USB 2.0 cable and iTunes software for Windows and Mac.  With iTunes, I am able to sync both my regular iPod and mini at the same time.  A lot of people would urge you to spend $50.00 more and get the 15 GB iPod.  I own both the iPod and now the mini and given the choice, I would trade in my regular iPod for my mini any day.  Most of the iPod accessories including the iTrip work correctly with the mini.  The only accessory that hasn't worked yet is the Belkin iPod Voice recorder.<p>If you are in the market for a great MP3 player, look no further.  It holds over 70 hours of music, fits in your pocket and looks great doing it.  I highly recommend the mini and will be buying a few others as presents for my family members.

In the box you only get the basics; a FireWire cable, USB2 cable, earbuds (no remote), belt clip, and power adapter.<p>The touchwheel is truly a marvel, integrating the solid-state navigation wheel with pushable control points to save space. It makes controlling the mini easier than my 15GB unit, but at times the wheel can be too sensitive and adjust the volume as you're switching tracks.<p>Even though the mini has a lower screen resolution, it's still very readable, but the album name is now omitted from the Now Playing screen. The backlight is even brighter than my recently purchased 15GB unit!<p>As is the case with Creative's Muvo2, the iPod mini uses the  4GB Microdrive from Hitachi. Spin-up times are a bit faster with the new drive, so the delays when a song isn't in the buffer are reduced. However, file and song transfer speeds are noticeably slower over both USB and FireWire. The regular 3G iPods walk all over the mini in this respect, and since I use the data storage capabilities of the iPod quite a bit, this is a bit of a bummer.<p>You won't find a user-replaceable battery on the mini, it's sealed inside like it's big brothers. Apple does offer a battery replacement program for 99 bucks, or you can pick up 2 years of AppleCare for half that. The typical lifetime of a battery is anywhere from 18-32 months, depending on usage and charging habits. I'm sure that third-party vendors will come up with do-it-yourself kits like they have done with older units.<p>Price-wise, the mini isn't a bad deal considering the drive inside it goes for much more at retail. Compared to other iPods, it's not so great, since an extra 50 bucks will get you almost quadruple the capacity. I'm sure most buying it will be looking at the great form factor and the fact that it's the cheapest iPod though, I bought in for the size and scratch resistance alone.<p>The iPod mini might not be for everyone, but for those who don't have to have their entire music collections with them or people who want a more compact unit, the mini fits the bill nicely. It's not perfect, but the iPod mini is a pretty compelling product.

If theese pople saw the mini, they would be absolutely amazed. It's small enough to put in your pocket, yet large enough to hold all your songs. The innovative click wheel is easy to use, and looks flashier than the 15, 20, and 40 GB models with it's brand new colors. The click wheel si better than the touch wheel on the regular Ipods. On the iPod I was always finding myself pressing buttons thst I didn't want to with everything touch sensitive. And yet with the click wheel you get the same easy navigation.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I'm in love. I-Tunes is very user friendly and I was able to copy the majority of my favorite cd's into i-tunes with no problems. I was amazed that it only took about 30 minutes to transfer about 300 songs to my ipod.   I ended up buying the dock and the Logic3 stereo speakers, but found that the charging dock was a waste of money. I use the Logic3 (which has incredible sound output for something so compact)at work, but it also does double duty as a charger.   The only problem I have is that i-tunes doesn't recognize my ipod as soon as I connect it to my computer. It usually takes me tinkering with the program software before it responds.   Overall, I'm very happy with the features and I show it off everytime someone stops by my desk.

<Content>One thing that everyone hears is that when you first get the ipod you have to charge at least four hours. Wrong. If you buy it at amazon, then yes, its true. But i bought one at circut city and when i opened the box and turned it on, it was fully charged. The sound is good depending on what type of earphones you are using. The earphones that came with the ipod have great sound, but after 5 days of having them, my left earphone no longer works. The menu is easy to navagate and easy to read. The touch wheel on the mini is not as easy to use as it is on the 10, 15, 20, and 40 gb ipods. The complaint almost everone has is that their ipod locks up (freezes) too often. It only does that is you push a button twice really fast by accident or if you make a weird movement on the touch wheel. I can swear that they said that the ipod has 8 hours of battery life, it seems like mine gets about 6. The color of the mini seems to fade away if you use it as much as i do. The ipod dock is cool but its not worth the money, and i suggest you get some type of case for your mini.

<Title>The iPod mini is great
<Date>Mon Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I finally gave in and bought an iPod. I decided to go with the mini because it's 100 dollars cheaper than the cheapest regular iPod and it's nice and small. So far I've been very impressed, the sound is great even through the little ear bud things. Very easy to navigate. I also think the mini is better constructed than the regular ipods, I prefer the aluminum construction, it doesn't show every little scratch like the shiny plastic and it's durable. I also like the longer battery life of the mini. Setup was fine, I'm using Windows XP, a little bit of confusion because of the need to format the ipod for windows use, but overall it went well. As long as you follow the instructions, you should be fine. Battery life is nice and long, no problem. The only issue, not a big one, is that the touch wheel takes a little bit of getting used to, sometimes it seems a tad too sensitive. Make sure your hands are clean when using it, it works best with clean dry hands. I'll check back in a few months to report if everything is still good. Overall I think it's an excellent product and a pretty good deal for $199.00.

<Title>Love my iPod
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've only had my iPod for a few days, but so far it's great.  The sound is wonderful and the interface is easy to use.  The touch wheel is a bit sensitive... I nearly rendered myself hearing impaired after accidentally turning the volume way up. I primarily use it at the gym and it's nice and light.  When I'm running, I can use the clip it comes with to clip it to the machine, otherwise, I can clip it onto my shorts and it doesn't bother me at all.    I had some problems installing, however.  I'm using windows XP and the cd that came with the ipod didn't have the most current software for formatting the ipod, whereas I had the newest version of iTunes already on my computer.  After downloading the newest software updates, everything worked just fine.

<Title>Love it! (Except the headphones)
<Date>Thu Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The ipod mini is by far the best ipod of them all, the best mp3 player out there, actually!  The ipod's sleek metalic look is much better, I think, than the other ipods.  The 4 gig hard drive is also enough for most people's music, and with the new 6 gig, thats plenty.    For me, the best features are: Great Interface Great sound Click wheel Fast download to ipod  As with all products, there are the complaints. I have one: The earphones (though they have great sound) SUCK.  They really hurt my ears, and I don't know about other people, but that gets annoying!  I can keep them in my ears for a few minutes until they just really hurt.  Now you may notice that I put 5 stars, what I really mean though, is a high 4.  If it weren't for the headphones, it would be a high 5!  I recommend the ipod to anyone and everyone who wants lots of music on the go.

<Content>I got my mini recently and LOVE IT!!  I've had it playing at work now for 2 days straight and haven't had to recharge it.  So far it is on hour 12!!  The sound quality is great and I love the controls.  I would recomend this to anyone.   Before I got my I was anticipating it's arrival so I downloaded Itunes and put all my songs in there, so when my ipod finally arrived all I had to do was connect it and it downloaded all 625 songs in a matter of minutes.   I did let it charge overnight before using so maybe this helps with the battery.

<Title>You could've had a winner Apple.....BUT instead its a Lemon
<Date>Wed Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had mine for about 2 weeks now. At first glance its a great product. The ipod has simple controls and a very intuitive interface. Works great in the car or at the gym. However, as you get past all the design eye-candy, you'll soon realize that Apple was in too much of a rush and sent a whole bunch of first batch lemons. I've already been through TWO ipod mini's because of a technical glitch. For some reason, they seem to freeze up while<br>using the controls. Here's the funny part...you can't do anything to refresh it since the battery is internal and you cant take it out. Even holding down the play button for 6 seconds doesn't power off the ipod. I've upgraded the firmware and it still freezes up. The only thing to do is wait till the battery dies completely, and then you can restart(reboot)it. Sorry Apple, but that's a stupid design flaw. When it freezes, which is very often, sometimes you have to wait up to 8hrs for the battery to drain before restarting it. I am returning this paper weight and getting my money back. I'll wait a couple more months so Apple can get their act together and deliver a more polished product. You shouldn't rush a great product Apple, because in the end, you'll just have unhappy consumers.

<Title>A great new addition to the iPod series
<Date>Wed Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod mini, in many ways, is a great mp3 player for those casual music listeners. However, for some, it may not be the best way to go.<p>Recently, I purchased a Creative Nomad Zen NX 20mb for 250 dollars at best buy. I was very happy with the product. However, after a few months of usage, the headphone jack would not work and I had to return it. Looking at the new products, I decided on getting an iPod mini.<p>And I was right with my decision. When you first pick up the mini, it feels extremely sturdy in your hands. It's just the right weight. The case feels extremely unbreakable, and it is about the size of an altoids tin, but is more flat. When looking at different reviews for it, no one could exlplain the &quot;revolutionary click-wheel&quot;. How did apple put the wheel on the iPod mini? Well, if you want to know if the touch sensor is still there, it is. But this time, the buttons are ON the wheel, and instead of touching the buttons, you press them, and the entire wheel clicks in. <p>As for the screen, the size doesn't get in your way at all, and compared to the other ipods, the resolution is much greater. The backlight makes it look very sharp, and overall it looks great.<p>The battery life lasts around 7-8 hours, just as the box says. However, (I am yet to experience this) the battery will die, and will not recharge after 360 times of charging it. It costs at least $100 to replace it.<p>The only iPod mini out right now is the 4gb model. That is enough to store over 1000 songs, close to 1200. For many people, that is quite more then enough, but for those who need more, it may not be your music-solution.<p>The other problem I encountered isn't too severe, but it is definately a problem. The iPod mini would at many times freeze, and I would have to restart it. Luckily, Apple made it very easy, and you can restart it just by holding down two buttons.<p>The headphones that come with the iPod mini are double earbuds that work well with the iPod, but don't deliver some of the music you could be getting with other high-quality headphones. Also, the mesh that covers the headphones frequently comes off.<p>All the other parts that come with the iPod mini work just right, and installing it on a Windows or Mac is usually quite easy. The software that is included (iTunes) works very well.<p>Overall, this product works great for the casual listener. It's definately up to par with the new Creative 4gb player, the MuVo NX.

<Title>Sounds great, but transfering music to it is painful
<Date>Thu Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I love the size and ergonomics of this little guy, but dealing with transferring music onto the iPod mini from iTunes is a MAJOR pain.  Supposedly, you can select the &quot;manual&quot; method of transferring music that you've placed onto the iTunes library from your own CDs or from the iTunes music store, but sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I've spent several hours over the past few days trying to create folders for &quot;workout music&quot;, &quot;soft tunes&quot;, etc., on the iPod mini and I can create the playlists, but often can't transfer any music to those playlists.  I've sent an email to Apple Support -- their response will determine whether or not I return this unit and buy something easier to use.

<Title>Size is Everything
<Date>Thu Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My wife has an iPod from 2002 - 10GB model.  That was the best mp3 player out there, until this came out.  A good mp3 player needs a few key things:<br>1)  holds a ton of songs,<br>2)  easy to use,<br>3)  easy to sychronize,<br>4)  SMALL!!!  The idea is portability, right?<p>With musicmatch, the older iPod was problematic.  But, iTunes is a tremendous improvement, for both the old iPod and now the mini.  The mini does everything the older iPod did, but with a smaller size and a much lower weight.  The weight is the biggest factor.  Put it in your pocket and you'll forget you're carrying it.  Worth every penny!

<Title>Fantastic toy! - Read before you buy
<Date>Fri Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is an A Grade product... I love it. Could not find one anywhere, got one at CompUSA, Buffalo- NY. ... This is a fantastic piece of equipment.. <p>The pod is just abt the size of a credit card, weighs hardly anything, so tiny, cute and sounds so majestic and sexy!<p>What I love about this:<br>Sound quality - sounds better on my headphone than thru<br>an AC'97 soundcard/WinXP. Played songs on my Sennheiser HD 280 Pro and it sounds divine!<br>Size - Superb form factor<br>Colors - Gold is Golden! Killer looks<br>LCD - Beautiful blue screen<br>Capacity - 4 Gigs is a decent size<br>No skip - I jog 6 miles a day outside. In my last 4 days of jog,<br>the pod has not skipped once. I have tried to cheat the buffer (30 megs?) by picking a random song and then jogging... The pod does NOT skip if you hold it in your hand. If you put it in your pocket I guarantee it will skip, so hold it or buy an arm band<br>Cold Weather operation - When I jogged yest nite it was about 25 deg C. The pod worked beautifully (though the manual says min operating temp is 32 deg)<br>Quality - BLOWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS you away. Fantastic Scroll Wheel - No outside buttons - all ops thru the wheel. COOOL!<br>Bragging Rights - This is the hottest toy in town<br>Rugged Construction<br>Connectivity - USB 2.0 and Firewire compatibility<br>Options - Can recharge battery thru USB (PC ) and Firewire (Mac)<br>Opreation - Works really well with iTunes, beautiful sync<p>Cons:<br>Battery - Battery life is bad. I got 5 hrs after having the brightness set to medium. and a lot of track playing<br>Charging Battery - slow. Takes 4 hrs to charge 100% but 1 hr to 80%. Could be better<br>Delicacy Factor - If you are a jogger u cant really be as comfy<br>taking this out as with a cheap flash player. There are no<br>waterproof cases, apple.com has no cases for this... thats bad<br>Cost of accessories - SKY high. A transparant case with band is $40.. Imagine!<br>Headphone- Included headphone is above avg, I could not get it<br>to stay in my large ear for over 30 secs at a time<br>Price - For the price conscious (non jogger) you could pay $50 more , not wait and get 11 gigs more....<br>Limitations - Cant export mp3 from the pod with included software(hacks available)<br>Works only with iTunes<br>Warranty - 90 days labor! Beware<br>Battery - Battery not user replaceable. Lot of noise abt battery failure rates/cost of replacement on original ipod<p>Overall...<p>You hard hard pressed to find a better player (quality,looks) at any price. If you want to indulge in fantastic music and<br>are willing to pay top dollar for it, buy it. If not u can<br>get compable players (Rio Karma/Nomad Zen) for much lesser but they are not as cool!<p>I love my purchase and salute apple for their superb product overall. I took off 1 star mainly due to the fact that apple is stingy with warranty and high cost of accessories & battery.

<Title>A no brainer MP3 player
<Date>Fri Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Its a pleasure to be the first reviewer of this item.  I purchased the first commercially Mp3 player as soon as it came out.  It was the Rio PMP 300 which held a whopping 32 mg dedicated <br>memory card.  These babies have changed.  This Ipod  mini is by far the best MP3 player I have had yet.  This includes Creative nomad<br>jukeboxes, the zen series, Archos, CD Mp3 players almost all the Rio models, etc.  It was hard for me to by an Apple product because I am a PC clone person.  On with the review.<p>Good Stuff:<br>Small as hell but easy to use with my big hands.<br>Volume gets real loud if needed.  I read somewhere that the Ipod's don't have any umph when it comes to volume.  This mini unit gives you more than enough volume.<br>Very easy to learn and use.  This is a no brainer.  Even though I am a computer geek of sorts its a pleasure to have something work like its supposed to. The computer setup is just as easy.<br>The sound quality is as good as any other unit I have had.<br>The click control is slick.  Its hard to describe but it makes<br>this unit the best of the best for going through the menus and song selection.<p>Not so good stuff.<br>I am not too crazy about the equalizer selections.  Their are about 15 or so modes to select from.  I would prefer a bass, treble, and other manual settings.<br>As usual, the headphones are not so good. This is normal for every MP3 unit I have ever owned. My favorite portable headset <br>for the money is the Koss ear plugs.  I replace the plug part with ear plugs that you can buy in a drug store. <br>Any thing with non-removable batteries worries me, but not enough to change my mind about this great unit.

<Title>This is apple's best product in years....
<Date>Sat Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Most people who are on the market for a new mp3 player take several things into consideration. The first usually is price, but please don't get ahead of yourself. Many may say that with apple products you don't get your money's worth, but they would be so very wrong in this case. You can get several 20GB players for 300 dollars and upwards but this little 4GB player will hold all the songs you could need at one time (1000+). But that isn't even the best part. When you get this little gadget in the mail, the set up is so easy and vast you will simply be amazed. Itunes can be downloaded from apple.com or you can install it with the cd. You plug it in to your power source and your computer and your up and running. Itunes will find all of your music on your computer and with the click of a button you can have your entire library on your ipod and minutes. Seriously, firewire is so much faster than USB. I got the new 20GB napster player as a gift and the speed does not compare. Once your music collection is onboard your new mini ipod I can assure you, there will be no regrets.

<Title>The bomb
<Date>Sat Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>lets face it. apple products are simply designed well. The ipod mini is no exception to this rule. I just read a review about the creative muvo 4gb player and all I have to say is: can you use itunes? no. itunes -apple designed jukebox software- runs on both mac and pc just as the ipod mini is dually compatable with usb 2.0 (for pc) and firewire (for mac or pc) interfaces.<p>itunes is superior software to musicmatch or basically all other crappy pc jukebox applications. This may be the ipod mini's greatest strength over the creative muvo. Well, that is if you dont take into account the unmatched user interface that the iPod boasts. <p>seriously, the combination of itunes, ipod and my music library has made listening to tunes that I love virtually all day a reality for me. Since I am a musician outside of my day job sneakylong.com I find the ipod mini a source of inspiration during the day. The battery life of 8 hours is perfect, its more rugged (sporting an aluminum body and lower weight) than the regular ipod, and it works seamlessly with audible.com, the spoken word audio content website.<p>Get iTrip if you can, its definately worth it as a fm modulator (perfect for the commute). If you live in  the city, you can use iTrip to take over the radio in the cab and the cab driver wont know whats going on as you bob your head to your favorite cypress hill song.

<Content>I got my green mini through cingular rewards.  I work for Cingular and get points for sales, etc.  The mini was 9,196 points.  Well worth it.  Some people have said their's locked up on them.  Mine has been great.  It's one of the few things i've gotten in recent years that wasn't made shoddy and just a piece of junk.  The finish looks really nice, the belt clip holds it very sturdy, it's so easy to use, and it sounds great.  I've bought a couple different headsets for them and found the sony pair the best (I have no idea what model they are.  They just sound great.)  I've put 716 songs on it so far (about 60 cds) and sometimes wish I had more room.  I have over 2000 cds.  But then i'd just be loading it up and not listening to most of the stuff on it.  With only 4 gigs of space, it gives me plenty of music but makes me erase some stuff every now and then to put something new on it.  It's not annoying in the least simply cuz I love to play with the thing.   Some advice for anyone just getting the mini:  If you start to import a cd, sometimes you'll get a very irritating click at the beginning of track one.  I've noticed if you just play the cd for about 2 seconds BEFORE you import a song, it won't put the click.  I'm guessing it's because the disk is already spinning at full speed when you begin importing, rather than it having to spin it and then begin.  It's worked perfectly for me so far. Anyway, I love this thing and constantly recommend it to all my friends. I'm definately getting another one (pink) for my fiance.

<Title>Screen failed after only three months
<Date>Thu Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am very disappointed with the product manufacturing quality as well as Apple's customer service for iPOD MINI. I purchased the MINI less than 3 months ago. Whithin three months, the central area of the LCD blacked out. When product was returned to Apple for service, Apple insisted customer cracked the LCD, and refused to service the product that carries 1 year warranty. The unit wasn't ever dropped on the floor, or compressed in unusual manner, but Apple described the issue as "abusive use". To me, it is a toal rip-off for a product short-lived within 3 months. An expensive product with sleek look, but poor manufacturing quality. Apple's "customer relationship" department worths visting, when you want all the BS, and excuses to shut you off. I hope there is good product out there to replace it soon.

<Title>My latest technology acquisition...good deal!
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My latest technology acquisition is the 4GB iPod mini, which arrived a few weeks ago. I've transferred a whole bunch of music (good stuff, and a few guilty pleasures) onto it already, and it's already seen good use: it's helped me get to sleep many times when I was feeling not so well, or could just not relax. I ordered it just after the prices dropped, holding off thanks to a tip from one of my co-workers, who heard through the rumor mill that a move by Apple was afoot.  I've been traveling a lot, and I figure this was a much more compact way of transporting music for the next time I go on the road. I knew the iPod mini was small, but I wasn't really expecting it to be as small as it is. Hopefully, there are no issues, and it turns out to be a good investment!  Some practical stuff: my order arrived promtly.  The device is easy to use, and interfaces easily with iTunes for Windows.  I've not tested the battery limits yet, but the limits appear to be much greater than 8 hours, so I suspect the 18 hours advertised is possibly quite true.  I'm glad I paid the extra money over the iPod Shuffle, as I can't see having such a device without a display.

<Title>Beautiful, sleek, tiny, and completely brainless ease of use
<Date>Sat Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Hands down, the iPod series have represented the absolute best in digital music players. While the unbelievably easy-to-use interface and seemless desktop integration have been Apple hallmarks since the dawn of time, even Windows users can enjoy this legendary legacy of hardware-software integration. Add to that the iTunes music store, with its massive catalog of over 500,000 songs to chose from (and I think I've already personally bought most of these!), then there's little else left to debate. Sure, there are competing online music vendors out there, but Apple's iTunes Music Store has got it perfect.<p>But I can't say all that much negative about the iPod Mini. It's light. It's tiny enough to slip into a pocket. It's sleek. It's beautiful. (It gets noticed a lot more than I do!) The sound is awesome. Whether mp3, aiff, wav, or aac (the mp4 format that blows the doors off older formats in terms of quality packed into a small amount of memory), the sound coming out of this baby is, in a word, luscious.<p>Speaking of memory, at 4 gigabytes, you've got more than enough to keep you listening to tunes non-stop for 4 sleepless days of driving --- and without hearing the same song twice. Since you can easily adjust which songs stored on your desktop you want to carry around with you, the only limit you have is the size of your computer's hard drive. I've got nearly 1000 tunes on the iPod, out of a few thousand more we keep stored at home.<p>The only real down side may be the 4 GB limit. With a 40 GB iPod out there, and not that much more expensive, those who really desire more gigs have a sleek and beautiful option out there.<p>Bottom Line: Fabulous digital music player, seemless integration with your desktop computer and  Apple's online music store, and pleanty of &quot;wow&quot; factor all packed into a tiny acoustic dynamo.

<Title>More bells and whistles than a church full of referees
<Date>Sat Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A friend just gave their new iPod and said, &quot;You learn how to use and then show me.&quot;<p>Well, I don't really need a clock, calendar, timer, games, and all the other things this iPod has (I already have a Palm); I just want to listen to music. And as far as the games go, you really have to be a masochist to play games on a screen this small.  Cute, but a bit much.<p>As for the music, this thing is very cool.  The software is quite intuative, and it's easy to rip CD's and transfer the files to your iPod.  As a matter of fact, the transfer can be set to take place automatically when you plug the iPod into your computer.  Speaking of which, I used a notebook computer with USB 1, and it worked just fine, regardless of iPod's minimum requirments (USB 2 or firewire).<p>It takes a bit of time to figure out the controls, but if left to its own the iPod will automatically sort your music by artist, composer, song title, music genre, and album title.  Or, you can simply get a list of all your songs in alpabetical order.<p>The controls are similar to those of a CD player, except for this very nice &quot;scroll&quot; feature, and the backlight is fantastic.<p>The unit has built-in rechargeable batteries (non replaceable), and I didn't get a chance to find out how long it lasts on a charge.  Sorry, as this could make or break a sale.  Like, what the heck do you do if the batteries run out and you're nowhere near an AC receptical?<p>All in all, if you want to be the first on your block to have the coolest MP3 player out there, than by all means go for it.  However, there are other units, though not as cool, that offer replacable batteries (you can use rechargeables), and also offer voice recording (I can't believe they didn't include that for the price).<p>Personally, I have a Muvo and like it very much, but it's definitely not as cool or trendy as the iPod, and the iPod's controls are a lot better. On the other hand, you don't need to load any software to transfer songs to the Muvo (Me or XP), so it's easy to grab a few track from friends as you travel around.  But, and this is a big &quot;but,&quot; the Muvo, and a lot of other MP3 players out there, don't hold a candle to the iPod's storage capabilities, even the mini iPod.

<Title>Apple's Best iPod.
<Date>Sun Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>What's not to love?  It's small, beautiful, and easy to use. I've had mine for a little over 3 weeks now, and so far have experienced no problems.  It's obvious to anyone who wants one, that Apple has an enormous hit on it's hands, because every store and website that had them in stock at the end of February, now has a waiting list. Yes there are similar players available from other manufacturers, and yes you can pay less money for units with greater storage, but once you have an iPod mini in your hands you will understand.  My recommendation is; if you see one for sale, BUY IT. Do not hesitate.  My only complaint is that there isn't much available in the way of accessories yet.  I'm sure that there will be more stuff available for the mini very soon though.

<Content>when ipod unmini version first released in taiwan, i was shocked by its no-button and apple-style design, but i didn't buy it, cause its size is just too big and cannot support video type files.<p>today, people also shocked by mini version ipod, but if you compare it's specification, you will find it still unsupport video files, and it's storage/price is very low, $249 plus $20 can buy 10GB unmini version ipod in amazon.<p>If you don't care what i say, and want use a special version iPod different with what someone used before, mini iPod is your best choice, trust me^^

<Title>Mighty little iPod!
<Date>Mon Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Now, I know this unit only has 1/10 of the space of the 40 gig iPod, but it's tiny size makes it absolutely perfect for the gym.  It holds plenty of songs, has easy controls, and a great sound.  My only complaint is that the earphones don't work at all for me and kept falling out.  I did not want to spend a fortune, but read unfavorable things about the Apple in-ear earphones, so I went for the Sony MDR-EX71SL Earphone which comes in white if you order from Hong Kong....  Back to the iPod: I could find nothing wrong with this little unit and highly recommend it for its great sound, light weight, tiny size and of course, the fact that it looks really cool!

<Title>Perfect iPod for the gym
<Date>Mon Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchase my iPod Mini about 2 weeks ago, and it is everything I hoped it would be: lightweight, compact, puts out great sound, and holds more than enough music for working out, and will even get me through the work day without having to hear the same song twice, and I've only filled it up half way.<p>Why the 4-star rating instead of 5? Well, the battery life indicator seems to be off. It can be fully charged, but only show half-power on the icon sometimes. I'm not sure if this is result of not conditioning the battery, or a design flaw. Also, on mine, the round scroll control wheel is slightly off-center (the wheel is set at a bit of an angle so the text is tilted). Also, because you can get another 11GB of storage space (plus added weight and size) for $50 more, the value isn't all that it could be. Of course, if you take Apple's suggestion that you shouldn't compare the Mini to other iPods but to flash-based MP3 players, this isn't a consideration.<p>Also, the iTunes software (I used the Windows version) and store are great. Very easy to use, and it's a good deal at $9.99 an album.

<Title>Wow.  Gorgeous and it Works
<Date>Tue Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Let me start off with the 'iPod experience'.  I got it in the mail, took it upstairs, and looked at it.  I carefully opened the box and there was a perfect cube.  No plastic to hack at, it just slid right off.  The box unfolds, and there resting is the iPod mini.  Nothing short of GORGEOUS.  It has a silky feel, very sturdy.  Check out the pictures on [website] before you buy.  Simple and effective design.  It might as well be designed by Porsche--on the oustide and the inside.<p>iTunes is undoubtedly the best music management software out there.  Its included on the CD with the iPod mini, but also a free download from Apple.  I've tried them all.  Windows Media Player (which is good), MusicMatch (Which is awful), and Real (Which has too many ads).  ITunes is ad-less, and is intuitive, like the iPod.<p>When you finish charging your iPod, there are 3 fun games (one more later once you load your music).  Parachute is a shooting game, theres solitaire, and brick too.<p>Once you get your music into iTunes (a few minutes per CD), you plug in your iPod, and the thing will update at less than 1 SECOND PER SONG!  That's fast.  I loaded about 20 CDs in a few minutes.<p>The headphones are incredible.  They don't feel weird, have great sound, and you can have the music up loud and no one will hear, even a foot away from you!<p>The Mini comes with Firewire and USB cables, but only supports USB 2.  MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE USB 1!!  I had that problem, and I needed to buy a USB 2 card ([price]).<p>The belt clip is ok, but it won't fit all belts (namely, mine!).  One time the belt clip slid off my belt and landed on a hard tile floor---hardly a scratch, but unnerving nonetheless.<p>You can store contacts and calendar files on the MINI too, but it works best if you have a mac.  You can do it with Outlook, but you have to sync it manually.<p>You can store text files as notes to yourself on the MINI with NotePad (PC) or (MAC).<p>The coolest part about the mini is the navigation.  The ClickWheel is awesome.  See if you can try it in a store or try a friends.  You ahve to see it to believe it!  Its super easy to find songs, and to pick right up where you left off.  You can even play some games while the music is playing.  Shut the iPod off, and you will come right back to where you were.  just hit play again!<p>It does not have a radio tuner or voice recorder.  Sorry.<p>The battery life has a little to be desired.  It seems like the thing drinks power.  Its not that bad.  Perfect for the gym, and as long as you don't have it on for a whole 8-hour plane ride, you'll be ok.  I don't think the indicator works right either.  It says i'm about half way when I just finished charging.  ah well.<p>Cons-<br>Funny belt clip<br>No USB 1.<br>Poor battery life<br>No radio tuner or voice recorder<p>Pros-<br>EVERYTHING ELSE<p>The pros outweight the cons, unless you had your heart on that radio tuner. hehe<p>Get this electronic wonder if you can live without!<p>Some people may debate whether this is a smart buy.  After all, you can get a 15GB iPod (regular) for only $[price].  Well, this has several advantages.<br>-Cool colors<br>-Smaller--About the size of a business card!<br>-$[price] in the wallet<br>-Cooler styling<br>-Less easy to scratch.  The aluminum finish makes the mini like a tank.  The regular ipod scratches easily.<br>-Most people don't have 15 gig of music<br>-Much cooler ClickWheel<br>-Includes belt clip (a holder for the ipod costs $[price] more if you get the 15gb one)<p>Again, unless you have hundreds of albums, go MINI!

<Title>VERY GOOD MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Thu Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I rececntly received my green Apple iPOD mini from the apple online store, and it turned out great. the 4 GB harddrive was more than enough (i have around 500 or so songs, and it only took up a third of the memory using apple's AAC format), and the easy syncronization from comp to ipod was a breeze - faster and simpler than anything i've ever seen. the aluminim casing is beautiful, as wel as the backlit LCD screen. for pricing, it dosen't seem too great, but i was able to pull off  $30 from my purchase using a student discount. Sound quality is excellent - and so are the provided earbuds.<p>Cons: the iPOD is great, but there are also many simple flaws - some of which i hope can be fixed using future firmwares.<p>First of all - you can't delete songs from the ipod, you have to do it when connected from the computer (not very good if you pirate music - and you receive bad mp3's with the sudden buzzes that make you go deaf). <p>Another is the sleep timer- you have to reset it every time you turn on and off the player. <p>The hold button (very critical) is a little hard to move. also, within the first 2 weeks of usage, the touch wheel became dirty but it could be cleaned off with an eraser. Yes, eraser. <p>charging was a bit awkward - you'll notice when you get it. <p>The battery life is average - mine lasts around 5 hours and burns out completely. The instruction manual never tells you how long the initial charge should be - i charged mine around 4 hours through my laptop's firewire port (the manual says it takes around that long to be fully charged)..but take my advice - charge it double time even if it says charged - for the first initial charge.<p>other than those, the ipod mini and is a great buy if your in for a high-quality mp3 player/jukebox. Apple has done it again.

<Title>How can you live without one of these?
<Date>Thu Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The manufacturers explain all the specs very well, but if you're reading these reviews, you probably want to hear from someone who had used the mini. I have been waiting for an iPod, but didn't want an mp3 player that was as big or as white as a regular iPod. Minis have the bonus of being very small and come in different colors. <br>The little cutie is so easy to use,so skip reading the instructions. I use mine with a Ti4 (that's a G4 Titanium powerbook to Pentium users). iTunes and iPod together make it incredibly easy to put your entire music collection on your computer and select which songs/playlists you want to bring everywhere with you. The transfer of my small library of 1 gig took a couple of minutes, and each time I add songs to the different playlists, it takes less than a second to update all the playlists. I also imported my contacts and calendar from Entourage (or Palm Desktop works, too).<br>The scroll/touchpad is very senstive, but there is a lock button on the top so you can throw the ipod in a bag or pocket and your volume and other settings won't be affected. I also purchased an FM transmitter to use in my car and my other radios around the house. The earbuds for me were too uncomfortable so I got new headphones, and now life is good.<br>The games are crap, but who buys one of these for games? I'm sure more people will add their own reviews which may give you different information than this.

It has so much memory for such a little mp3 player and it really is easy to use along with itunes and the ipod mini dock.

<Title>Size does matter!
<Date>Fri Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sure, when you read the specs a 1/2 inch may not seem like it's that much smaller than the original white iPods, but when you hold it in your hand it really does feel Mini.<p>Obviously the only drawback is the lack of storage (in comparison to the other iPods anyway. 4 gigs is still a lot of space for a device that small). I have about 8 gigs of music, so I need to stick with my 10 gig model for a while, but if they release new Minis with say a 8 or 10 gig hard drive soon, I will definitely sell mine and go for the smaller size.<p>Not only is the iPod Mini fiendishly small and cool looking, it's also a lot more functional than the "big" iPods in my opinion.<p>Controls<p>As you may know, the "big" iPods feature four buttons across the top of the device that control the menu, play/pause, and next/previous tracks. They are also extremely sensitive, and can be pressed on accident just by trying to pick up the unit. It's also easy to press the wrong button when trying to find it by touch with your thumb. There is no click when you press the buttons, they are instead activated as soon as you lightly touch them.<p>The iPod Mini has the buttons built into the scroll wheel itself due to size constraints (it's really small!), but they also make an audible and "feelable" click when pressed. The scroll wheel is still touch sensitive, but all of the buttons click when you press them. This makes it a ton easier to navigate and use the iPod Mini without looking at it.<p>The hold switch (on the top of the unit, to keep the buttons from being pressed) is also much easier to use than on the "big" iPod in my opinion. On the big one you have to slide the switch with your fingernail or press down really hard to get it to move because it is almost flush with the surface of the iPod. But the hold switch on the iPod Mini sticks up a little more and has sharper edges, allowing you to easily "catch" the edge of it with your thumb and operate it.<p>Casing<p>The case of the iPod Mini is much nicer than it appears in pictures. I was a little unsure about all of the wacky colors when the Mini's were first announced, but when you see it in person it is actually quite nice. (I still don't like the looks of the gold one though!) The back of the case is the same material as the front, so it doesn't scratch and show fingerprints like the shiny chrome backing of the original iPods. Since we ordered directly from Apple, we got free laser engraving on the back as well, which looks like it was done with the same machine that does the etching of the Apple logo and other wording, so it matches perfectly and blends right in with the rest of the design.<p>Software<p>As far as I can tell the software for the iPod Mini is exactly the same as the originals. One difference I noticed is that when the iPod is ready to be disconnected from the computer, it shows a big check mark on it saying that it's ok to disconnect it. I don't think the originals had that.<p>One irritating thing is the reset controls of the Mini though. According to Apple, you have to plug in the iPod to a wall socket in order to reboot it, which seems a little silly. My wife's has gotten stuck once since we've had it, and we couldn't figure out how to reset it. I'm not sure if she ever figured it out or not yet (she's out of town so I could only walk her through it over the phone while she was at the airport). Hopefully the lock-ups will be very infrequent, or we may be calling up Apple to see what the problem is.<p>Extras<p>The Mini comes with a nice belt clip, which is easy to slide on and holds the device pretty tightly. You of course still have to be careful not to brush up against something when it's on your belt and scratch the screen or metal casing. It also comes with a Firewire cable, as well as a USB 2.0 cable which most Windows users will use. The original iPods only came with the firewire cables, forcing you to either by a firewire card for your PC, or buy a USB 2.0 cable at an extra cost if you had a Windows machine.<p>There is also a wall-plug included in the box. You just plug the firewire cord into the little power adapter, and plug it straight into the wall to charge it. You can't plug the USB 2.0 cord into the power adapter to charge it, so if you use that cord to sync to your PC, you'll have to carry the firewire cable as well if you want to charge the iPod without plugging it into a computer.<p>Value<p>A lot of people complain that the iPod Mini is too expensive in comparison to the 15 gig model that is only $50 more. This is a valid concern if you have 10 or 15 gigs of music in your collection, but if you are just a casual music listener, or don't mind manually managing the songs on your iPod rather than storing your entire collection on it, the iPod Mini is definitely an option to consider.<p>The size difference is significant, despite what you may first think after reading the specs on the Apple web site. If possible, look at an iPod Mini in person before saying "Oh, it's just a 1/2" or so smaller than the original iPod, that doesn't matter".<p>The iPod Mini also comes with more accessories than the 15 gig model, including the USB 2.0 cord, and the belt clip.<p>Overall this is a completely incredible little device, and is worth every penny of that $250.<p>Leave it to Apple to make something as incredible as the original iPod look obsolete and "huge" in comparison to the new iPod Minis.

<Title>iPod mini Blows Away Competition
<Date>Fri Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well, there's quite the debate about whether the iPod mini is really 'worth it.'  In my opinion, it really is.  People complain that its only $50 less than the 15GB iPod, but when I have no use for that much more space, why buy something with more drive?  Don't take me wrong, I have tons of music; I just don't feel the need to carry it all with me at all times.<br>Others compare the iPod mini to the Creative muVo2 4GB. Sure, the muVo2 is $50 less, but when you look at the difference in ergonomics, physical design, and firmware features, the iPod mini beats it hands down.<br>All in all, the iPod mini is a godsend for those of us that don't want a clunky player, but also want something that has a reasonable amount of space, as well as style.

<Title>Who says money can't buy happiness???
<Date>Sun Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When I first saw the iPod mini I thought how small could it be.  I mean come on.  My 15GB iPod is small as it can be.  Especially when you compare it to some of the other HDD MP3 players out there.  But when a guy I work for got his in the mail I went crazy.  This is one of the smallest, and cutest devices I've ever seen.  This thing feels better in the hand and looks better than a regular iPod.  When you press the pad for the menu or to change a song it gives a surprising amount of resistance.  I had worried that while scrolling through my libraries that I would accidentally press one of the buttons but that never happened.  As for the operation of the iPod it works exactly the same as a regular iPod.  Even the belt clip which I thought that the iPod mini would never stay in feels as though it were spot welded in.  Leave it to the people at apple to design something so perfect.  My only complaints are not with the iPod but with the Apple in ear headphones.  They might as well be called the Apple fall out of you ear headphones.  Do yourself a favor and buy the sony in ear headphones, but the Apple ear buds work just fine for the average joe and have good sound quality.  The other thing is the arm band that is sold seperatly is just a bit too small.  I have arms that measure about 18&quot; or so and I can barely get the thing past my forearms.  But those are complaints of extra items and not of the mini.  I love the mini so much that I went out and ordered one myself, eventhough my wife and I both own a regular iPod we decided to order a mini also.  If you are looking for a small MP3 player look no futher.  This is the one too buy.  Even if you just bought another kind.

<Title>LOVE IT!
<Date>Sat Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was in the market for an mp3 player that I could use while running and exercising - and I had to go with the iPod mini. You don't need to worry about purchasing batteries - it can be recharged simply by plugging it into an outlet. Battery lasts for about 8 to 10 hours each charge. Currently I have about 400 songs in my iPod mini and it isn't even half way full! I can't judge it on its compatibility with PC's (because I have a Mac) - but it is a breeze using it with my Mac. Install the cd - plug in the firewall adapter - and it will automatically transfers your iTunes songs right into the iPod mini - same folders and all! I do not own an iPod, so I don't know if it is worth buying an iPod mini if you already own its &quot;older sibling.&quot; But if you're looking for an mp3 player to exercise with or travel around with - look no further. ONE NOTE: I do not like the headphones that come with the iPod mini at all. I STRONGLY recommend that you buy the in-ear headphones - not only for sound quality, but also because they fit so much better. No, I don't own stock in Apple. But if you try to exercise with the earphones that come with the iPod mini - they won't stay in!

<Date>Tue Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>We ordered the ipod-mini directly from Apple.  Caution! They don't have all the bugs worked out of it.  It freezes up and requires the user to either plug it in and reset it or reload its software which erases all the songs you have downloaded on to it.  We have had to do this twice and its very time consuming.  Then the menu screen became unstable, it scrolled non-stop.  Finally, the menu screeg quit working altogether.  Iin a few days it quit working altogether.  For a new product, not very good.  We have had it less than a month.  My advice, wait and let them get the bugs out of it.  Apple customer service was less than customer friendly.

<Title>Pretty in pink!
<Date>Thu Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The primary reason I decided to purchase an mp3 player was so I could listen to music at the gym.  The iPod mini was definitely the best way to go.  It's incredibly small and lightweight, but the control buttons are still large enough to operate with ease and the screen is big enough to see clearly without having to squint.  I like the way the iPod mini has the control buttons right on the click wheel...it's much easier to operate than the original iPod.<p>In addition to its compact size, the mini has all the cool features of the larger iPod, including a backlit screen, full song list display, and many more.  I haven't utelized the contacts option yet or played any games, but it's nice to have those options at my fingertips.  <p>The mini comes with a secure belt clip, a very nice pair of earbud headphones, a cable to connect the iPod to your computer, and a cable to connect the iPod to the outlet charger (also included).  The iTunes program is incredibly easy to use, and you can download music very quickly.  <p>The only real complaint I have about the mini is that it should be priced a bit lower, considering that for $50 more you can buy the 15GB iPod, which holds four times as many songs as the iPod mini.  However, I think you really have to think about what you're going to use your iPod for.  In my case, I wanted the most lightweight model to take with me when I work out, so the mini was definitely the best choice (and 1,000 songs is still quite a lot, believe me!).  Still, I think Apple should lower the price.<p>Finally, the best thing about the iPod mini is that it comes in a variety of colors.  I have received many compliments on my pink mini: it's very fashionable!

<Title>the price RISES yet again
<Date>Fri Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>about 4 weeks ago the price to get this same thing (ipod mini)was $180. Now it's $205. are you nuts apple makes their ipods for a little less than $30 and their selling them for $205. It's a total rip off. i would not get an ipod mini unless the price is below $150. Sure it's great with all it's songs and extra features but, it's not worth the money. I'd wait for the price to drop before you buy an ipod mini.

<Title>How did I live without it?
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had my doubts about the Mini iPod. I decided that carrying around heavy, bulky CD cases were out of the question. After I'd invested in a Sony MD player I became painfully aware of the discs I had to carry around... not to mention having to remember which songs were on what disc. I had to find an easier way to carry my music around.  So I bought my iPod today... and I don't know how I ever lived without it. Everything is so organized and easy to use. I have 1500 songs at my fingertips 24 hours a day.  The only downside: It doesn't come with a charger... but it charges when hooked up to the computer by the USB cable.  Other than that it's great! It's small and sturdy... and very lightweight. They come in adorable colors and have very customizable features.

<Title>Flat Sounding: Not much Bass
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had an Archos Recorder V2 for about a year now & it has been great. Recently I bought into the Apple ipod hype & got an Ipod Mini  When I say that Archos is better sounding than Apple Ipod, I know it our of experience. Unless you haveused other mp3 jukeboxes, you might think that ipod has great sound. However, there are other better sounding products out there.  Ipod for all its hype sounds flat; no bass or depth. Archos sounds fuller when playing the same songs. Ipod surelay has a great look & definitely a great interface. No doubt. Howver, at the end of the day I need a great sounding jukebox.   Although Apple's Ipod looks great & is snaller in size than Archos, I care deeply about the quality of the music. And even with the best headphones & numerous tweakings, Ipod is flat. And, yes, I have tried all the EQ settings & with Seinheiser earbuds.  Serves me right for buying into the hype.

<Title>Definently worth the cost
<Date>Sat Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought a green ipod mini a few months ago when it was selling at $250. I wasn't sure at first whether I wanted a mini or an ipod with more capacity, I have about 25 cds and like a ton of music. Currently I have 249 songs on my ipod and I'm no where near to filling it. I figure,that by the time my music collection got bigger there would be a better music player out.          I have seen the bigger sized ipods and they are much harder to use, the buttons on them are more like indents where you sort of have to rub your finger around to get the ipod to react. With my mini ipod the click wheel is very easy to get used to and the buttons on it react instantly to your touch.             Its incredibly easy to find music on itunes, you can type in the names of the artist, album , soundtrack, song Etc. They also have lists of the top 100 songs for many categorys of music. The one problem I found with itunes was that THERE ARE NO BEATLES SONGS!, a slight problem which I'm sure you can solve by talking to your parents or your parents friends. Just put the cd in your computer and it loads teh songs.            The sound gets VERY loud and the quality of it is good. Great price, buy it now

<Title>Changes for the Good
<Date>Sun Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my silver iPod Mini yesterday at Circuit City. I wanted one so bad, after seeing my brother's regular iPod work so good. One HUGE problem I had with the regular iPod, though, was the touch wheel and buttons. It just doesn't feel natural, hardly even touching something, and then it be activated. The click wheel is much better. I was about to get a 1GB iPod Shuffle, but my mom and I decided that its much smarter to get something with a screen and that can hold over 4x as much songs. It was a very good investment. I already have 12 songs on my iPod, and I already love iTunes. iTunes is very easy to install if you have a good, up-to-date computer-Mac or PC. an iPod is a huge step to the perfect iPod.....it might even be the perfect iPod - perfect price, perfect size, perfect storage size. Don't miss out on the fad and get an iPod Mini, or any iPod for that matter (they all sound pretty good to me.) P.S. You don't have to have a Shuffle to play songs randomly - you can do the same thing with other iPods.

<Title>More or less met my expectations. 
<Date>Sun Mar 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As with most high-end products, you'll hear both good and bad things about it, in equal quantity. I held off buying the iPod mini until the price went right down, and with that time now here, I went online and bought one right away. I chose the green one, in case you're interested. Overall, I am very pleased with it, and the pros definitely outweigh the cons.  With that in mind, here is my breakdown of my iPod experiences thus far. Keep in mind that I have had it for about one month at the time of writing this.  PROS:  - Excellent build quality and durability. It is almost like Murphy's Law with me, that the most expensive gadgets I buy will always be the first to get dropped. I have dinged my iPod around, and it has sustained absolutely no damage. The nice finish doesn't attract smudges and fingerprints like the regular iPods do, and the tactile quality of the click wheel (much better than on previous models) is excellent. - The sound quality is excellent, and I have compared it against many other jukebox MP3 players, as well as many flash-based ones. - The iPod and iTunes supports AAC, which offers good compression of your songs without the sound quality suffering. - 4 GB may not be on par with the 40 GB model, but I found it to be all that I need, and I am a big music collector. I have no need to take ALL of my music with me. - The iTunes software is much better than Windows Media Player or the proprietary, copyright-protected nightmare that is Sony's burning software. Importing and transferring has been relatively hassle-free. Loading songs onto your iPod is simply a matter of drag and drop. - The "Cool Factor." This is an iPod after all.   CONS:  - The battery life. This is a common complaint, and the only real caveat I have against the iPod Mini. The player boasts "up to" 8 hours, but that is under ideal conditions. Ideal meaning that you do not use the backlight, the EQ, or skip through songs too much. On average, I get around 6 hours total...but I am a song-skipper, and I like to have the volume cranked right up.  - Make sure your thumbs are clean while using it. The white click wheel can get dirty rather easily. - The songs will transfer super-fast over USB 2.0 or Firewire, but don't even think about doing it on a USB 1.1. Most computers don't have the aforementioned ports as a standard, so you will probably have to shell out more money for an expansion card for your PC.  - Those trademark white headphones might make you a tempting target for muggers. Use generic ones instead.  Despite the few drawbacks, I am happy with my purchase. Some other reviewers have commented on everything from bugs, skipping, to downright freezing or dying, which I have no experienced despite heavy use so far.

<Title>I was wary of buying it 
<Date>Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Gave me a couple of scares when the songs started skipping and it wouldn't turn on, but strangely enough when I took off the volume adjustments on the songs, they stopped skipping. And as for it not turning on, it was out of batteries, because I hadn't listened to it for a couple of days, but I've learnt my lesson and always plug it in to the charger if its not being used. I've also dropped the unit a few times without the skin, but apart from the little scratches, it's fine.   PROS:  -very light, I put it in my pocket and I thought I lost it at the end of the day, I guess this is sort of a con.  -feels very VERY nice in your hand (small, compact)that anonized stuff around the mini feels like a nice kind of cold crisp  -sound quality's alright it's mostly the quality of the mp3 file you've gotta worry about  -decent colours, but would like to see orange replace gold  -4 GBs is more than you think, just put only your favourite songs on it, if you want to put your whole music library into it, i suggest one of the other iPod with larger capacity  -USB capabilities    CONS:  -easy to break, COUNTLESS # of ways to screw up an iPod mini  -after a while you can hear staticky noises at loud volumes  -after the first time the scroll wheel loses its aura, then it gets dirty and sometimes selects the song that comes after the song that you actually want  -the earbuds are crap, the wires can stick out and it can shock you (I've been shocked before), it's more than a con, its dangerous!    -you have to baby it if you'd like to see it last more than a year  OVERALL: These things aren't "hip" anymore now that everyone's got one. They even stopped showing the iPod commercials on TV. Now they have the 5GB mini with the coloured font on the scroll wheelydealy. The regular 4GB is down to $199. My 5 month old mini already feels ancient. I say buy one if you want, the pros and cons cancel each other.

<Content>Don't fall for the "get an iPod for free" scams in the fake "reviews" posted here. It's spammers harvesting email addresses for their ridiculous products.  Think about it for a moment. How can somebody afford to give away $250+ gadgets just for signing up for some trial offers? Answer: they can't!  The San Francisco Chronicle also says these offers are bogus. Search sfgate.com or Google for "David Lazarus Free iPod not really" and you will see what the people running these programs are really doing.

<Title>W-O-W!
<Date>Mon Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This thing kicks ass! It is by far the best mp3 player on market, and is also better than the other ipod models (unless u r looking for a large song space)!! I love this thing! I have had it for a few weeks now and have yet to experience ONE single problem! I am amazed! The battery power problem experienced with the original ipod has been improved upon so that now the 8 hour estimate is relatively accurate. It takes like... probably 30 minutes to get all your music on the mini the first time, then after that only a minute. The sound quality is superb, as are the controls, the click wheel is (in my opinion) much easier to use than the other navigation formats. It functions properly and is easy to find songs. The mini is also scrath resistant, so setting it on the desk wont scrath it (like it did the ipod), and it comes with a belt clip in the box. The games are kind of difficult to control at first, but get easy pretty soon. I dont really use any other features other than the clock (which i use instead of a watch now) If i experience any problems later on i will write a second review.<p>iPod mini fo'eva!!!

<Content>This IPOD is prone to headphone jack problems after about a month of use.  Any type of movement now cause static during song play.  Any headphones I try do the same thing.  I have read about this problem on several places on the net.  Apples response...&quot;There is a one yr warranty&quot;.   Guess that is their excuse for selling an inferior product.

Until people ask about it, that is.

The case weighs practically nothing, but protects iPod mini in your pocket, purse or backpack. Recessed in the case to keep its surface pristine wherever you lay it, the 1.67-inch (diagonal) backlit screen displays full song names and more. iPod mini gives you over 25 minutes of skip protection and lasts up to 8 hours on a single battery charge.  <br> <br> <br> <p> <br>great great great !

<Title>Not what I thought
<Date>Wed Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Battery drains pretty quickly and the iPod freezes a lot. It also &quot;dumps&quot; all your music and then they magically reappear sometimes after freaking out over losing everything you've worked so hard to convert and add. It doesn't take wma files so you have to convert them to mp3. iTunes isn't the only program that works with the iPod Mini like Apple says, Real Player works as well. I should have listened to my brother on this one, his Philips mp3 player uses all formats.

<Title>Another Sucess Story for Apple
<Date>Mon Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>We all know that quality is worth the wait. This will apply to the new Apple iPod Mini. The iPod Mini is by far, the best digital music player I've ever used. However, the new iPod is in great demand. Everyone wants it, yet it is out of most people's grasp. For now, that is. The Apple company made a rather large mistake earlier in the year, they didn't produce nearly enough of the mini's to meet demand. Hundreds of eager customers have added their name to a list of thousands to recieve a new iPod by the end of May. I know this as a fact becauseI, myself have searched exxtendedly for this product. I found that not a single store has them in stock at thids time. And in order to recieve one, you must order one, pay around $250, then wait three to five weeks to get one.  April 18, 2004

<Content>Yes, it's really amazingly small. Yes, it's extremely cute and will cause all your friends and family to have extreme curiosity and envy. It also has 4 GB of space, which is enough to keep you on your music collection toes. Overall it's a wonderful product.<p>I've experienced three problems. First, the hold switch sometimes comes off in my pocket, allowing the player to run out the battery. Second, the software screwed up somehow one time and deleted all the songs from the player (easy to fix by re-uploading, but bothersome nonetheless). Third, (and this is a problem with all iPod earphones) the small earbud foam covers come off easily and can be lost/destroyed in rapid fashion.<p>I've also heard there's a little solder in the unit which can come loose after prolonged running or jarring, but I have not experienced that. I have used the armband with no problem to date.<p>Highly recommended, for style, sound and savvy. You'll be the cool kid on the block for sure. At least for the next two weeks when the iPod embedded-in-your-arm comes out. Then apple really will run your life.

<Content>Can the best get better. Yes.  When Apple released the original ipod it was everything a music lover wanted.  Sure it was slighty larger than most players but the benefits were great.  Large screen, options on storage, fasionable design, and more.  Now Apple has unleased the mini and it takes care of the size problem.  Apple is unique in that all it's poducts sync together.  You can have your ipod, Apple computer, itunes, and then go to the istore for music.  The best parts about the player are the sleek design and room for expansion.  Apple provides updates for the MP3 software on the ipod and the mini will also come with this benefit.  Apple suceeds in an original way, again.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Everything's better in pink!  Seriously, I had it for two days before I brought it back. There were no problems, I just didn't want to be greedy, since I already own a 15GB 3G and a 20GB 4G. But for the two days I had it, I fell in love with it.  Battery life: Never had to recharge it in those two days. I didn't use the equalizer - since the equalizer setting you use in iTunes transfer to the iPod, I didn't have to.  Look and feel: This thing is really cute! And if you get one in silver, I guess it's cool. The functionality of such a small device is unbelievable. The brushed metal look is even better in color, and the click wheel interface makes it really simple to use one-handed (but you still shouldn't use it while driving - don't learn that the hard way).  Functionality: I transfer a lot of files back and forth, which is why this is less useful to me than the 15 and 20GB models I now have. As a design student, I need to move large Photoshop documents from home to school and back on a semi-weekly basis, and it's so easy to just drag and drop them once you enable disk mode.  I also bought my first audiobook at Audible.com last week. The iPod places 'bookmarks' where you leave off, so you can just pick up the story whenever, and not miss a beat. And the wheel makes it easy to back up in case you feel you've missed something.  Cost: With the recent price drop, the 4GB model is now priced at what it should have been. It's good, also, that the 6GB model is only $50 more, since having nearly 4 times the storage at a $50 price difference didn't make sense. Perhaps Apple could look over their pricing again? It's still $299 for a 20GB, so if you're not really into the colors, you get a lot more storage for a little more money.  All in all, this is a really good player. And since I won an incentive contest at my job last week, I will soon be the proud owner of another brand new iPod mini! I guess it was meant to be.  (I think the only drawback is if it's really true that they don't include the wall charger with the 6GB models... That kinda bites.)

<Content>Remember that prices on this Ipod have gone down significantly because it is the old 2004 model.  Spend a little more, and instead buy the newly released model, which supposedly an 18-hour battery life as opposed to the first-generation's 8-hour battery life. I have the new 2nd generation Ipod Mini, which I bought this weekend, and it is terrific.  I haven't been able to clock the battery life, but I charged it for the first time on Saturday, and today (Tuesday evening) it is at about half of its original charge.

<Title>Easy to Use / Sounds Great,but Some Features are Frustrating
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My sister bought my father an iPod. I have been setting up my father's iPod for him, and it is easy to see why the iPod is so popular. "Ripping" CDs to your computer hard drive and transferring them to your iPod is tremendously easy, and the iPod's menu is intuitive. One of the best compliments I can pay? I found my father with his eyes closed, kicking back in his easy chair, the iPod earbuds hooked up to his ears--he had the biggest smile on his face. I have found the device to be frustrating in some ways, though. First, while it is easy to transfer music TO the device, new users should be forewarned that it takes much more work to transfer music back FROM the device to your computer--and regenerate your playlists (in case, for instance, your computer hard drive crashes, or in my case, when I tried to copy my Dad's music files from his C: to his D: drive and accidentally corrupted the files; I had to completely rerip scores of CDs). You also can share the music between your iPod and only ONE computer.(Apple limits how you transfer your files to make it more difficult for people to pirate music, but it also limits legitimate use of music you legally own). Secondly, the iTunes music store is not available in Asia, where my father lives. (Again, because Apple is afraid that people in this region might pirate music), which unfortunately limits my father's ability to legitimately buy and download music. Those are severe limitations, so I can only give the device three stars. I will not buy one fo myself, but overall, it has been a great gift for my Dad.

<Title>Windows XP vs Ipod and Squeaky Speakers
<Date>Wed Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the mini Ipod in the Dubai Duty Free and am resident of India. The product has been a nightmare to use - Copying songs from my windows XP pc has resulted in requests getting timed out all the time. Especially for big files. And it gives a firm ware error all the time. Also service for Ipods is bad with the service centre staff being slow to respond and completely apathetic. Also I found that the problem with Windows XP is endemic and they suggested I move to a Mac. Also the service centre told me that the money back guarantee does not work in India.  Itunes does not work in India either.   To make matters worse the speakers started squeaking after a couple of weeks of use. Please suggest how I can get my money back. Forget the time wasted trying to repair it!

<Title>Easy to set up, works great,  but one complaint.
<Date>Sat Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my blue ipod mini today from the apple website. It took me about 30 minutes to install all the software and register my ipod at the iTunes website. I don't plan on buying any music at the iTunes store, I just wanted to transfer my favorite songs from my vast CD collection to my ipod. The color is very rich and vibrant, it looks great and works with ease.  My only gripe is that they don't give you a USB power adaptor for an electrical socket. Since they don't include one with your ipod mini, you have to charge it buy keeping it connected to your computer. Also, the computer has to be kept ON while the ipod charges. I hate having to leave my computer on for 4 hours while my ipod is charging. I recommend that you also buy a power adaptor so that you can charge your ipod from an electrical socket. I know I'll need one for when I go home, and am not able to take my computer with me.

<Content>Nice. Everythings great, but there's too many accessories to buy. I spent more money on accessories than the iPod mini, itself. And, now there's a 4 GB and a 6 GB starting at $199 with a longer battery life.

<Content>I borrowed this item from a friend and used it for a cross country trip.  I also got an FM modulator to plug it into my car cigarette lighter so I could hear it through my car stereo.  It sounded pretty good and was great when I couldn't pick up any good radio stations.

<Title>Pretty good if you have a good computer...
<Date>Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all I'd like to say how very impressed I am with amazon.com! I ordered the super saver shipping and got my i-pod via UPS the next day instead of in 10 days like it said! Unfortunately, we don't have windows XP or ME on our crappy computer so I can't even use it until we get a new one. But I'm sure it'll work nicely.   I just have one reccomendation for amazon-I didn't want to enter my entire credit card number over the internet, so I just entered the last 5 digits as prompted, but never got a phone number to tell them the rest of it! It was very inaccessible and very hard to find, and it drove me crazy searching for it for hours. I'm sure it can be made easier-to-find.   Overall, very happy with my first order from amazon.com, and will definitely be ordering again!

<Title>Impressive, with minor bugs
<Date>Wed Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased my green apple ipod mini a few months ago and overall have been extremely impressed.  The sound quality is impeccable, and the controls are intuitive and quick.  A few minor bugs, though.<p>Pros: First and foremost is sound quality.  Even with relatively low bitrate(120-140) i rarely noticed any static.  The new clickwheel works amazingly well, especially well when used one-thumbed (compared to other mp3 players.)  Its small size and easy synchronization with your computer and iTunes are pluses as well.  I have a PC, and Apple finally got something right. It is a breeze to add songs from cd's into itunes and then onto my ipod.  It will usually open up itunes and update it for you.  It also pops up as a portable hard drive which is very useful in lieu of a flash memory drive.  While on the matter of transfer, it was extremely speedy, even with USB 1.1, taking only about 20 minutes for 400 songs(i have a rather limited library).  USB 2 is much faster, so keep that in mind if transfer speed is an issue.  It rarely (if ever) skips, thanks to  32mb of flash memory that it stores the music on, thus it has nothing that moves and skips while it is playing.  The most aesthetically pleasing thing about the mini is its aluminum (colored!) case.  IT resists scratches very well, and does not smudge at all like the original.  Another perk of the mini is it comes with a usb cable and not just a firewire one like the regular one, which would set me back another 30=40$. Finally, I love the screen.  It is clear, even at its size, and the backlight works fantastically.  <p>Cons: THe biggest problems I had were swallowing the big price tag and small battery life.  250$ seems like a lot when you can get a similar device for 50$ less.  While the whole unit is remarkably small, in order to get it this size the manufacturers cut out battery size.  THis is usually not a big problem as long as you remember to plug it into your computer or a wall outlet, but it is cumbersome on trips because you always need to bring the power cord along.  Also, The ipod never shuts off.  This is a bit of a mixed blessing as there is no start up time, but coupled with its small battery life, it can only go a few days without being recharged, even if you do not play any music. Plus, it has a relatively small hard drive, holding only about 1000 songs, paling in comparison to the larger ipods.  But I don't have any use for a 40 gig ipod, so this is good for those who don't have a large amount or music. It freezes occaisionally, but this is not a suprise, as it is a computer and computers do that.  The scroll wheel is occaisionally finicky if you want to move down say, one item, which would not be a problem with another mp3 player with buttons instead.  The games are also difficult on this small screen (especially solitaire) but again, not something to base your purchase on.  Finally, I sometimes found that it was too small, specifically too flat for its width and height.  I usually keep the included belt clip on it, just so it feels bigger and sturdier in my hand.  <p>As a whole, I was extremely satisfied with this purchase, with just a few small bugs that are few and far between.  I highly recommend it if you do not have a large music collection or are looking for something for excersize, etc.  i also recommend the Sony MDR-EX70LP Earbud Headphones for use with it.  Tey are an excellent match.

<Title>Static-Crackle-Useless after 1 month of use
<Date>Wed Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After receiving my ipod mini from a friend in the USA (I am a UK resident), I lovingly listened to it for about a month, then it all went rapidly downhill... When I now play it, the slightest movement, touch of the beautiful aluminium casing, all I can hear is crazy static, screeching noises. <p>After visiting other ipod web forums, it appears to be quite a common fault.

<Title>Great LITTLE ipod
<Date>Fri Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The best thing about this ipod is how unbelievably small it is.  Mine is exactly the size of my business card. It is also VERY thin and light.  I understand it has all the features and benefits of full sized ipods with one exception - capacity. It only holds 4GB (really more like 3.5 of actual music). I was able to cram in about 30 CDs - granted these are mostly jazz CDs with lost of 10min+ tracks. The iTunes software is great. The battery lasts about 8 hours if you dont use the backlight too much. I sync with my Win XP PC using USB 2.0 and I can't believe how fast it uploads the songs off of my PC to the ipod. (CD to PC takes a little longer - maybe 3 or 4 min per CD.)<p>Others at the ipodlounge dot com have complained that there is an issue with the headphone plug losing its connection with the circuit board over time creating a lot of static and poor sound quality. After a week mine is still fine, but it is something you should know about. Apple is apparently aware of the issue and honors the one yr warranty. If mine has a problem, I will quickly reduce my star rating.<p>I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the capacity issue. I really wish I was able to get my whole CD collection on it, but I guess I would need the 40GB version to do that.<p>Anyone considering the Mini should also check out the 15GB version. For fifty bucks more you get more in the box and over three times the storage. You do give up the &quot;coolness factor&quot; of having a mini.<p>In my box along with the Mini was a USB 2.0 cable (which also charges it from the PC's 2.0 port), a firewire cable, the ipod, a belt clip (useless), earphones w/o remote, and a white square plastic box which can plug into an AC outlet which, when used with the firewire cable, becomes an AC adapter.<p>Laser engraving is available for about twenty bucks if you order directly from Apple - great if it is a gift.

<Title>What every jogger needs to know!
<Date>Sat May 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Not sure if you've heard about it - but Apple Company may have a much bigger customer relations debacle on the horizon than the recent battery life problem.  Personally, after what I've been through, I'm ready to launch a campaign to let everyone know that Apple is blatantly misleading the public about their newest hot item - the iPod Mini.  Here's my story:<p>I purchased a Mini, along with the arm band accessory for the express reason of listening to music while jogging. At first, I loved it - the sound was great, it was very easy to use - and of course, very cool to look at and show off to friends, etc. Then, on my sixth use, the iPod completely &quot;froze.&quot; No sound, no nothing. None of the buttons worked and it would not reset.  It had completely locked up. I called Apple immediately, and explained the situation.  The Apple representative, who apparently had heard of this problem before, quickly let me know that, &quot;...As shocking as this may sound, the iPods are not made to jog with.&quot;  I could not believe what I was hearing.  I indicated that the Apple website specifically suggests jogging as a recommended activity with the Mini.  Apple even advertises the Mini with people break dancing - which is even more &quot;high impact&quot; than jogging!  Furthermore, they sell a Flexible Armband for the iPod that clearly states to be used for JOGGING (which I was using when it died).  <p>I have since spoken to numerous Apple representatives to find one who would agree to help me with my problem.  They've made comments like, &quot;The mini is similar to your home computer, and you don't jog with that, do you?&quot; Another Rep added, &quot;...yes you can jog with it, but we cannot guarantee it's performance.&quot;  And my favorite, &quot;We are striving to produce a Mini that you can jog with, but we have not completely perfected the Mini.&quot;  I indicated to them, that they are CLEARLY engaging in false advertising, but unbelievably, they responded with, &quot;No, we're not, because the Mini <br>will work fine for approximately 20 minutes of jogging, before it may &quot;freeze.&quot;<p>The only &quot;fix&quot; they have offered is, when the iPod &quot;freezes&quot; let the battery completely die (which could take hours), then re-charge it and try it again.  If it is still frozen, I will have to call Apple and re-boot the Mini's hard drive - which will cause me to lose any music saved on it.<p>Evidently Apple did not adequately test their iPod Mini product before putting it on the market, and now, they have decided to continue their deceptive advertising practices to promote a product which they now know is not suited to an activity which many customers will assume is an acceptable use.  Clearly, they do not stand behind their products and do not offer acceptable solutions to their customers' problems.

<Title>Great player
<Date>Tue May 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had this little beauty (in pink) for about 2 months now and I love it.  I am a casual music lover so the 4gb drive is more then enough for me.  I love how easy it is to use and the sound is wonderful. I would recommend that you invest in the in ear head phones because the ones that come with the player really become uncomfortable with long wear. The only reason this is given 4 starts rather then five is because I think it is a little pricey if one takes in the fact that you can get 11 more gb for only 50 more dollars.  So it isn't really a great value for the money.  But if that doesn't bother you and you want a stylish, awesome player, go for the ipod mini.  You won't be dissappointed.  Nothing else out there currently can touch it in cool factor.

<Title>don't be decieved my children
<Date>Mon May 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i was the first in line to buy this from apple.com<p>probably one of the first people to receive it as well<p>the first day was great. i was ecstatic that it arrived intact, and in a cutesy little box that ought to make teenagers giggle. <p>but after a week, those giggles turned into runts of frustration.<p>let me tell you what happened... (and this has happened to many of my friends as well.. i doubt i'm the only victim of such a tragedy)<p>1. the earbuds are the worst quality ever. they were probably manufactured by one armed blind children. the wiring casing fell apart, the painted logos on the earbuds scratched off, the interior wiring got all stretched out and is vulnerable to damage.<p>2. the laser engraved apple isignia on the case can be scratched quite easily, contrary to popular opinion (in apple's opinion that is) although the case puts up pretty well, the logo on the back has been nearly scratched off. i keep my ipod mini in my pocket constantly, but this shouldn't warrant scratches on an anodized aluminum case.<p>3. the touch sensitive wheel is a piece of shiet. this may be a personal preference, but since i am the king of touch, and a have very agile fingers like a puma, i think this &quot;touch screen technique&quot; will prove obnoxious for the less-gifted. in some cases the touch roll crap function is nice, but when trying to use the star-rating function and finding a song through &quot;song browse&quot; its a huge pain in the buttcheek.<p>4. last but not least, since i'm wasting too much time writing this review in my pissed off manner (i'm calling apple support right now to return this DAMNED piece of disfunctional mayhem!), the biggest thing that makes me want to murder squirrels, is the damn function of the product itself! TO PLAY MUSIC!!!! over the past 4 months, since i haven't had the time to bother myself with this warranty business until today, the ipod mini has crashed repeatedly! nearly 20 times! what i mean is, i'll be sitting listening to a good old playlist, when voila! the ipod will freeze for no apparent reason. the backlight stays lit, the screen data is stuck on display, and worst of all, YOU CAN'T TURN OFF THE DAMNED MACHINE! there is no reset button! sooooo... you have to leave the damn ipod on for the remaining 8 hours of battery life until the frozen backlight sucks out the last drop of juice! talk about marketing a crappy product! <p>ok, now i hope you realize some of the setbacks that has plagued my ipod mini experience.<p>however, to show that i am not biased in any way (all i care about is a good product!) i will give a cliffnotes version of my experience.<p>-pros-<br>*be considered &quot;trendy&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; for all you vain folks<br>*very lightweight design<br>*awesome white backlight<br>*has games function, although they are for the most part useless and very difficult to play<br>*itunes software is great<br>*the case is very durable, and the silver finish is attractive to the eyes<p>-cons-<p>*small storage space, my ipod is maxed out with only 851 mp3's. it's actually 3.8 gigs not 4.0 as advertised if you check the player status.<br>*the emblems, apple logos and such scratch off very quickly<br>*the included headphones are of the worst build quality i've ever seen. airline headphones hold up better.<br>*the freakin' touch sensitive wheel is way TOO sensitive! if you keep the ipod in your pocket, and it rubs against the side of the fabric, you are prone to deafness as the volume control will be altered dramatically.<br>*battery life is pretty weak, lasts around 7-8 hours<br>*the music player function is fatally flawed in that it crashes for no reason nearly everytime i use it whether i'm at school, working out, or sleeping. its absolutely retarded.<p>yeah so be aware, consumer, and do what your heart tells you to do. hahahhah. god i hate this thing.

<Title>iPods: It's Plusses and Minuses (Mini Version)
<Date>Mon May 10 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Here are the reasons why you should buy an iPod:<br>1. It is compact, you can take 1000 songs with you everytime you go out. The iPod slips very easily in your pocket and is pretty light.<br>2. It is extremely easy to use. Plug it in and it automaticcally all the songs from your computer (iTunes) to your iPod. Very very fast connection and updating. It only takes about 4 seconds to update an average sized album. Amazing huh?<br>3. It's very very convenient. One thing I really about the iPod is that you can create playlists so your songs can play in a particular order. You can make as many playlists as you like and it'll take like 10 seconds. If you want to burn the songs into a portable CD player, it'll take a good 20 minutes, AND you get worse music quality. You can change your playlists as many times and you want.<br>4. It's got a lot of other features on it. The games are really fun. You can also put notes, calendar, and contacts on it.<br>5. The sound is really good. You get equalizer and you can adjust to maximize the quality of music depending on the genre.<br>6. The design ROCKS! Come on, who can deny the fashionability of the iPod Mini?<br>7. Extremely light: makes it even more convenient!!<p>Some not so great points about the iPod:<br>1. It scratches very easily and unless you don't mind that, you're gonna have to buy some kind of case for it, which will make it slightly bigger (but some will make it more fashionable).<br>2. The battery really doesn't last that well compared to some other mp3 players out there. To get the most out of your iPod battery, do not fully discharge it before you recharge it. (There's no memory effect.)Supposedly it lasts 18 months if you listen to 6 hours of music a day. (Still not that bad!)<br>3. The price is pretty up there... But say, you use it everyday for the next 1.5 years, the iPodmini costs 45 cents a day. And chances are you ARE gonna use it for more that 1.5 years.<p>Some final words:<br>Go for it, you really won't regret the purchase. The iPod is a timeless thing. The iPod really opened my eyes to music. I now listen to a wider variety of music. With iTunes, purchasing songs you like can never be easier. Once again, GO FOR IT!! NO REGRETS!!

<Content>While I don't have any issues with the product itself (although the battery is known to go out on ipods), it costs FAR too much.  For less than the price of one of these you can get another player with 5 times the amount of storage!  There was even one on here recently (Archos 20GB) that was HALF the price of this and five times the storage space!<p>Only get this product if you're concerned more about being trendy than listening to music.

<Title>buy a regular iPod!
<Date>Mon May 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>when thinking about buying an iPod, your considering a rather hefty chunk of change. MP3 players range in price, you can pick one up for 60 dollars, which holds maybe 125 MB worth of music (each song being aprox. 2 MB) or you can go big for 500 dollars and get 40 GB (holds somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 - 25 thousand songs in standard MP3 format) this mini iPod is definately sold to people who think its &quot;cute.&quot; Believe me when i say, your money is much better spent on a normal iPod. The 15 GB iPod, which i own, is only slightly larger than the mini, and is simply white. for just 50 dollars more, you are getting near to 4 times the space for songs! Consider your options: <p>A) slightly larger, uncolored iPod with 15 GB for 300 <p>B) smaller, colored iPod with 4 GB for 250  <p>the answer is obvious.I currently have about 850 songs on my iPod, and i've only used 2 GB! on my 15 GB iPod thats just a scratch, but thats half the memory on a mini iPod! So if your looking for a great bang for your buck, the regular iPod will run circles around the mini.<p>ADD ON<p>i had to add this on when i found these at my local electronic store. if you simply MUST have a colored iPod, they have jackets that fit over the regular iPod that come in various colors, and protect your iPod very well in the process. See more about me to read my review on the jamJacket!

<Title>Too cool for school
<Date>Mon May 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I heard a quote somewhere; &quot;There are two kinds of people in this world, those that own an iPod and those that want an iPod.&quot;  I was in the later group, but when the mini came out, I had to be in the first group.  The physical size is perfect and light.  The only way the mini could be better is if it were cheaper (that's why I only gave it 4 stars).  I was able to score the student discount so I got it for $229.  The click wheel interface is the ultimate in usablity.  I'm glad I didn't buy a regular iPod.  My battery life has been slightly better than the specified 8hr span.  Do I regret not getting the 20 or 40GB storage?  NO WAY.  The battery doesn't last the 4gigs worth of play, let alone 20 and I'm not afraid to take only the music I need.  Fear of commitments?  Buy the regular iPod.  I'm ready to take the leap with my iPod mini.

<Content>The iPod mini is a huge improvement over the bigger iPod models. While it only holds 4GB, (and I say `only' because 4GB is a lot of music!), you'll be happy with this smaller, lightweight, sexier mp3 player. I installed all the software on my Windows XP computer without any problems. The unit arrived with a bit of battery life so I charged it via the transformer supplied - use the firewire cable to connect to the iPod. I found it charged quickly so I was up and running in no time flat.<p>The box contains iTunes, the software you use to purchase songs and transfer existing files to your iPod; however, I recommend you download the latest version online. Once you pop in the CD it will try to install iTunes, but if you have a newer version it recognizes that and completes the setup. You may need to reboot your Windows machine.<p>The usability of the unit is MUCH better than that of the regular iPod. It does not take much pressure to traverse through the menus and I found that after using it for a while, navigating the iPod became intuitive. It just requires a bit of practice. <p>One thing I am concerned about is the size of the font on the screen...I think for older adults or those with low vision, there may be a problem reading the track names or seeing the menu titles. They may find using the backlight all the time improves the readability of the text, however this may drain battery life faster.<p>The headphones that come with the iPod are somewhat uncomfortable during extended use. While the sound is very good, I will be investing in a different pair. It's a shame Apple can't let you choose which type of headphones you'd like - or - improve on the pair provided. <p>Thankfully, this unit has a hold button that prevents the accidental bump or nudge if the iPod is in your pocket. The belt clip that comes with the iPod is very handy and I have walked around the house and work with it on and never worried about it slipping out; just be sure to snap the iPod into the clip rather than sliding. <p>For those of you with an existing MP3 collection, you may find you need to rename your songs and add ID3 tags. The iPod uses these when displaying the song on the screen. I had all my files named (Artist) - Title.mp3 and I had to download a file rename tool to remove the parentheses. I also had to download a program that would auto-generate ID3 tags based on the file names so that when I imported my songs into iTunes to be transferred onto the iPod. You'll be glad you took the time to do this otherwise, browsing through songs will be near to impossible. Songs purchased from iTunes are preformatted for the iPod - you won't need to rename or add tag info.<p>My final request from Apple or another manufacturer would be to create a travel carrying case for the iPod mini. And not your typical black padded case either - perhaps designer versions created for women and other style conscious iPod owners. I'd like something to hold all the basic accessories that come in the box. I still don't really have a good way to protect my iPod when traveling whether from my home to work or overseas.<p>Overall I'll give it 5 stars for being small, lightweight, easy to use, style, and sound. It gives me everything I've been looking for in a portable mp3 player. I also like all the extra accessories that are available if I choose to expand its use. It really needs to come with better headphones and I wouldn't mind paying more for something better than hard, uncomfortable ear buds. The extras such as a calendar, note pad and games are nice, but I don't see myself using those functions, especially already having a cell phone and PDA in my purse.

<Title>Awsome
<Date>Fri May 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Sure, it is gonna take a dent out of your wallet, but this thing is incredible.  It holds so much music (1000 songs), on an eight hour battery life, with a small, sexy case of your color.  Some say you should just shell out $50 more and get a regular iPod with 4000+ songs, but if you don't have 400+ CD's or need that many songs, go to an apple store.  Once you've used this thing, you'll fall in love with it.

<Title>Awesome, but still not perfect
<Date>Mon May 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just got my iPod Mini.  This is my first experience with an mp3 player and it's very cool.  I think everyone needs one of these.  The days of CD's are over.  <p>As much as this thing is one of the coolest little devices I've owned, it isn't perfect.  Puting music in can be frustrating.  I burned most of my CD's prior using the Window's Media Player (WMA format)  The itunes won't accept most of those files, because Microsoft instals an lincensing encryption on them.  So I had to re-rip all my CDs with itunes.  You bascially get forced into this little war between Microsoft and Apple to domniate the media file format.  They both force you to rip their format, and they don't cooperate with each other.  Neither rips to mp3 format.  You're probably best off to get a simple third-party ripper an do the ripping to not-encrypted, good old mp3 format.  Both iTunes and Window Media Player will accept those.  <p>The Windows version operating system for the iPod is not perfected yet.  It comes with version 1.0.  But it has bugs, so you have to download 1.1, and install it.  But even that system still has bugs, and the iPod will freeze up from time to time, requiring a reset function, which is disturbing.  <p>It works most of the time, as long as you're gentle with it.  Don't press too many buttons in strange order, and the device won't get confused.  <p>I hear the Mac version OS is very good though.  But be ready for a few surprises if you're a PC user.

It transfers songs in about 1 second for each using Firewire.  I have 50 songs on it so far and It still has so much memory left.  It's easy to use and the games are great too.  Get This Product!!!

Sometimes I worry that there I can't use it in several years because there is no way to replace the battery, but that's in a long time.

<Content>The ipod mini is just awesome. If you want a quality mp3 player, but don't need a lot of space, get this one. It hardly scratches and is really compact. the control wheel is really convenient because unlike the big ipod, you could just press buttons and scroll without having to move too much. It's not too light, and not too small. I give it 5 stars.

<Title>Small But Powerful
<Date>Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod mini is built from the ground up as a portable device for people with fast-paced lives. It's small and lightweight physical dimensions are perfectly suited to be being placed in a pants or shirt pocket without being a burden.<p>But don't let its light weight fool you into thinking the iPod mini is a pushover. The 4GB hard drive (3.7 GB actual) can hold about 1,000 songs - enough to last almost three full days. The installed software includes four games; a calendar; a notepad; a contact database; a clock; backlight with timer; an alarm clock; and the abilities to customize the main menu; create playlists; and rate songs. All this is in addition to being able to be used as an external hard drive!<p>However, the most revolutionary aspect of the iPod mini (aside from it's size and weight) is its control interface. Incorporating the 'Menu', 'Pause/Play', 'Forward' and 'Back' buttons directly to the touch sensitive scroll wheel not only creates simplicity from a design standpoint, but form a user one as well. Accessing these controls is a breeze. Thankfully the touch wheel is designed well enough that accidental pressing of a control is unlikely to occur since you have to press down a bit to activate the button. I'd actually like to see the entire iPod line adopt this interface.<p>Some people complain that the iPod mini is only slightly cheaper than the 20 GB iPod and offers a lot less storage space. But what you loose in storage space you gain in portability. It is also important to consider that compared to other players of its size and weight, the iPod mini offers much more storage space, many more features, and a better music jukebox in iTunes 4.0.<p>I want to carry the most music I can in the smallest possible device that offers the best interface and features. For me, that device is unquestionably the iPod mini. If you have similar demands of a portable music device, the iPod mini is sure to become a permanent accessory to your lifestyle.

<Content>I've had many mp3 players, but this is my first Ipod.  I'm very satisfied with the product.  It's the perfect size for strapping to your arm and going jogging.  No skipping whatsoever.  The optional armband is very comfortable too.  My only complaints are that is doesn't include an FM radio and the earbuds are of low quality.  I picked up some Sony MDR-E828LP for $11.00 which sound great.  I can store about 650 songs on mine, which is a decent amount.  I also like the fact that you can illuminate the lcd display so that people can see you jogging at night.  I've owned mine for a little over 3 months now with no problems.

<Title>Amazing little machine
<Date>Tue Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>One of the biggest surprises with this product is how small it actually is. I've had lighters that were bigger than this ipod. The click wheel is significantly better than the original ipod and the software is roughly similar to that which apple has produced before. Any one who has used the ipod mini's big brother will feel right at home. The finish of the product is excellent and even though I was worried about the gold color (so 1970s'), it does mean I can actually find the device when I'm digging around in my bag. The battery life is also slightly better than I expected (6 hrs), but those on cross crounty trips might want to consider getting a powerplug for the car's lighter-socket.

<Date>Sun Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had my little iPod mini for about a week, and was quite impressed with its capibilites. It took me a bit to ajust to the ClickWheel, but once you got used to it it was quite useful. Unfortunatly for me, I accidently dropped it while running for my life in a rain storm and it fell in a puddle. It might have been submerged for about 6 seconds, but all its done since is flicker occasionaly and wont charge anymore. The funny thing is my computer still recognizes when its plugged in. All in all, for the little more than a week I had it, I'd like to say that this iPod preformed very well. Just dont get it wet.

<Title>Really cool, better than the big iPod
<Date>Wed Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>For my birthday, i wanted this really bad. It was out of stock every where in MD, so my mom got the 15g iPod, but i still had my name on a waiting list for an iPod mini and ended up getting both. For 2 days, i had both, and i was really torn on which one to keep. The big iPod is only cool because it had more space. i dont like the touch sensitive buttons; the press buttons on the mini respond better. I only have 2.4 gb of music. but being able to back up my computer on the 15 gb iPod would be cool, like in run away jury, i could erase my computer of sensitive material in case some1 was going to sack my house and computer. But as it turns out, i dont have highly clasified material on my comp, so i would never use it. so i ended up keeping the mini because i still have room to expand my music collection and it fits in my hand a lot better and it is a lot better for running with because its lighter and smaller.

<Title>cutest thing EVER!!
<Date>Wed Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>i sold my old klunker of an ipod (first generation, 10GB) on the internet in order to make way for this one...it is so much smaller and lighter, i love it!  sure, it holds less songs, but does that really matter?  how many can you listen to in one sitting, anyway?  the pink color is SO CUTE!!!!!!  i love the free laser engraving option they have through the apple website.  <p>i also got the armband for working out, and it was worth every penny of the $30 price.  i had a really tough time running with my old one because of it's size/weight, but the armband offers a very stable, secure means of carrying it along!  i also got an auto adaptor (cassette type) which works great.  the only thing i need to get is a case, because i don't want it to get scratched...it looks like it could be scratched quite easily.  the other thing is that it turns on by itself when in your purse or backpack, just because of the button design (if it hits something it gets bumped on).  that gets annoying because it wears your battery down, but if you had a hard case i am sure that would take care of the problem.  However then it wouldn't look as cool.  <p>i would definitely recommend this to everyone, even current ipod owners, the old ones are just too big (plus it's cheaper).  the armband is worth every penny and you should also get a case to protect the beautiful finish.

The sound quality is superb, it is small and light (for a player with a hard drive), and itunes is really great.  I only have two gripes about it.  When I was first learning how to use it, I had a rather difficult time setting everything up.  Other than that, it is way too expensive!  Still this is a very good mp3 player.  Congrats, apple.

<Title>Too expensive
<Date>Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Apple has a habit of making things so cute you don't realize you're paying out the nose for them. I like their machines, they always seem to work well and are relativly easy to get the hang of. But why oh why would you pay so much for a mini when you can get more than 3 times more space for not much more money. Cuteness and size isn't worth the price tag on this one.I was hoping they were making something for those who can't afford an iPod, but no luck, if you can't afford an iPod you can't afford a mini either. Add it to your wish list and hope somebody loves you.

But if you are like me and prefer functionality over appearance and size, get the iRiver iHP 120, it's only $50 more, but has a LCD remote, is the SAME size as a regular iPod, is 20GB, has FM tuner, microphone, is a TRUE hard drive player, AND has 16 hour battery life.

<Title>Elegant &amp; Sleek, BUT
<Date>Sun Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased the 10GB iPod a year ago and recently purchased the 4Gb mini iPod. The price (for both iPods) are quite high but with the low supply and outrageous demand, what else do you expect? Now, when I first opened the box and got started, I was required to install the CD that comes with it along with either iTunes or Musicmatch. I decided to go with MusicMatch b/c it came with my Dell pc. Saving my CDs to my cpu harddrive,  saving the playlist, connecting and loading the iPod window, and transfering the music+previous installation took at least an hour. If you're buying this as a present, be aware that a computer illiterate person will have trouble with this. Besides that, I REALLY recommend buying some type of case (preferrably the ones that allow you to use it without taking it in and out of the case repetitively) because they get dirty and scratched FAST with the average wear&amp;tear.

<Title>reset+reset+reset = iDud mini
<Date>Sun Jun 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My Ipod mini was given to me for my birthday in May, 2004. Almost one month and two returns to AppleCare, I still do not have a properly functioning mini. I have heard the warnings about the problems that are typical to the mini yet I thought it wouldn't happen to me. When I first got it, it seemed to work fine, however it froze after the first ten minutes of use. My friends who also have iPods told me that this was normal. Then it happened every time I used it. AppleCare suggested that I reset the device when that happens. The problem was that I was resetting it constantly (and losing the music in the device). Other problems soon followed. My unit could not recognize being charged or the music in my Itunes library. I was getting strange icons on the screen that weren't in the User's Guide (and only one iPod expert out of the twelve I dealt with knew what the icon meant). I sent it back to Apple once and they said it was fine, apparently looking for a problem unrelated to my unit. I really had to struggle with AppleCare to have them look at it again. They had me reload and update versions of software that didn't help and constantly tried to sell me expensive consumer protection plans. I spent hours on the phone with them. I guess the good people at Apple have a hard time admitting that they too are capable of making a dud, or as I now call my device, an iDud. Now I am waiting for my Ipod to come back from service again. I realize that this is an exception and there are many of you out there who I love your iPods, but if you do get a faulty unit it will be a long and difficult struggle to remedy your situation. In the end, it wasn't worth it. I now just want my device to simply work and the giver of this generous gift to feel happy that he didn't waste his money. Hopefully by my next birthday it will be functioning.

<Title>Great, but some units freeze
<Date>Mon Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got one of these and loved it. It has a scroll wheel that works perfectly, the click buttons are alot better, its small, it holds 1,000 songs, it looks cool, and it doesnt brake or scratch nearly as easy as the big ipod. But alot of people have been saying that their ipod minis have been freezing. Someone told me that the ipods are so popular that apple has been making to many to fast (to restock), wich means they could not do a great job, they dont go over everything good enough. I think that may be true. So when you buy this, you gotta hope it isnt one of the bad ones....<p>Other than that, I love this thing. People say the battery is to short. 8 hours? Its not like your leaving it on all day; when you listen to a cd player, you dont leave it on all day. I also think 1,000 songs is well over enough. When are you gonna listen to all those songs? and if you want more, erase the ones you dont listen to. This thing fits in your pocket PERFECT. Im serious you dont even feel it. Also the colors are awsome. <p>The only problams I have is after awhile of putting it in the dock, the bottam paint wheres off. I hate it. And like I said, people say that their ipods freeze,(not mine). Thats about it.<br>Features:<br>-It has 4 games, brick, solitare, parachute, name that tune.<br>-download audio books (its pretty cool)<br>-1,000 song capacity<br>-time/date<br>-contacts, to-do list, phone #......<p>This player is the only Mp3 you should get. This is the only big company that makes a Mp3 player (besides Dell). I bet most of the ipods work, cause i saw alot of good reviews. These ipod minis are selling like a dvd player for a dollar, so buy one soon. You also might want to get these at a store, cause stores online are selling them for like $300. Amazon has a great price  ( $233 )dont get me wrong, but I heard they wont have any till until October. If you can wait that long than go ahead and buy it here. <p>I forgot to say that this has a usb 2.0 cord ( finally Apple is thinking ) that lets windows users conect their ipods to their computers. The original ipods didnt have this and you had to pay 20 bucks. Also this comes with a belt clip that is usfull, but i dont use it because it will, after about 6 months, take the paint off the ipods sides ( where the clip goes ). Also the ipod use to come with a arm belt thing that goes on your arm, but not anymore.<p>Altogether I have to say you should buy this ipod mini. I think the coolest colors are green and blue, and most girls like pink.....and some guys (no offense). Both the big ipod and mini are awsome, but i preffer the mini. If you like style, size, and looks buy the mini. If you like huge capacity, buy the ipod. But both have awsome sound, and extras. Trust me youll like them, witchever one you buy.

<Title>Smart playlists are the key to the iPod mini
<Date>Wed Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First off, I love the iPod mini. I also own a 30GB iPod and I like the extra capacity to store my entire music collection (about 15GB) and some backup files from the computer. The mini improves on the iPod in some great ways.<p>1) the buttons are integrated into the scroll wheel. You can press the wheel in four directions to skip tracks, pause, etc. This works perfectly and makes it much easier to use with one hand (the regular iPod has four buttons arranged above the scroll wheel).<br>2) the size is amazing. It is so small it fits into a pocket, on your belt, or on your arm with the armband accessory and you won't notice it.<p>The smaller capacity might put off some that have large collections. However, the iTunes integration is flawless and the new smart playlist features in iTunes 4.5+ make it really easy to get a good mix of music onto the player. The default playlist that iTunes creates for the iPod mini is heavily weighted towards tracks that are often played and that you've rated high (4 or 5 stars). This might get repetitive for some people. You can create your own smart playlist in iTunes to get a better mix of songs that you like, songs that you haven't heard in a while, and new music. Create four playlists that look something like...<p>1) &quot;rating is more than 2 stars selected by highest rating and limit to 1.5 GB &quot;<br>2) &quot;most recently played is more than 2 weeks sorted by least recently played and limit to 1GB&quot;<br>3) &quot;select by most recently added and limit to 1GB&quot;<br>4) &quot;playlist is 1, 2, and 3 select by random&quot;<p>Now set iTunes to sync playlist 4 and you'll have 3.5GB of music that is a random mix of music you like, music you haven't listened to in a while, and music new to your collection. You can use the extra 500MB to sync other playlists to the iPod as well (many of those songs might be in the your smart playlist anyways). You can obviously name the playlists anything you like and play around with the settings to tweak them to your hearts content. Playing around with these features is part of what makes the iPod mini so fun to use! You'll absolutely love it.

<Title>Nice, But Flawed
<Date>Wed Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I use my Ipod mini with a PC and have had it since launch.  First of all, its a nice design that can't be argued. Apple has put some nice touches on it. It includes Itunes as well. Of course the MINI could be better.  Battery life is good. But there are some flaws that make this MP3 player not so desirable.<p>Flaws:<br>1) The first night I took my Mini home, it froze, as I'm sure many of you have read about already.  I freaked out and it took me a while to figure out how to reset it.  It still occasionally freezes and although I can fix it quickly, I always get nervous..&quot;What if my songs DID get deleted?&quot;<p>2) The 'On The Go' Playlist is odd. You can only add songs, but you can't edit that playlist.  If you don't like one part of it, your forced to delete the entire playlist or live with it. <p>3) One of the most major flaws I encountered was recently I noticed that you CANNOT transfer songs from my ipod to your PC. I even downloaded the upgrade Itunes 4.6 and it still did this. You are only limited to burn songs to your ipod.  This can be very frustrating if you want to switch songs from one computer to the other using your Ipod, because you can't do it!  I was very surprised about this. <p>4) Price and Value. This is an Apple Product. It is expensive, hands down, and worst of all, it only has 4 gb compared to the 20 gb available by other companies nowadays. <p>If you are a sentimental person and will get joy out of the product just by listening songs that make you smile, then this will work fine.  But so will any other MP3 player.

<Title>The IPOD can do more than what Apple tries to let you
<Date>Wed Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my IPOD Mini (from Circuit City) for about a week and I have to say it is an excellent product.  I do have a library that is larger than what the Mini can hold but I only listen to a portion of it often and that portion fits on the Mini perfectly.  I started with 128kbps ACC and then tried 96kbps and I could not hear the difference.  So now I have 96kbps on the Mini and it holds so many hours of music that you can listen continuously for a couple of weeks (working time).<p>Here is the first thing every user should do.  Download the latest Apple firmware, I think it is 1.1.  My IPOD Mini came with 1.0.  The update gets rid of many freezing issues.<p>Apple says a lot of thing canot be done on the IPOD Mini but you can actually do.<p>To &quot;Nice, But Flawed&quot;<p>Yes, you can transfer songs from the IPOD Mini to the computer.  If you enable disk use then you can use Windows Explorer to see all the songs on the Mini and copy them onto your computer.  There are also some freeware letting you do this but they really are not required.<p>To &quot;Violates first rule of peripherals&quot;<p>The IPOD Mini works perfectly with the slow (1.1) USB port and that is what I have on my Thinkpad T23 and use.  It charges and downloads just fine.  However, if you want to load all 3.7GB of song in one shot, it is a bit slow with USB 1.1.  I like manual methods so I just drag one playlist at a time and USB 1.1 is fast enough.<p>Now I do not carry my Pocket PC with me anymore because I have all my contacts loaded onto the Mini.   Although I can not make entries in the Mini, this is a great convenience for me.<p>I gave it a 4 stars becasue there are rooms for improvements.  For example, I hear pops and clicks if I tried to adjust volume or fast forward to a partin of a song when a song is being played with EQ on.  So I have EQ off now.  I think there are two factors to this problem. One is software.  Apple may come up with another formware update to solve this.  The other is simply what the Mini has in processing power.  On your computer you can try to have iTunes open and playing a song.  Then you try to open and close other software suxh as browsers, MS Word, etc.  You will hear the same pops and clicks when you do that.  That is caused by insufficeint processor power to maintain the songs being played smoothly because much of the process power is being used for opening other programs.

<Title>Perfect for most users
<Date>Fri Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>While the 15gb Ipod is only slightly more expensive, drwing many customers away from the mini, very few people actually use the additional 11 gb. This product is the perfect capacity for most people. I am fully aware that you can get a 4gb player from Creative for about $50 less, but it lacks many key features that make the ipod mini stand out. For example, the MuVo2 has a tiny screen, and no convenient click wheel. <p>Other companies may make larger MP3 players that cost much less, but they lack some of the cool and useful features that only apple provides.<p>There are some compatibility issues involving people with older PCs, and I have one thing to say to those complainers who bought them:  READ THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ON THE BOX, STUPID!!!!

<Date>Sat Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I know that is not very comparable, but I have never been so much satisfied with an audio player as I had with the Ipod Mini<p>Bottom Line: Ver easy to use and navigate through a lot of songs, any playey out there navigates songs as good, 4 gigs are totally enough for anyone's favorite music, anyone can like more than 800 songs at the sama time!!, Itunes software is awesome, I even use it before buying my Ipod. <p>It's true you can not download songs to tje computer but there are free applications that can do that. Just visit versiontracker and look for it. <p>I travel a lot, and I know I would not be able to lve w/o it.

<Content>The iPod Mini is perfect for me. The size makes it perfect to wear on my arm while exercising. The Mini is incredibly durable. Even when running on the treadmill it never skips. And it really is so tiny that it never gets in the way.<p>I love that I can search through all the different bands, albums and songs with little effort. The click wheel is incredibly easy to use and get used to. Not to mention how cute the pink finish is. In fact, all my friends are jealous of it!

<Title>Very Satisfied
<Date>Sun Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just purchased a silver iPod Mini and so far I love it. This is my first attempt at anything to do with digital music, so I asked all my friends and family for recommendations. They all said that the iPod was the only way to go. I opted for the Mini version because my CD collection isn't really big and with a thousand song capacity, this little thing might just hold it all.<p>I was intimidated at first, but figured out rather easily how to load my music onto the iPod. It is surprisingly easy to use! The dial is a great way to scroll through my song library and it is really easy to pull up the albums you want to hear. I am also really impressed with the headphones that came with the iPod, such great sound quality!<p>All in all, I am very happy with this purchase. In fact, the hardest part of my iPod purchase was deciding on which color to pick!

<Title>Impressive Little Gizmo!!
<Date>Tue Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Weighing in at 3.6 ounces, count me in on early adoption of this technology. Whether you're a Mac lover or a PC fanatic (I own a PC), you'll surely enjoy the Apple iPod Mini.<p>Let me just say even the packaging is an artistic wonder. Once you open the box, you are greeted by all white carton that separates to reveal the word &quot;enjoy&quot;. That's it--Apple credits on one side and &quot;enjoy&quot; on the other.It is a thing of beauty!<br> <br>Here are a couple reasons:<p>-4GB of storage (that's about 1000 songs)<br>-8 hour battery life<br>-Calendar, Contacts, and even GAMES are included(!)<br>-Sleek, simple design is small yet flashy<br>-Complete with iTunes software<p>I was looking for an alternative to installing an expensive MP3 deck in my car. I even tried to quench my audiophile thirst with XM Radio. No avail. Good programming, but it didn't draw from my own personal pool of music. I decided I wanted something portable, an MP3 player. But not just any player! A robust machine, worthy of holding my CD collection.<p>I made the mistake of paying exorbinant S&amp;H fees to an Ebay seller. However, even after paying way more than necessary and waiting way too long, I've found my iPod Mini to be indespensable!!

<Title>A mini Revolution!
<Date>Fri Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod mini is built from the ground up as a portable device for people with fast-paced lives. It's small and lightweight physical dimensions are perfectly suited to be being placed in a pants or shirt pocket without being a burden.<p>But don't let its light weight fool you into thinking the iPod mini is a pushover. The 4GB hard drive (3.7 GB actual) can hold about 1,000 songs - enough to last almost three full days. The installed software includes four games; a calendar; a notepad; a contact database; a clock; backlight with timer; an alarm clock; and the abilities to customize the main menu; create on-the-go playlists; and rate songs. All this is in addition to being able to be used as an external hard drive!<p>However, the most revolutionary aspect of the iPod mini (aside from it's size and weight) is its control interface. Incorporating the 'Menu', 'Pause/Play', 'Forward' and 'Back' buttons directly to the touch sensitive scroll wheel not only creates simplicity from a design standpoint, but form a user one as well. Accessing these controls is a breeze. Thankfully the touch wheel is designed well enough that accidental pressing of a control is unlikely to occur since you have to press down a bit to activate the button. I'd actually like to see the entire iPod line adopt this interface.<p>Some people complain that the iPod mini is only slightly cheaper than the 20 GB iPod and offers a lot less storage space. But what you loose in storage space you gain in portability. It is also important to consider that compared to other players of its size and weight, the iPod mini offers much more storage space, many more features, and a better music jukebox in iTunes 4.0.<p>I want to carry the most music I can in the smallest possible device that offers the best interface and features. For me, that device is unquestionably the iPod mini. If you have similar demands of a portable music device, the iPod mini is sure to become a permanent accessory to your lifestyle.

<Title>Great little gadget, but earbuds could be better
<Date>Tue Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had mine for about a week now, and it's pretty spiffy. I don't have High Speed USB on my PC, but my Audigy has a Firewire port in the back, and I can transfer a track in a couple seconds. If your computer has &quot;USB 2.0,&quot; that doesn't necessarily equal 480mbps Hi Speed USB--it only garantees a minumum of 12mbps. You might need to get a PCI card for that, but they're relatively cheap. (Keep in mind that the Mini, unlike the 15GB iPod, comes with a USB cable). There's also free 3rd-party software you can get to transfer from the iPod to a PC. Actually, there's a *lot* of 3rd-party software, a factor a lot of people might not consider when comparison shopping. Check out ipodlounge.com some time and see what I mean.<p>The reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the earbuds aren't all that great, and they really need a shirt clip. I was told to check out headphone.com for alternative suggestions, but your mileage may vary. Also, you can't create custom EQ levels, from what I can tell.

<Date>Wed Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>From the moment you open the box till the final song you hear, the iPod is an experience unlike any other.  When I first got thing, I sat down and opened up what was to be the best 250 bucks i've ever spent.  After sliding off the cover and opening the two halves of the cubic box, there is one word on the inside cover, &quot;Enjoy.&quot;  And thats what I've been doing ever since.  This thing is an absolute joy to use!<p>However, many people complain about the 4gb space and how for only $50 more you can get more than twice the space.  However, all of you should stop and take a look at how much space you really are using.  2gigs?  4gigs?  500mb?  Come on, only a small percentage of you actually have more than 5gb of music on your computer.  And even if you have 50gb of music, will you actually listen to ALL of it before listening to the same song twice?  I think not.  When I bought this, a friend of mine with a 10gb iPod laughed at me and said, &quot;What a waste of money.  You could of gotten so much more space for only a little bit more money.&quot;  Okay, that is true.  But after looking at his iPod, he only had 2GB of music on it!  This example, I belive, is the truth for most (but not all) the music lovers out there.  We need a reality check everyone...<p>And here it is:  4gb is about 3 days STRAIGHT listening to music.  If you happen to listen to all 4gb of music and get tired, simply hook it back up to your computer and get a fresh set of music.  Not too difficult, huh? You just saved yourself 50 bucks.<p>The truth is, if YOU like the iPod mini, then YOU buy it.  Who cares if your friends with the regular iPods make fun of you?  You know that deep down inside, they really envy your mini.  Yours is smaller, lighter, more scratch-resistant, easier to use, has a longer battery (in most cases), comes with a USB 2.0 cable, and is cheaper.  And lets not forget the coolness factor, which simply dominates all other music players on the market today.  But whatever model you choose, you can't go wrong with an iPod.

<Title>Good luck actually getting one from Amazon
<Date>Fri Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I placed my order for an iPod mini here on Amazon on March 14th.  Original expectation for delivery was end of April which then became mid-May, end of May and now -- October 6th!?!?  I know these are hot items, but 7 months lead time is absurd.  If they don't have them (and aren't getting them) it would seem that they should stop taking orders.  It is now July 8th so who knows, as we get closer to October they may push the date back yet again to December or January - so much for planning ahead to have one for my wife's birthday which was mid-May, who would have guessed that eight weeks wouldn't have been enough back then.  Note that I HAVE NOT made any changes to my order which would impact a change in expected delivery date.  A few weeks ago they did make the minor consolation of upgrading me to 2-day shipping (from super saver) but to be honest, if I'm waiting 6-8 months, do I care about another 2-3 days of delivery time?    Hopefully I can update this review when (or should I say if) I get the iPod mini.  ------  Update:  I received the iPod mini on July 21st - only four months from order to delivery, definitely the slowest experience I've ever had with Amazon.  The iPod itself is great, good OS, clear screen - battery life is a bit weak - around 3-4 hours - but I suppose what else do you expect in such a small package.  The included iTunes software is horrific, nowhere near as intuitive as musicmatch jukebox which came with our first generation iPod.  All in all, a great device - just watch out for Amazon taking orders that they may not be able to fulfill!

<Date>Tue Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a nice product but the frenzy over it is really uncalled for.  The price, at $250, is really expensive.  I guess if you keep supplies artificially low, have a good marketing dept, and send free samples to all those monkeys at those tech websites to create a &quot;buzz&quot;, then you can justify this price. Anyhow, I shouldn't even complain as I got this free. My girlfriend won it at a conference.  <p>There are a few things that you should consider before getting this puppy.  The battery life is NOT as advertised.  My Ipod has never lasted more than 5 hours.  The second thing is that iTune is hard to use.  It is a bit counter intuitive compared to other similar programs out there.  There are better programs out there that you can download. <p>Save your money.  Don't be a sheep.

<Content>I ordered 1 from amazon and I am waiting for about 60 days and they expect to ship it in October of 04. Bought 2 ugly blue ones at another online site and I am having a nightmare with it. It skips like crazy when working out and even after a full days charge dies in battery time after 2hrs of use. The color shading is also strange , it differs from top to bottom. Also the quality of the sound seems poor with the default headphones. I purchased some fontopia ones and it seems clearer. The second mini which was a present was DOA, and calling apple did not help as they want to replace it with a refurb.

<Title>A wonderful gizmo with a sophisticated character!
<Date>Mon Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Here in Kuwait, I was lucky enough to obtain a mini before it was even available outside the US where it was in such a heavy demand that purchasers had to patiently wait for their units. I would have waited and waited for such a little marvel. The iPod changes how, where and when I choose to listen; all of which maximizes my enjoyment of the music. I noticed that my music purchases immediately are sampled and compressed on the computer and uploaded to the iPod. I need not experience the music on my Hi Fi anymore. The assurance delivered by the sheer amount of music available in this little package (about 3-solid days worth of music on the mini) satisfies my every mood. With a few turns and clicks, I switch from Joaquin Rodrigo to Philip Glass to the Beatles to Sinatra to Santana ... All good music, all the time, anytime and anywhere. Delivered courtesy of a little piece of technology that is packaged like a work of art. This little device has a character of its own - something other electronic music players lack.

<Title>The #1 Digital Music Player
<Date>Tue Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Since the inception of the digital music craze, I have owned several portable MP3 players, but always resisted the urge to purchase an Ipod. I always thought I could get the same value and quality with a lesser-known or cheaper player. Boy was I wrong. I recently received the Ipod Mini as a gift, and I have no idea how I ever got along without it. The small, lightweight, compact design is perfect for the music lover on the go. With the included belt clip, or the neoprene armband (sold separately) you can take your music virtually anywhere. I use it when working out, working in the yard, washing the car, or when I just want to relax. The thumb wheel makes using the Mini a breeze and takes no time at all to get used to. Organizing and transferring music is a snap using the included Itunes software, and if you are like me you could use a little help getting all of your titles organized. The Mini also has several extras you might enjoy such as an address book, alarm clock, and a few games. The backlit display is bright and easy to read. My favorite little perk of the Mini is that you don?t have to worry about wasting your battery while you are transferring your songs or data because the Mini will actually charge itself while connected to your PC if you are using a USB2.0 or Firewire port.  Overall my impressions of the Ipod Mini are very positive and this is without a doubt the best digital music player I have ever owned.  Pros: Small, Compact, and Lightweight Effortless Navigation Fast Data Transfer (USB 2.0 or FireWire) Great storage capacity (4GB) for such a small player Very Good sound quality Bright Backlit Display Battery will charge while you are transferring data (USB 2.0 or Firewire) Tons of available accessories Will play nearly any music format Available in several colors  Cons: Supplied Ear Buds are uncomfortable and do have great sound quality Too hard to obtain (lead times running as long as 6 weeks)

<Title>A &quot;must read&quot; ipod mini review
<Date>Thu Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my silver ipod mini at Target for $249.00. It truly is a great machine if you want to keep music, notes, contacts and play games. My sister(ipod mini blue) and I both have one and they've work out great except one time my sister's wouldnt turn on it just kept showing the apple so we reset it after reading the manual and we reset it and everything was fine. NOTE: Always read the manual if there is a problem! Some people complain that it crashes their PC or blacks out, well, I'm not saying its true, but maybe it's because they didn't read the manual or it could be that their ipod IS screwed up. So when your bored or something just flip through the manual and see if there's anything important you need to know its worth fifteen minutes of reading to have a whole lot more time enjoying your ipod mini without any flaws. Another thing is that if your looking at reviews to buy an ipod mini (which you probably are) don't just buy one or make your parents buy one for you, research the product it's a big investment especially for a kid. At least read 10 reviews before purchasing (I did) even short reviews count or go to apple.com to view accessories and ipods. I recommend buying yours at CompUSA if you want to get it fast and with accessories and they have great customer service there. Amazon is good if you only want the ipod and if you don't mind waiting and I'm pretty sure they don't have accessories (my mistake if they do). But amazon is great for low prices and other stuff but I wouldn't recommend it for ipods. Anyway when you first get your ipod DON'T throw the box away unless you already have a carrying case because this will work as a safe, sturdy, temporary carrying case until you find another safe carrying case I know this is a sturdy product but accidents happen and there goes $250 down the drain. !CAUTION!: Do not buy for people who are erresponsible people who might break or lose the ipod mini. The ipod mini has its pros and cons but those pros and cons are for you to find out and I think my fingers are going to fall off so

<Title>I dig it!
<Date>Fri Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content><p>I ordered my green iPod mini from Amazon in mid-July and, much to my surprise, it arrived on my doorstep a mere three business days later! I was totally prepared to wait months, but this was awesome! After reading previous reviews, I made sure to charge the mini for a few hours before loading music and had to download a new version of iTunes onto my PC. Still cool. I cautiously picked a couple of CDs from my Musicmatch library and connected the mini. It seriously only took about a minute and a half to load 81 songs! This mini is constantly amazing me! I have not even used a tenth of the memory and cannot wait to load it up. <p>The menus are easy to navigate and the pressure wheel is a hot ticket. The sound is stellar, although the earbuds kind of bother my ears (most do). I have never had the volume up over a third of the way and have been noticing subtleties in some of my favorite songs that I never noticed before - on either the CD or my PC. I am totally in love with my iPod and don't know how I went so long without one before!

<Title>Best thing I own
<Date>Sat Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my iPod Mini since they first started making them, and I totally love it.  It is probably the best thing I own.  It's extremely easy to use whether you have a PC or Mac.  Firewire or USB, it's still awesome.  I love how I can set the alarm to wake me up with a randomized playlist.  Nothing better than that.  Also, it works very nicely with iTrip, which allows me to play songs through a radio frequency (you can choose which frequency, out of all of the possible ones) and it's just totally awesome, very easy to show music to people who don't have speakers with headphone jacks.  I have never regretted this purchase.  I say buy it and be happy again.

<Title>I thought Apple was never suppose to freeze!
<Date>Sun Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my ipod mini two days ago. I charged it the first day and transferred music onto it 4pm the next day. 11pm - it froze. It froze within 12 hours of me getting it! So I had to bust out the manual and hope that I didnt have to wait until the battery ran to use it again, or hope that i didnt have to send it back in cause there's no reset button on it. Luckily after searching a bit I found that you can reset by toggloing the hold button and holding down menu and select for 6 seconds, only it was really hard to do that. Well, the sound quality is much better than my sony mc-p10 and can't hate the size and weight. I have two, a silver and blue, the other one I've had no problems with, but that freezing thing got me a little upset.

<Title>Worth the money
<Date>Mon Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you're on the fence trying to decide whether spending $250 on an ipod is really worth it, I must urge you that it truly is. After pondering day after day about putting down the $$ myself, I decided to go ahead and purchase Apple's premier product. After using the ipod for several months, I've come to appreciate the great extent of the memory as well as its convienently easy-to-use structure. Being a student currently enrolled in summer classes at college, the recording option on the ipod has also been a helpful addition to the multi-purpose music machine. I can go on and on about the other purposes the ipod can serve, but you've probably already read them in the product description. All in all, my advice for those who are unsure that the ipod is worth the $$, is that you will not be dissatisfied with the product.

<Title>Too much BOOM will undoubtedly make you BUST!
<Date>Mon Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>There was a lot of hype coming into the iPod mini. I owned a Rio Nitrus and saw that it had 4 GB and a $250 price tag. I decided to return my Nitrus and take on the mini. I got a silver one. However, the iPod mini was a huge bust and I returned it on Labor Day.  First off, I was impressed by its design. It is very svelte and intuitive. The click wheel is ok but takes some getting used to. Also, there is no dedicated volume button so there is a learning curve to volume control which becomes a major pain. The click wheel is decent but its too easy to over shoot your selections. Also, going through the menus can get tedious sometimes as going back and forth is confusing, plus over shooting the menus happens all the time. iTunes is a good program although I never used the music store. Apart from a few good design and software attributes of the mini, I couldn't find much more to rave about. Now for the cons:  Sound Quality: It is well known that the iPod trails its competitors in the sound quality department, and the mini makes no exception. Sure, if you have never listened to another mp3 player before, it sounds great! That is why you will read these reviews and hear good things about the sound quality. But since I have listened to the two major Sound Quality big boys- Rio and Creative mp3 players, the sound quality was extremely distinguishable, with the iPod sounding flat, not as loud, and base-less, as opposed to the loud, powerful, bass-rich Rio and Creative players. The stock earbuds are bad too. Apple refuses to release their Signal-to-Noise ratio(which is basically how powerful the sound output is), for a good reason at a marketing perspective. Rio and Creative both boast Signal-to-Noise ratios of &#62;(greater than) 95db, which is pretty good. Some 3rd party tests have revealed that the iPod's Signal-to-Noise ratio is &#60;(no more than) 86db. Almost a 10 db difference, which explains the distinguishable sound. The built in EQ hurts the sound quality more than help, since it disorts the sound more than adjust it. The EQ isn't custom, so you are out of luck if none of the presets work for you. None of the presets did a good job of improving the bass. If you want a player that has powerful output with good bass range, avoid the mini.    Battery Life: The rechargeable battery life is inexcusable, considering the amount of money the player costed. The life is advertised at 8 hours, but that is when its EQ is off, volume in the middle, shuffle on and backlight off. When you actually use the click wheel a lot, have the backlight on, fiddle with the player, and have the volume up in the higher range(which you will need to do), you will be getting about 5 hours, 6 is really pushing it. I regularly had to recharge my battery. After 6 months, the battery life started to degrade. The iPod battery is known for its ability to die out, so I knew this was going to happen.   Other minor things have also hurt my experience with the mini. When a song title or album or artist is too long, the iPod mini just centers the text and clips it on the end, which is really unprofessional looking. This is lazy on Apple's part, since its not that hard to do. All other players I have owned can do this. Let's go, Apple. Also, the calender/to-do/address book functions are next-to-useless since they are kind of hard to use, especially with the over sensitive click wheel. The games are ok but nothing that will keep you addicted.  Apple sells its iPod/iPod Mini like hotcakes, so there is no immediate or strong need for them to improve the player. If it weren't selling good, yes, you would see them trying to improve the sound quality, battery life, and execution. However, they really don't care, since they are making loads of money off the product so its not on the top of their priority list. Apple heavily markets/advertises their players and it is really the only player I see advertised. They, along with other media and biased consumer reviews, make it seem like the best player out there but it really isn't when you have had experiences with other players.   On Labor Day I returned my iPod Mini for the Rio Carbon 5GB. It has an extra gigabyte, superior sound quality(only Creative beats it, but hey, Creative makes sound cards), 5 band custom EQ, 14 hours of extra battery life, a slimmer design, a voice recorder, and easier menu navigation(in my opinion) with a more responsive and easier to use jog wheel. It's appearance isn't too bad either. I am extremely happy with my Carbon and I think it is a superior product to the iPod Mini in every aspect. The Carbon is even compatible with iTunes, a huge selling point for the iPod mini! Also compatible with WMP 10 and drag/drop capability, the software edge goes to the Carbon.  The Creative Zen Micro, another 5GB player, has been praised as a good player and although I have not had experience with it, it does look good. It sports an FM tuner, Voice Recorder, and the best sound quality on the market along with 10 colors to choose from. Check it its good review on CNet.  In conclusion, I think the iPod mini was decent at its time until its competition capitalized on the several disadvantages the iPod mini has, making the iPod mini an inferior product in every way. But with no immediate need or desire to improve the performance of the player, and rather just trying to make the cutest mp3 player possible, Apple is not heading in the right direction. This explains the title of this review: Too much BOOM will undoubtedly make you BUST, since its popularity(boom) is so high that it will go bust(not willing to improve it) since it has no need.  I rated this two stars for the following reasons:  + Good design + Durable and strong + Click Wheel is good + Software Package is good(iTunes) + Decent games + Easy navigation once you learn the ropes of it + 4 GB can be a lot for some + 5 colors  - Expensive, bad value - 4GB may not be enough, and there are also 5 GB players out now - No dedicated volume control - Click wheel can be over sensitive - Menu navigation frustrating as you learn to use it - No custom EQ, only presets that disort - Bad included earphones - Sub-par sound quality with a low range of bass, generally flat - Can be louder - Bottom of the barrel battery life, which is inexcusable - Battery gets weaker over time, can go dead after 400-500 charges - No useful extra features FM tuner or Voice Recorder - Tough to use &#34;extras&#34; like Calender or Address Book, better used on a PDA or even yet, Pen and Paper - Apple heading in wrong direction when it comes to improving the player, they just want the best design rather than best performance. A form over function kind of approach. - Too many people have one - Better players of this catergory out there, such as the Rio Carbon or Creative Zen Micro  One sentence summary: If you don't care about sub-par performance on sound from an mp3 player or low battery life, and just want a cute little mp3 player, the iPod mini may be right for you- if you don't like its superior alternatives such as the Rio Carbon or Creative Zen Micro.

In the house...we have seperate computers, I felt bad that she had to lug around a CD player on her arm, that I bought her a pink mini iPod. She was so so SO excited, she ripped the box open, charged it, then installed the software on her computer...3 weeks later...she still loves it, she jogs, runs, and hikes with it on her arm, one day...she even ran in the house telling me to log onto Target.com (We mostly buy all our electronics, furniture, and stuff like that from Target.com) to write a &amp;quot;divine&amp;quot; review, well...here I am. This product is excellent, fun, and holds about 1,000 songs, she has her 80's playlist, I have my rock playlist. (When buying this item...if you are a early morning/late night jogger, purcase the armband, it'll come in handy)    One Punk Rock Kid

<Content>UPS:  This is just a beuatiful item, rugged and well-made, good volume for us hard-of-hearing folks. Saw one in a store and HAD to have one. Amazon said it would ship in 2 months, but the they shipped it in a week! Seems very rugged and fine for running, etc., no skipping.  DOWNS: CONSIDERING THE THEORETICAL WAIT TO GET ONE OF THESE, YOU MIGHT WAIT FOR THE RIO CARBON WHICH SHOULD BE OUT SOON.  MINI's Battery life 8 hours and battery not user replaceable. But I bet by the time I need to replace it they have a 20 hour battery like the new Rio Carbon!  Price is ridiculously high IMHO, and will come down with mfg. costs and competition.  No reason tolower it whenthere are a million idiots like me waiting in line ot pay $250!!!  But the new generation full-size 20gb IPODS and the RIO Carbon have MUCH longer battery life and cost the same more or less. Frankly I was about to cancel my order and wait for the Carbon, which has 5GB, is smaller, has a voice recorder, appears as a UMS device, and has a 20 hr. battery, but my Mini got here b4 I made up my mind for sure. Will be very interested in reading comparative reviews with Carbon when it starts shipping.

<Title>Ipods are soooooo cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Thu Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Ipods are the coolest thing for storing music.You can hold over 1,000 songs!.And you can rate each of your songs and the ipode will tell you what songs are the 90`s.The ipod has four colors pink,green,gold and blue.The cool thing about ipods is that you can charge them and not have to keep buying batteries for your CD player.When you set up your ipod it takes to a web site where you can buy songs for 99 cents!.And also the ipod comes with a clip so you can clip your ipod to your belt and listen to music while you walk.The cost for the ipod may seem high but its worth the money.And also the ipod will tell you when it is low on power a sign with a picture of a battery with low juice will come up and it wont let you listen to music until you charge it for a few hours,After charging your ipod it will last for days.The head phones that come with the ipod are little phones for your ears instead of those big head phones you might use for yourCD player,And the phones are cool because you can put them in your pocket along with your ipod.And the ipod has a light in side the screen so you can listen to your music in the dark.When you get your ipod it may seem confusing SO USE YOUR INSTRUCTION GUIDE!.The ipod comes in a box with every thing you will need to get started.So have fun with your ipod.

<Title>Great fun and ease of use in a perfect little package
<Date>Wed Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my mini just before a road trip and used it with Monster's iCarplay FM transmitter. Amazing! One of the least painful trips in memory!  The mini is the perfect size - not too big - and the anodized aluminum case is durable yet stylin'.   I'm disabled and on multiple medications that mess with my brain's functioning, so I wanted to get something with an ease of use most people probably don't need. (Yes this has been proofread).  Music acts as a distractor against pain on long trips. I also needed something that would satisfy my audiophile's love of good quality sound. Having a poor-sounding MP3 player would actually be worse than none at all! I also wanted to take a good cross-section of my music without having to tote the amount of CDs that would entail.  The mini iPod delivers both effortlessly; my only complaint with it is that I rather underestimated the amount of GB my CD collection takes up!

<Content>Boy, I love this thing. I got mine from Amazon a few months ago, and it's firmly armbanded and functioning wonderfully. Amazon shipped (using Circuit City) quickly, perfectly, as usual.  Short list of why it is so great: The iPod is so intuitive to use a monkey could work it easily; The controls work at a light, gentle touch, making it perfect for those with handicap issues; It sounds great; The earpieces fit in my ears, actually; iTunes has thousands of songs online for download for cheap; it is sooooo easy to organize your songs via iTunes and then get your playlists into your iPod; I have XP and have had ZERO problems; It is beautiful; An armband is available, if you have body issues with having it in your hand or on your waist; It holds a LOT of tunes, yet is a very nice size and a convenient shape.  The two top reasons I personally recommend it over other products: it is easy to use and intuitive to use, in almost every way; it is drop-dead gorgeous. There are tons of players out there that sound fine. Get one that you will love. Get an iPod. Trust me - it is worth every penny. After my cats, I'd grab it were I escaping a fire.

<Title>The gadget of the decade
<Date>Sun Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I wouldn't go as far as Will Smith to hail the iPod as "the gadget of the century'", but certainly the iPod mini, along with my new Apple Powerbook, is one of the loveliest electronics gadgets I've owned over the last decade.   Since my aging Dell laptop was dying, I considered buying an external hard disk to secure my data to a new machine. Then it occurred to me that I might as well invest in the iPod to do the transfer and enjoy music at the same time. I checked both 20G white iPod and pink-colored mini at the Apple Store in SoHo. The choice was obvious: the mini had so appealing design and form factor that I couldn't resist it despite insufficient storage - my music library is about 5Gb and still growing.   It was a pleasant experience just to open the cube-shaped package, something I never felt with Dell, IBM, and even Sony. - Mini comes with both USB and Firewire (so does the new 20Gb iPod), works with both my old PC as well as Apple Powerbook - so much for blaming Apple for its closed architecture.  - Sound quality is good, especially with AAC music format. I agree with many people  that AAC offers better quality than MP3 and WMV. - I crammed about 800 songs into Mini's 4Gb storage. Once you start building the music library, it starts growing quickly. The rumor has it that Toshiba's new 6Gb disk may be used in the next generation mini. Any increase would be welcome. - The mini got hung up several times and I had to "reboot", but the problem disapppeared after the recent iPod software upgrade. - Battery doesn't last for 8 hours as Apple claims. Especially when I skip/fast-forward songs often, it consumes more power. I'd say 4-5 hours, based on my experience.   In conclusion, the mini has a trade-off compared with the white iPod. You sacrifice storage and battery power for a charming design and a petite form factor. If you need more than 10Gb storage, it's better off to get the 20Gb iPod.   iPods come with higher price tags than players from Dell and Rio. But I'm willing to pay a premium for Apple striving for design and engineering perfection.   iPod has changed my perception of music listening once and forever. It's mind-boggling that I can carry my entire music collection wherever I go, in a gadget as small as a business card. Another score for Jobs & Co.  p.s.) Having said all the good stuff about ipod, I admit that nowadays I try to stay away from it, at least when I need to get work done. Otherwise, endless sweet melody, one after another, would put me into a serious sugar coma for the whole day...

<Title>Lots of little bugs, but still love it!
<Date>Tue Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I believe that Apple released the mini a little too soon - certainly before it was able to work out a lot of the bugs.  However, I was dying to get one, and probably wouldn't have waited even if I was aware of the bugs!  I love the size!  It fits into the tiniest of purses, and travels with me wherever I go...For me, the storage is more than sufficient, as I already have over 350 songs stored, and haven't even filled a third of my memory yet!  The bugs are a little disappointing, but are not serious...I have to "reboot" it at least once a week.  We all have to reboot our computers from time to time, but I was surprised to have this problem with the mini only weeks after I got it.  My songs "disappear" from time to time, but I'm able to get them back by rebooting 4-6 times.  If you can wait for the mini, I would hold out at least another year...by then I should hope that Apple can figure it out!

<Title>Don't let others talk you out of this - It is this best!
<Date>Wed Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'm a techno guy and have a lot of gadgets, but this is the best that I have had.  It even has me thinking about switching over to apple/mac stuff.  It works and does every thing I want it to do the way that I want it to.  I like to use audible.com and they give you $100 credit toward an mini-ipod with a year membership.  I love that I can fit all my audio books on this thing and not even think about space.  I've had it for a week and it just works really well.  And the controls are just fun to use.  Fun and works great, get it and enjoy the cutting edge of portable players.

<Title>I love my mini
<Date>Thu Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased the Ipod mini a few weeks ago and let me tell you, this is my third MP3 player (the first two being from Rio). I love this thing. I bought the one in silver instead of the other colors because silver happens to be my favorite color.   Anyway, even though I only have almost 170 songs on the Ipod mini, I cannot complain at all. Hopefully I will be loading up some more songs on the mini soon. I love the EQ features and you can also change the EQ on the songs in Itunes (which comes with the mini). The only small complaint I have is the battery life. I don't use the backlight often but I do find myself charging it every now and then. I will definitely think about purchasing the Apple Protection Plan in case something goes wrong with the battery or something but for now, I am so in love with the Ipod mini that I don't want any other MP3 player out there. Sure, it may set you back about $250.00, but the warranty coverage is better than Rio, the customer service is better than Rio and if you have an Apple store near you, you can easily take your Ipod to a tech and they will do whatever they can to fix your problem.  So for those who want an MP3 player, I highly recommend the Ipod mini. It's a great investment and it is worth every penny.

<Title>Apple Did It Again!
<Date>Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When Apple came out with the IPod, it significantly improved the quality of the digital lifestyle. They again made the best MP3 player on the planet even better when they added more choices of the iPod, increasing battery life and storage capacity. Now with the mini iPod, they have achieved in shrinking the best MP3 player down to the size of a credit card without taking away any of the original iPods features. Although this may be expensive vs. the new 15 GB iPod, if you have the money, grab one while you can. The sound quality is excellent, the mini has all features packed into a tiny size that is great for someone who does not need to use it as a backup drive to hold all their photos, etc. It has more than enough room to hold your music. If you don't care about paying this much, you can't go wrong. Apple did it again!!!!

<Title>Some will love it - some won't understand why it even exists
<Date>Sat Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPoD Mini is the new, smaller, snazzier version of the iPod, for those of you who don't know that already. Its capacity is also considerably smaller.<p>Hence, the great debate kicks off: what's more important, the aesthetic or the capacity?<p>Many people are bashing this product because the 15GB iPod costs only $49 more. Why would you pay, they ask, so much for an mp3 player that holds so little? And when larger capacity models are so readily available?<p>Well, think about a couple of things: how much music do you really listen to on a daily basis? A weekly basis? I've got 40 or 50 gigs of music on my computer, but there are maybe 400 or 500 songs that I actually _like_ and want to listen to on a regular basis. I've got a first generation 5GB player and have never really felt the need to have more capacity because it's so easy to add and remove songs whenever. It's fine if you want to carry your entire music library around with you all the time, like you're going on a long, long trip somewhere, but it's not really necessary.<p>The second, and most important thing, is how it looks and feels. I just got my hands on one, and it's a pretty neat little thing. It's not actually that much smaller in terms of raw numbers, but it FEELS a whole lot smaller. Like cell phones, minute changes in size become exponentially more noticeable as the products get smaller overall. The Minis are scratch-resistant and the aluminum is nice -- no greasy fingerprints like on the regular iPods. There are also many nice colors and the screen is brighter.<p>The buttons: I can't stand the touch buttons on the 2nd and 3rd generation iPods. I like my 5GB because you actually push the button and feel it click. For whatever reason, I take pleasure in this. The Mini combines the two -- it has a touch wheel with push buttons under it. In my opinion, this is great. I like the fact that they've brought back push buttons.<p>Over time, the price will most likely go down and capacity increase. In the meantime, this is a product for people who place importance on how things look. I mean really -- why do people buy little, expensive cars, or cell phones, or designer handbags or whatever? Because they like how they look and feel. I completely understand people who would rather buy a regular iPod but I understand the market for the Minis as well. It's a great product.

<Title>3.5 Stars actually. Great but still far from perfection.
<Date>Sat Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Before buying, do research. Google for ipod dirty secret. Other must see venues are ipodlounge and macfixit.<p>Anyone buying any kind of ipod should be wary of the battery. Is apple purposely making these batteries irreplacable so that they eventually wear out? Very shady...<p>On the plus side, it's everything you loved about the regular ipod, but in a smaller size. The storage capacity is enough for most casual buyers, but very pricey (time magazine reports the profit from one ipod sale around $170US). If it were any cheaper, it would kill the sales of the regular ipods. The itunes software is actually more impressive than the device itself. I cannot emphasize that enough.<p>More critically speaking.... <p>WHY no radio tuner? Especially at this price! It would be so simple to add one too. Radio is essential for NPR, BBC or your local public radio station for news. <p>The earbuds are actually kind of large, and were painful to keep and remove from my ears after less than an hour of usage. And why no button or dial on the unit itself to control the volume directly? The reason is to make you buy the wired remote with volume control and pause/play buttons, for $40US. And why the strange adapter on the bottom to connect to your computer? Surely they could have put USB or 1394 (firewire) ports on the device itself. The reason is to make you buy their proprietary cables if you ever lose them or need extras.<p>The click wheel is a very good idea, but it somehow feels kind of cheap and chalky to the touch. Undoubtedly, the button labels will scratch off with use and the wheel is still (over)sensitive as ever. Grazing over the wheel to reach and press the wheel in for the buttons, it can scroll accidentally much the same way many laptop owners move the mouse trackpad while they are typing.<p>The address book, calendar and PDA functions only work with Apple computers with OS 10 ical and addressbook. If you have a Palm Pilot of some kind with palm desktop, you need palm2ipod, which a hobbyist created. This utility only exports palm desktop calendar and address book so far (no &quot;to do&quot; list or notepad yet). Ideally, Apple should create this kind of support for PC users, not some grassroots DIY movement.<p>The belt clip that it comes with is a plastic shell with a dot of rubber behind it to help keep it in place. It snaps in from the top, and feels somewhat secure. I could see it loosening and being unusable after some time of being snapped in and out constantly. <p>The unit itself feels very sturdy, almost like I could stand on it without breaking it. It is actually much heavier than it looks. It's not too small, where it would be really easy to lose (and people lose their cell phones and keys all the time). The texture is a matte finish that does not glare and get smudgy fingerprints all over it. I wouldn't trust it on a jog or workout at the gym, since it has moving parts that could potentially be damaged. When will ipods be totally shockproof and waterproof?<p>The LCD screen is a little bigger than most cell phone screens, and readability will vary by person. In light of that, the &quot;Now Playing&quot; view, does not display the name of the album. The backlight only lights up the screen but very nicely so.<p>If this device is the best of it's kind (it is), then the competition is really, really awful.

<Title>Incredible
<Date>Sat Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Wow.<p>The iPod experience starts when you open the box.  No scissors needed.  No hacking away at steel-like plastic.  I slide the cover off the cube, and open it up.  Sitting there is the most beautiful device I've ever seen.  This is the porche of MP3 players.  It is nothing short of gorgeous.  Beautiful, very functional, and EXTREMELY well thought out.  You can TELL someone was thinking when they designed this thing.  You turn it on.  Immediatly you have quick access via the very-cool click-wheel to 3 fun games (4 once you load the music) and an empty calendar (which can be filled from calendar files from many major calendar apps, including MS Outlook).  You can also customize all sorts of settings.<p>The mini seems extra beautiful in the dark, with the bright backlight glowing.<p>iTunes is undoubtedly the best music management software out there.  Its better than Real, MusicMatch, I've tried them all, and iTunes BLOWS them away.  Its simple, functional, beautiful, and makes sense----like the iPod.  They sync in perfect rythem.  iTunes transfered my songs to the iPod at about 1 second/song with USB 2.  Now THAT's FAST.  That included playlists, etc...<p>The Headphones are NOT the worthless things you often get with players.  These things are top-notch earbuds.<p>The iPod can be useds as a portable hard drive.  Do the math and think how many of those little USB memory keys would be needed to store as much as one of these.<p>The AC Adaptor is cool in itself---essentially travel size<p>DO do your research.  The iPOD will NOT work with USB 1 ports or a 4-Pin Firewire.  It requires USB 2 or a 6 pin Firewire.<p>The sound quality is very good, and the battery is said to last longer than the regular iPod.<p>You might think, for $50 more, I could get the regular iPod.  Well, think about how much music you have.  I have 20 CDs, and they don't begin to fill it up.  Do you really need 15 GIG?  If you don't, Go Mini and save yourself $50. =D

<Title>Worst Customer Service I ever seen for a company
<Date>Sun Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I would surely wait until they have this thing working, or get ready for hours on the phone.  I have three different computers, so its not the computer, its either thier software or unit.<p>This is my letter to Apple:<p>I cannot begin to convey the frustration I have encountered with your company this past week.  Over the past two days I have been on hold and spoke to a total of seven techs, non of which could solve my problem.<p>Bought an I-POD mini directly from you, had it engraved, waited  a month, received it yesterday.<br>Have been on the phone to customer service 4 times for 4 hours and 7 different techs (once being hung up on after an hour on hold).  After all that, my final answer was, &quot;send an email to iTunes&quot;. (I did receive a reply from Itunes, they said contact Apple technical support again, and they have no voice technical assistance).<br> After 4 hours on the phone, reloading software, downloading software from websites, resetting the unit twice, trying different computers,  my answer and solution is &quot;send an email to iTunes? You got to be kidding?<br> <br>My names is XXXXXX(age 46), my serial number is U2XXXXXXXX.  Now I have to wait at least another 24-72 hours for a response from i Tunes, this is poor customer service to say the least.  <br> <br>I know this is wrong, I called customer technical service again, this time for one hour and fifteen minutes, I just asked can I just send this back.  &quot;NO&quot; You will be charged a restocking fee.  &quot;Maybe its not defective&quot;  &quot;I will talk to an engineer and call you back some time next week&quot;  (I guess I am suppose to wait by my phone?)  <br> <br>You know, I really don't care about the restocking fee, even the total cost of the ipod.  My time is for exceeded $300.  At this point I am just ready to throw it in the trash.  I bought it from Apple for $250, downloaded 60 songs at $60 dollars, but to be treated like this is not excusable.  What it has shown me is that you service is terrible and there is no respect for my hours and hours of time.  What seems to be more important is putting me and your new product through test after test that you should have done before sending out the product. <br> <br>There is no way I would ever buy another Apple product or buy your stock (foolishly believing that you may have a good product and service with iTunes and ipod).  (By a dell, sony, etc., there is no hours and hours of hold times and &quot;we will call you back next week&quot;)<br> <br>If you cannot resolve the technical issues with this, I will charge back my credit card for the purchase and you can tell me where to ship the unit back to.  If not, I'll take the three hundred dollar hit and spread the word to other potential customers and stay away for life.  I have kept a copy of this request and this terrible service for my credit card provider also.<br> <br>Signed,<br> <br>XXXXXX<br> <br>After all these hours and money and time I have invested, could not someone at least call me?

<Title>Outstanding! I love the iPod Mini
<Date>Sun Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My wife asked me for an MP3 player or a portable music player. After looking around, I decided to buy the 4GB Ipod Mini (silver). It will have plenty of disk space for over 1000 songs which is enough at a time for my wife, plus it is very light weight and includes a belt clip. The software, iTunes loaded and connected to our new ipod with the supplied firewire cable (also includes a USB cable) with our WinXP machine. The unit comes with a charger, but we it can also charge when connected to the computer (save the charger for trips away from the computer). I ripped a few of our CDs into the iTunes software (AAC format, 128 bit rate but you can use MP3 if you wish), and the quality is excellent, so now only about 200 more CDs to go but they rip pretty quickly and you can listen to the tracks while you are importing. The software easily syncs the tunes into the iPod. Many say that the iPod is about design and colors, which personally don't matter to me, but the iPod mini is also about function. The way you scroll through menus, adjust volume, etc. is sooooo slick and easy once you spend a few minutes with this machine. I love it so much, I have now convinced myself to also buy the 20GB machine for myself to hold all of our music.

<Title>What a great product.
<Date>Sun Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is my first iPod. I thought the previous models were very cool, but too big for my taste. This iPod itself is easy to use and the iTunes software is ok. I was hoping I could just copy files directly from my WinXP machine and not use the Apple software but you can't if want to play music (you can use it as a storage drive but you need to use iTunes to transfer music you intend to play) I do like the playlist and smart playlist features of the software. Sure 15, 20, or 40GB would be nice, but 4GB holds a lot of music. If you are worried about *only* having 4GB of space, then do what I did - look at your digital music collection and select the files you would want to have on an iPod. I have much more than 4GB, but most of it I don't listen to anyway. Now I can have plenty of music on a very compact device.

<Title>Oh my God this thing is sweet
<Date>Thu Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>before i bought this, i bought a sony mini-disc player. i was pretty impressed by that, but then my buddy got a mini...i was overwhelmed by how revolutionary it was. my mini disc only held about 75 songs per disc. i also had to carry around all the discs if i wanted to listen to something that was on another disc. the ipod mini is awesome looking, very easy to use, and holds about a 4th of my music collection. i have had only one problem with it and apple is aware of the problem and takes care of it with no questions asked. the head phone connection disconnects from the motherboard and causes static and eventually loses sound all together. i went to the local apple store and they replaced it. i went home and put my music back on it and im a happy man. Godbless Apple/Mac computers for revolutionizing the music industry and ultimatly reducing the cost of music by around $5 a record. most albums from the itunes store is $10, some are even less expensive. i gave 5 stars even though it did break, because they replaced it without incident.

<Title>Fast turnaround on iPod Mini from Amazon...
<Date>Sat Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My girlfriend got me a 15gb 3G iPod last month... and I just returned the favor by getting her a Pink Mini for her birthday.  While the extra storage of the "full sized" iPods is nice, there's something very elegant about the smallness and sturdiness of the mini.  When comparing the iPod/iPod Mini to mp3 players of other brands, the first thing you notice is the elegance/ease of use of the interface.  It just feels like it's been well thought out-- it feels like quality.  Other mp3 players often have a feeling of not being finished--- you're constantly checking for firmware updates.  A big pain.  BTW, I ordered the mini on Aug 25th.  I was bummed out because the estimated delivery date was Oct 15th!  It turned out the item was shipped on Aug 26th and arrived on the 27th, a mere 2 day turnaround (not the 1 1/2 month+ wait I had been dreading).  Amazon's great!

The software is great too. If you don't want your screen to scratch buy a case. Also purchase the care protection plan. This one is way better than the 15,20,30 and 40 gb models. If you are looking for something cheap that can hold up to 128 songs, purchase the iriver model. no i dont have but people say it is good.

<Title>Great Product....Lousy Service
<Date>Tue Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am a long distance runner who spends hours on the road each week getting ready for Triathlons and Marathons. Music is important to my runs as it helps keep me on pace and at the same time help the miles dissapear more quicky. And before I bought the mini ipod I must admit that I suffered from Ipod envy. I loved the interface and the ease of use of the big unit but to my mind they were too big and too bulky for long distance running. Instead, I made due with products like the Rio Cali and a couple of others that were fine units but had limited memory and difficult user interface. Needless to say I was very excited with Apple introduced the Mini Ipod. In fact, I got one on the first day they were available. The unit was everything I hoped for...lots of space for a variety of music...good interface and small enough to fit on my arm. It was great in fact until about two months after I got the unit when it broke. As I had bought the extended warrantee I did not worry. I called Apple and they sent out a box for me to ship my unit back to them for repair. Well that was two months ago and my unit still is back. They first time they sent it back to me still not operating. Then they botched sending me a new box to ship the unit back to them not once but twice. And, now I just sit waiting for the unit to be sent back to me.   Considering what I paid for the unit, the fact that I also bought the extended warrantee and that I have been able to use the unit two months out of four, I can not possibly reccomend this unit to anyone.

I would really kill for a bigger iPod mini, but I guess you get what you pay for when it's out.  Rio has a 5GB mp3 player thats the size of the iPod mini with some new hard drive, I hope that's in a new iPod mini by christmas.

It has really good controls and buttons, which i think are much easier then those of my brothers 15 GB ipod.  The battery life is fine, i dont know why people keep saying its not enough.  Eight hours is alot.  Think about it, how many days a week are you going to spend exactly eight hours listening to your ipod, espeially if you have school.  Also, the storage space is actually alot as well if u think about it.  1,000 songs is alot of music to hold at one time.  Most people who have the 15 GB or higher hardly fill up more then 1,000 songs anyway.  Besides if you get tired of the music that you have on it, then take it off by simply hooking it up to itunes and deleting it off and then you can fill it up again with new music.  I also like the material its made of more then the normal ipods, because the mini is made of a metal that doesn't scratch unless you purposely get something sharp and scratch it.  The only problem that i had with it (I dont have it anymore) is that when i hooked it up to my PC, it was encredibly hard to get i to work.  Ive had itunes for a month or so, so its not like im new to itunes.  I plugged it in and it had all of these different formatting errors that took me roughly four hours to figure out and fix.  So unless you're a computer genious, then plan to spend a couple hours being really angry that it wont instantly download your music.

<Title>great product but,,
<Date>Sat Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been using the iPod mini for a week now and must say it is a great product!  The 4 GB capacity is fine for me.  I can't fit my entire music collection but having 100 of my favorite CDs in something so small and light is awesome.   The user interface is very intuitive.  You almost don't need a user manual.  It came with iTunes which is by far the best program I have used to manage my music collection.    The iPod has one flaw though.  The iPod inserts a sub second gap between songs.  This isn't noticeable unless multiple tracks are intended to blend together, as in a live recording.  The iPod should be smart enough to queue the next song in memory without adding a glitch.  This is a firmware problem and has nothing to do with the way the music is copied from the CD. When the music is played with iTunes from the computer there is no problem.  I understand other media players have similar problems so iPod is still ahead of the rest.

<Title>Amazing
<Date>Sun Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It's amazing the transitions music has gone through in the last 40 or 50 years.  When it started out, the only way music lovers could enjoy their favorite songs was by collecting big vinyl records.  Then came the big, bulky 8-track tapes.  Then cassettes, which were small and convenient but they didn't last forever.  Then came CDs.  They could last a lifetime, but often had skips or scratches.  Finally there were MP3s...and the iPod!  I got one of these for my birthday and am absolutely thrilled!  It is so small, and holds up to 1,000 songs.  You can buy songs with the iTunes software and upload them onto your iPod, or you can upload CDs to the iPod in a matter of seconds.  As for me personally I used MusicMatch Jukebox to rip my CDs and then loaded them into iTunes and put them on my iPod.  With the iPod comes a firewire and USB cable which you use to connect the iPod to the computer.  You also get earbud headphones (which provide brilliant sound) and a belt clip.  The iPod gets an 8-hour battery life, which is plenty to hear your favorite songs again and again.  Then it takes about three hours to recharge the battery (one hour for an 80% charge.)  The only drawback seems to be that I'm going to have to seriously cut down my music collection!  The iPod, however, is the best MP3 player out there.

<Title>IPod Convert
<Date>Sun Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was a doubter of the usefulness of having an IPod so I held out against getting one, even though I am a big music fan.  Well I finally snapped and got one, I have to say I am impressed with it.  It's not very high priced, I think I paid about $250 for mine.  You know that's not a lot of money these days at all.  It's about the same as a cheap cell phone and a heck of a lot more useful to me at least.  It holds quite a few songs at 4GB it can hold over 600 songs as long as you don't use a super high quality setting when you copy your songs.  I am a picky person when it comes to sound quality, and I wasn't disappointed with it at all.  It also handles my headphones fine even though they are made for much higher power studio equipment.  I didn't have any problem using the iTunes program and the supplied cables to sync with my laptop running XP.  It was easy no problems at all.  Basically I just had to say that it really does what it says it will, and it sure is easy to use.  If you love music and are tired of carrying around those huge clunky "portable" cd players then this is for you.

<Title>Too little storage, expensive
<Date>Tue Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod Mini's are quite stylish, but in person, the color plastic they use feels cheap.  I was really surprised by this "discovery" when I check them out in an Apple store a few months ago.  And on some of the display units, the pain had already started coming off.  Not a good sign of Apple's "high-end" pretense.  My biggest issue, though, is the limited storage.  4GB, which is even less if you use the binary count method (where 1GB = 1024MB), doesn't really hold that many songs.  Since MP3 (and Dolby's AAC) is a compression encoding method, you *do* lose audio quality when you rip your CDs (unless your have crappy CDs to begin with).  128kbps is not really that good for ripping music unless you are a teenager not concerned with "good-quality" music.  I use at least 196kbps, but at that rate, the iPod Mini can hold only 650 regular-length songs, or about 50 CDs.  That's not really helluva lot of music.  Even at the more customary 128kbps bitrate, you can only cram about 75 CDs worth of music on the iPod Mini, which means when you run out of space, you'll have to delete songs and re-transfer songs, a task not easily done in the iTunes software, on PC or Mac.  So for this much money, the iPod Mini is a poor value.  On the other hand, I must say that the other alternatives are not as nicely designed or easy to use as the iPod Mini.

<Title>TOP PERFORMER: Small MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Everyone raves about the iPod and the iPod Mini. Are they really worth the money? Abso-f-lutely. The only question you should be asking yourself is, "Should I get the iPod or the iPod Mini?"  I bought the 20GB iPod and used it for 6 months. Then I borrowed my roommate's iPod Mini and used that for a month. I ended up selling my iPod to buy an iPod Mini, and here's why.  It's all about portability. The Mini fits in my pocket so much better than the regular iPod. The Mini with the armband is so much more comfortable than the bigger iPod with the carrying case (Apple does not make an armband for the iPod because it is not practical; third-party armbands are available, but they are not comfortable at all). I find myself taking the Mini with me just about everywhere I go without a second thought; with the regular iPod, I always thought about whether I'll be comfortable carrying it or not.  As for the "limited" 4GB space, I prefer the 4GB to the 20GB. Instead of carrying around every single mp3 that I owned, I only carried around the songs that I wanted to listen to, which made the 4GB iPod Mini much more manageable than the 20GB iPod. If you think carrying around 1000 songs is limiting, then you have bigger issues (see a shrink about that).

<Title>Great features and suggested improvements
<Date>Mon Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Personally, I have found the iPod mini is well worth its price. Its portability, storage capacity, sound quality, and ease of use are all excellent. I particularly like its functionality of creating different play lists: most frequently played, recently played, randomly selected. The randomly selected playlist is a great way to add variety and to improve your knowledge of your own collection of music while listening.  Here are some suggested improvements:  -the battery needs to be improved to last the uninterrupted eight hours as advertised. Or the users should be able to carry and substitute a spared one on long flights.  -the earplugs need to be improved so that the soft cover doesn't fall off too easily.  Nonetheless, the Ipod mini has enabled me to enjoy my own collection of music more than ever -- on the move.

<Title>Love the mini
<Date>Tue Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod mini is by far the cutest piece of technology I've ever owned. Granted, it only holds 4 GB of music, but that's enough space to hold a fair amount of my music until I get sick of hearing it. Then, I clear it off and load new songs.  The mini is very easy to use-- i'm using it with win XP, and had to buy a USB 2.0 card. Installing the iPod and iTunes software is very easy, as is the initial configuration that you have to perform on the mini (a wizard walks you through the entire setup). I'm not at all familiar with Apple or Apple software, yet I was able to set up and begin using my mini withing minutes of opening the box.  It charges up quickly and seems to be very durable (i've dropped it twice already in one week of owning it). I have my mini in an iSkin, which protects it well, both from falls and dirt. (I'm certain the iSkin added additional protection when I dropped my mini.) The transfer rate from PC to mini is very fast, although that will probably vary depending on which cable you use (firewire vs USB) and your computer setup.  I'm very much into things that look stylish that are also high quality. The iPod mini meets both of those requirements. I highly recommend the mini, however, if you are more concerned with function over fashion, I would spend the extra $50 and buy a 20 GB iPod.

<Content>I love the iPod mini, but for those who haven't seen them in person, the "pink" is not pink.  It's more of a purplish mauve raspberry color.  Not a bad color, but not the sweet baby pink that it looks like in the picture.

<Content>I love my ipod. I wear it whenever I'm walking around, and having all of my favorite songs on hand is like living in my own TV show. I love the lightness and design of the ipod, but there are a few things that I would improve. For instance, the battery life could be better--but the recharge time is pretty short, so it's forgiveable. It is easy to forget to lock the ipod, so when it's in your purse, it tends to turn on by itself and waste batteries. Also, a better and more comprehensive manual should be included b/c it can do so much more than play music. Other than these minor things, I can't rave enough about my pink ipod mini!

<Title>Ipod Mini is Awesome
<Date>Sat Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my ipod mini for about 3 months now and I love it! I bring it everywhere. Not much bad to say about it except some minor problems that you have probably already heard 25 times. 1) battery doesn't last very long but just charge it during the night and its ready for the next day 2) Was difficult at first for me to put songs onto ipod. I was on a mac and the songs wouldn't transfer to the ipod but i figured it out by going to the top bar and selecting convert ot mp3 but i don't have to do that anymore.. I guess it fixed itself 3) The task of renaming all your songs and albums and artists is very time consuming but worth it because otherwise you won't be able to find your songs on the ipod 4) The manual only gives basic instructions which was annoying because you had to pretty much figure it out for yourself. I have never had it freeze on me like others have been saying and I think it is worth the money because I use it SO often! The only thing i haven't figured out is the calender. So if you want to buy an ipod mini do it because it is worth it!

<Date>Mon Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I was pleasently surprised at how easy my Ipod was to set up along with the ease of use of Itunes. I initially had doubts about skipping during playback but that has not been the case. I presently only have 185 songs on my mini but plan on doing more shopping for tunes online. I have been able to find songs on Itunes That I thought I'd never hear again. Battery life on the Ipod is good, not as long as advertised but it will take me anywhere I need to go before recharging. I also purchased the Itrip mini and docking station as well as the Bose SoundDock which is a treat ynto itself. You will not go wrong with the mini as long as you don't have hundreds of CD's in your collection. I choose what I listen to carefully and only want to listen to my favorites and this player does that and then some.

<Content>Regardless of which color you get, this mini is a winner!  The rest of em are junk, but this mini lets me use it in the car with the optional cassette adapter, and enough songs to make a walk interesting and fun!  I discovered by accident that when you "burn" CD's they work in car and home CD players! A real gem and Apple hit the target. It's small enough to fit in pocket or purse. Even the supplied earphones are good and everyone knows you are listening to iPod.  iTunes is easy to navigate and download music...but you can rack up a bill at .99 cents per tune before you know it! If you change computers save the tunes BEFOREHAND!  Hook the new one up, hook the iPod up and it erases it all! You will never be disappointed.  The battery life is okay, but you have to send it back to Apple to have the internal battery replaced at a cost.  Should be more user friendly in that regard. But, want a great gift?  Get one for Christmas, birthdays, etc. Make someone happy - commiter, student, gym rat or yourself!

If Documents is what you are interested in, still get the iPod because your average document is 5-10KB, and there are a 100KB in a Megab. (is that right or is it a 1000? I'm not sure.) and a 1000 Magab. in a Gigab. times 4, I think you'll have enough space!

<Date>Sun Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Wow, this is one slick little gadget! So far it works great, but I can see the battery getting a little weak like some of the other reviewers have described. I normally don't purchase the extended warranty, but I did with this item. With the Apple protection plan they don't just repair the product, they replace it. So I will wait for about two years until enough people complain to Apple, and they manufacture a better battery. Also the Itunes store is pretty good, but they are missing some very popular artists. (try searching for Dave Matthews Band. I mean they don't have any Dave Matthews??? Get with it!!) As far as the FM transmitter goes I have tried three of them and finally settled on the Monster brand one. I would stay away from the one that Best Buy sells for $99.99. I can't remember the name of it but it is a white cradle that has all of these extentions to plug into the ciggarette lighter. Just by taking it out of the package (thats right folks 100 bucks and they sell it in one of those imposible to open plastic packages!) I knew that it would break soon, and I was right!! Plus any bump in the road and my Ipod would get jarred out of position. Very angry with this product!!!!!! Enough about the accesories, buy an Ipod Mini today! You will not regret it.

<Title>Almost Perfect
<Date>Sun Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The ipod mini has almost everything that the ipod has in a smaller package.   Design: Apple really went all out for this one. The ipod mini seems smaller than my credit card! It's also nice to know that there are more colors available. I happened to choose silver because all the other ones seems too girly. The overall design is simplistic. There are no parts jutting out or any hooks for clothes to snag on. This creates a rather sleek appearance that is in some way, attractive. The screen is conveniently backlit and is large enough to display basic information, yet small enough to relax my concerns about a scratched screen.  Functionality: The ipod mini delivered exceptional sound quality when I compared it to other mp3 players. I used the same speakers for all devices so I know that the results are fair. The menus are very intuitive. They aren't graphical but simple and easy to understand. My 5 year-old cousin was easily able to figure out the menus.  Compatibility: Alas, this is where the ipod's shortcomings are most obvious. To connect the ipod with your computer you must use iTunes. This is one of the few flaws I have found in the ipod. Another flaw would be file type compatibility. WMA files won't work on the ipod. You must use AAC or MP3.  Overall, I found the ipod mini to be a near perfect mp3 player. Throw in WMA and RA compatibility and driverless connectivity and it would have been perfect.
