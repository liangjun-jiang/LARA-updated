<Title>Good, not perfect
<Date>Mon May 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I researched lots of hard drive mp3 players before buying one a year and a half ago. All the reviews I read said the Carbon was the best value for what I was looking for, so I decided to go for it because I-pods seemed over-rated and too expensive. I had no problem with it for about 7 months and then it stopped working for no good reason. Tech support sent me a new one and now all is well. It works fine, but there are some little quirks. The interface is not the most user friendly, and the clock refuses to work on mine, for example. Those things being said, I still give the carbon 4 stars because they aren't that annoying.  On the plus side, it can play lots of different types of files, has a built-in microphone and a long-lasting battery, which lasts twice as long and takes exactly half as long to charge as an ipod mini. It has a sleek look,fits easily in my pocket and doesnt feel fragile. I like the Carbon wheel better than the I=pod wheel. Someone on this site said they have had 3 different players and the wheel broke on all of them. I simply can't believe that that person wasn't just really really dumb. The wheel is perfectly sturdy. The case they give you doesn't have a belt clip and you need to take it out of the case to press the buttons, but you can buy a better one.  Rio seems to have really good tech support. I think they realize that their products are a bit quirky and they don't give you a hard time about getting a new one (this is based on my experience and that of one of my friends). All in all, I know four people who have a carbon (including me) and two of them broke and were replaced, so guess you just get lucky or you don't. That said, I know a few people who have I-pods that just cut out for no reason and/or don't charge properly, and they dont have good customer service to even it out because I-pods are so popular. So, in conclusion, this is not a perfect player by any means, but I'm happy with mine, and it's still a good value.

<Title>My third Rio product - this was a super deal!
<Date>Mon Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apparently unlike many of the reviewers here at Amazon, I have been pleased with Rio products thus far - first one was one of those little 126k MP3 players, then moved up to a Cali 256k.  I'm very accustomed to using Rio's Music Manager software as a result.  Anyways...I've been wanting to get a player that would be compatible with Napster2Go, but until recently most of the subscription-based players have cost $200 or more...too pricey for me :) so when I saw the Rio Carbon selling for $99 here at Amazon I jumped on it, and boy am I glad I did (granted, I've only had it for a week or so).  While I did have some issues installing the software and getting my PC to 'see' the Carbon I got a great deal of assistance from the forums at riovolution.com and rioworld.org - including a link to version 3.02 of the driver for the Carbon.  Once I uploaded that, it was smooth sailing...so far anyway.  The carrying case could've been better (what no belt clip???) but fortunately there are compatible cases out there - it would have been nice if the case that came with allowed the user to view the screen and the controls without having to take the player out.  Anyway - so far so good, in fact I'm considering buying another one for the hubby - being able to use Napster 2 Go is totally awesome!  I've downloaded 150 songs so far and barely used any of the Carbon's storage room...

<Title>0 stars - piece of *%$&
<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've probably used this thing for 10 minutes in all the time I've had it and spent hours trying to get it working. Don't bother wasting your money.  First, it didn't power up at all.  then, it powered up but the pc no longer recognized it.  I finally got it all working AND charged up the battery, upgraded the firmware, etc.  Unplugged it to listen to it and what do you know?  None of the buttons are reponding.  It looks like it's cycling through the songs but can't hear anything.  Now it doesn't get recognized by the pc OR the power adaptor.  Nice.  Pushing the reset button does nothing.  If you do buy this, make sure you start TRYING to use it right away so you can get your money back.  I waited too long til the warranty was over.  I spend my whole day dealing with computer problems.  This was supposed to be a "relaxation device" for me!!!! :)  Just posting this as a warning - take a look at all the people who have problems with this.  I'm buying an Ipod.

<Content>I managed to get this player brand new for $69.99 during a clearance sale.  It is great for long commutes and work.  It works as advertised and I get about the stated battery life depending on current volume.  The only thing they should have changed was the carrying case.  You can't use the main buttons when the player is in the case.

<Title>I love it, and would buy another...
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 Player has given me hell.  But don't get me wrong... it's a love-hate relationship. It's incredibly attractive with a sleek and shiny back and an easy-to-maneuver front. It's lightweight and hold's in your palm nicely. The sound quality is great and I play it for long hours and it has lasted for a long time.  That being said, I've had my Rio for 10 months, and I've dropped it a few times (no practical protective case, really). Problems I've encountered have been it shutting off and bearing the message "Upgrader" not allowing you do anything. The best remedy I've found for this problem has been to plug it in to the charger, and it will typically take care of the problem. This was a recurring problem, but it has quit being a pain, and I've had practically flawless play with it the past few months. However, I dropped it recently and the wheel broke, which means I can not turn the volume up or down on the Rio, only through the output device (speakers). That's my own fault though.  You get interesting comments when listening to the Rio... "What's THAT?"... mainly because people are so used to the Ipod, but I would choose the Rio over Ipod anyday. Ipod's overrated.

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player!
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It has been two years since I purchased my RIO carbon, 5MB player.  I drop it at least once a week, it spends 25% of the time rolling around in my coat pocket while commuting back/forth to work, the other 75% is spent rolling around in the bottom of my purse.  Although it came with a case, it's not really practical.  You have to keep taking the whole thing out to change or search for different titles.  An improvemnt would be to have an opening which allows you to change your opions easily. Anyway, I dropped it one last time thsi week and the volume button came out and it won't work anymore. I'm buying another one! I see there is a 20GB Rio that has my name all over it!

<Title>Great Player!!
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Both my wife and I have each had a Rio Carbon for over 2 years now.  Mine gets dragged (and dropped) everywhere.  I have wireless FM in my car so I can even listen to it while driving.  Neither of us have had ANY problems with our players, other than occasionally forgetting to recharge it.   I've dropped mine many many times without any problems.  My 7 year old borrows it all the time and it keeps on ticking.   I have firmware version 1.43.  I have 1,508 songs on it (WMA variable bit rate) and still have 20% of my hard disk left.  Haven't touched my CDs in years!  I like the long battery life and I fly overseas to India and Japan quite a bit.  It's nice having a long life MP3 player with on the flights so I don't have to listen to the canned airline music.  And I can recharge it off of my laptop when I'm in my hotel room or at work.   I have had no issues with the menu button or the little selection wheel.  If this one ever dies, I'll buy another one without any hesitation!  The only negatives I can say is (as others have mentioned) the case sucks and is worthless.  I also wish I could create play lists without having to use the Rio Management software.  I have gotten around this by using the `genre' as play lists.   I use Media Tagger 1.3.5  (which is freeware) to re-write the tag data on my music files.  Also as a side note, always have your songs backed up on a hard drive some place.  Even the best player can get lost or stolen and you don't want to have to re-rip, and re-download all of your CDs and songs you bought on-line!!!

<Title>Way better than iPods and half the price!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband bought this mp3 player for me as a birthday present. It's a whopping 5 GB player and you'd have to put down at least $250 if you want an iPod with comparable storage. It holds an amazing number of songs and I especially like the recorder feature. It's great for undergraduate and graduate students because you can record lectures and listen to music with one little device! Both the device and the software are straightforward and easy to use. I agree with the other reviewer because it is a tiny bit annoying that you can only create playlists when you're hooked up to the software, but it's really a minor flaw and definitely not a big enough problem that I wouldn't recommend it to others. Even if I hadn't been biased against iPods before this because of their ridiculous marketing strategies ("Buy our products because they look cute and come in flashy colors! Never mind if they're quality products or reasonably priced!"), I still would have thought this product was 10x more efficient and reasonable.   My only complaint is that mine broke easily. I see that others reviewers have dropped it multiple times with no problems, so I guess I got the token dud. I only had it for a few months and I dropped it once at the grocery store, and now it's broken and unresponsive to anything I do.   Here's my personal plea: It looks brand new on the outside and I hate to buy a new mp3 player for $100 when I know there's someone/someplace out there that can fix it. I checked Rio's website and they no longer fix their players, so does anyone know of other companies with websites that I can check with? If not, do you have any general suggestions as to where I could start? Any type of stores or business that might offer this service? Thanks and I'd appreciate any help!

<Content>Very frustrating!  The Rio Carbon comes in an industrial strength plastic package.  I spent over 15 minutes trying to get it it open -- it is too thick to cut with scissors or slice with a razor blade.  Once I got it cut, I gashed my hand on the plastic.  I am no wimp -- this packaging is just crazy!  It could serve as the shipping container.

<Content>What a great little player (once my dad got the crazy package open).  It's about 3/4" shorter than the iPod mini, but about 1/2 wider.  Similar thickness, but more rounded.  Similar weight.  Like carrying another cell phone.    The rubber grip is nice too -- fits great in the hand.  One complaint: the shiny chrome case collects fingerprints and scratches like crazy.  After 2 days, the back is pretty scuffed just from sliding it across the table.  The iPod Mini has a brushed metal case, which hides scratches and fingerprints.

<Title>Incredible product
<Date>Sat Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Carbon for about two weeks now, and I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase. First off, kudos to Rio for the sleek design; it's amazingly small and light, travels very well, and looks very, very stylish.   There are minor annoyances associated with the Carbon though. First off, if you buy this, make sure to have a set of good headphones / earbuds of your own with a gold plated plug. The packaged earbuds are crap, and anything uncoated apparently produces a lot of static due to some design error. Secondly, the back of the Carbon and the touchpad collect fingerprints like mad; being the neat freak that I am, I spend quite a lot of time polishing the bugger (annoying!).  Beyond these small grievances of mine, the Carbon trumps the iPod in both storage / battery life. Beyond the obvious 1gb increase, I'm never concerned about the remaining battery power (although I haven't tested the claim of 20 hours, I've never ran out of power, and I use this thing all the time). If you do buy the Carbon, make sure to upgrade the firmware; lots of small fixes and charging while connected via USB = plus.

<Title>Cool product - needs a little more thought put into design
<Date>Thu Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've been a big fan of Rio/Sonic Blue products since their inception. The Carbon does have a lot of storage space for music, it the perfect size and weight (I use mine while working out and running).  Also, cool metalic backing like the iPod.  Ease of use.  Dislikes: battery goes fast!  6-10 hours of use before it needs to be recharged.  Also, battery guage is crude and not all that accurate.  Not precise.  Also, NO HOLD BUTTON!  That is probably the biggest design flaw - I keep hitting the buttons and pausing/forwarding/reversing songs unintentionally.  Lastly, the leather carrying case, while very cool, does not have a viewing window so to fast forward songs you need to remove device from case and manually fast forward.  Really needs to be a "cut out" to view buttons and the screen display!!!!  A note about RIO products: while cool products, good size and weight, they do tend to break rather quickly.  I'm not that rough on the equipment but previous 2 Rio products had problems that required fixing.  I bought my first Rio at Best Buy (yeah, they ripped me off) but got a cool protection plan that allowed me to trade in if product breaks within 3 years (for an extra $39).  You can return for same product or upgrade to the latest and greatest!

<Title>Great so far
<Date>Fri Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I chose to pick up this guy over the ipod mainly because the ipod uses itunes and aac. I'm one of those "bad" guys who prefers to pick up my tunes from p2p networks without the hassle of converting to apple's format.   Some pluses about the carbon: -Supports wma, this works really well with j river media center which allows you to upload and convert to wma on the fly. -great battery life, some people are complaining that they want a removable/replacable battery, but by the time the battery goes dead the player won't be worth keeping by then. -I personally like this design better than the ipod; as one reviewer said, I think the design appeals more to a male audience that finds the ipod a bit too toy-like. -I use this to also listen to audio books in the car (via the Belkin Tunecast II). The carbon supports the audible format, but I just rent audio book CD's from my local library and upload them onto the player.  -the 5 gig seagate harddrive can be removed, and it actually works in most devices that use type II compact flash (yes, it's that small). But from what I hear there are bugs with replacing a CF card back into the carbon.   Some cons about the carbon: -Like any other mp3 player, the stock headphones do not bring out the potential of the player. There are alot of earbud headphones on the market, but I recommend the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia for those on a budget (amazon has it for 27 bux). These earphones appear to be nearly identical to the MDR-EX71LP's, but the 71's have only a 15 inch cord because it's designed for players with a remote. The 71's come with a one meter extension, but the adapter looks bulky and the overall length becomes too long. Also, if you get static just put some clear nail polish around the base of the earphone jack to prevent direct contact with the metallic casing. of the carbon.  -the playlist feature cannot be edited from the carbon itself, and mine takes a bit long to process the playlists but only after I've uploaded new songs. (not a big deal, only about 10 more seconds and that's only after i've synchronized).   Overall, a very good buy considering the features, performance, and price. Plus, you avoid becoming an ipod clone.

<Date>Wed Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I waited at least a month after the Carbon came out to see what others thought, would it hold up, what bugs are present ect..  Then i made the plunge.  Overall its GREAT.  the battery life does last 20 hours.  You can even use a usb card charger i got for my palm to charge in the car with the included mini usb cord.  Holds a good amount of cds and love the fact i can listen to my audio books.  Any negatives are the power button.  With in the first 3 days the unit fell and the power button stopped working.  BestBuy exchanged it no problem but i made sure to get the 2 year warrenty extention with the new unit.  And this needs to build play lists in the fly.  I never used playlists untill i got this. But it would be nice.  How ard would it be to add this?   This looks so much better then the mini ipod and takes up very little room in a pocket.  If u use this in your car get the belkin tunecast II.  It powers via car charger.  Im tired of buying batteries for the tunecast I.  Carbon lasts longer then it does  UPDATE.  Im on my 3rd carbon.  This is the last try.  Love the player but something happened to unit and it wont power on.  Didnt drop it but did have a hard jolt.  IS ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM? If this one fails then i guess i get an ipod.  But damn it works so well.

<Title>A dissapointing purchase
<Date>Thu Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Prior to buying my Rio Carbon, I spent days searching the web for both professional reviews from major and smaller consumer electronic device reviewing sites, as well as many consumer reviews of the Rio Carbon. After reading all the hype and glamor everyone had to heap upon the Rio Carbon, I decided that it was time to finally get one myself.   Though the price was quite steep (around $270 after s/h), I was still very happy and satisfied at purchasing what I thought was a superb product. Upon receiving the Carbon, my first reaction was awe. What a cool looking device! Very sleek, thin, and fits comfortably in the palm of my hand. I then proceeded to carefully read the maunal and follow the directions step by step before even turning on the player itself. I charged the player for 3 hours just like the manual told me to do. Then went online to Rio's site and downloaded the latest version of the Carbon's firmware. I then proceeded to plug the USB cable into my USB port in my computer and followed all proper installation procedures to upload the firmware into my Carbon. One really neat thing that I noticed at this point was that when the USB was connected to both my Carbon and my PC, it would actually take that time to charge my Carbon through my PC's USB port! I then proceeded to take out the Music Manager CD that came with the Carbon, installed it onto my PC, and then surfed the web to update it to the latest version. Then started the task of uploading all my MP3s onto my little player. It was then, FINALLY, after a good excruciatingly long 7 hours after I had received the Carbon in the mail (after all, I wanted to make sure that I didn't do anything that might damage or deter from the directions laid out for my little expensive player), that I FINALLY turned on my Rio Carbon.   It was definately worth the wait. For as I turned on the Carbon, I was greeted by very cool red glow from the Rio logo on top of the player. And as the menu lighted up and displayed all the little neat functions of the Carbon. Such as voice recording mode, music/voice/audio playback, stopwatch, and a few others tweaks and settings.   However all little neat features aside, this was after all a MP3 player. And the whole reason for purchasing it was to play.....you guessed it......MP3s! I quickly pulled out the earphones that came bundled with the Carbon, plugged them into the player, and pressed play.  Much to my dismay, the sound quality was HORRIBLE! Maroon5 sounded like either a girl or a guy with a VERY high pitched voice. And my other MP3s didn't fare too well either. I couldn't understand if my player was just defective, or that this was normal for the Carbon. It occured to me that maybe a few of the MP3s may have gotten corrupted somehow during the transfer from my PC to the player (though I don't see how that would be possible). But the fact that ALL the MP3s didn't sound the way they were suppose to quickly ruled that possibility out of my mind. I pulled out my flash drive, uploaded all my MP3s onto it, and then transfered them onto my laptop to make sure the original files wern't the cause. And as I suspected, they played perfectly on both my PC and laptop through Realplayer, as well as Windows Media Player. Which left me with the conclusion that something was wrong with the Carbon. At $270, I was not overly eager to ship it back to receive a replacement that might give me the same results. So instead I opted for a full refund.   Overall this player had a great design, was a very good idea, but ultimately it failed where it counted the most. In its ability to actually play MP3s.

<Content>Great small player.  Price was well within reason for what it provides (I got mine for 250 online)  Pro's:  Small, light, sleek.  Real easy to charge (USB).  I've so far been happy with the sound (be aware, if you use an all-metal plug for headphones, it may cause distortion! Design flaw).  Thumbwheel and buttons all well placed and easy to use.  Been jogging with it several times without any skipping (very nice)  Con's:  Case.  Okay RIO, just why do you make a case that neither has an arm band nor a clip? Plus you can't access any of the controls while it's in it. Someone just wasn't thinking! The music software that comes with it is adequate, but watch the defaults if you like a specific way to load your music.    Small nits:  Playback.  I would like to be able to playback music by directory as well as "artist" or "genre". Yes, I know I could make playlists, but I'm lazy. RIO made some nice features including a clock and a stopwatch.  I wish they went the one extra step of adding an alarm to the clock (to wake me up) and a countdown timer to the stopwatch (for jogging).

<Content>I've had my Rio Carbon 5GB for over a year now. The feel of it is very sleek and comfortable. The user interface is excellent and easy to get used to. My son had a Dell Jukebox and now has an Ipod Nano, the Rio Carbon is much better than the Jukebox and just as good, if not better than the Ipod interface. The thumbwheel is effortless and is easily manageable with one hand. You can't do that with the iPod! The AC - USB power charger is great. I haven't seen other MP3 players with this type of capability. (I.e. the USB cable plugs into an AC to USB adapter.) Battery life has been very good. An excellent value!!

<Title>Rio- Good but cheap
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had a Rio Carbon for about 8 months. So far I've gone through two of them. I don't know whether I've gotten bad ones or what because the first one after about 2 months wouldn't do anything but display an "Upgrader" message and the second one's volume wheel became dislodged and doesn't work anymore. Now the company wants 100 bucks for another one. No one should have two go through two MP3 players or more.Thats why I think that it's JUNK.  I'm now thinking about getting an iPod because they don't have external parts besides the headphones. The overall design is good and the storage and software is satisfactory but I mean come on...  How many products are you supposed to get? Last time I checked it was 1.

<Title>The worse buying experience of my otherwise happy life
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> This is an ultra-inferior product. The little wheel on top of the player is as cheap as they make em'. Mine has broke 3 times now (in just 9 months) and this time RIO says they won't replace it - probably because they know it will just keep breaking and they will have to send me a new one every 3 months. The third time I tried not to even use the wheel as much and it still broke! Also, this player creates more jack noise than you can imagine. I lost an eardrum last month just trying to plug in my headphones to the player. 3rd - the system crashes quite a bit, and unless you carry around a tiny sewing needle, forget about resetting the thing.  Bottom line - don't waste your time or money on this hunk of junk. It will only lead to misery and despair.

<Title>Lovin' It
<Date>Thu Apr 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Rio Carbon for about two years now, and though I had some initial issues, I was able to iron them out, and it works flawlessly now even though it has seen fairly heavy use.  I did have to put a piece of tape around the earphone connection, because the unit is made of metal and the earphones would crackle when the metal ring on the earphones made contact with the metal case.  The other problem was the player would go in about 50 songs, then shut off.  When I restarted it, it would be back at the first song.  In order to get past the 50th song, I had to run it to the 54th song, before it would play through the rest of the songs.  Fifty songs is a lot to thumb through one by one, so I realized it was an issue I would need to fix.  The neat thing about the Carbon, is it will pull up on your computer as another hard drive.  So I just right clicked on it and did a reformat.  That did the trick, when I loaded the songs back on, no more problems.  This feature also makes it so you don't have to use the Rio software to load the songs onto the player, you can just drag them over, though the software is very simple to use and probably loads the songs as fast as dragging them over.  The unit does have some improvements over the Rio Nitrus, for instance, instead of having a separate power cord, the Carbon charges with the same cord that hooks it to the computer.  Also the buttons used to scroll through the songs are sturdier than the one button on the Nitrus. Unfortunately, not all the changes were good.  Changing from a plastic case to the metal, caused the problem with the earphones that I mentioned above, and also, they took off the lock switch that was on the back of the Nitrus, which kept the settings from being changed while it was in my pocket.    The Carbon does have a case, unlike the Nitrus, but it's pretty worthless for anything except protecting the unit from getting scratched up, because it has nothing to hook it to your belt. However, the unit is small enough to fit easily into your pocket, so no big deal.  One of the most annoying things about the case is you have to pull the Carbon out of the case if you want to do anything more than turn it off or turn up the volume.  That's pretty lame, but nothing I can't live with.  I'm not sure exactly what the battery life is, but I know I've listened to it for eight hours straight and the battery life is down maybe half, so the 20 hour claim is probably not far off, which is pretty awesome.    By and all, though the unit could stand some improvements, it has served me well and if I ever have to buy another MP3 player, I'd definitely go with a Rio.

<Title>don't waste your money
<Date>Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player less than a year ago and it is already broken.  I researched all MP3 players and this Rio Carbon received great reviews and seemed to have everything that I wanted.  It was great for about 8 months, although it would occasionally turn off randomly when listening to music. Then one day I turned it on and it had "UPGRADER" mode written on the screen.  I went to the Rio website and tried to install all versions of firmware which is suppose to rewrite the hard drive (and erase all music files on the player).  This did not work, and either did the countless phone call to Rio's support team.  All they could offer me was a refurbished player for $99. Do not waste your money on this MP3 player, I am not the only one with these problems either, there are lots of reviewers that have the same problem, and tapping it on the back doesn't do anything. If you do decide to get this MP3 player, I STRONGLY suggest getting the warranty.

<Content>... but at least the files inside the HD remain intact! Some times when you turn on you need to push the reset button,  so your configurations (volume, equalizer, etc) are lost. The files inside the internal disk aren't affected but this bug. Just because of that bug it will not receive 5 stars.  Even thought, it's much better than any iPOD. You can put any type of file inside. It recharges directly from the USB. AND IT'S CHEAPER than an iPOD!

<Title>An almost perfect little MP3 player
<Date>Sat Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Rio Carbon is the first MP3 player I bought. I was first intrigued with the Apple iPod Mini that my nephew had, so i decided to look at other MP3 players.   The Carbon is almost perfect, and I feel a bit better than the Apple Mini iPod. It has 25% more capacity. I have placed over 800 songs on it and used only 60% of the hard drive. The unit is a bit smaller than the Apple unit but looks a lot cooler. The red backlit logo and rocker pad looks very svelte. The back chrome plate is prone to fingerprints and smudges. As previously mentioned, the only design flaw is that some headphone jacks causes static when it touches the stainless steel edges of the unit when plugged in. This is easily fixed by painting a layer of fingernail polish on the exposed headphone plug (but it should not be necessary). There is a lock function on the Carbon (it pays to read the manual) by holding the MENU button in and pressing the center button. The carrying case is very snug because of the odd shape of the Carbon and does not have a belt clip. The ear phones while sounding good, do not fit well in smaller ears (too large) so I had to buy a separate headset. I find the interface very easy to use with a tactile feel to the wheel. I find no problems using it. The battery charges either from the USB port of your PC or from an adapter that uses the same USB cable. The display is very legible for its small size and longer titles constantly scrolls laterally across the screen (cool!).  The Rio Music Manager is very easy to use. Unlike from what I read before, you CAN do mass corrections to the ID3 info tags. Select all the songs you wish to edit and open the properties and change the fields. The one thing I find to be an issue is that if you update any fields in the Rio Manager, it does not update the info on the Rio if the file is already in the Rio. The software just synchronizes songs that are not on the Rio, not if there are any changes to the ID3 fields.  The easiest way was to delete all the files from the Rio and resynching the unit. It is best to update the ID3 fields before synching the Rio.

<Title>Number 1 mini HDD MP3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>You've probably been hearing all about ipods (unless you've been locked in a cupboard for 3 years) and how they are the best and only MP3 player out there. Well, they're not (either) with the Rio carbon being THE player to get.  Compared to the ipod mini, for $50 less, you get 1gig more space, a plug and play interface (just plug it into any computer with win 2000+ and transfer files in explorer), a 20 hour battery (2.5x apples at least), better sound quality (I think anyway) and the list goes on. Better compatibility with audio formats (MP3, WMA, WAV), can use loads of music stores, not just crummy iTunes, a better navigation system (the non tactile everything is annoying). The wheel on the carbon is great, as you can just change volume like that. It's also more stylish I think, and will show that you're not a clone who has to get an ipod.  Other players are good, but just don't compare, with the Creative muvo2 having an awful navigation system, and the zen micro again going the all non tactile route (even for volume). Some players may be decent, but are double the size of the carbon (another one of its huge advantages). If more space is essential to you though, I suggest the rio karma, which is amazing value, playback, sound and navigation.  The one minor issue is the static issue many people mention, but I think it has been resolved now anyway, but a bit of nail varnish on the jack isn't that hard, but most earphones come with the plastic part as far as I've seen. The case is also not the best I've seen, but vaja make a superb custom designed case for $40 or so, which you can get for saving all that money from not buying an ipod!

<Title>Rio Carbon and Rio Karma
<Date>Fri Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had a Rio Karma for a year and a half.  My wife has a Rio Carbon.  I am writing in response to several bad review.  Sound quality: the Rios do a bad job on bad MP3/WMAs.  That's right, the problem is their files, not the player.  I have 2800 files on my Karma and the only ones that sound wrong are the ones I got years ago off the net.  Yeah, I can tell the difference on my $10k theater system.  Then again if you want hi-fidelity, wouldn't be playing through a lossy format like MP3s or WMAs.  There is the lack of lower frequencies, but through portable headphones the lack is barely noticable.  Quality:  I have dropped my Karma (20 gb hd) while it was on well over 20 times.  I have yet to have a failure.  Firmware updates worked fine and added lots of features (not just bug fixes) along the way.  Syncing has never been a problem.  I have been syncing using both Windows Media 10 and Rio's software with three computers since I bought it.  The ability to sync with more than one computer was the reason I went Rio over Ipod in the first place.

<Title>Carbon vs ipod mini
<Date>Sat Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Like most I probably spent over a week visting every web site that had reviews of mp3 players and read every review on amazon for all of the various players. All signs pointed to the Carbon as the right player.  My one concern was the ever mentioned design flaw with the metal casing and how with some headphones static whould be induduced due to direct contact with the metal.  A trip to the local store change my views. I found that all of the players that I saw looked and felt VERY cheap. I was actually disappointed with the Carbon as well.  What did catch my eye however was the Apple ipod Mini.  The feel and look of these players can not be ignored. I feels sturdy and yet not heavy. I thought there is no way I'm going to by an apple product when all I have are Windows machines. However the more I read on line the more I decided to strongly consider this unit. I was worried about the player not supporting wma files. However I downloaded the itunes software and was pleased to find that when you import a wma file it will convert it. The software lets you convert it to several formats (ACC, mp3). The default is ACC but I decided to go with mp3 even though they are larger then ACC mainly because I wanted to be compatible with playing files on other windows machines that didn't have the itunes software installed. I ended up going with the ipod mini and thus far feel it was the right choice. Great sound and a user interface second to none. I encourage anyone thinking of spending money in this range to go see the players in person and see if you like the feel of the players in your hand. You will see that the majority of these players look and FEEL very cheap even though they are highly priced. I was also wanted a way to clip the player to my pants, something that is not provided by the Carbon. In summary don't hesitate to consider the ipod mini even if you are a windows die hard.

I wasn't familiar with them so i am not sure how they should sound, but what I heard was unclear static music.  I looked up the songs online, and they did sound more enjoyable online, so i think maybe it is the machine itself.  Did this happen with anyone else? Were the songs supposed to sound like that or was it the machine?

<Title>Great little player
<Date>Wed Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Rio Carbon is a superior alternative to an iPod mini.  I checked around, read lots of reviews and wavered slightly before going with the Rio Carbon.  I have never looked back.  The playback and storage space is phenomenal.  I listen to audio books constantly and this little player holds a WHOLE lot of books.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I think that the Rio music manager software sucks.  I have not been able to get it to work at all.  It gets hung every time trying to scan for files on my computer.  If I stop the scan it works okay to transfer files but not good enough for my satisfaction.  I have problems with static in the headphones but am hoping that the nail polish trick works.  Battery life is incredible and recharging is quick.  With the firmware upgrade, the player can be charged through the computer via USB which is really really nice.  Highly recommend this product!

<Title>Better than iPod Mini
<Date>Tue Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I own both the Rio Carbon and the iPod Mini.  Personally, I prefer the Carbon.  I'm sure many of you out there are deciding between the Rio Carbon, the iPod Mini, and the Zen Micro.  As far as I'm concerned, the offerings from Dell and Gateway aren't nearly as competitive.  Here is why I bought the Rio Carbon (for myself).  I got an engraved iPod Mini for my girlfriend because it was shiny and pink.  Pros 1.  20 hours of battery life (Manufacturer estimate) - way longer than Mini or Micro (Micro has removable batteries though, but you'll need 2 of those batteries to equal Carbon battery life) 2.  5gigs of memory - 1gig more than Mini, does not need partitioning for file storage like Micro 3.  Drag and Drop interface - easy to load and unload than Mini or Micro 4.  Does not need Drivers - transfer files to or from any computer 5.  Smaller/Lighter than Mini and Micro 6.  Nicer looking (unless you like the different colors) 7.  Microphone for recording!  Mini lacks this function.  Micro has it plus radio! 8.  Plays WMA files.  Mini lacks this function.  Micro has it! 9.  Cheaper than Mini and Micro (street price)  Cons 1.  No radio 2.  Laggy interface 3.  Just one color 4.  No engravings 5.  Static when using metal plugged headphones (can be fixed)  Battery life: I haven't gotten around to timing the battery life, cuz I never need it for 20 hour straight, but it definitely lasts me through the longest days.  (about 14 hours or so)  All the battery life you'll really need if you recharge while you sleep.  The battery can be charged by USB, which is very convenient if you need that extra juice.  The usb cable also plugs into the charger (like the firewire cables for ipods), so you only need one cable when you need to travel around.  File transfer and storage: The claims about it being drag and drop are true.  It is so easy to put music in and take music out!  However, you'll probably want to use the software included on the CD (or from the website) to sort and organize the music and for mass editing of ID3 info.  The drag and drop feature allows you to use the whole hard drive as a portable storage device.  That's up to 5 gigs that can be used to store personal files!  (Way better than the Zen Micro's half-baked max 2 gig partitioning system).  File transfer speed seems standard fare for a USB device w/ a MiniHD.  Look and Feel: The overall quality of the Carbon does not quite match up to the Mini, considering the Mini uses a fully aluminum shell.  Keep in mind, the Carbon is by no means a cheap feeling device.  The back of the case is a shiny chromed metal (shiny, but scratches and smudges easily like iPods).  The sides of the case is rubberized, which is very effective in keeping the device safe in your hands.      The front shell is a glossy plastic.  The top and the buttons are also chromed, but I think those parts are plastic instead of real metal (I could be wrong).  Overall the player looks very sophisticated.  I was amazed by how thin it is, about the same as the Mini, if not thinner.  It's lighter, shorter and rounder, and fits in my hands better than the Mini.  I have less fear of dropping the thing when I'm holding it!  My friends are amazed at the size and weight.  The display is sharp and bright when backlit.  The red lights are cool too!  The fake leather case that comes w/ the player is poorly designed though, it could use a hole on the side for access to the buttons and display.  I took a razor and cut those holes myself!  Sound Quality: The head phones that come with the Carbon is pretty bassy.  I've found I need to pump up the mid range to compensate, but overall, sound quality is crisp and clear.  Please note that I am not an audiophile off any sort and not very good at judging this.  The reports that using headphones w/ metal plugs causing static must be true because Rio has thoughtfully included plastic extension wires for headphones to keep metal parts from contacting the metal in the shell.  The voice recorder is decent.  I've used it for class and it was able to record the lecture pretty clearly, although I had to set it close to the teacher's podium to do so.    Voice files are recorded in .wav files, pretty large...so keep that in mind when recording for long periods of time.  The high pitched whining the internal hard drive can be heard on the recordings, which is a nuisance.  User Interface: Rio must have decided to use a cheap processor in order to extend the battery life.  There are many times during its use when the user interface lags behind my inputs.  Keep in mind that the music has not yet skipped on me.  But there were several times when I would try to jog the volume or switch between songs and the display would fail to keep up w/ my inputs.  I was spoiled by the iPod's relative quick response.  However, this only happens when a new song is being played, which is understandable because the player has to search for the song and then read it into memory.  However, the lag is a tad frustrating, especially when you're trying to change settings for a new song.  As far as I have used them, it never occurred in iPods I've used.  The button layout and functions are very intuitive and easy to use.  The jog wheel is just as functional as the overhyped touch wheel on the iPods.  I've found touch sensitivity can be difficult for people without a delicate touch.  Overall a great buy.  Better than iPod Mini in my opinion.  I haven't tried the Zen Micro so I wouldn't make that comparison safely.  The Dell and Gateway players don't appeal to me.  So the Rio Carbon just might be the best miniHD mp3 player on the market right now!  P.S. about clipping electronics on your belt... Don't do it...It looks real dorky~

<Title>Excellent product for my needs
<Date>Sun Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After doing a lot of research on MP3 players I decided to go with the Rio Carbon.  I've waited a month before writing this review, and so far I have not had any problems with it.  Here's what I like about the Rio Carbon:  It's small.  It literally fits in the palm of your hand and it's half the depth of a cellphone, so it can easily share a pocket with something else.  It's lighter than a cellphone too, you wouldn't even know it was there if it weren't for the tunes.  Being one of the smallest harddrive devices, it's still 5GB, more than the iPod Mini.  Using and carrying the device is simple.  The scroll wheel is conveniently located for your thumb to use and it's easier to use than the iPod's wheel, which can be very touchy.  Playback features include an equalizer, repeat, shuffle, playlists, and lock-mode.  It also looks damn good.  Here's what I don't like: As far as I can see, there is no way to build a playlist from inside the player, they must be transferred from your computer.  When hooking up a pair of Sony MDR-V600 headphones, the Rio shutdown.  Why?  The plug has metal around it which made contact with the Rio, which I assume caused it to short-circuit.  Luckily it was fine and I tried again, getting it in without the metal making contact.  The sound quality was noticeably flatter than what comes out of the computer, which would have been a huge disappoint if I purchased the Rio Karma for home use (20GB is nowhere near enough for a FLAC player) - but I opted for a travel companion instead, and thus perfect sound quality is not necessary.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, I can hear the bass.  It's just not as good as an Audigy2 soundcard.  I would never disrespect someone else's opinion, however another recent review included some plain false information.  The Rio Carbon includes a protective carrying case, a USB cable, free songs, and a free 2-month trial subscription to the Audible network, which carries eBooks.  Overall, the price, size, weight, storage, and ease of use of the Rio Carbon make it a winner.  If you want to check it out, I've seen it in a few large retail stores, but wary the price, it's cheaper online.  Hope this helps.

<Title>Almost 5 stars but falls a little short in quality
<Date>Fri Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First off - this is a great MP3 player from the company that could be responsible for the affordable portable mp3 player market. The Carbon stores a lot of music and data and sounds great. A _huge_ bonus to this mp3 player is that it is a 5GB harddrive. You can literally take this mp3 player and plug it into the usb port of any computer and all of a sudden you have a portable 5GB diskdrive at your disposal to transport data. Yes, that's right, you can listen to all your music as well as store data on it (I do it all the time.)   An even better thing about this mp3 player is the drag and drop feature. You don't need any music software like iTunes, Rio Music Manager, etc to put music on this great player. All you need to do (if you don't like messing with music software) is plug your Carbon into the USB port and start dragging music onto the player as if you were moving files from one disk to another - it's that simple. Once you're done and unplug the Carbon from the computer it will turn itself on and recompile a file list and create a new playlist of music (this takes about 4-5 minutes.) Isn't that awesome?? This is how EVERY player should work - INCLUDING IPOD. A HUGE plus to Rio for the aforementioned feature.   Now, before we get all giddy about this mp3 player there are a few issues with the unit.   If your Carbon has a serial number that shows it was made before (I think) December of 2004 you will need to call Rio and get a little plastic spacer ring or a headphone adapter. Why do you need to get that? On the Carbons made before a certain date there is an issue with the headphone jack. The headphone jack is plated/metal and you get a crackling/shorted sound with traditional headphones. Most headphones have a metal ring around the male prong of the plug. When this metal ring touches the metal ring of the affected Carbons you get a short of the electrical signal that is supplying sound to the headphones. As a result you get a nice crackle in the sound. Carbons fix is to send out a little plastic spacer or an inline headhone cable jack. Both of these have a PLASTIC ring that eleminates that sound. Both solutions work great and it's just a matter of preference on which solution you want to use. It's just a shame that Rio had this problem in the first place. Now - keep in mind - you are ONLY going to have this issue if the unit is part of the original batch of Carbons that had this design issue. The MAJORITY of Carbons do NOT have this issue and the Carbon Pearl does not have this problem at all. Actually, as I'm writing this review I do _THINK_ that Rio is shipping the players WITH the adapters included so you don't have to mess with calling them.   Now, another problem that you will immediately see is the carrying case that comes with the unit. The carrying case that comes with the unit is a simple holster with no belt clip and NO OPENING FOR THE SCREEN OR BUTTONS. What on EARTH was Rio thinking??? The carrying case is completely USELESS. You can't clip it to your belt and you can't control the player without taking it OUT of the case. Now, in Rio's defense they do sell a PROPER case with a belt clip and holes for the controls and screen for like $19 online.   Another issue I have found that pops up from time to time but not often enough to be annoying is player lockup. Every now and then the player will decide it's had enough of my heavy metal music and lock up. All you need to do to make it behave like it's supposed to is poke a little paper clip into the reset hole on the top of the unit. I've had to do this maybe 3 times in the year that I've had it. This is something happens to any mp3 player so this is nothing to panic about.   One other thing that is a plus for Rio is their firmware support. Rio has always been really good for keeping the mp3 player firmware fresh. There have been 3 or 4 firmware updates for the Carbon. These updates range from bug fixes to feature additions. I _highly_ recommend that when you buy this mp3 player that you go to the Rio ([...] believe) and upgrade to the latest firmware.   I have had my player for over a year and aside from the items listed above I have enjoyed this player and I am also thoroughly satisfied with the player. I happen to have one of the earlier refurbished models with the metal ring around the headphone jack. As a result, I had to get the little plastic ring but it works fine. I use this mp3 player as a portable diskdrive as well as a great mp3 player. I work out a lot and I take this into the gym and it works great.   So, overall - if you're looking for a VERY affordable 5GB+ mp3 player that also doubles as a portable harddrive this is what you want.   If you are someone that is looking for a good gadget-type gift for a geek in your family or a family member that loves gadgets then they will love this.   I couldn't give this 5 stars because of the design flaws that I mentioned before.

Though I was just a minute away from clicking BUY on CompUSA.com when I remembered this player.  It has more storage space (at 5GB -> iPod's 2GB), longer battery life (20h -> iPod's 8h). Though it may not be color and have all those features it is still a better buy. However, Rio went under so if you can find this player get it. I got mine for under 200$.  The software installed fine, but requires that Windows Media Player 9 be installed as well, which is silly. It's because WMA files that are protected with DRM use MP9. I have two PC (XP & Win98 SE). I have had no issues with the USB plug-n-play under XP, however the player will not install fully under Win98 SE unless you have a USB 2.0 port, which mine does not. It will go through the motions, but when you try & access the drive it won't show up in the drives list even though the Device manger says it there.  Battery meter is not accurate. The firmware seems not to accurately report actual battery life. I have used this in a cross country trip (LA to Arkansas) and was able to listen to 12 hours of music, and the battery didn't die. I charged it full on a Monday and it died (shutoff) by Saturday after midnight. I had 23hrs of music in 388 files (96kbs to 320kbs). It shut off on song 311. So the battery IS just over 20h.  All in all a very great buy over the iPod fad. If you can find it, get it. Plus, you can put regular files on it and playlists.  NOTE: Someone said you can't generate playlist. You generate a playlist using Rio DJ Music Maganer, by using the Playlist function. Or with your MP3 program; then put the playlist on the Rio. The playlist will be listed under Play Music/Playlists.  ADDENDUMS: It will seem to drain away while off. I started the stopwatch, turned Rio off, then 8 hours later turned it on - the stopwatch was still running. I wanted to know just how long the battery lasted. The specifications says 20 hours. But, I used the stopwatch function and (pausing it when it turned it off and continued when i turned it back on) found out that tha battery ran out after 10 hours 10 minutes. I'll try again to see if I can get it to last for 20 hours like it supposed to.  I upgraded the firmware from 1.42 to 1.95 and the Rio Music Manager software from 2.90 to 2.96. Upgrading the firmware reformats the Rio, so backup your music first.  I have seen a implementaion difference in how the drive is formated (Data and Media folders are separate) and it now supports the PlayForSure music service from Microsoft -- not that I'll ever use it, I'm partial to Real Rhapsody. Also you can now play music from seprate folders.  As for whether the battery will now display accurately, we'll see how it handles.  Once at work it wouldn't come on, so I thought I'de broken it some how (the power button looked like it was going to slide out); I was even thinking about buying a new player (the 6 GB model even); but then 'my voice inside' said to just take it home and recharge it. Turns out it _was_ just out of battery juice. HAH! I'm so paranoid!  I love my Rio Carby!

<Content>I purchased a Rio mp3 player and it broke within a month.  Fortunately, I was still under warranty.  After many "outsourced" telephone conversations, they finally sent me a replacement.  This model was "refurbished".  I had purchased a new one and they replaced it with a refurbished one!  That just doesn't seem right...   After six months it stopped working all together.     Please take heed to the poor reviews on this product... You'll be glad you did.

<Title>Good, not great
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned this player for about 9 months.   The sound quality is very good, and the player definitely looks nice (subjective of course). The form factor is excellent, the player is light and the display is clear. The battery life is excellent, and using USB for charging is handy.  I do have one major gripe though. The response time of the player can be SLOW. I'm not sure how the firmware was written but it must be caching something or other. Every now and then it stops after I hit a control and it literally freezes for a few seconds. The worst case is actually when turning on the player. Mine takes around 30 full seconds to bootup. I know defragging the player's HDD reduces this but when you change your music you have to defrag again. I've read forums online and it seems most people's Carbons start up within 10 seconds... not sure why mine performs so poorly.  Some other gripes: Songs are only listed according to their ID3 tags (not folders) and the software has crashed on my PC to the point where I no longer use it.  Also, the part of my power adapter for the USB charging that plugs into the socket did not work when I received it! Fortunately I had an alternative way to plug it in.  However, since this is the first really portable mp3 player I've owned, I'm still very happy to have 5Gb of music with me anytime. I've used it a LOT.

<Title>everything but the voice recorder...
<Date>Fri Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love my rio. It's tough, sleek, pocket sized and easy to use. I recomend it to anyone looking to use it as just an mp3 player. If you were however considering using the mic for anything other than personal voice notes keep looking. I purchased my rio with the hope to record and play back lectures. Unfortunatly the mic is not anywhere near sensitive enough to be useful, so i'm passing my little rio on for something new.   Creative Labs new Zen Vision :M is boasting a lecture quality mic as well as fm, 30gigs, movie quality olcd and an MS office linking organiser. Alot of reviewers are calling this thing the ipot killer and they might be right. I am so in love with these funky swiss army knife style gagets! If they can slap a phone on that thing, and get some internet access they might have a chance of taking down the crackberry too.

<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned four (yes four) Rio Carbons. I have purchased two and both of them failed within 6 months. The front panel controls are easy to use and in general it is a nice player. This is an excellent sounding player, unfortunately it has the following defects- 1. it is subject to failure from shock and a portable player WILL be dropped at sometime or another. 2. It has a combination volume control and selection wheel which is both over sensitive and too fragile if used during exercise or physical activity. 3. It is SLICK and (see above) has no attachment point for a lanyard or other device to prevent dropping it.   I had to upgrade the firmware upon receipt of all four players and cannot figure out why Rio couldn't get that done at the factory especially since two of these were refurbished warranty replacement units that came out LONG after the firmware upgrade.   Rios customer service is very good and I wish the player had been nearly that good

<Content>I have had my Carbon for almost a year now. I don't know what's up with those shock issues, because god knows I drop this thing enough and accidentally abuse it. The only thing that I can find wrong is that no one makes protective cases or skins for them. Sure they give you the leather case when you buy it, but you can't easily acess the controls. I personally have made my own plastic cover for it. The only reason I feel this is a big deal is because like iPods, the nice shiny backing gets scratched waaay to easy. I really recommend getting one of these, here's hoping you get as good a version as I have.

<Title>good product while it lasts
<Date>Sat Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>ive had my rio carbon player for about 1 1/2 years and it has worked flawlessly until recently. for the first year i encountered absolutely no problems with the carbon and found that i liked it much more than an ipod, due to its size/shape and how easy it was to use, the only complaints that i had in the first year were fairly nitpicky in that the headphones stopped working after about 6 months (which isnt a big deal since headphones are easily replaceable) i also found it a pain to scroll through all of the artists to find a specific song that i want to listen to because this takes a long time (which is one feature in which the ipod is superior). the player is fairly easy to use and the software for the computer is also user friendly with easy playlist options and it is also simple to modify the title for the songs. it doesnt take very long to upload the music to the player and the player instantly recognizes what songs you already have on it so it wont waste space by duplicating the song on the player. i found the carrying case useless since you cannot access the front buttons while it is in its case and it is an extremely tight fit, making it difficult to insert and remove the player from its case, so i rarely use it. when i first purchased this mp3 player the stupid best buy employee told me that it could hold 5000 songs which is what made me choose this product over others, however i was extremely disappointed to find that it can only hold between 600-700 songs, and while that still is a great deal of songs this did not meet my expectations and it came nowhere near the amount of songs i wanted to put on it, making it sort of a pain to change my songs and go through all of them to pick and choose which songs i wanted to listen to rather than just having all of my songs at my fingertips. recently i have been having problems with my carbon player and have been pleased when i call the customer service center, they have been able to help me a great deal each time i call in getting my carbon to function again (i have called a total of 4 times in the past 6 months) however today i called them since my carbon player said it had no songs on it but when i plugged it into my computer it said that the player was full and they tried to help me as best they could but ultimately they told me in the sweetest way they could that there was an internal issue within my player and that i need to get a new mp3 player, which is disappointing since it seems like an mp3 player should last longer than 1 1/2 years. what surprised me most of all was that the rio employee suggested that i research the mp3 player much more before purchasing it (which i most certainly will do) and that i should really look at other types of mp3 players, basically telling me that i should not get another rio carbon 5 gb player. i will certainly follow this employees advice and do not plan on purchasing another rio product in the future, if you are considering purchasing this mp3 player i recommend that you do so only if you dont mind getting a new one in a year or two... but hey, you can do what you want, this is only my experience with one carbon, if you decide to get one hopefully you will have better luck than i did

<Title>Awesome Durable Product
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this MP3 Player as a gift for Christmas last year.  I love it! I have not had a single problem with it. I'm in the Navy. I just got back from a 6 month deployment where I used it heavily. It's so small that it takes up no room at all in my rack. I could carry it around in my uniform pocket. It's gotten dropped a million times and still works. It's had some books and stuff dropped on it. I've used it almost every day in the gym for a couple of hours a day and it's worked great. The only gripes I have are the speakers that came with it aren't as durable as the player. Those broke after about 2 months. The product support for this, cases and accessories sucks. I finally found a case by case logic that sort of fits it and straps to my arm. And the buttons are sometimes easy to hit and change the song or pause it. Other than that I love it. I would definitely recommend it and am going to buy one for my wife.

This tiny dynamo has it all in a device that fits in the palm of your hand.  The sound is great.  I loaded all of my favorite songs from my music collection and still have 2 meg of space left.  The only negative is the carring case.  You have to remove the player from the case to use it.  Highly recommended.

<Date>Thu Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>If you're thinking of buying an MP3 player, you should probably ask yourself a question: Am I the type of person that forks over 200+ bucks for something that might not last me a week?   The first Rio Carbon I bought lasted me four days. I got it replaced with another one and it lasted me less than 5 hours. Rio has done an awful job engineering this product.   And my friends haven't had much luck w/ IPods (they die out after several months). This, of course, concerns me since companies are distrubting faulty products. If you're thinking of buying an MP3 player, please wait for the products to be improved. I sure learned my mistake about it.

<Title>Best of Class - Great Size to Capacity Ratio
<Date>Tue Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been a big fan of the Rio hard drive MP3 players having owned a 1.5GB Nitrus for over a year and have played with the quite similar 20GB Karma for a while.  I loved my Nitrus, but my biggest complaint was that I wished there were just a bit more room.  The second I saw the 5GB Carbon, which is roughly the same size as the Nitrus, I knew I had to have it.  When my Nitrus broke, it turned into an opportunity to get a Carbon.   On a side note, hard drive mp3 players apparently do not survive 20 foot drops very well.  But I digress.  Pluses:  1)  The size!!!  Like the Nitrus, this is still the largest benefit.  It is smaller and lighter than the 4GB Mini-Ipod and about the same size as the Nitrus.  I can carry it in any pocket with no problems.  Not only is it small, but it is very lightweight.  I don't even notice it being in my pocket. 2)  The capacity!!  The Nitrus held 1.5GB, which was pretty decent.  The larger I-Pod Mini holds 4GB, which is obviously better.  But this puppy holds 5GB.  Right now is has four different music playlists and four books and I've barely put a dent into the amount of space it holds.  All this in a little-itty bitty package.  Brilliant! 3)  Volume control.  The Nitrus had two flimsy-feeling buttons.  Now you use the scrolling wheel.  This is so much easier, especially while wearing gloves or fidgeting through a case. 4)  The battery.  My old Nitrus ran forever, and now the Carbon runs even longer.  I rarely run out of battery on my Nitrus (I just had to charge it once every few days) and I've yet to run out on the Carbon.  I do hit the road often and it is nice to not have to tote a power cord everywhere I go for it.  Mixed Reviews:  1)  Voice recorder.  This would be great if there were a quick and easy way to make recordings.  Instead, you need to go through the menuing system and even then it takes a bit for it to start recording.  If you wish to make a quick note, it'd be faster to grab a sticky pad.  And the results aren't that fantastic.  It is really hard to figure out the perfect distance to get a good recording as it offers no feedback on audio recording levels (it's always too much or too little, never just right). 2)  USB.  You now use the USB to charge the Carbon and to upload/modify music selections.  However, the USB must carry a certain amount of power.  This renders my laptop unable to transfer the files or even synchronize.  But, when the Carbon is attached to my computer and is idle, my computer will actually charge the battery.  An annoying drawback is that when you plug in the power, the Carbon doesn't know if it is power or a computer hookup so it will power on.  Many a times I've hooked it up to power it and then come over to find it running.  Instead, you need to hang around awhile and make sure to turn it off afterwards. 3)  The case.  I almost put this in the negative column but since the Nitrus didn't even include a case, I decided to move it into mixed.  This is not really much of a case, though, but more of a protective covering.  You can't attach it to anything like a belt clip, so be prepared to buy a new case for this.  Believe me, you'll want it (please see earlier reference to 20 foot drop).  But I use the included case with my newly purchased case.  If you look at their online manual, the case actually looks nice.  Too bad the one depicted there wasn't shipped with the Carbon.  Negatives:  1)  Support.  Their web site is lousy while trying to get answers.  Software updates are a breeze, I'll give them that, but I can't figure out anything else.  It is nearly impossible to get a live body to lend a hand in times of need.  And as somebody else pointed out, this only comes with a 90 day warranty... though my Nitrus lasted over a year with no problems, except the lack of a parachute. 2)  Playlists:  You can only make them at the computer and they can often be difficult to make correctly (I often listen to audio books so they MUST be in a certain order).  I hate being on the road when I realize that the books got jumbled up.  This is also a big complaint of my mother's, who also owns a Rio. 3)  The cover:  The stainless steel looks awesome, but with certain headphones I get a lot of static.  Including their own earbuds!!!  Talk about a major oversight.  How annoying.  In the end, I would highly recommend this over any other player if you are looking for something in the 5GB size.  If you actually need 20GB, look at the Rio Karma.  That is a fine piece of machinery as well.  If you are insane and need more than that (why are you reading this review then????) then look at the I-Pods which sport hard drives as large as 80GB.

<Title>Use safety pin to insert in "Emergency Reset" hole!
<Date>Tue Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am enjoying my new Rio Carbon 5GB MP3 Player which I received for Christmas.    However, after a day of playing, it froze and needed &#34;rebooting&#34;, like any computer sometimes requires.  One reboots by inserting a nonsupplied pin (I used a small safety pin) in the &#34;Emergency Reset&#34; hole on the upper right of the top next to the player's volume control.  This fixed the problem immediately.   This one freeze-up which my Rio player experienced was probably the fault of the dubiously edited spoken word file I had been playing when it crashed (the file had long duplicate segments of audio spliced together on the end).  I have not replayed the file for a test of my theory, but I have used the player extensively since then with no untoward consequences.  I like the Rio Carbon's organically futurist design and easy operation.  I think it out-sleeks the iPod Mini in style.    The only odd thing is a noticable delay in response to control clicks when in the &#34;Recorder&#34; mode.  Click the upward &#34;&#62;||&#34; option and there's about a second delay before the solid circle in the diamond appears and thereby indicates it's recording speech -- and clicking the same option to pause recording likewise has the same delay.  However, the recordings are clear even without holding the small microphone close up.  With my Rio Carbon, I now enjoy spoken word and music audios from several sources by playing them amost anyplace anytime.  I've downloaded two 'podcasts', the lastest Internet trend which is based on the Apple iPod Mini and similar MP3 players such as the Rio Carbon.  'Podcasting' began a few months ago with advent of the iPodder program for Apple and Windows. (Technically speaking, iPodder is an aggregator for RSS newsfeeds containing MP3 enclosures.)  For the future, I expect podcasting to keep my Rio Carbon loaded with a stream of new content.  ITcoversations.com is a great source of IT industry conference talks, all for free, all announced via podcasting.  And, at 30 MB an hour, the 5 GB hard drive of the Rio Carbon is a good portable listening device for these informative geek talks about how the world's going to change as a result of what's happening in techiedom.  Another spoken word audio source for one's Rio Carbon player is Audible.com, from which I've purchased a couple of audio books (&#34;Masters of Atlantis&#34; & &#34;The Dream of Reason&#34;).  The Rio Carbon comes with info on an offer of a free month's trial membership.  This offer isn't advertised, but there was a coupon inside my Rio Carbon plastic encasement with the URL for the offer.  A free month gives an immediate free audio book (unabridged) and a free month's access to subscription audio (such as downloads of the weekday Charlie Rose Show interviews).  Best of all, it gives access to purchasing as many audio books during the month as you like at the heavily discounted price of $10 each.  Check out this option when buying.    The Rio Carbon 5 GB MP3 Player can utilize the special Audible.com format for spoken word audio.  Somehow this audio format not only compresses 8 hours into around 60 MB of file space, but also seems to speed up the reader's speech without distortion, thereby allowing only a little over two minutes per typical page.  Or maybe these professional readers are just very fast talkers. Yet it takes me about 3.5-4 minutes to read a page aloud, at my quickest.  Additionally, in regard to 'mobilizing' my music collection, I have been able to indulge my taste for the exotica of avante-garde classical music by &#34;ripping&#34; a few of my old audio CDs into MP3 VBR format.  For example, on my Rio Carbon, the noisy Edgard Varese is now only a few clicks away at anytime so I can give my nerves a jangle whenever needed on late weekend evenings, as a sort of aural equivalent of caffine.  ;-)  For background music in idle moments, or for &#34;spacing out&#34; in meditation, the Rio Carbon does an excellent job of reproducing the solo piano music of Dr. Will M. Tuttle's &#34;The Call&#34; album (I chose the 'Best' MP3 VBR format under the Rio Manager program and ripped the entire CD).  The Rio Carbon 5GB MP3 Player greatly enhances the value of one's music collection, by making it transportable and selectively accessible via customized 'playlists'.  I compared the popular Apple iPod Mini (4GB) and chose the Rio Carbon (5 GB) instead, and I have yet find a significant downside to my choice.    For scholars, students,  and other note takers, it is important to point out that the Rio Carbon comes with a built-in voice recorder feature.  If I recall correctly, the Apple iPod Mini has no built-in voice recorder.  All other things equal, and ignoring the 25% greater storage capacity of the Rio Carbon, the voice recording feature leads to the Rio Carbo ranking better than the iPod Mini.  Note: A recent review of the Rio Carbon and other MP3 players in the New York Times' Technology section states that there is a known problem in use of non-Rio headphones on the Rio Carbon -- they cause a 'static' noise.  But I've personally found the small earphones supplied with the Rio Carbon adequate because I mainly listen to spoken word recordings and have found a way to wear them comfortably.  My recommendation is to buy.  I did.  Yet keep in mind that this is a device designed to work in conjuction with one's computer (there's no other way of loading it with music & talk audio content).  Hence, it's not for technophobes.

<Content>After Months of waiting Rio finally released the Rio Carbon LE. I quickly snatched it up from Rio's wed site with a special deal. I loved this player for about 2 months when it stopped working!!! Rio's Customer Service is the worst I've ever had to deal with. When i finally got a hold of someone she told me that there was an error with the design of the LE and to send it back. I did so and still havent recieved a new one. They sent me an email saying it was shipped then the next day sent me another one saying that there on backorder. I told them to give me a refund, still havent gotten it. This all started about 4 months ago and I'm still without an MP3 player. I still want a Carbon but I'm nervous about buying one of the Carbons from Best Buy or Circut city to get the same problem. The Rio Carbon is the best player for its size(5gb players) but they really need to work on their service and support.

At first it was great. A few navigation gripes here and there but other than that it was perfect. Then I get a black screen and irresponsive buttons 3 days later. I reset the carbon. It works for 4 more days then it dies. Perhaps a change in the manufacturing might help fix this. As for me, I'm returning it for an ipod mini. From what I've heard it's MUCH more reliable.

<Title>Good features, no DRM crap, fragile scrollwheel
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had one of these for 3 months. Just broke the wheel, now it's useless, aside from being a slick-looking 5GB USB hard drive. Pros: Super-easy music transfer on Windows, just use Windows Explorer file drag and drop, or Media Player (yes, I know a lot of you think it's garbage, but I like it). No Apple or Sony-esque stealth DRM nonsense. Battery life and feature set as-advertised, no complaints. Cons: Scrollwheel fundamentally flawed. Rolling the wheel traverses very few selections, meaning endless scrolling across long lists. Worse, for me, like some other reviewers, I broke the fragile scrollwheel. Unlike others, mine is completely lost, so I can't even try to disasemble the unit and glue it back on. Also, the reviews are right, most quality headphones have metal jacks and will short out (how did they miss *this* in testing?!). Other than that, I loved it, but won't replace it because of the fragile wheel and the fact that the manufacturer is getting out of this business. If you'll treat it gingerly and you're willing to use the included plastic-plug headphones, it's a great value. If not, and you're DRM-averse, go with iRiver.

<Title>Solution?? Please read if you have UPGRADER MODE PROBLEM
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like my Rio Carbon a lot, regardless of the Upgrader problem which I was able to fix. After about 3-4 months, my Rio Carbon got stuck in the UPGRADER mode. After trying all the manuals suggestion w/ no luck, I read somewhere that somebody just gave it a tap in the back and that made it work (place the Rio face down in your right hand and give it a little tap or 2 in the back  with your left hand.) I tried doing it and gave it 3 taps in the back (I felt like I was burping a Baby) I connected it to the computer, the MP3 hard drive made a noise and the upgrader mode went away. All my music was still there and it is working  fine after a week.  Before getting the upgrader mode, I was downloading music from the Windows media player,I was not using the Rio program which probably cause the upgrader mode problem. Also, it looks like downloading upgrades cause problems on some Rios (must of the people w/ the Upgrader mode problem say that it happens after they do a software upgrade. So used the original software CD to reinstall the program or download that version. I do not guaranty that this method of fixing it will work for anybody, I also don't know how long it will work. I am not responsible for any damages to your MP3 if you decide to try it. I am just stating that my Rio worked after doing it. I figured, after trying everything else to get rid of the problem and since it wasn't working anyway,  might as well try it. It worked for me, so good luck.

<Title>Forget this one
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Purchased Rio Carbon last January. After numerous calls to Rio due to faulty software, firmware, etc., I then had to have unit replaced three times! The scroll wheel broke twice! Rio has gone out of business, having sold out to another company.The price has dropped 30% for a reason.  Stay away!

<Title>Very good player, but alas Rio is no more
<Date>Mon Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The best features of this player are, in my opinion, the self-indexing ability (drag & drop music without software), the great battery life, the small size and good looks, and the high sound quality.  Also, some will find the Janus-DRM compatibility (for Napster & other subscription services) very handy.  I wish it had the ability to create playlists on the fly, and that the scroll wheel wasn't so crucial (if it breaks you cannot adjust the volume).  The first Carbon I had died (the hard drive stopped working and the player would error out to upgrader mode), but luckily the replacement plan I purchased came in handy.  Bottom line:  A great player for its time, but now with Rio out of business, there are probably better-supported alternatives.

<Title>$99 to repair after initial warrenty.
<Date>Tue Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Im yet another sufferer of the volume control wheel poping off. And since it did such with the volume low ....which in my opinion this player could use to be abit louder...this player is now completely useless as anything but a small audio storage device.  Another complaint I have is with the audio jack...using headphones that dont ahve a plastic stoper when connected to the device causes a great deal of static with movement.  And since Rio is going out of buisness...the product is no longer worth anyones time or money.  Never had any other issues with it....it was decent before this incident.

<Title>Stay away from Rio Carbons -- They're Highly Problematic.
<Date>Wed Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am extremely disappointed with the Rio Carbon-- I would not recommend it.  In the first month, I had many problems with the player not starting, the player completely freezing, and the player constantly shutting down in the middle of play.  The final straw was when the jogger dial caved in.  The player had not been dropped or jolted in anyway.  When I sent the player in, they sent me back a "refurbished," i.e. USED player.  This used player was heavily scratched up on the back.  I did not pay full money for a new Rio Carbon only to receive a used one.  And now, I am having the exact same problems with this "new" player.  The jogger dial has once again caved in without provocation.  The player continuously shuts down in the middle of play.  And to top everything, the customer service is highly adversarial and certainly not helpful or sympathetic.  My advice?  Stay clear of Rio players.

<Title>Do NOT buy a Rio Carbon!!!
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I will never ever buy from Rio again! I had the Rio Carbon for exactly 4 months and it broke! I suspect it's the battery and you can't replace the battery. I called Rio Support, long distance, of course. Rio Support wanted $99 to fix it. Forget it! I will not pay $99 for something that will mostly likely break in 4 months again. I may be a fool once, but not twice. I am going to buy a Creative Zen instead. My niece had a Creative Zen for a little over 1 year. She dropped her Zen and it broke. However, the big difference is that she called Creative and Creative sent her a brand new replacement for FREE! Yes, that right! Creative sent my niece a brand new replacement, a new model too, for FREE. That's what I called great Customer Support. Rio Carbon should take a lesson from Creative. Rio Carbon SUCKS!!!

<Title>Doesn't Hold up!
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought one for my 15-year old and my brother bought one for himself. The wheel on both became dislodged, ours after about 95 days (or just a few days after the warranty expired)and the other after about 7 months. Trying to get an answer on how to get them repaired was impossible and after many hours online and several faxes to Rio, we gave up. Instead we bought earphones with volume adjusment and got by without the click-wheel navigation feature. After 8 months, one of the units was fell accidentally off a shelf and onto a hardwood floor and that was the end of that! Recommend you check the warranty and talk to others about their experiences B4 you decide which MP3 to buy.

<Title>Negative Experience
<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Only one person's experience, but I purchased this and had to send it back for three replacements to try to get one that would last over two weeks without suddenly going blank and dying.  I eventually gave up as it is too expensive to keep shipping it back to the RMA center.  As other reviewers mention, returning a Rio Carbon likely will result in receiving a refurbished model.  I ultimately went with a Dell DJ, which works well.

<Content>after reading several reviews i decided on this model , purchased from best buy with an extended warrenty , just in case so far it has preformed brilliantly, excellent battery life no need for a car charger ( it was on for a few 18 hour streaches - still life on battery before recharge) files were easy to download through windows explorer or media player can play audible books ( not all mp3 players can ) in fact mine came with a coupon for two free audible books built in EQ does work , purchased good sony earbuds and coated the base with nail polish- no static problems- sounds great can download music from several sources , no need to be locked into one source ( i-tunes ) has shuffle play and yes you can fast forward or reverse through any song that is playing never skipped in the car , just to test it out i tapped it on my table fairly hard and it still didnt skip i used a leather punch borrowed from a friend put a hole in the case purchased a black leather shoe string from walmart and now i wear it around my neck for chores in and out of the house  so far im rather pleased with it, i do recammend the extended warrenty just im case that microharddrive fails, after 3 years ill be ready for a new one anyways

<Title>The Best - for now!
<Date>Tue Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a really volatile market, so watch for new products. Having said that, this is the market leader for now in my view.  I went from a Creative Jukebox to an iPod, and was quite pleased with it. But the case started to split and the battery life diminished, so I decided to try the new mini. But this little beast sat next to it on the counter and I compared the two. This baby makes the iPod mini look out of date and clunky, uncool even!  Touching wood, I have had no problems to date (3 months use) with reliability, but the useability is superb. I love the controls and the clarity of the screen, although the carrying case is badly designed.  But you buy one of these for the sound, and I recommend that you listen to one. Compared with the iPod, it gives a cleaner, sharper sound which is, I suspect, as close to CD quality as we are likely to experience on an MP3 player for some time.  Battery life is really good (although I cant say I have tested the manufacturers claims), way better than iPods.   To summarize, it is a real "feel good" machine. Try it and fall in love with it.

<Title>Review-Rio Carbon
<Date>Sun Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Carbon is by far and away the best portable audio device that I have ever used. Plenty of features and all are very easy to use. 5 GB of memory is more than enough, and certainly as much as I will ever need. Sound is incredible and is very easy to customize with the equalizer to your own personal liking. The only negative is the ear buds. Very uncomfortable, sub-standard sound quality, and constantly falling out of my ears. I purchased a set of "in the ear" buds from Radio Shack ($21.99) which completed an almost already perfect package. Awsome product!!!

<Date>Mon Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This product advertises Macintosh interface. It will interface with a Mac, but not gracefully and consistently. But the main problem is that IT WILL NOT TRANSFER PLAYLISTS USING ITUNES ON A MAC!!! Why is this important? Perhaps you're not a teeny bopper downloading the latest tunes from the net but a person who loves classical music and opera and need playlists for efficient storage/transfer. I returned this product and bought an IPod which will do what I need it to do.

<Title>A sleek little gem that holds a lot!
<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had never owned a digital music player before I, on a whim, really, ordered the Rio Carbon "Limited Edition" (first 500 units made).  I travel a lot and wanted to be able take my music collection with me in the car and on the plane.  When I received it, back in September, I was amazed at how small it really was. I started loading it up with my CD collection, and found that I had plenty of room left over.  Syncing it with Windows Media Player 10 was a joy, as was the ease of use and the great sound quality.  I had never really thought about the Audible support, but I tried the free month and was hooked, downloading books and the daily New York Times.  I listened to Bill Clinton reading his "My Life" during a long car trip, and was enthralled.  The Carbon does Audible navigation very well, allowing fast forward and rewinding, skipping forward and backward through chapters, and has the ability to save up to 10 "bookmarks". It has the iPod beat here in many ways.  The battery life is truly astounding.  The meter will appear to show that it is low, but it will keep playing for hours more.  I do have some minor gripes - the user interface can be confusing in some places, where you have to know which of "click the scroll wheel", "press the menu button" or "press the OK button" you need for a particular function.  But I picked it up soon enough.  I would also like the ability to create playlists on the fly, rather than having to upload them, but that is minor. Lastly, the case provided protects the player well, but you can't get at any controls when in the case!  I do like that the controls are all findable "by feel", even if the player is tucked in my pocket.  I've now owned the Carbon for almost five months, and it is giving me a lot of pleasure.  If you're in the market for a small and sexy hard disk player, this is the one to get.

<Title>What's an iPod?
<Date>Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing is perfect.  My ONLY issue has nothing to do with the player but with the leather carrying case.  It doesn't help much having to remove the player from the case each time you need to fiddle with controls.  The player itself is a dream.  It's smaller than the iPod mini but gives you an extra gig of storage.  I especially like its flat, smooth ergonomics.  It fits nicely in the front pocket of your jeans.  You don't realize it's even there.  It sounds great and it plays wma files which is very nice.  I don't care too much for the lack of lossless wma playback as those files carry huge file size overhead.  I honestly don't have a negative thing to say about this audio player.  I have one of the 500 limited edition models and am still as enamored with it now as the day I got it.  It's one of those rare products that actually delivers exactly what you'd expect from it.  And with some of the deals that Amazon has on this thing right now, I'm amazed that they aren't sold out.

<Title>Looks cool and sounds great but...
<Date>Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little player looks cool and has great sound but. About 20 percent of the tracks skip like an old record player.(I thought we were way past that!) Rio support's response was upgrade the firmware which had already been done. When I informed them of this they disappeared off of the face of the earth. I don't know about you but that is totally unacceptable. Whatever happened to SERVICE in this country.  Buy an Ipod and avoid this crappy company. It will work properly at least until until the battery dies.

<Title>Cool little mp3 player!
<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was going to wait and save up for an Ipod but I found a good deal on the Rio Carbon and had to snatch it. It is a cool little mp3 player that sports a 5gb hard drive with built in voice recording. I like how it automatically sets up on Windows XP as an external drive and you can drag and drop files immediately. Made sure I downloaded the latest firmware for it before I started messing with the settings. The sound I would say is a little above average, had to mess with the equalizer to get it the way I wanted it. There are presets for Rock, Jazz, Techno, etc. The other good thing is that it accepts WMA files so I didn't have to convert any of my previous WMA tracks. I thought the menu access was kinda quirky, everytime you select and change something it automatically goes back to the audio screen and you would have to press the menu button again to get back. The volume button doubles up as the scroll button which is surprisingly fast to the touch. I like how it charges via USB and the battery life is a whopping 20 hours after one charge. Overall, I would rate this player 4 out of 5 stars. I would've given it a 5 if it wasn't for the menu access thing and the lack of a dedicated hold button (but can easily be done through the menu settings).

<Date>Mon Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Great player. Very easy to use. I didn't even need to read the directions to use the software.  Excellent sound quality.  Very compact.  The only thing is the case is not very functional. You can't access the controls when it is in the case.  I bought a generic arm band case at Target so I can store it when I walk.  Definately worth the money over the Ipod.  Purchased at NewEgg.com $199.00, no tax, free shipping. That is $50 less than in the stores. I bought this over two weeks ago, and I have not had to charge the battery yet (after initial charge, ofcourse). Used it in the car with a FM transmitter and had very good quality.  I just order speakers for it.  I also purchased new headphones for it, but the ones that came with it were fine.  I just like a different style. I give this MP3 player 2 thumbs up.
