<Title>Crippled Functionality
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Once again, Sony has designed a great product with incredible functionality only to severely cripple it with over the top digital rights management. I bought this unit to transfer legally purchased mp3 files (that do play on my iPod) only to find out that they "cannot play". Sony tech support indicates that the hardware will not allow mp3's to play if the drm cannot be ascertained - I sent them one of the files and they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work either. It does do some things exceptionally well, such as play music, has fairly simple controls, great battery life and takes disposable batteries as well as a rudimentary but functional display that lights up to make it easier to see at night. It also holds a lot of songs as Sony indicates in their literature. Unfortunately, it does require that you use the Sony supplied software to transfer songs into it - and the Sonic Stage software is nowhere as user friendly as the Apple iTunes software.

<Title>Techno At It's Best
<Date>Fri Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The unit is small, light, and easy to use.  The faceplate/button combo has a firm feel to it with no sloppiness.  The only thing I am a little disappoined in is that I can only fit 133 songs on the unit, but for the price, I can live with it.  I can live with it just fine.  One more point;  The AAA battery gives all the time promised and then some.  Overall, I love it!

<Title>Avoid It - Not an MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Listen to Gadgetphile's review - I got this player today as a birthday gift, and I get the CANNOT PLAY message for every MP3 that I own (yes, OWN; I've never downloaded an illegal MP3). Evidently, the people who love this player use Sony's music service and ATRAC format. Thank goodness the giver kept the receipt; this player is going back to the store tomorrow. As usual, Sony is so obsessed with proprietary formats that they've ruined their chances in another lucrative market. This is the Betamax of MP3 players.

<Title>NW-E100
<Date>Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>this is my first mp3 player and i just chose it after a good research over net and considering my budget.at first wanted to buy an iPod but considering the fact that,going to buy a PMP in near future,decided to go with flash-based players and also lower the price as much as i can my choices now become:creative zen n200-Shuffle-NWe100 series.considering shuffles lack of features my main choice became N200 because of low price and featured-pack  package,but when i saw all those awfull ratings reviewers gave it and seeing it at store i went with my last choie:NW-E103 cause it has the nearest price to N200 and never go back. and now my expressions: after i got it,i must say it is very beautiful and stylish(i picked the one with Orange color)to hide in your pocket!and also very small.sound quality is extreme as expected from sony products dont let other reviewers confuse you,it IS excellent. and for the software side you can either Drag&Drop by updating mp3 file manager to v.2.o or using sonicstage 3.0-i must say after reading all those reviews which say it is a crap i found it very useful and also beautiful UI you can with a little effort import all your library and(you must rearrenge it) and then transfer them.you can also convert your songs to atrack3/plus and reduce their size so that you can double or triple your players space,wich i find very nice and useful,you can play with the settings and choose the bitrate that best suits you-in most cases you cant tell the diffrence after compression. the unit itself is well-built and can last a long time.face plate buttons are very intuitive and nice my only compliant is the usb cover and Hold switch wich are not that easy to operate and wish it had 512mb or 1gb thats why i gave it 4 stars. over all very happy to buy it and recommend it.

<Title>Decent player, still inferior to the iPod
<Date>Sun Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Overall, this MP3 player works fine. The included software (SonicStage) comes with a utility to convert MP3 files over to Sony's proprietary format - ATRAC. Converting the MP3's over to ATRAC3 format is kind of time consuming, but if you're trying to cram as many songs as possible on there it can be of benefit, since the file size is smaller after conversion.  The features of the unit are nice for such a low-end MP3 Player. You can adjust bass and treble, along with "Sound" level, which I gather is some kind of sound-enhancement utility. The little slider on the top of the unit is nifty, allowing you to switch between "Folder" mode and "Track" mode. I like to organize my music in folders so being able to switch between folders with ease is a must. The slider also allows you to go to "Hold" mode, which is a similar feature to locking the keypad on cell phones. If you select Hold mode, you can put the player in your pocket and not have to worry about accidentally pressing any buttons. Then, of course, you have standard options such as Repeat and Shuffle.  The SonicStage program interface is probably one of the worst designed applications I've ever seen, but transferring files in it isn't so difficult.  Overall I would say that if you have money for an iPod or an iPod Nano, get one. The only reason I got this instead of an iPod Shuffle was the LED on the front. I like having some kind of a display. But the iPod and iTunes are BY FAR the best products on the market when it comes to digital music. If you're just looking for something simple and cheap, and don't mind a little extra work then this is the player for you.

<Title>Gift for son
<Date>Thu Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Teenagers love gadgets and this one saved the day.  We bought the Sony MP3 player for Christmas (we opened early) and I set up and downloaded the 5 songs that came free with the purchase of the player.  Setting up the software was a snap, and downloading the free songs was easy.  Moving them over to the player took less than 2 minutes and the playback was wonderful.  My son's friend has the same player, however an older version, and his headphones are not as good as my son's are.  This player has sound volume like I never imagined such a little player would have.  It's small and fits into a shirt pocket easily.  I also love that it came with all connectors and software, to include ear covers.  The music can be stored in folders or individually, which helps keep things in order.  The software also has the ability to transfer your current music into the network format, so you can have your favorite songs (legally purchased) converted over to the player.  I love it, and more importanly, my son really loves it!

<Title>Pretty good
<Date>Thu Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my second mp3 player and I love it. Before buying this one I had a Creative Micro Zen, which was amazing, but worked for only a month, then the headphone jack brake and since I didn't have the guarantee (in fact I bought it in Canada and I live in Chile) I just sold it by pieces. Then I made an extensive research and I realized that-of the people I know-the ones with Sony mp3 players were the happiest, in fact they were more satisfied than the people who owned iPods. So I bought this player.  The first thing I liked about it is the small size and weight (useful). Putting music on it it's easy too, eventhough transforming 100 mp3 songs into atrac3plus took me like 2 hours o__o. Anyways...the sound it's nice too, I have some big noise-cancelling Phillip headphones and the player works really nice with them. Oh, and a AAA battery last a lot(I bought the player on Xmas and I haven't change the battery since then...).  So if you're looking for a cheap player, try this one, it's the best choice =)

<Title>Piece of Junk - Don't Buy
<Date>Mon Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'm glad I don't write reviews right away after receiving a gift, because I would have mistakingly given this product a good one.  I thought the sound was pretty good, and was impressed with the amount of songs it held, and the battery life.  I received the Sony Psyc MP3 Player (in blue) for Christmas.  That evening I set up the software, used my 5 free downloads, and put a couple of my own CD's on it also.  Everything went smoothly, and I used it a few times, thinking this thing was great!  My problems started when I wanted to transfer all my purchased downloads from Realplayer.  This mp3 player wasn't supported.   I put the mp3 player on my dresser and there it sat for about 2 weeks.  When I went to use it again, it would lock up and/or shut itself off.  I couldn't access the menu, and my computer wouldn't recognize it when I hooked it up to the USB cable.  After sitting on the phone with Sony, I realized this thing was just dead.   So I made an even exchange for the same style Sony.  I went to transfer the songs I purchased from the enclosed Sony software, and it says it cannot transfer this type of file. HELLO??? It's from your site Sony!  You can't even accomodate songs from your own site?  I've had enough of this $90 piece of junk.  I would never recommend this player to anyone.  It's been nothing but a headache.

<Title>Good Quality Product at a Fair Price
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First I must say that I am a fan of Sony products. I have always liked their performance and their price. I own several items including a Home Stereo, two digital cameras, a video camera and my home computer is Sony.   So naturally I looked at Sony when I decided to buy an MP3 player. I read the reviews and shopped around. I decided on this one because the 1GB ones were on backorder. I was very concerned over the reviews that said the Sony Proprietary software was difficult and a real hassle to mess with. Now maybe I am biased because I like Sony, but the software was no more difficult than anything else. I downloaded the software, rebooted the system, and within minutes I was downloading music and listening. No problems, no hassle. Maybe it is because it is a Sony computer, but it was easy.   Now I am not going to say that it is the greatest MP3 player out there. But if you are looking for a good quality sound with a fair price. I highly recommend this one. I would assume the 1GB would be just as good, only it holds more music. As far as that goes, The 512MB is pretty good as far as storage. I don't have quite the 345 songs that it claims(around 200), but most of the songs I have are over the 3.5min. average that they suggest and I still have 100MB of storage left. The battery seems to last quite a while like they claim too. I didn't get out the stopwatch and time it exactly, but it is a long time on one battery.  If you would force me into finding something negative about this item, I would have to say that the button that switches it from file to folder to hold is a little hard to move to the correct position by touch alone, but that to me is minor. So, overall I am pleased with the purchase and well worth the money. If I had to do it over again, I might get the 1GB just because it could hold more, but I'm not sure that I need all that anyways. Enjoy!

<Title>great hardware, frustrating proprietary software
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The hardware is great. I'm very impressed by the battery life, weight, etc. Unfortunately there are two problems with the software/firmware which are overly proprietary. 1. The device is incredibly finicky about codecs. Many files can be played only by converting them to WAV and back to MP3 or ATRAC. 2. There's no drag and drop, you have to use Sonic Stage to get files on the device. So if you plan on buying files from Sony or using Sony's software to rip cds, it's great. But if you want to leave the Sony bubble and use, say podcasts, it can be a serious hassle.

<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Here's the rub. If you use a legal download service such as Rhapsody, the files won't play in this device. So, you are forced to use Sony's at $1.00 a track as opposed to .79 or less. I blew 20 bucks downloading from Rhapsody into my sony and it wouldn't recognize the files. Really a pain. I just wanted a small, lightweight MP3 player. What I got was a big pain in the butt.

<Content>I have had mine for about 3 mobths.  It does exactly what I want it to do. I wanted it to play music in the car as I have a daily commute to work.  I have a tape player in my car, so I bought a tape deck converter and play the music from the sony network walkman through the stero system of my car.  The network walkman is very easy to use and the battery life is long.  Just remember to turn it off!  In my case when I turn off the car, the player is still playing and I have to manually turn it off or it runs down the battery.  The only thing that disappoints me about it, is now they have come out with the cutest pink/gray version.  Very girly and fun!

<Title>I HATE this device
<Date>Thu Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All of my past MP3 players had a nice, easy, drag-and-drop interface for loading files, but this one insists upon using the Sonic Stage program to load files.  Since Sonic Stage crashes my computer every time I try to run it (there's a conflict with some other software I currently have loaded, and I gave up trying to find out which software it was) I'm stuck having to load Sonic Stage on my work computer.  This means every time I want to change music I have to burn my music to a disk and drag  the dang thing to work, load the music onto my hard-drive, re-start my computer, THEN add music to the MP3 player.  Mostly it just sits in a drawer at home because putting music on it is just too much hassle.  I think I've actually used it about five times since I "treated" myself to it for Christmas.  Great value for my money, huh?

<Title>Tough as nails, but I had to upgrade.
<Date>Thu Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Well, I got this little dude for my birthday and by gosh by golly, it worked well.  It still does, but I gave it back to the person who gave it me so they could upgrade me to a Creative Zen Micro 5 gb.  They haven't filled up much if it, but they will ;-)  Okay, so here's the scoop:  -Dropped it on the sidewalk.  NOTHING happened! Not even a scratch! -Dropped it on the kitchen floor twice -Dropped it on hard carpet  None of those did ANY damage whatsoever.  And okay, I wish I could use iTunes with this, but oh well, Sonicstage is okay and it compresses quite well.  The sound quality is great, but if you want it to be excellent, hold the play mode button so it turns to S1, then press it again.  S2 is the best.  Also, you can put it on shuffle and stuff, which all of them could do, so I'll kinda count that out.  It is pretty cheap!  A 1 gb iPod Nano, which holds less somehow, actually costs twice as much.    Oh, and I love the battery life.  1 AAA battery lasts me about a month.  I like that better than charging my new one.  It's got a backlight.  Nothing special, but convenient nonetheless!  Last, but not least, it's TINY! And LIGHT!  I can't even tell it's in my pocket!  If you don't have a whole lot of music (25 CD's or so) this is perfect for you.  The space was adequate for about 9 months, and it was a good 9 months.

Its lightweight...small (like an oreo cookie) only uses one battery that lasts forever!! And its easy to use!  It most certainly downloads music off the internet, you don't have to download only from the disk!!!  I uses Ares for my music...no problems! Perhaps those who cannot read the manual should ask a kid to do it for them.  Not to be mean, it's just that my kid was the one who figured out how to do it!  LOL.  For the price its perfect!! Its user friendly!  Highly recommend for the kids......its a tuff little bugger!!! Be careful because a lot of mp3's out there do not take music off the internet...but this one does!  Who needs an iPod???  Besides people think iPods are so wonderful (huh) that people get beat up for them....ugh..duh!  Play it safe and get a Sony Psyc!!!!

<Title>Ugh.  You can do better for less money....
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First and most important, the battery life is NOT, repeat NOT, what it claims to be.  The only reason I purchased this thing is because I figured I would save money with the extra long battery life when it came time to purchase batteries.  Think again.  Strike one.  The sound quality is just plain bad.  Most of the time there is an awful hissing noise in the background.  I also like my music loud, but at full volume, you won't get eardrum-thumping sound, no matter what phones you use with it.  Strike two.  Sony's music connect service is the worst I have ever seen.  I purchased an album a year ago and it still can't finish the download.  Like a fool, I actually tried again and I still experienced the same problem.  Two albums purchased and no music to show for it.  MAJOR strike three.  This product sucks and so does Sony.

<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this little player for probably 2 years now, and it's always been a very easy to use, dependable and TOUGH little unit. Mine's been left in the car for a week at -40, it's been stuck inside a hot glove compartment for days, it's been dropped, thrown, covered in dirt, all sorts of abuse, and yet it still runs beautifully. one AAA battery can run for 50-70 hours, depending on brand. Can't get much better then that! My ONLY complaint is there's no drag & drop option, you need the program, but thats minor.  As for people saying it won't play certain MP3s, out of all the times I've used it, I've only had that error on maybe 5 MP3s out of hundreds, and sometimes, just RENAMING the file so it's only alphanumeric made it work fine.

<Content>I don't know why people were annoyed with this MP3 player. It has simple instructions to follow, and only 6 steps to do everything. It was easy to intall the program for it, and it transferred my music to the program, which was awsome. It was really easy to transfer my music into it, and it lets you make your own playlists, then transfer them, which is wonderful. It's also great that you don't have to plug it in, you just have to change the battery, which is faster and makes the MP3 last longer. I love that it's a sony too, so I know it'll last a long time. In short, it's a great MP3 player!

<Title>Fake mp3 player!
<Date>Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Got mine from Sonystyle.com just yesterday. After playing with it for a few hrs here are my impressions.  First and foremost the mp3 playback quality is atrocious. 128kbps files sound like 64kbps or lower. Even my no-brand-name cheap mp3/cd player has better mp3 quality.   I suspect the codec/DSP in the Sony are still designed for their propreitary ATRAC3 plus format with a secondary mp3 support. In fact converting a mp3 file to Atrac3plus (with included software) sounded better than just mp3 file. Inspite of this hassle, it was still below mp3 quality from other players.   The battery life seems to be in line with the specs listed by Sony. No complaints on that front. The backlight LCD display is a nice bonus too. The size/volume is significantly more than the iPod Shuffle.  The user interface is more loaded than such a small palyer can withstand. As a result it more cumbersome and confusing than Apple/iRiver players.  In short this awkwardly named "mp3" music player is a step in right direction for Sony but is still below average. Price is right but not the quality.

<Title>Wonderfully lightweight and amazing battery life
<Date>Wed Mar 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sony calls this new line of flash-based, coin-like (but they are thick coins!) MP3/ATRACT players the Psycs, and their new-age styling does psyc you out.  Which is not a bad thing, as they are more euro-cool than the rather bland and boring iPod and the downright butt-ugly iRiver.  The more I look at the Psyc, the more I like its looks.  The new Psyc MP3 player features 512MB of flash memory, which is great for those of you jogger jocks out there.  You can shake this thing violently and it won't skip a beat, unlike those hard drive-based players.  Before you insert an AAA battery, the Psyc weighs in at an amazingly light 0.9 oz. -- that's right, folks, it's less than an ounce!  With the AAA battery, my guess is it's about 2 oz.  It's very small although, relatively speaking, it looks a little thick.  (About 0.75 in. at its thickest part.)  What, you ask, it uses an AAA battery?  Yes my friend, and this one AAA alkaline battery can power the player up to 70 hours!  That's almost three full days of continuous playing.  The phrase "up to" here means that in order to get all 70 hours of playing, you must 1) play ATRAC3Plus songs encoded at 48kbps and 2) do not press buttons or do random play (i.e., just leave the player playing sequentially).  In the real life we like to skip a song, fast forward, random play (a.k.a. shuffle play), turn it on and off and on and off, and most importantly, we play MP3 songs.  All these operations reduce the battery life.  Given my experience with previous Sony MP3 players, my estimate is one good AAA battery should last you 40 hours or more.  (With my beloved Sony NW-HD3, I routinely get the advertised battery life of 30 hours even when playing MP3 files.)  Of course, the use of AAA means you get an abundant and ready supply of cheap power source, and you can trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.  The Psyc, which comes in three colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version), has a nice backlit LCD screen, so you always know what you are playing as opposed to having to guess as on some other certain MP3 player.  It plays MP3 as well as Sony's ATRAC songs.  If you are an ATRAC fan you'll like the sound quality of this little player; it's at least as good as Sony's MD players.  For MP3's, the sound quality is a bit "muffled" compared to my NW-HD3 20GB player, but still quite good if you pair it with a good pair of headphones (i.e., ditch the stock earphones).  Sony still has a long, long way to go in the user interface department, as this has always been its weakness, whether it's digital music or digital video or anything else.  The Psyc is not hard to use; its basic functions are no-brainers.  But, for anything beyond play/pause/skip, its interface, whether on the unit itself or on the PC transfer side, is still not polished and was clearly designed for a Japanese audience -- Japanese consumers reportedly love to play with complicated gadgets; no surprise given how elaborate sushi-making and origami are.  We American consumers like things that are elegant and simple, and Sony has a lot of room for improvement in this regard.  In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the new Psyc flash-based MP3 players.  They are stylish and lightweight and lasts forever on cheap AAA batteries.  They have good sound quality and are priced right.  Just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting a little.

<Title>Delightful MP3 player
<Date>Fri Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this MP3 player for a week now and I am really happy with it.  It is feather-weight, sounds excellent, display is great and battery indicator is still at 100%.  It can also be used as a USB device to carry data files.  My only irritation (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is the requirement to use Sony's Sonic Stage to tranfer files to it.

<Title>Better than shuffle
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been planning on buying an ipod for a while, but didnt have the money.  with the shuffle now out, i was ready to go.  but i came across the sony network walkman and decided to give it a try, and it has been worth it. my roomate has a 512 shuffle and has about 100 songs on it.  my sony has about 300 for the same price.  also, i can go weeks with one aaa battery, he has to charge his every day.  finally, the quality of his ipod is very poor.  the damn thing broke when taking off the usb top and has to be jammed back in often.  if you want a cheap, yet quality player, go with the sony.

<Title>Awsome sound quality
<Date>Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player is so cool. It's tiny and it has awsome sound quality. It is also very durable. I've dropped it so many times, but there are still no scratches and it function properly. I would ditch the headphones that came with it though. They have bad sound quality and they are very uncomfertable. This devise can store over 300 songs when it is at its lowest quality, but even that sounds great. Why get an Ipod mini? It costs over twice as much, and you will probably never use all of the space that is provided. Not to mention that the sony looks cooler and is much smaller.

<Title>poor-to-average
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Pros: - Small; average sound  Cons: - transfering of music files ridiculously slow!! - difficult to maneuver it - no armband included! - sound is of lesser quality than iPod!  I guess you get what you pay, but could be cheaper! I wouldn't call it a smart choice.

<Title>not the best but good enough
<Date>Fri Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>well here is my take on it...doesnt' have the best sound quality but i bought it to use it for my workout so is great for it. if i want great sound then i'll just use my ipod. it's light and best of all it uses an external AAA battery. i have used the psyc for 16 hours now...battery level is still at the highest...what else can i say? if only ipod used AAA's. if you're looking for a 512MB player, you're probably looking for something that you can use for your jogging or some workout session...if not you should be looking for a hard drive player. it's 99 bucks too....how many other 512mb players do you get for 99? besides the ipod shuffle i don't see any...and it has a display too....anyway...if you're looking for great sound....go somewhere else, if you're looking to workout with it look no further. Oh and one more thing....this thing can get loud...seriously loud...with the volume level at half it's as loud and my ipod will ever get...just one more thing to consider.

<Title>Scew the ipod..!!!
<Date>Tue Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This Digital music player is exactlty what i've been looking for and more..!!!! 1: a device that i can EASILY download my music onto (cd,mp3...etc.) 2: a device that does these things and doesn't cost you an arm and a leg. 3: a device with a easily replacable and cost efficient battery. This device is all of that plus more!!!!! the software given can be installed easily and doesn't take forever to download your music.You dont have to worry about waiting to get home to charge your battery if it dies, just carry another AAA battery and BAM!! another 70 (thats right 70!!!) hours of playing time right there! The sound is EXCELLENT, GOOD BASE AND VERY LOUD if you want it to be. NO MOVING INTERIOR PARTS (unlike the i-pod!!!) so you dont have to worry about it possibly breaking while you're working out! (yeah....Apple doesn't warn you about that ,do they?!?!?!) purrchase for yourself ...you WON'T be sorry.
