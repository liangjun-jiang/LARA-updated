<Title>Great when it works
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got an ipod as a gift in July 2003, and had some problems with the software, and getting my computer to recognize the device, etc.  I had read a user review on Amazon stating that the software was &quot;flakey&quot;, and I didn't know what that meant until I got my ipod.  When it works, it really is great, I like the design and used it everyday, but it took a fair bit of tinkering around to get it to work.  The directions weren't helpful at all.<p>A previous reviewer wrote that he couldn't run with his ipod because it froze up constantly.  I run with mine everyday and have not had this problem.<p>I had some problems with the Music Match software.  Sometimes it would duplicate songs, and I could only delete one version.  I had to restore my ipod to factory settings a few times to remove duplicate versions of songs.  Apple came out with iTunes for Windows a few months after I got my ipod, and I've found it to be easier to use.<p>My ipod died completely, even though the battery was fully charged, in December 2003.  It didn't work for a few days, then I was able to revive it.  This happened 3 times before I sent it back.  Apple customer service kind of sucks, there is no 800 number to call for support, you have to register on their web site and email your problems in.  Within a few days of emailing Apple, I received a shipping box in the mail to return my ipod.  I sent it back and received a new ipod in less than a week. <p>I'm kind of skeptical that my new ipod will last any longer than the old one, but maybe I had a dud.  With the problems I've had, I can't really recommend the ipod, but it really is great when it works.  Definitely read the other user reviews before purchasing one though.

<Title>Best there is!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Just got the 10-gig iPod last Friday (picked up at a great sale price as Apple is dropping 10-gig in favor of "mini" and "15-gig"). All I can say is awesome. I never had Apple before and was skeptical based on some of the Amazon reviews. But all my fears were erased. I have a 6 month-old Compaq at home and had no problems getting the two to sync up. Literally "plug and play". Bonus is, if your Windows PC has a newer fire-wire port, it will even charge your iPod while downloading music. I have almost 1,000 songs (75+ albums) on it right now, and using just under 4-gig. I read a lot about people having problems sync-ing their window-based PCs to iPod. Based on my experience, I can only guess they are using older PCs and insist on using USB2 or even old USB.  One tip, if you're "ripping" CDs to put on your iPod, be logged into the web. I-tunes will literally fill out all the song/track information for you (a little tid-bit I found by accident).  Also, regarding the reviews where people "e-mail" Apple and have horrible customer service stories....   check out the Apple web-site.  You can't e-mail Apple.  You must call them directly or join one of the discussion chat-groups (which I've used, and are very helpful).

<Title>Proof that there was a crash in Area 51!
<Date>Wed Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>...and they loved music. This product must have been reverse engineered...it's that good.<p>I've been listening to MP3's on portable players since the Diamond 32MB.  I'm an absolute music junkie and use these players to get me to (and keep me in) the gym everyday.  The iPod (of which I've owned 2 previous models) is hands down the best portable on the market.<p>Combine with the Apple owned iTunes site (this sounds like a commercial but...).  They work phenomenal together.<p>I have a PC.  If you do to, make sure you buy the PC version.  Also, it's much easier if your PC has a Firewire port (kind of like a USB port but wider and shorter).  If it doesn't, and you're not computer savvy, you might want to avoid iPod (as painful as that is to say).<p>Daily use is great.  The keys themselves are heat sensitive, which is cool (no pun..), but can be a pain when you get the song you want, go to put in your pants, and accidently touch a key.  Other than that, flawless.  Very intuitive buttons, very intuitive menu, and beautiful looks.<p>If you need more than 10GB of space, you're probably a target for the RIAA and will be sued any day now...  I have 700 hundred songs and use about 25% of the available storage on this unit.<p>I can't say enough good things about this thing!<br>Enjoy...

<Title>Great music, great fun, but not scratch resistant
<Date>Sat Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Received my iPod as a Christmas gift. An amazing product. Pleasantly surprised by how good it sounds. How much music it holds. How easy it is use. How good it feels in your hand or pocket. <p>My only complaint is that it scratches very easily. I strongly recommend that you buy a case for this when you buy the device. My new iPod started showing scratches by Christmas night. I you don't have a case for it, be sure sure you don't put it in a coat pocket with your car keys or a nail clipper.

<Title>Warning to all potential buyers...
<Date>Fri Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a load of crap. I got it as a christmas present.. and now it's february.. so i've only had this thing for 3 months. Well, at first it was all right and all.. but now it's officially DEAD. I have yet to send it in to be repaired and i'm not sure if i want to considering my dad paid so much for this skimpy thing that fails to deliver after only 3 months. I get tired waiting for songs to upload and furthermore, the battery life drains so fast. i started out w/ an ok battery (the battery would go down one bar after about 30 songs) to battery life of an imposter duracell bunny (less than 20 songs and it's down one bar) well great, my ipod died completely when i tried to listen to it a few days ago. it's not responding to snything. i see some ppl think it's great and it has worked out well for them but i really think this is a hit-or-miss product. Either it works for you or it dies within a few months. I have heard other stories of people's ipod dying within a few months and even though there's a one-year warranty, the person still had to pay for some repairs. So buyers beware.. make sure you know what you're getting yourself into!<br>Edit: I got a replacement ipod... had to transfer all the songs over to it... moreover, it just died again. So this stupid thing has died TWICE in less than SIX MONTHS.

<Title>ipod is OK. hoping for advances in future models
<Date>Sun Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had my 10GB ipod since Sept. 2003 and I bought it for $300 and had to also buy an FM transmitter, cables for my computer (I have a PC, not Mac), a carrying case (for running, etc.) and a car charger. Thus, the price was somewhere around $375, plus I bought the extended warranty from the store because I knew these were fragile items.<br>The basic FM transmitter isn't as good as the ITRIP, but it was sufficient. The battery life in that thing stinks though.<br>I accidentally knocked my ipod off of the treadmill in its carrying case and it broke. I was pretty mad considering I used to throw my tape player all over the place and nothing ever happened. i miss tapes.<br>anyway, i believe that the ipod should come with a few more features, like a built in FM transmitter and an FM receiver for listening to the radio. i also think its a bit pricy. sometimes it freezes for no reason and sometimes the software for my PC does not synchronize well with the ipod and i have to restart. <br>i find the ipod pretty easy to use, but it is very fragile and could still use some work. i hope the future models will be better. now i cannot buy a 10GB, i have to get a 15GB, but Apple does not seem to be doing anything to their newer models to make them much better. More music is better, but there are no new added features. <br>I might try a new mp3 player in the meantime until apple gets their act together. since all these mp3 players are so new, you can't expect any of them to be perfect. i will take a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude with the ipod. not that i don't recommend it. its the only mp3 player i have ever had, so i have nothing to compare it to.

<Title>Elegant and Simple
<Date>Thu Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Although I'm a PC person, I have to appreciate Apple's commitment to quality. For a piece of equipment this advanced, it is amazingly simple to operate. The face has no moving parts; instead, the heat from your fingers activates the different buttons.<br>  In this updated model there is room for a couple hundred CDs and (supposedly) the issue regarding battery life has been resolved.<br>  Possible issues:  You must own an Apple or PC computer as this is the only way to upload your music onto the iPod.  This model only comes with a Firewire cable; a USB adaptor is extra.  Also, any songs that you keep on your iPod must be stored on your computer.  This last issue is only a problem if you are running a computer with limited harddrive space (e.g. &lt;10gb).<br>  Besides these small problems, my iPod has given me hours of pleasure.  One recommendation is the Griffin iTrip FM transmitter.  This allows you to play music from your iPod over any FM radio.  This item runs about $35 and can be purchased on Amazon.com or on Apple's website.

<Content>The iPod 10 Giga-Bytes. These Guys know how to do the music business! The iPod Has a VERY sleek design for your pockets and case.(I Strongly suggest the case...)With the iPod you can make the huge piles of CD's from the 80's into little AAC Files (Mp4 files). This Helped me and my father. <br>     I got My iPod after my original Mp3 player broke,(it was some wierd hard drive player the size of a brick.) and I have NEVER regreted it. Just using this program may result in: Mac Fever, buying pepsi just for the iTunes lid, thinking or dreaming about a brand new iMac or iPods. <br>     Anywho, You Should buy this! Just keep it away from any electrical devices that include: Van de graff generators, The Ball Things That Have the sparks inside it. it messes with the touch buttons.

<Title>Sweet!
<Date>Tue Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When mp3 players came out I was fairly dissapointed until I discovered the iPods. Apple makes the absolutely top of the line mp3 player on the markey. Yeah, you can go buy a mp3 player for a fraction of the cost, but you'll also get a fraction of the quality.<p>The new iPod minis are great, but I'm still using my good old 10 gig iPod and it hasn't let me down yet. The batteries last practically 4ever, and it's durable and cool looking to.<p>A note to anyone trying to decide on size: don't automatically buy the biggest iPod just because it's the biggest. Chances are you're never going to use all of the space. One of the best ways to utilize the Pod is to put all your favorite music on it and then just set it to randomly shuffle between songs. You can't do this if you have a couple of gigs of the good stuff and 38 gigs of junk...

<Title>This is very expensive  but worth it
<Date>Sat May 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>this is so cool. i got one for crhistmas and loved it. i have about 529 songs on mine because i get all of my songs from my schools media room. the teacher is devoted to apple brand software, computers, acsseories, and speakers. this is very cool and the songs are cheap. theres just one problem, when listening to loud songs, you should turn it down because for a small item, this can be hered from a room away when left playing and at max voloume! and it moves alone when its loud! but it is good and it has a cool backlight so when your in the dark, the screen lights up and so do the buttons. it dsiplays the time, date, and it has a photo and video slot and you can keep your scedhual. it also has games like brick and solitare. it also has a special game where it takes all of your songs and makes a music quiz where it gives you 90 seconds of a song and a list of songs for you to pick and get right. this is the only game that you can't listen to a song while playing. the back has it's own licences number and the logo. it has an area for your settings and your ipod's identity(a.k.a your name, tis number, the amount of songs it currently contains,, and the amonut of space you have left and how much is used. pretty cool right! thanks!

<Title>A Perfect Creation for Music Lovers
<Date>Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I first saw I-POD at the MAC display in King of Prussia and I was just bowled over by its sleek design. But it was much more then the Design when I received my i-POD from Amazon. <br>The functionality, the ease to use, the sound quality everything is perfect about this little gadget. Its Got Games, its got address book, you can use it as external hard disk.. and what not. Overall a must buy for anyone who loves all his music to be with him/her.<br>Although there are a few points which you should think about, <br>1. if you are ordering a 10 GB ipod...and for Windows, it doesnt come with USB, so you will have to install a firewire port like I did (if you dont have already). Firewire port externally installed doesnt give the speed claimed.<br>2. Do buy a carrying case, the lil ipod is so sleek that it can slip out of your grip anytime.<p>so Go ahead and beleive me you will love this ...

<Title>iPod rocks on!
<Date>Mon Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was initially skeptical when I was given an iPod as a Christmas gift. I didn't have a vast collection of MP3s, and was not sure that I would use it all that much.<p>Well, now that I have had it for almost six months, I must say, WOW! I take it to work with me everyday (in fact, I am typing this review whilst listening to some classic Beatles on my iPod). It has become an essential part of my life, and I cannot imagine life without it.<p>Combined with iTunes as a way of organising my music, and adding in the power of AAC encoded audio, it kicks butt. Buy one, or better still, buy one of its bigger brethren. The convenience, power and ease of use make it one of the coolest consumer electronic gadgets I have gotten in years.

I was very leery at first because I did not want to waste the money on something that I will not use very much.  I have to say though; this mp3 player has changed my life!  I never go anywhere without it.  It has replaced all of my CDs to the extent that I have sold most of them.  This player out performs any other on the market and always performs flawlessly.  I am also very surprised at how often apple releases new updates on the player.  I am a windows user and I use win 98se with absolutely no problems at all.  Please do not hesitate to buy this because it is worth it.

<Title>Love Music? Can't Do Without iPod.
<Date>Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received the 10gb iPod from my pops for a graduation present and I have to say it's MORE then worth the price. The iPod is simply amazing. Just opening the box to retrieve the 'Pod' is a treat. Apple designed some sort of iPod-origami to create a square-looking box that is truly artistic and practical. Once I got to the machine inside, my life was complete. The iPod is so smooth and the features so extensive, it looked as though it should be in a James Bond film. The backlight illuminates the `Pod' so beautifully, giving the buttons a red glow while turning the viewing-screen a sharp, white color. I never wanted to turn it off. It's as though I should've placed the instrument on a mantel when through listening just to gawk at its beauty.<p>Furthermore, I could actually hear the iPod spin its compact hard drive. Upon taking it out of the box, it turned on to reveille language options and instantly hooked me into configuring the entire thing.<p>Overall the iPod is the most beautiful machine I've ever laid eyes upon. The long battery life is simply icing on the cake and the number of songs it holds is astonishing. If Apple makes computers as well as they constructed this music piece, it's no wonder people obsess over Macs.

I have only had this MP3 player for about 1 month, and I already have over 150 songs stored on it. No problem using music match jukebox... it's very easy once you get the hang of it. <br>The iPod is so sleek and simple. It is so beautiful, and I take it everywhere. <br>I absolutley love the scroll wheel, it makes everything so easy. It's very easy to operate, and It weighs so little. (less than 2 CDs in jewel cases!!)<br>I hope that for the prospective buyer, that you are willing to spend a few extra dollars and get this iPod. I garuntee you will not be dissapointed.

<Title>"to good to be true" I said. MAN WAS I WRONG!
<Date>Sat Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ok lets start with the teanie,weanie,bad news:<br>1. The first problem is that it was truely made for Macs. All of the included acessories are Mac only compatible unless you have a Fire Wire card already installed on your Comp. <br>2. The second is that you need to buy a USB 2.0 wire for people who have a PC. Unfortunately if your comp is older than 2 years you probabally need to buy a USb 2.0 PCI card. Without it, your sunk. Your comp wont recognize the Ipod because of the older 1.1 USB Driver therefore no music can be transfered. But no worries its about [$$$] for the USB 2.0 Cord and [$$$] for PCI card, but trust me they will garantee a faster and swifter download of music. <br>3. Oh ya it would help to have or burn a copy of Windows Xp because of its great compatibility with installing a recognizing new devices,software,ect..<p>Now for good stuff..<br>WOW!! times 5. This Mp3 is amazing, so much to do with it besides music. You got games, scheduler, clock, alarm, great organization for music playlists and songs. Sound quality is great and dwonloading is swift and easy. Download all your CD's in 2 minutes a CD or faster.( depends on how much songs are on it.)So small and sleek looking its great for traveling and fitting anywhere. If you buy the carrying case for sport activites you can jog, hike,bike, ect.. without it falling out.<br>IF you got the cash$$$ i sugest you buy this one it goes quick so get yours now. Nothing beats it! Best on the market fro your money. So why you still reading? BUY IT!!

<Content>I had never been very big on Mac products, but after deciding it was time to move up from my 32MB MP3 player, I settled on the iPod.  This device is absolutely amazing.  10GB is plenty of room for me.  I had a little trouble settting it up to run on my Windows Me operating system.  MusicMatch always said it was not connected even though Windows said it was there.  Finally after trying it on two different comptuers I took it back and exchanged it for another one only to have the same problem.  I then tried it on one of my friends computers which had WinXP.  After hooking it up there I was able to format the drive.  Brought it back to my house, no luck.  Then I found some software called ephPod 2 on the internet and it works just fine.  All the iPod software still says its not connected to my system but hey, it works.  I deffinately advise anybody thinking of purchasing an iPod to go ahead and do it.  May seem a little expenseive, but it's well worth it.

<Title>Hard to Fault ..Except  Extreme Volume Limits on Euro Model
<Date>Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ditto what everyone says below --- hard to imagine better bang for the buck than this sensationally slick little wonder of technology. I do however, have one knock against it which I view as quite significant. It simply does not produce enough volume for my liking: and I'm not a headbanger by any means. I would strongly advise anyone considering this to try it out first. I'm referring here to the models with 2.0 software -- for some reason the earlier versions do allow the user to tinker with the upper registers. But not the newer ones, which is big disappointment. Other than that -- great machine.<p>ADDENDUM: The volume problem described above relates to all Gen 3 iPods sold in Europe (where I purchased mine) -- the US models are fine. New French "Big Brother" regulations limit the db levels produced by personal stereos and Apple decided -- for some reason -- to apply these limits to all European models. There is a thunderstorm of indignation about this issue on the iPod related chat boards. Apple has been curiously silent on the issue. So Europeans, beware!

<Title>The player that set the bar.
<Date>Fri Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>over and over again I keep hearing in tech circles when the &quot;ipod killer&quot; will come out, that is, when dell or gateway or rio will come out with a player that can compete with the ipod.  my own ipod is a great player, granted I am using a Mac the Mac OS and the ipod were designed to work with each other.<br>the ipod is small enough to fit in your pocket, carries all your music and organizes it.  people wonder why buy apple since there are other players that have more memory or cost less.  i ask why buy a jaguar or a mercedes when there are other cars that have the same horsepower but cost less?  apple takes ideas like music players and puts top-quality design into them, being able to find 1 of 900 songs in a few seconds is great.  I took it out the box, hooked it up and had my whole collection uploaded in less than three minutes.  it is made of a tough(but hardly scratch resistant) plastic and stainless steel, other players are made out of toy plastic.  other players may have lots of features, like voice recording and FM radio (something that would be nice) but there is no other player that has a cleaner and simpler interface than the ipod and voice recorders and other accesories are easy to buy if you need them.<br> plus apple listens to people, any complaints people have are listened to and their products keep getting better. as for some of the features that other players have, apple lets third parites take care of it.  there are thousands of accesories out there, from microphones to card readers and hundreds of designer cases, how many of those do you get with the Dell jukebox?  I have a freeware program called pod2go that puts news, weather and notes onto my ipod, where is the community of people writing freeware for the Rio nitrus?  <br>Apple encourges ideas in people, you are not just buying a player you are buying a platform that is surprisingly open and constantly being improved.  <br>sure the ipod is not perfect, but it raised the bar for the rest of the industry and challaged everyone to put out better quaity products.

<Title>Can't live without it
<Date>Sat Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my 10 GB I-Pod since Thanksgiving, and definately don't regret buying it. It is amazing how many songs you can fit on something so small; I love having my whole music collection wherever I go. It is pretty easy to use, and the software installed w/o any problems. Since I have a Windows PC, the wire that came w/ it (firewire) did not connect to my computer, although some PC's may have the required connection. I simply had to purchase an extra connection cable for USB from Circuit City (an extra $20). The software for converting CD's to mp3 files works well, and it takes about 5 minutes per CD (on my computer).<br> <br>Overall, I love my I-Pod. The back is a little scratched up from everyday use, but otherwise it has stayed in good shape. I definately recommend the purchase of this product. I have the 10 GB version and still have PLENTY of room after loading on my favorite CD's. A must have for any music lover...

<Content>There are SOOOO many outright lies in the review by the "electronics fan" from Sterling, Virginia, I don't know where to begin. How about from the top.<p>1. He or she (let's call him or her "Sterling", okay?) calls it a "Mac only product". Ugh. Not only has been made for PCs for almost two years, the vast majority of iPods are sold to PC users. That's an indefensible lie on Sterling's part.<p>2. "The buttons on the front are touchy...I keep on turning it on accidently."<p>The touch-sensitive buttons are by definition "touchy". That's why they're called "touch sensitive" -- and also why THERE'S A LOCK SWITCH ON TOP. Sterling's ommission of the elegant lock switch is pretty damning evidence for the hypothesis that Sterling has never even used an iPod, much less owned one.<p>3. "a fully charged battery barely lasts 2 hours of listening time..."<p>Well, I'd think you'd find a good majority of iPod users out there agreeing with the product's specification of 8 hours of listening time, or slightly less if the hard drive is used heavily (by skipping ahead alot, for example). Another deceptive lie. (Hmm, do you work for Microsoft, Sterling?)<p>4. "There is no setting to disable the front panel controls."<p>Um, see #2 above. Lie, lie, lie.<p>5. "ACC format...what's that all about? Nothing on the PC side of the world (hey folks, 98% of the computing public are PC oriented.) uses ACC format (except for some obscure apps like the horrendous Music Match and the equally bad iTunes)."<p>Um, it's called "AAC", not "ACC". I'll tell you what AAC is about. Advanced Audio Coding is part of the international standard known as MPEG-4 and you'll be seeing a lot more about it. Nokia, Europe's largest cell phone maker, uses AAC. The RealPlayer music store uses AAC. And iTunes, the most popular download software on the planet by far (70% market share) uses AAC. A deceptive lie to call it "obscure". Again, more evidence that you're just astroturfing for Microsoft.<p>6. "If iPod users want to make their music that they download from iTunes available to their home stereo using a wireless network connection, what device would they use?"<p>There are all kinds of companies, other than the ones you mentioned, that do this -- Philips, TEN, TiVO -- do a google search on AAC streaming. Of course, iTunes has built in Rendezvous (an open standard) streaming, so expect to see a LOT more on this front soon. Not to mention bluetooth and RF solutions, which are simpler.<p>7. "I have an 85GB MP3 Music library."<p>Great. The iPod support that.<p>8. "custom software assures that I always have fresh music based off of what I already listened to"<p>You don't need "custom software" with iPod -- iTunes "smart playlists" feature accomplishes this for normal people that aren't programmers like you apparently are.<p>9. "These are things you cannot do with Acc format music folks!"<p>Nothing your byzantine setup you describe excludes AAC as far as I can see. Of course, the songs you buy from iTunes are protected somewhat and can't be shared freely with just anyone. But your complex setup can't be accomplished with Microsoft's protected download files from iTunes's competitors, either.<p>10."iTunes for Windows. Man...can any single application suck as bad as this? First, it's nothing more than a thinly veiled medium for pushing Apple's other products (Jobs has even admitted that he is using the iPod the iTunes to "suck" windows users into the Mac world)."<p>You contradict yourself here. You say it sucks, and then you say it's an attempt by Apple to make great software to convince Windows users into buying Apple's products (which it is). Considering how popular it is, and the rave reviews it's gotten from the PC press, forgive us if we don't take just your word for it.<p>11. " The first problem with iTunes is that you don't have consistant menues for your second mouse button and the third mouse button doesn't exist..."<p>Um, last I checked most PCs had two mouse buttons, not three. And I think iTunes interface is incredibly consistent, surely moreso than WinAmp.<p>12.  "Second problem is that this interface is nothing more than a re-badged browser! And it doesn't use any of your existing internet settings like your favorites menu, nor your automatic form fillers, or any of the browser help objects you may have installed (like Google toolbar with an auto fill form app) And let me tell you...you have to fill in a lot of fields to download a song!"<p>This is just flat-out wrong. iTunes is an MP3 player with a built-in store, automatic background downloads, multi-threaded operations. It's ONLY one to use "one-click" technology -- so once you set it up, you NEVER have to fill out ANY fields. You click "buy song" and three seconds later you have the full song on your computer, forever. Instant gratification.<p>It's also ridiculous to falsely label it a browser and then complain it's not a browser (with your "favorites" menu, security icons, or what have you)!<p>12. "And whats with spending a buck for a song?"<p>99 cents too much for a song? The 30 million plus satisfied customers would disagree. Also, if you buy an album, it's only $9.99, no tax or anything, so often it's much, much less than 99 cents per song.<p>If you don't want to pay 99 cents for the instant gratification of getting music you want legally (and supporting the artists -- much more so than through CDs), you can continue to steal MP3s, as you apparently have. The iPod will play stolen music just fine!<p>13. "And a low resolution song at that? Sure, ACC format recorded at 128 is like MP3 at 132 or something like that...sure...but it's still compressed audio. And it's compresed audio at 10 times compression...Folks, look up the term "lossy compression" you will find out that music that is compressed is done by REMOVING sound! Yes, that's right! the sound you want to hear is removed from the music to make the file smaller. The smaller the file, the more sound is taken out of the music! CDs have (get this) CD quality sound...makes sense, right? The music you download from iTunes has one tenth of the music that CDs have."<p>Wow, what a long-winded harangue on compressed music. This from someone with 85 gigabytes of compressed MP3s!!!! Hypocritical.<p>14. "And since you're not getting the liner notes, or the video that is sometimes included on the CD, you should pay less than one tenth of what a CD costs!"<p>No, you're paying almost half. Or, if you buy just the three songs you probably want on the CD, less than $3. But iTunes does include limited liner notes and many high-res QuickTime videos, for free!<p>15. "Plus, when you consider that there is the distribution, bricks and morter (physical stores) and employees that need to be paid, you can see that at the costs that a CD is, (about $17 now) a downloaded MP3 should be less than 17 cents!"<p>I don't know where you learned your math, but Apple's not making any money on your purchase, as you said before... and you're saving considerable amounts.<p>16. "Come on people...it's your money...vote with your wallets!"<p>They are... and you're losing.  :-)<p>17. "In all, I gave this device 2 stars becuase it does look cool...but unfortunatly, it's not the device for windows users!"<p>And which one is, considering your strange criticisms?<p>Yes, it does look cool. NO OTHER DEVICE is as small or as powerful. The cheaper knockoffs are all BIGGER AND HEAVIER.

<Title>Very good MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is the first piece of Apple hardware that I've ever owned.  While there were some challenges to overcome in getting it to work with my PC, once I got past them, it's been a great player.  The standard earbuds produce much better sound than I expected (even if they aren't the most comfortable to wear in your ears).  I found the interface very intuitive to use.  Building playlists on the fly, skipping tracks, adjusting volume, etc are all very simple as a result.  The only complaint I have with the hardware is that the battery life isn't quite what I expected.  But it's been good enough to pass the time on many a plane flight.<br>The integration with MusicMatch (still my favorite music collection software on the PC) was pretty good, but iTunes for Windows integrates far better.  It does a great job of replicating the interface of the iPod, and makes great use of the screen real estate.  The smart playlists are its best feature.  The graphic equalizer works very well also.<br>I'm glad I bought it.  If you're in the market for an MP3 player, I highly recommend the iPod.  The 15GB version might be the best deal, since you get the remote and the dock as well.

<Title>iPod is an unreliable piece of junk
<Date>Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought a new iPod and only used it for a few months before the hard drive failed. It is now dead.... I've sent it in for repairs, but I'll probably be on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get it fixed. This is not a relaible device. If you are looking for something to use for active sports like skiing, etc. my advice is to look elsewhere. For the time being, I'm back to using my old Creative Labs Nomad 3, which I've had for years and has held up quite well, unlike my iPod which has failed in an embarassingly short amount of time. Shame on you Steve Jobs!

<Title>AWSOME!
<Date>Wed Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 player ROCKS!  My friend with a Mac got a 20gb model for christmas, and I thought it was really cool, so i disided to get one for christmas.  I picked up a USB 2.0 cable, and it works great with my Windows XP Compaq computer system.  It looks cool, sounds great, and the transfers are really fast.  It has my entire music collection and I have only used a fith of its Hard Drive.  The games are also very fun, and I succed in transfering all of my contacts from Palm Desktop without much trouble.  If you are thinking about buying an MP3 player, iPod is THE BEST!

<Title>Amazing...But who needs thousands of songs?
<Date>Tue Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This product is amazing I have to admit. But honestly, who needs thousands of mp3's in their pocket? If you drop it, thats a few hundred down the drain. Go for a mp3 player that doesn't have a hard drive like a rio, because it can still be in 100 shape if you drop it. 60 songs is fine, but if it breaks (which it will after 2 years) than that's to bad if you don't have a lot of extra cash. Overall, the thing is amazing, but it's almost too good to be true and it will have problems.I definetly wouldn't pay $1 to download one song from MaC!<br>...

<Content>this player is simply awesome and the best out there, period. im a windows user and had absolutely no problems getting it to work on my computer. <p>when i set the ipod up, i didnt even bother using music match which came with the player but instead i ripped cds with CDex and transfered music with Ephpod. <p>the size of this player is amazing. its so small and fits very comfortably into my pocket. cant beat the size (10 gigs is pleanty of space). i currently have nearly 1000 songs (thats most of my music collection) loaded onto the player and still have over 5 gigs left. one thing to be aware of is that this actually doesnt come with 10 gigs, with the apple firmware on the pod, you only get 9.2 gigs. <p>overall, very impressive and highly recommended

<Title>This is The Best MP3 player on the Market!
<Date>Thu Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The Apple 10GB iPod is THE BEST MP3 PLAYER ON THE MARKET TODAY!It has a decent battery life (when not connected to the computer)and holds at least 2,000 songs. It is very much worth the $300 and the only MP3 players I could compare to it are the Apple 3g 15GB and 30GB models. I absolutely love the all touch interface and the superbrightness of the backlight. The one complaint I have about it is it's short battery life connected to the computer. Other than that I have no complaints and would highly recommend it to anyone who asked me about it.

<Content>THis is by far, the best MP3 player out there. Its structure is firm and durable, and it has a nice weight to it. The format is excellent and so is the battery life, however, the screen is hard to see, even in the light. When the backlight is on, it devours the battery. Otherwise, this is the best player on the market.

<Title>ipod 10 GB (win)-great gadget!
<Date>Fri Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am really not much for using computers except for emails and shopping but I was so impressed by the ipod with regards to its style and music capacity that I went ahead and purchased it!  I never downloaded music before so I knew it was going to be a major challenge.  I installed the firewire card as well as the program for the ipod which proved to be easy as pie but the music software was my biggest headache! It took me forever and a day to get it going.  Once I mastered it though- everything else just fell into place.  My ipod did freeze up a couple of times but other than that I am pleased with it.  Awesome sound, easy to use and the remote earphones is a must!

<Title>a second try
<Date>Mon Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I already wrote a beautiful, glowing review of the ipod, but it didnt get posted ( I said some things i shouldn't have, I think).  Anyway, It's easily the best MP3 player available.  My roommate has the creative jukebox zen and he admits the iPod is a more quality machine that is much easier to use (though the zen is definitely worth the cheaper price tag).  The iPod is definitely not cheap, in either sense of the word. <p>Some Pros:<br>Very easy to use, beautiful design, using with a mac has flawless connectibility, with mac it can use AAC file format which is smaller and sounds better than MP3, Its Just darned fun!!!!<p>Some Cons:<br>-very easily scratched, a carrying case is a MUST.  The apple carrying case is great but also expensive.<br>-Touch sensitive buttons are VERY sensitive, but using the hold switch quickly becomes second nature.<p>Overall, if you're in the market for an MP3 player  and have the extra cash, the iPod should be your first pick.

<Title>Great Product from Apple yet again!
<Date>Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Ok, first of all, I've never been a real Mac person. My friend has an eMac and I use that once in a while. I like it, I have to say, although I like Windows for its software compatability. About the new 10GB iPod, I absolutely LOVE IT! 2500 songs (2000 when formatted for Windows), easy to use directions and great software for both Mac and PC. Two things I don't like about this thing, though, the earbuds Apple supplies kind of have a hard time staying in your head, particularly my Left earbud. My right one is fine. Also, it is a bit difficult to navigate songs if you don't have a playlist set up and playing and if  your iPod is in your pocket, etc. It can be a hassle, but it's worth it. Though the battery life is 20% shorter than last models, its still a solid 8 hours of music. I have a PC, and the MusicMatch Jukebox software couldn't be all that much easier to use. It's simple to add songs to your library, and then send them to your iPod via FireWire (card sold seperately, but the FireWire cord comes with the iPod) or USB 2.0 (you may need to buy a USB 2.0 card if you don't have one, because once again it doesn't come with a card. You'll also have to buy a seperate cord that can use USB 2.0 because the iPod only comes with FireWire). Other than navigation problems and the earbuds, this was a great product from Apple and I'm proud to be associated with them!

<Title>Once it dies, you're out of luck.
<Date>Mon Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Apple's iPods are really wonderful, amazing machines while they are working.  They are also wonderful while they are under warranty.  However, once they are past warranty, if the machine permanently freezes, or just dies and won't come back to life despite your having tried all the fixes given on Apple's support page, there's not much you can do.  Apple does offer a mail-in repair service, but the flat fee for repairs is nearly the price of a new 10 GB iPod -- more than $255.00.  A scam if I've ever heard of one.  I knew I shouldn't have bought the thing!

<Title>My Experience
<Date>Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is referring to the 5gb 1st generation model, which I got my iPod last year. I loved it despite some difficulties. the case on it was a bit loose when I got it, and something a friend had been told caused me to ring up Apple tech support. They reassured me there was no manufcturing fault my friend had been told about, but I mentioned the loose case and they replaced the iPod with a new 5gb ipod at the beginning of this year. 3 weeks later I was listening to it and the display went odd. Occasionaly it seemed to be almost shimmering, with sections of the text being displaced. I spent 2 hours in the apple phone queue, with little success and finally got through. I was told it would be replaced again. I tried to talk them into giving me a new one, like this product, and they told me I would have to speak to customer relations, opening at 9 (this was at 8 20). I duly rang back later, and after an hour in the queue for tech support I was finally referred to customer support (apparently they cannot be contacted directly, but must be referred to from another department). However, they essentially just said it would be sorted out by the repairs department and I would probably just be given another 5gb model, and they could do nothing abut it. I know this may sound like I'm being stupid by asking for a new model when I bought the old one, so I should explain. I was one of 3 people to buy 5gb iPods in my year at school, and all of them have broken. One of my friends was given a new (3g) iPod, which has been  no problem. Another was given a replacement as I was, which has also failed recently. Total 5gb iPods: 5 number defective: 5. Another friend had a 10gb iPod, which also had to be repaired. That accounts for all the 1st and 2nd generation iPods I know of, but another friend told me today that another friend of his is on his 4th iPod now. This hardly inspires my confidence in the build quality/reliability of them. The response I have had from Apple is essentially that once the 12 months of warranty are up it's no longer their problem, and they don't care. So much for promoting brand loyalty - a friend of mine had convinced me that Apple were far superior to PC manufacturers, now I have reconsidered that view. The iPod was my first and last Apple purchase.

<Title>A joy to use
<Date>Sat Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First of all, the rumors are true: apple has discontinued this model and is now offering a 15 GB iPod for the same price. So don't buy this model, unless you're getting a good deal from amazon and only need 10 GB.<p>My experience with this unit has been fine.  I have a Windows PC, I've been using iTunes for Windows since it came out, and this little gem was the likely extension of that.  They integrate seamlessly, and I've yet to have a problem with it.  Windows and iTunes together do take about 30 seconds to recognize the device, but I've attributed that to less than ideal hardware/OS integration.  <p>I did buy an AppleCare Protection plan from Apple.com for this unit (US$59.95) because I've heard many stories of its battery dying after 18 months of usage, and this plan extends the complimentary service an additional year and is half the cost of replacing the battery (plus shipping).  So, be warned. You do have this option to avoid shelling out half this unit's cost to keep it working.<p>The unit itself works wonderfully.  Its controls are very intuitive, and I've been able to put about 2/3 of my digital music on it, which I consider plenty to have in my pocket.<p>Its greatest shortcoming is the fact that this unit will not charge its battery when connected to my Windows PC (I have heard that some Windows PCs will charge iPods, but not mine).  Keeping it connected for about an hour while I reorganize my music collection and update iPod's songs drains the battery to about half capacity.  This is in sharp contrast to Macs, which will charge the battery while you're syncing, which would leave you with more than half capacity, I'm sure.  But this effectively destroys the "sync-and-go" method.  Mine is "charge-sync-charge-and-go."  But the battery life is much better when just playing music, as this unit kept me entertained most of the way through a transatlantic flight.

<Title>A lot of deceptive reviews!
<Date>Sun Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>A great many of the reviews from PC users are deceptive.<p>1. Some of them are complaining about the custom engraving service. That service is NOT available from Amazon, so they're reviewing a product Amazon doesn't sell. That's deceptive for prospective Amazon customers.<p>2. Some are complaining about problems getting their PCs to work -- and at least two of the ones I saw were using the MusicMatch software to sync. (One even bought an upgrade to MusicMatch -- how much of a sucker do you have to be?) Um, Apple switched to using its own iTunes software for PCs OVER THREE MONTHS AGO, so anyone who's using terrible MusicMatch software for syncing shouldn't be. Can we really believe that they spent &quot;hours&quot; on the phone with tech support if they're not using iTunes (freely available at itunes.com), surely the first thing that tech support would tell them? <p>3. One person said that he didn't like the Apple font on the interface. Enough said.<p>4. Some are reviewing the 5GB first generation model, which came out OVER TWO YEARS AGO and was DISCONTINUED OVER A YEAR AGO. That's unfair and deceptive in a review for a new model.<p>5. Others are perpetuating the LIE that the battery isn't replaceable. (They got that email with the ipodsdirtysecret website.) Um, Apple has offered two options for quite some time: you can extend the full warranty at any time during the first year of ownership for $59, or you can get a replacement battery at any point after the warranty's expired for $99. <p>6. Some are writing one-star reviews saying the 10GB model has been replaced by a 15GB model for the same price. Um, why is that a one-star review? The 10GB iPod is still great, and may be available for a discounted price ($236). The fact that a new model has come out is NOT a reason to dissuade prospective buyers of the 10GB at such a low price. (An incredible deal, really.)<p>7. One person complained about sending an email to the Apple support site and is furious he hasn't gotten a reply. I'm fairly certain Apple doesn't offer email support. Misleading and deceptive. Apple does offer 800 number tech support as well as absolutely free &quot;Genius Bar&quot; tech support at the 60+ retail locations across the country, which is a pleasure to use.<p>8. Some complain about &quot;sound quality&quot;. I think this a function of MP3 compression. (Or AAC compression, Dolby's format, which is supposed to be better.) iTunes gives you an option of higher quality rates if you'd like to, which I doubt these people have tried.<p>9. A lot of people are PC users whose machines are freezing on them. IMO, this is Microsoft's fault for making such a terrible product, vulnerable to spyware, viruses, worms, security holes. I'd bet almost all the people reporting problems with their machines have at least one of the aforementioned problems -- all of which are common in the Windows world and non-existent in the Apple one. Get a better computer, people!

<Title>IPOD-Bad Product Not Ready for Consumer Market
<Date>Mon Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got a new IPOD for Christmas.  It turned out to be a nightmare from the beginning.  My wife purchased it for use with a brand new PC and an ITRIP so it can be used in an automobile.  Apple sells both products as an integrated system.  It turned out that I could never get the ITRIP and IPOD to work together, contrary to Apple's claims.  When I finally gave up and tried to return this product after Christmas, they wouldn't take it back.  They claimed the problem had to be on the side of ITRIP (I've yet to confirm that), and they don't stand behind that vendor.  Bottom line is they they have a 10 day return policy in the very small print somewhere on line (and no, the 800 No. salesman doesn't tell you that), and since my wife ordered this in early December they told me I had to keep it whether I wanted it or not.  Also, they sold my wife on personalizing the IPOD (loving note on back) which was FREE.  Turns out that once it is personalized, they won't take it back even if something is wrong with it (but they won't tell you that).  Just to add to the horror show, they shipped it initially to the wrong address (after we had them read it back to us), and they forgot to mention that a special PC cable was required to work with a PC (and yes they were asked).  I had to order the new cable after Christmas, so I didn't even get to turn the device on till after the first week of January.  After spending 2 weeks trying to debug it, I gave up and tried to return it.  You know the rest of the story.  I started out my computer career on one of the early Apple computer's.  Turns out this will be the last Apple product I ever buy.  MY ADVICE: THESE PEOPLE SPECIALIZE IN SALES DECEPTION - BUY YOUR MUSIC PLAYER FROM A COMPANY THAT STANDS BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT!!!

<Title>(...)Not Ready for Consumer Market
<Date>Mon Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got a new IPOD for Christmas.  It turned out to be a nightmare from the beginning.  My wife purchased it for use with a brand new PC and an ITRIP so it can be used in an automobile.  Apple sells both products as an integrated system.  It turned out that I could never get the ITRIP and IPOD to work together, contrary to Apple's claims.  When I finally gave up and tried to return this product after Christmas, they wouldn't take it back.  They claimed the problem had to be on the side of ITRIP (I've yet to confirm that), and they don't stand behind that vendor.  Bottom line is they have a 10 day return policy in the very small print somewhere on line (and no, the 800 No. salesman doesn't tell you that), and since my wife ordered this in early December they told me I had to keep it whether I wanted it or not.  Also, they pressured my wife into personalizing the IPOD (loving note on back), which was FREE.  Turns out that once it is personalized, they won't take it back even if something is wrong with it (but they won't tell you that).  Just to add to the horror show, they shipped it initially to the wrong address (after we had them read it back to us), and they forgot to mention that a special PC cable was required to work with a PC (and yes they were asked).  I had to order the new cable after Christmas, so I didn't even get to turn the device on till after the first week of January.

<Content>First. The buttons on the front are touchy...I keep on turning it on accidently and draining the battery (and a fully charged battery barely lasts 2 hours of listening time...)<br>There is no setting to disable the front panel controls...hint to Apple...you need this feature!<br>Second. ACC format...what's that all about? Nothing on the PC side of the world (hey folks, 98% of the computing public are PC oriented.) uses ACC format (except for some obscure apps like the horrendous Music Match and the equally bad iTunes)<br>If iPod users want to make their music that they download from iTunes available to their home stereo using a wireless network connection, what device would they use? Linksys, Creative Labs and the HP DMR-EW5000 digital media players all do not support ACC formats...MP3s folks...there's a reason it's called &quot;a standard&quot; The whole world uses it!!!<br>I have an 85GB MP3 Music library. I carry snapshops around on my Archos device (yeah, it sucks, but it works and is reliable) 20gbs at a time. but my main library is on my server at home. I use Winamp to stream my music to my computer at work, I use a wireless connection to send fresh music automatically to my Windows CE onboard player device in my car (custom software assures that I always have fresh music based off of what I already listened to) and I have a wireless media player for my home stereo that interfaces a menuing system through my TV set (Viewing my digital photos on my 53 inch plasma is awsome) These are things you cannot do with Acc format music folks!<br>Third iTunes for Windows. Man...can any single application suck as bad as this? First, it's nothing more than a thinly veiled medium for pushing Apple's other products (Jobs has even admitted that he is using the iPod the iTunes to &quot;suck&quot; windows users into the Mac world.  The first problem with iTunes is that you don't have consistant menues for your second mouse button and the third mouse button doesn't exist...Hey Apple...you're targetting the enlightened Windows users...we know how to use more than one finger to click a mouse! Second problem is that this interface is nothing more than a re-badged browser! And it doesn't use any of your existing internet settings like your favorites menu, nor your automatic form fillers, or any of the browser help objects you may have installed (like Google toolbar with an auto fill form app) And let me tell you...you have to fill in a lot of fields to download a song! <br>And where's the security icon that Windows users are accustomed to see in the lower right hand corner of their browser? Apple &quot;says&quot; that the connection that you're sending your credit card information is secure...but how do I know that? I don't see an &quot;https&quot; in the browser, nor do I see the padlock. And call me paranoid, but I surely don't want an application saving my credit card information on my computer locally either...and I certainly don't want someone else to store my credit card information! So, having to fill out that form information for EVERY song is nuts!<br>And whats with spending a buck for a song? And a low resolution song at that? Sure, ACC format recorded at 128 is like MP3 at 132 or something like that...sure...but it's still compressed audio. And it's compresed audio at 10 times compression...Folks, look up the term &quot;lossy compression&quot; you will find out that music that is compressed is done by REMOVING sound! Yes, that's right! the sound you want to hear is removed from the music to make the file smaller. The smaller the file, the more sound is taken out of the music! CDs have (get this) CD quality sound...makes sense, right? The music you download from iTunes has one tenth of the music that CDs have. And since you're not getting the liner notes, or the video that is sometimes included on the CD, you should pay less than one tenth of what a CD costs! Plus, when you consider that there is the distribution, bricks and morter (physical stores) and employees that need to be paid, you can see that at the costs that a CD is, (about $17 now) a downloaded MP3 should be less than 17 cents! Come on people...it's your money...vote with your wallets!<br>In all, I gave this device 2 stars becuase it does look cool...but unfortunatly, it's not the device for windows users!

<Title>Hello? iPOD
<Date>Thu Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The review of an &quot;electronics fan&quot; from yesterday is incorrect.  He/she wrote:<p>&quot;First. The buttons on the front are touchy...I keep on turning it on accidently and draining the battery (and a fully charged battery barely lasts 2 hours of listening time...)  There is no setting to disable the front panel controls...hint to Apple...you need this feature!&quot;<p>I have the original iPOD which has an excellent control lock switch, as do ALL newer models. When this switch is in the lock position, an orange panel is visible. Quite elegant-- one more feature reminiscent of scandinvian design. Now if a fully charged battery is lasting only two hours- either the product is defective or quite old.  If it is quite old, one would hope the user would have discovered the key lock switch by now.  HINT TO REVIEWER; review on something you are familiar with.<p>4 stars to the 10/15GB 3G iPOD which I have extensively checked out, only because the battery life is indeed slightly short (an extra 20% would be welcome).  But, overall, a substantial improvement over the 1G/2G iPods.

<Title>very cool
<Date>Thu Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Knowing the 10GB model is being phased out by Apple for the 15GB model I recently purchased one at the relative bargain price being offered by Amazon.  I seriously doubt I need even close to 10GB for music - but never say never.<br>I have a PC so I was a little leary - and I did have one hurdle to cross - my PC was operating on Windows 98 so I had to upgrade to WindowsXP to use the Ipod.  The upgrade was painless and the new operating system is a major improvement.<br>As for the Ipod the directions could be much clearer and for this I take away one star.  All in all the ipod works as billed; it sounds great and the design is very functional, and it looks really cool.  I really like this unit a lot - but, while (after some experimentation)I can load the music I want  I still believe that there must be an easier way that I will eventually discover and the directions really are lacking in this area.

<Title>I Can't Put It Down
<Date>Sun Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I recently bought the 10GB ipod off of Amazon and it is so much fun.  The songs transfer from iTunes to the pod so fast right when you plug it in for the first time.  I'm listening to it right now and earlier I put it on slipped it into my pocket and was doing chores around the house.  The greatest thing about it is if you have an adapter in your car so you can play cd's from your tape player, you can plug in the ipod instead of your portable cd player and it sounds perfect.  Plus NO SKIPPING WHEN YOU HIT BUMPS!!!!

<Title>Even Better than the First Version
<Date>Wed Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I remember seeing a friend on a cold Novemeber day in 2001, he uses OS X and I use XP Professional, none of us had anything against the other operating system, that was just how it was; but it was that day that he showed me his new 5 gig iPod and I was hooked. You might be asking yourself why I waited until the third generation iPods came out to get one. Well, for one, in November 2001 and until August 2002, iPods were for Macintosh users only. But then you may wonder why didn't I get one in August. Well, I thought I would, but they were expensive and I wasn't sure I wanted to spend that much money after hearing about all the problems Windows users had with MusicMatch and their iPods and then the lack of help they were given by Apple Support just because they were Windows users. So I waited a bit and later that year, I updated my computer and thinking about the future I installed a Creative Audigy sound card because I knew its price was close to that of a PCI firewire card, something I lacked. It was then I was seriously thinking about investing in an iPod. But I began reading about the trouble that Creative's version of the IEEE 1394a standard, SB1394, was giving PC users. I was worried so I waited some more, by this time it was January 2003, and a new 40 gig iPod was rumoured to be approaching, this meant the price would drop for the other models so I waited and waited. The rumour sites I looked at said it would be released in early March. We all know Apple waited until May and they only ended up releasing a 30GB version (7500 songs for the 30GB vs. 10000 for a 40GB.) A few of my friends got the new iPod, I saw that it was better than the first: smaller, more rounded, the new backlight was cool, and the issue of the open firewire port was solved. I was still worried about the Creative Firewire issue and the use of MusicMatch. After hearing from them that MusicMatch did indeed work fine, I went for it. I visited my Apple Store, got stuck in traffic on the way home (worrying about the FireWire all the way) and then plugged in the iPod and it worked fine without any of the problems I had heard of. I loved all of my friends iPods and I love having my own. It's a great product. Yes, MusicMatch isn't the best but I may try Ephpod and besideds the guy at the store wasn't too upset when I told him I was a Windows user. Buy an iPod, it is hands down better than the Creative Zen and the Archos Jukebox put together. Period.

<Date>Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I recently purchased a PowerMac 12&quot; computer and got a great deal on a 10GB iPod.  I absolutely love it!  I'm currently in the process of backing up my entire CD collection and putting my favorites on the iPod to use in the car; much easier to use the iPod on the road than shuffling through CDs.  There are a few things that don't thrill me about its design: it is rather difficult to change settings on the fly (i.e. EQ).  It'd be nice to have the EQ sync with the genre on the mp3 tags (if this is actually available I haven't figured it out).  It takes a while to become comfortable with its navigation, however once you do there's really no problem getting around.<p>PROS:<br>firewire powers/charges/syncs device (no needless, excessive input ports)<br>sleek, slim design<br>backlight VERY handy<br>stores other data files than just mp3/AAC/wav/etc.<br>screamin' fast firewire connection (compare to USB)<br>durable; no problem jogging w/ it on a belt clip<br>solid state buttons/wheel<br>many features (calendar, games, clock, etc.)<p>CONS:<br>proprietary Firewire cable (which, in apple's defense, is included)<br>fairly expensive compared to other mp3 systems (high $/GB ratio)

<Title>The perfect iPod
<Date>Tue Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I recently have decided to buy an iPod and I wanted to research how well it worked. The first thing I realized was that ipod was three-hundred dollars, and that to me at the time was a bit too much, then I looked at the other mp3 players. The next best offer I say was a one-hundred and twenty-eight megabite mp3 player, and it was one hundred witch some people said was reasonable, but when you look at the ipod, for three times the price it has seventy times the memory, and that was just the  begining. Unlike any other mp3 player it also has a few simple but fun games, a much cooler and stylish look, a built in clock, calender, and a wake up timer, I made this reveiw on the 10 giga-bite iPod even though the best one is the 30 giga-bite ipod, I wrote this on the one that I planned to buy, I hope that this review will give an i dea of how incredible the ipod is, and to catch your eye before you buy a different mp3 player- your friend mike

Oh and another bad thing is that if you use a windows computer, less songs can be stored:2000. With the new music format on macs you can hold 2500. 2000 is still a lot of songs though. Dont let those small things make you not buy it though, this thing is AWESOME. ALL THOSE SONGS, GAMES, A CALENDAR, CLOCK, TEXT PAD, ITS FAST, THE SONGS ARE REAL EASY TO GET TO. . . That reminds me: If you have 2500 songs on your IPOD, and you wanted to find 1, you'd be able to find it REAL FAST cause of the browsing system.

The included MusicMatch software for PC is basically totally broken (and this is confirmed by numerous posts on sites like ipodlounge.com). The standard advice is to go buy another program like xplay since the included software from Apple doesn't work. The problem with the third party programs is that most haven't been updated to work with the latest crop of ipods. ... Not sure if this is apple's way of suggesting that everyone buy a mac ..., but if you are a PC users I suggest looking elsewhere. I am very disappointed ...<br>-H

Musicmatch is a very good media player anyway and works well with the iPod. Not only is it the best MP3 player on the market by miles and miles but it looks great and works easily on windows. I just plugged it in and it instantly downloaded all my music in under 5 minutes. Also, unless you work at a radio station the 10 GB is the best value for money and is smaller aswell.

<Content>I am buying the Rio Cali 256 Sport to replace my iPod. I've had the iPod for 1 year and bought it specifically for long runs. It's great for storing songs and for non-impact activities, but it is NOT for running! <p>My iPod started to freeze up while running, so I went to the Apple store for help. (The freeze-up only happened while I was running. It was OK otherwise.) I was told to restore the iPod to factory settings. That did not work, so I went back to the help desk. The second time, the tech person told me that running with the iPod was like running &quot;with a hard drive strapped to your belt&quot; and that it was not good to run with it. I am a tried and true Mac person, but I would not recommend this MP3 for active sports.

<Title>Beautiful Machine & Yes, It works with PCs....
<Date>Thu Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this toy for X-mas, but was reluctant to use it after reading the warnings for PC users. When you look closely on the box, they do recommend to use either a USB 2.0 or FireWire connection. So here I went and got a SIIG USB 2.0 Firewire 10/100 Adapter Card (for sale on Amazon for $42.99) and installed the card in my PC. Then I rebooted, installed the software for the SIIG, connected the iPod and installed its software and VOILA!!! It works awesome. Without a snitch!!!<p>The music program iTunes is an awesome software, much better than MusicMatch and works without any problem on a PC. The transfer from the PC to the iPod of MP3s is PHENOMENAL. A full 60 minutes album @160kps encoding is roughly dowloaded in 10 seconds.... Thanks to the Firewire connection. The iPod comes with a Firewire cable but if you want the USB 2.0 cable, you'll need to go on Apple web-site.<p>Last but not least, the design is really cool, the wheel easy to use and the earphones decent quality. Just a precaution: buy a carrying case to protect this jewel. Remember there is a hard drive in it.<p>One thing missing: COLOR DISPLAY??? Apple, anyone???

<Title>I Loves me'pod
<Date>Fri Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This product is just amazing.  First of all I would like to establish credibility with everyone here by saying that I have researched the iPod a lot before buying and even some more after buying.  I have owned my iPod for about a month now, and I own the 3rd generation 10gb iPod(win).  <p>I use my iPod with my inspirion 5100 Dell system.  Running XP Pro, and iTunes for Windows.  It is smooth as butter.  I have not run into any problems, and the software is extremely easy to use.  You plug in your iPod, and you wait while it downloads your music to its hard drive at 1 song per second.  (With USB 2.0 or firewire)  <p>Now there has been a lot of speculation and worries about the battery and I urge you to not worry.  In fact before you buy the iPod I recommend googling the keyword &quot;li-ion battery" or &quot;battery care&quot;.  And try to specifically look for li-ion batteries, as that is what the iPod uses.  These batteries are good for 300-500 charge discharge cycles.  One thing I read that was really important was to keep the battery cool, and almost never do a full discharge.  These batteries have NO memory affect, and last longer when not fully depleted, but rather charged after a certain battery power remains.  So never drain the battery.  Going back a little bit there are now third party companies that offer &quot;do it yourself&quot; battery replacement kits online for about 50-70 bucks.  Or you can mail it to Apple for around 105 dollars and they will replace it with a new battery.  This price includes shipping and tax, but it is approx!<p>The speakers are great, considering they are ear buds.  Sounds are clear and crisp, almost sounds like my 2.1 computer sound system.  The frequency response is good, and unless you are a composer, you will be extremely satisfied with the speakers.<p>The other great thing about the iPod that others do not offer is the ability to double as an external hard-drive.  I know for a fact that the Dell DJ has no capability as it is strictly an mp3 player.  So you can use your iPod for more then just music.  You can even use your iPod to boot your operating system.  You can literally use your iPod as your only HD if you want.<p>This is a great mp3 player, and like all battery operated products, its batteries fail after time.  This is normal.  So in that case you just buy a new one.  I mean how many cell phone batteries have you gone through?  By the way, Dell currently offers no replacement battery for its Dell DJ.  <p>The iPod will eventually grow on you, it is popular for a reason and its attractive and sleek design allows you to take it anywhere.  With a 25min skip protection you might as well jump on it, and it still won't skip!!  I am not a Mac fan at all, but I think the iPod is a great innovation.  For all those who are skeptical, do some research, and consider the superiority of the iPod.  Thanks for your time.

<Date>Mon Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Not only do you need a fire wire but you also need an I pod dock.I found that out after i had gotten my I pod. The fire wire cable is about 19.99 and the i pod dock is about 39.99. But other than those two things the i pod is the most awesome thing i have ever seen. I love mine and dont think twice about buying one.

<Title>Very nice piece of equipment, but not perfect
<Date>Mon Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have an Apple imac, so I am not having the problems that PC users are having. The unit is nice and small, but my biggest complaints are 1) accessories are expensive for apple products 2) I'm annoyed by their free engraving offer which apparently keeps people from being able to return or exchange their ipods (I, fortunately, didn't not have mine engraved). 3) itunes will not allow you to pull songs from your ipod and put them on your hard drive.  This is easily avoided however with software that can be found online.  Of course, you have to purchase the software. In summary, it's a nice unit, but I question some of Apple's decisions.

<Title>Love this gadget
<Date>Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got this item about two weeks ago and I am really happy with it. The earbuds were uncomfortable but I simply bought another set of headphones instead. The software installed properly the first time around, the transfers from my PC to the IPOD are very very fast, and all in all I think it is one of the slickest pieces of electronic gear I've owned.<p>I might have bought the mini-IPOD had I known they were available, but this unit is a manageable size and has loads of storage space.<p>A Keeper.

<Title>I've never been so frustrated with something in my life!!!
<Date>Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First of all, this piece of apple technology meshes with windows systems very poorly.  I never could get my compaq computer to recognize it.  Fortunately, my wife's computer could see it after 2-3 hours of tinkering, but then we were dismayed because MusicMatch is impossible to figure out, and comes with no instructions.<p>Second, the unit freezes if you run with it.  We had the same experience as other Amazon reviewers.  Basically, they don't tell you this when you buy it, or bring it back once or twice to have it looked at.  It's usually the 3rd or 4th technician/salesman (with us, it was the 3rd) who tells you that, &quot;running with an iPod is like running with a hard drive -- it's just not made for that type of abuse&quot;.  We traded ours in for a new one, then sold it and bought an iRock.  It only holds 25 songs, but is much lighter, more shock-resistant, and comes with true windows-ready software that is actually decipherable.

<Title>disappointing service
<Date>Thu Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I may have a lemon but I've had nothing but trouble with it. And the really disappointing thing is that the service at Apple is awful. you can't talk to anyone, you have to sign on and do it online - they won't let you write much, I had to redo it 3x to get it to take. and I sent it once and they didn't fix it. now I'm sending it again and they are charging me for shipping. I'll never buy another Apple product and if it doesn't work this time I'm moving on to another MP3. too bad - its cool and it sounds good when it works.

<Title>In a league of its own
<Date>Sat Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Apple 10 GB Ipod from a Windows User<p>Pros: <p>Lithium Ion Battery: Actually lasts as long as Apple says it does.<br>20 EQ Settings: You can really tell a difference!<br>Downloading and Syncing music is E-Z: It automatically updates when connected.<br>Backlight: Very bright and cool. White screen and red buttons.<br>Playlists: Pretty useful when you have a lot of songs and don't want to spend time looking for ones you want to hear. <p>Cons:<p>Firewire Charging: For Win users.... If you use 4 pin for firewire, your IPOD will NOT charge during syncing. Either purchase the docking station and/or the USB 2.0 + Firewire cable, allows you to plug the into USB and your AC adapter. <p>Deleting and Creating using IPOD alone: I don't think you can delete songs or make playlists without your computer. <p>Case/Sleeve Protector not included: The Ipod scratches pretty easily. I suggest buying a case very soon after buying one.<p>All in all a player above players. Reliable, easy, and extremely fashionable. The buttons are very sensitive, which is great sometimes and rather annoying others. Don't let the $299 sticker price stop you from buying one because you won't regret it!

<Title>a 30th to remember
<Date>Mon Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>for my 30th birthday one of the presents i received was a apple ipod 10gb for windows. i receieved the ipod on thursday but could not right away play music. the games and other features worked though. by sunday i had finally gotten my ipod to work and i couldn't have been happier. the ipod is nothnig short of amazing. the easy use of the ipod is strong feature as is the 10gb of space. i have uploaded 219 songs onto my ipod and still have 8.3 gb. i haven't even used 1 gb yet. one thing that many people have stated they didn't like about the ipod was the program musicmatch that came with it. yes, musicmatch had porbelms when i first set it up. other than the inital problems musicmatch works like a dream. a major concern i have about the ipod is its battery. i wish they had given us a longer lasting battery. Another concern is durability but with all that you get it is a small price to pay.  other than that the ipod is amazing. now i can listen to cd's i that i have not been listening to. and the only reason i haven't been listening to those cd's is because i don't have a big enough cd carrying case and i don't really don't want to carry that many cd's with me anyway. now i don't have to. now the ipod will never replace my cd's,it can't cause i have too many, or my cd player but it will be something that i will use for as long as i can.

<Title>It's sexy.  What else do you need to know?
<Date>Fri Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The new iPod is definitely sexy and sleek, and easy to take anywhere.  It holds a lot of music, but is a little more expensive then other MP3 type players.  (The Creative Nomad and Archos Jukebox are about the same price with about twice the storage I think, but are also bigger and clunkier.)  The iPod is definitely the way to go if you're looking for something with a lot of room for music, but a smaller size.<p>I had a little problems getting my Mac to see the iPod the first time, and syncing it with iTunes took a few tries, for some reason.  I'm not sure if it's because I hadn't really used iTunes before, but syncing wasn't really intuitive.  (That's probably a fault of the software, though, and not the iPod's fault.)  I didn't have the same problem on Windows, though.  It worked well the first time, aside from losing what was already on the iPod (see next paragraph).<p>It is worth mentioning that you can't download songs from both your Mac and your Windows machine to reside on the iPod at the same time.  When you go to transfer songs from the Windows machine when you've previously synced with the Mac, all the previous songs will be erased because it has to format it in to the Windows format.  Probably not an issue for most people, since most are either Mac People or Windows People, but it is worth at least a note.<p>The controls are sometimes really sensitive.  If you happen to "brush" the front of the iPod while it's playing, you could very easily end up skipping forward or backwards a track.  However, to prevent this, there is a "lock" slide on top of the iPod, so it won't register any button pushes (good for when it's powered off and you don't want it to accidently turn on while in your purse or backpack).  Also, as a note, if you ever hand it over to someone to look at (which undoubtably, when people see it, they'll want to touch it), make sure you take off your headphones.  The first thing the other person will do is turn the volume dial up. ;)<p>The powering on/off can be a little annoying, since to turn it off, you have to hold down a button for a couple of seconds.  I'd prefer just a switch or something quicker.  If someone's talking to me, I don't want to wait two seconds to turn off my music.<p>The backlight is really nice, though, and makes it really easy to see the display.  You can adjust the time on it so that it's always on, or it turns on for set amount of seconds after you've pushed a button.<p>The battery power seems to last for a good amount of time.  I can take it to work with me and listen to it all day.  It'll usually run out of batteries about five minutes in to my drive home, so I'd guess it's about nine or ten hours of play time, depending.<p>Overall, it's a pretty great device, it just has a couple of annoying things when you're using it *all the time*.  The storage size and the physical size (and admittedly, the look) are worth the annoyances.

<Title>The iPod is amazingly perfect.
<Date>Sun Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I just bought my very own iPod 3 days ago, and I have to say that it is one of the best investments I have made. <br>To start off, the very box that it is in is elegant, clean, and streamlined. The iPod itself is the perfect size. While it is small, it is not uncomfortable for large hands. The buttons are placed perfectly and with the trackball, you don't have to think about what you are doing at all. Also, the iPod is light, but it doesn't give the impression of being cheap or toy-like. <br>All together, it took about 10 minutes to install all the software on my computer (which is running Windows XP Professional) and everything went very smoothly. I disagree with the people that think that Music Match is a bad program; I have had no problems with it. <br>The built in features in the iPod are plentiful. There are over 20 equalizers that all have a distinct sound. There are three games, which are surprisingly advanced; I have seen worse games on some palm pilots. The iPod has a calendar, notes, and contacts (all of which can be imported by synching to Outlook. The backlight is clear and perfect. The iPod can also be used as an external hard drive.<br>The synching between Music Match and the iPod is smooth and fast (trusting that you have FireWire or USB 2.0). When you make any changes in Music Match and then synch to your iPod the changes are made there too. If you make multiple playlists that have a song in common, your iPod does not double up on the song, and saves you valuable space. I had about 2 GB of music on my computer and it took about 5 minutes to finish synching (via FireWire).<br>Finding your particular song that you want to play on your iPod could not get any easier. You can browse by: Artist, Title, Album, Genre, or Composer. If you have many songs, it is easy to go though them quickly with the trackball. When you select a song there is about a second of wait when the hard drive recalls the song. There is absolutely no skipping; the box says there is skip protection of up to 20 minutes. When playing a song and pausing it or fast-forwarding, there is no lag in the time between pressing the button and the effect. <br>The battery lasts eight hours and charges quickly (especially when plugged into your computer via FireWire). I saw someone else saying that plugging it into their wall with the AC plug shorts out the battery, but I have not experienced that, I think that their problem was just their outlet. Don't let his experience put you off.<br>The only negative thing I can think of is that it doesn't exactly cater to older computers. The iPod will work with USB 1.1 but you have to buy a separate cable (a specialized one made by Apple. This also goes for USB 2.0) I have not seen these cables anywhere else but Apple's website. If you only have USB 1.1 I recommend buying a new USB 2.0 or FireWire card (this is what I had to do). A Belkin FireWire PCI card (which is made almost specifically for the iPod) only cost me 40 dollars. Out of the two I would recommend FireWire. FireWire allows you to charge your iPod and you won't have to buy a separate (and hard to find) chord (as the iPod comes with its own FireWire cable). Also my iPod froze once, but it is easily taken care of by just holding down play and menu at the same time.<br>All in all, the iPod is a great Mp3 player, the best one out there. I recommend it for anyone with a large CD collection or a large collection of downloaded music. I absolutely love it, and I think it was worth every bit of the 300 dollars it cost.

<Title>1 Week's Worth of Feedback
<Date>Mon Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is a neat product if you're really into convenience (who isn't?) and music. The pros:<br>1. Lets you transport a huge music collection with you anywhere in a very compact package. No transporting bunches of CDs around or a laptop loaded with your MP3s.<br>2. Did I mention that it is small??? Go to COMPUSA or BEST BUY and check it out before you buy. The touch-dial interface may confuse at first but you do get used to it very quickly, like a new cell phone. So don't sweat the controls when you first try it.<br>2. You can play hours of music on end with no participation needed - great for parties or if you're just plain lazy like me.<br>The cons:<br>1. Charges using the same port as that which you connect to your FIREWIRE port which gives me some concern as to its future reliability. It just does not seem as sturdy as your typical circular AC adapter connection.<br>2. You may find a way to make the IPOD manager software work with your PC &amp; MUSICMATCH software with WIN98 but I could not. I changed my OS to WIN ME to get it to work, and boy ME is really RAM hungry. Anyway WIN98 does not meet listed IPOD requirements so you should at least consider this before you buy. I expected the MUSICMATCH software interface to IPOD to be simple but it took a little stumbling around to figure it out. What do you expect when you don't read directions. The one thing that is a little annoying is, after you download your songs to the IPOD you have to tell the software to &quot;EJECT&quot; the IPOD to stop the interface before you can disconnect it. That takes about 20-30 seconds. <br>3. If you're considering buying the IPOD, take a serious look at the 15GB version vice the 10GB version. For a little more cash, you get accessories that do not come with the 10GB version including the data/charger dock, the remote/headphones,and carrying case. If you buy the 10GB version and these accessories separately, you'll pay more than the 15GB version price!!! Why the hell would you want these accessories? I think they should help cut down the wear and tear on your IPOD and probably prolong its life (at least the dock and the case) and your investment. Of course I have no data to prove that since I dont work for Apple or Consumer Reports, its just my OPINION.<p>Anyway that is my feedback after 1 week of use. Have fun with it!

<Content>Ok I'm conviced that some of the people who wrote reviews for this work for Macintosh. I was really looking forward to getting one for my birthday. Instead of having it work flawlessly (yeah I know. I guess my expectations were high. This is a MAC product we're talking about here) it froze in diskmode for an hour. That wasn't all that big deal since I was able to figure that problem out. Soon after though, the battery keep indictated that it was out of power. This after it had been CHARGING FOR 4 HOURS AND SAID THAT BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGED!! The best was yet to come though!!! You need to install musicmatch jukebox in order to transfer music to your iPod. Well it froze each time I tried to transport mp3s to the iPod. The last time it froze it deleted almost ALL of my MP3s!!!! That was it for me so now it's going back to the store tomorrow so I can get my money back. Way to go Mac!!!!

I did, and the unit crashed on me. <br>I wanted this unit to work so bad that I worked on it for 2 hours and it still didn't work. <br>I have seen people with the Ipods and I am sure they are Apple users. There is no reason in the world that this unit, for the money I paid for it, should have problems working right out of the box. Especially, if I used on a new computer.<br>It just simply is not constructed for PC/Windows use. <br>I am giving this one star becuase the display and size was nice, but the frustration of getting it to work was too much. <br>If you have an Apple (based on the other reviews)get an Ipod. If you don't, don't say I didn't warn you.

<Content>After some initial bumps, I now love my iPod, but there are some things I was never told....for one thing, the material states that iPod is fully compatible with Windows, however if you are running ME you MUST have a Firewire card in order to use it. I did not, I only had a USB port, but did not find out you couldn't do that until much frustration and calling Apple support. (I did, however, find Apple Care to be VERY helpful and informative). However, after I upgraded my system to XP I had no problems, other than the fact that the USB 1.0 connection is tremendously slow. But, I think if you have a USB 2.0 card and are running XP, you will be very happy with this product!!

<Title>The single coolest device I've owned
<Date>Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The 10GB iPod is by far the coolest electronic device I've ever owned. I just switched from PC to MAC and got the iPod because I love music and thought it would be fun to try out, and since I was already buying a new computer what was another $300.00 (sarcasm)? The price is a little high and was the only thing keeping me from buying one earlier, now I wish I would not have waited! <p>The user interface is very easy to learn and it took me about 5 minutes to get used to it. If your music is organized correctly with the correct ID3 tags then you will have no problem locating your music, and the iPod does a good job of keeping all the information easy to access.<p>The iPod is extremely easy to connect (on my Mac at least, I have not tried it on a PC, but I would imagine if you have firewire it is pretty straight forward), just plug it in and go. After spending two days transfering all my CD's onto my hard drive I now have my entire collection on the iPod with room to spare. I take this thing with me everywhere, and not only does it have my music it also syncs with my Calendar and Address Book. I believe that this feature is only available to Mac users, although I am not sure. It has replaced my PDA however due to how incredibly easy it was to sync with everything on the Mac (although I never used my PDA seriously enough to warrant owning one, for those of you that are dependant on your PDA's it is absolutely no replacement as you can not enter data on the go).<p>If you are putting off getting one of these due to the price, don't put it off any longer it is more than worth the money.

<Title>Still The Best
<Date>Mon Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my iPod for a couple of months now, and it has been one of my best purchases ever.  I've had no problems with the battery, and the software on both the iPod and my computer work seamlessly and flawlessly, making it nothing less than a joy to sync up my music with it.  The battery lasts for hours,  and it charges when it's hooked up to my computer.  I've noticed people complaining about the battery conking out.  My friend had a similar problem with his iPod, read those complaints, decided he'd been screwed, and got mad at Apple.  I told him to send it to them with an explanation of what wasn't working. He did, and they sent him a brand new one the next week.  That is not bad customer service. <br>The thing about the iPod that is scary is its high price tag, otherwise everyone would have one.  There are now competitors/imitators out for less mulah, and the reviews for all of them seem to flatter said devices.  I have noticed, however, that all of these reviews mention the iPod and compare them quite defensively with it which shows me that iPod, though it has competitors, is still the best, and still the measure of what a digital media jukebox should be.  If you want the best out there, get an iPod.  If you want a cheaper one with confusing software, and crummy, ugly hardware, get an imitator.  My recomendation is to save up for an iPod. It's worth it.  (I've also heard rumors of a less expensive, smaller model coming out soon.. Maybe wait for that?)

<Title>Best present ever
<Date>Mon Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My wife bought me the 10GB IPOD for christmas and I love it. I read a lot of reviews before I actually recieved it and I'm glad I did. It enabled me to go get a firewire card for my Dell. I had downloaded ITunes months ago so when the Ipod arrived, I was ready to go.I opened the box, plugged it into the firewire and, within 5 minutes, an update was downloaded and my entire 3.5 Gb of music I already had on my harddrive was on transferred. I have not been able to put the thing down ever since. I also bought the Belkin FM tranmitter so I can listen in my car. There is a little static but basicly sounds good. I now have over a thousand songs ready to go, in the palm of my hands.<br>   For those having Windows compatability problems, I found a few hints at Techtv.com and ipodlounge. Good luck to you. Once you get it working, you will love it.

<Title>I Love it!
<Date>Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod is the greatest little (and I mean &quot;little&quot;) device I've ever used--or heard of.  It worked right out of the box, as I have gotten used to since I got my Mac.  (I am a former Windows user who switched because I was tired of fighting to get things to work on my PC.)<p>Based on the reviews I've read, if you have anything other than a low-end PC, and if you download iTunes, you'll experience the ease of Apple.

<Content>This product is awesome and easy to use.  Granted, for Windows users it is a tad more difficult.  But, if yo have Windows XP, iTunes 4.1, and buy the optional USB 2.0 cable; it is no problem.<p>The features are amazing and the iPod is just plain beautiful.  Notice the slick chrome design with pearl face; very 21st Century.  It makes me want to buy everything Apple makes.<p>But a cationary note must be stated; this unit scratches very easily (so buy a case).  <p>There simply is not better MP3 player; don't even bother.  Others pale in comparison and lack the features.  Worth every penny!! Go and buy one now!!

<Title>Great Little Player
<Date>Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My husband gave this to me for Christmas.  The design of the packaging was what I would expect from Apple and was not disappointed.  I loaded it on my Dell PC, without any problems and was able to download music right away.  The only problem I have is that the earbuds don't stay in my ears while working out.  I've spoken to other women who would like this player, but they want a chose of different colors.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this little player with the big sound!

<Title>Apple Uses Deceptive Sales Practice to Reduce Returns
<Date>Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Do NOT personalize your IPod with an engraving, which Apple is offering for &quot;free.&quot;  If you do this, you will NOT be able to return your IPod for ANY reason.  This detail is burried in the fine print found in &quot;Other Terms and Conditions.&quot;  This is a deceptive sales practive. The right to return a product is one of the hallmarks of responsible retailing. <p>This warning is in addition to the many caveats regarding the IPod's inferior battery.  Many users have found out the hard way that the &quot;memory effect&quot; degrades the battery in the IPod over time.  You will have to replace it.  Initially, Apple was charging $269 for the repair but they are succumbing to consumer pressure (and class action lawsuits) and offering a $99 replacement program.

<Title>IPod needs extra cables to work with  Windows
<Date>Thu Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought the IPod for Mac and Windows  recently from Amazon.  I have Windows XP not a Mac computer.  My Windows Computer does not have a Firewire connector, and I could not get the IPOD to work. Amazon did not provide any recommendations on how to fix the problem.  ... Dock Connector to FireWire and USB 2.0 Cable(Windows PC only) ...<p>After purchasing the IPod Dock Connector from Apple my IPod now works great. I would recommmend this product highly. This connection should have been included from Apple to begin with as it was advertised as for "MAC and Windows."  As Apple has chosen not to provide it as part of the purchase price, my suggestion to Amazon is to recommend the iPod Dock Connector to FireWire and USB 2.0 for Windows customers as an add on at time of purchase.  Amazon needs to provide this as an accessary rather than forcing the customer to find it at Apple without technical support from Amazon. It took about 10 days after receiving the IPod before i could get the Dock Connector from Apple.

<Content>I purchased the Ipod 10GB for windows. I have had no problems i use it with the Transpod in my work van and have no problems. When i rent cars or ride in some one elses i just take the unit along with me. I have a extra 5GB hard drive on my computer and store all my mp3s on that drive and my operating system on the other. I have downloaded and copyed about every Damm song i can and i only have 885 songs. This is a good product and i recommend it.transfer speeds with the firewire is lightening fast.copying your CD's using the enclosed MusicMatch program takes seconds to your Ipod. I'am curious on how the new design ipod is doing.

<Title>It's a wonderful little piece of equipment.
<Date>Mon Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I just got the iPod 10GB and I'm pretty impressed so far.  The unit is tiny, sounds great (better than on my computer) and interfaces suprisingly easily with Windows.  This is also the first Firewire device I've used and I'm impressed with the transfer speed.  The user interface on the player is unique but very intuitive, functional and simple to get used to. It doesn't crash, freeze or otherwise torment the user like some products out there.<p>The only drawbacks include the proprietary battery system which means if the battery starts failing you need to do surgery the thing. Also, I've found the included headphones, as rich and wonderful as they sound, to be very uncomfortable, at least as earbuds go.  I'm currently using my old Sony earbuds instead.  Finally, some additional on-board features such as a voice recorder or FM radio tunner would be nice, but aren't too sorely missed.<p>Definitely a product worth buying.  You won't find a better MP3 player anywhere.

<Title>iPod Will make music lovers happy.
<Date>Wed Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got my iPod last week, just before Isabel knocked out power in our area for days.  It was a life saver.<p>Now for the technical nitty gritty.  PC's can put mp4(aac)audio onto it, dbpoweramp's software with a mp4 codec will put aac audio on your ipod with the musicmatch software running (your iPod has to be opened).  However if mp3 floats your boat, musicmatch will do just fine.<p>Battery life is good contrary to what many people say about iPod. I have friends who have owned theres for over a year and it works beautifully.  It's best to keep updating your software and restore it once a year.  If you do restore, to keep battery life good, make sure you back up your files so you can re-install.<p>Simply put iPod, is the easiest, and best sounding portable audio player you can buy.  Save up, it will be the best money you've spent on music.

<Title>A little frusterating, but in the end, worth it
<Date>Thu Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I wrote a previous review about this product before even using it, complaining about the extra expenses that came with it. I regret not using the product first, to determine whether or not the hidden expenses (sales tax ($20.00), USB 2.0 card ($30.00), and USB plug ($19.00 plus $5.00 shipping and tax), total $374). The Apple iPod, despite its setbacks in price, is an amazing little product. <p>As soon as the USB connector cord arrived in the mail (quickly, even, I ordered late Saturday night and recieved my order the following Wednesday) I proceeded to download the software (took about 10 minutes, very easy set up), and record about 12 CDs using the MusicMatch Jukebox software that came with the iPod. This proved to be slightly frusterating...MusicMatch is not very user-friendly, and very flawed; I had to restart my computer between every 5 or so C.D.'s, and a few C.D.'s didn't record at all. Each C.D. took about 3 minutes to record. After recording the discs, I synced my iPod to MusicMatch (my computer failed to recognize the iPod, but for some reason MusicMatch did, so I had no problem) and downloaded the files; an amazingly fast process with USB 2.0. After that, I had a slight problem in that the iPod didn't remove the &quot;Do Not Disconnect&quot; message from the screen after the songs were downloaded. I decided to be brave, and unplug the little machine, and had no problems.<p>As far as the iPod itself goes, I was amazed. The controls are a bit confusing at first, but it too me no time at all to become accostomed to them. The overall layout of the files is easy...from the main screen you can go to the playlists option (a list of your playlists, or mixes, of songs...you could do &quot;Happy Songs&quot;, &quot;Favorite Songs&quot;, &quot;Classical Music&quot;, &quot;Songs that Start with the Letter B&quot;, etc.), the browse menu (look at songs by Artists, Albums, Songs, Genres, and Composers) the Extras menu (the clock, contacts list, calender, notes and games- Solitare, Brick, and Parachute. note: although you can enter info onto the contacts list, calender, and notes from your computer, information can no be entered on the go and the iPod is absolutely no replacement for a PDA), the settings menu, the backlight button, or the &quot;Now Playing&quot; option if you have music going. The sound quality of the player is excellent, however, I'm not a fan of the earbuds...they're a bit too big and uncomfortable. If you really, really, really want to get the most out of your iPod, you can use it as a portable hard drive- to transfer large files from one computer to another- or to download text onto like recipies, driving directions, and maybe a short story. The touch controls make the iPod more durable-no buttons to break-but are easily pressed, so you never know when you may accidentally brush against something and stop you song, or worse, cause the volume to rise to earsplitting levels. I reccomend using the hold switch so nothing will accidentally be pressed. The only problems I have are with the batterry status indicator...its very approximate. <p>So, in short....<p>Pros:<br>Put all your CDs on one player...throw out the clunky CD case<br>Small and portable<br>Easy to use<br>Doubles as a calender, address book, text displayer, and portable hard drive<br>iTunes Music Store (Mac) lets you purchase individual songs for $.99 each<br>Looks totally spiffy<br>Will make friends jealous<p>Cons:<br>Battery life indicator is approximate<br>MusicMatch is slightly difficult to use<p>Scratches very easily<br>Kinda screwy with the &quot;Do Not Disconnect&quot; messages<br>EXPENSIVE

I have a Windows PC and it even works with my computer. Don't listen to people who say you need an Apple Computer to make it work and also don't listen to people who say you need to have a firewire port installed in you Windows PC. If you buy the USB connector cord (www.apple.com) it syncs very quickly through USB on a Windows PC. Definitely a great product for all music lovers.

<Title>mp3 Players Don't Get Any Better
<Date>Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have own a few mp3 players my self, and I have many friends who own mp3 players and I have yet to see a better mp3 player than the apple iPod. The iPod is definitly the easiest mp3 player I've worked with and probably will ever work with because it's such a great little machine I wont ever have to by another mp3 player. With the iPods capibilties going up to as many as 10,000 songs and as little as 2,500 hundred songs, you only have to buy as many songs as you want. My iPod has been one of the best investments I have ever made. I use my iPod in my car, in my house connected to my sterio, any time I exercise, it's so lightweight you can take it anywhere and there are endless possibilities as to what you can do with it. If you are thinking about buying one, you shouldn't hesitate. All you need to think about is how many songs you want.

<Title>A godsend!
<Date>Fri Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I'm so happy that I got myself an iPod.  I've had no problems with it whatsoever.  I'll admit that it's pricey, but it's also well worth it--besides being a music player, it also functions as an address/contacts book and has a place where you can store notes (anything in .txt format) AND it serves as a hard drive, so you can store whatever you like on it and transfer it onto another computer.  Very nice.  But back to the music part...I don't have to carry big CD wallets around with me anymore.  I can listen to my favorite songs now without having to skip past the ones I don't like.  I can create my own playlists and listen to stuff from a bunch of different albums without having to physically shuffle anything around.  Plus it's helped me rescue several of my CD's--CD's that I was planning on throwing out because they wouldn't play properly on my CD player anymore; they were that broken in.  I'd tried cleaning and fixing these CD's before, and none of that worked out.  Then I got my iPod in the mail last week and thought, &quot;Why not?&quot; and tried putting the stuff from those CD's into it.  The music didn't just play well on the iPod--it sounded much, *much* better than it would've sounded on my CD player, even if the CD's themselves were in better condition.  Actually, *all* music sounds much better on an iPod than with a CD player.  It's fabulous.  I don't regret buying it at all.  It really is a godsend.

<Title>I love, love, this thing!
<Date>Sun Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've never been so in love with a thing before, well, maybe a certain Hot Wheels car when I was a kid, but I can't stop raving to all my friends and coworkers about my iPod. It's the best MP3 player on the market. Hands down.<p>Now that Apple released iTunes for Windows, there's no reason to not pony up to the bar and get one. Musicmatch is a joke in comparison: cluttered, non-intuitive, junky. Apple thinks about the user's needs: the interface, appealing design, simple logic. PC manufacturers must hire their designers from the Skoda or the Yugo factory. Apple makes good stuff that looks good. That being said, Apple's iTunes for Windows only supports 2000 and XP. My preferred iPod computer is a Mac, but the PC side just got much better. It was really smart for Apple to open it up. It might show PC users what junk they've been putting up with from Bill Gates and Co.<p>Pros: The interface is intuitive, not an afterthought. No other MP3 player comes close. It's tiny, light, it looks cool. The dial is really smart. Backlighting is a must at night. MP3s sound great. I rip mine at 192. 10 gigs is a lot of music. Took it on a roadtrip to Florida. Sweet! File transfer is a snap with firewire or USB 2.0. Again, it's intuitive. Drag and drop. I use it as a portable hard drive too, for multi-MB files. Battery life is pretty good. In the car, I leave it charging from the cigarette lighter via the firewire port.<p>Cons: Numero uno: price. Some folks can't jump the hurdle. You'll see them at Wal-Mart buying the cheese doodles and man-made fibers. Back off the fatty foods and leisure suits, my friends. Soon you'll have enough cash to get an iPod. Listen, if you're gonna buy your loved one an MP3 player, get them the best. Another $100 or a lifetime of regret. The choice is yours. Especially if you're buying for a woman. They'll never forgive you if you get them an ugly Archos or Nomad. Two words for you, cubic zirconia. You know what I mean? Cheapness goes deep, and women can smell it like cheap perfume. Don't make that mistake.<p>Accessories: Get a protective case, either leather or one of those gel things. I drop mine all the time, and it keeps on ticking. Once in a while it will burp, then I have to &quot;reboot&quot; it, but it's rare enough. I use a cassette adapter in the car, better than wireless transmitters, but an aux input deck would be even better. Get a cigarette lighter adapter to charge it while you're driving. A secret: set the iPod volume to about 85%, then use your car's volume to adjust per song. I read that now you can dump compact flash cards into your iPod, so that's another good-sounding accessory. I think Belkin is making it.

<Title>If only Apple could make every electronic product...Great!
<Date>Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I used to own the Sonic Blue/Diamond Rio 500 (remember those?) which at one time was the top mp3 player, but the software was extremely buggy and the player finally died after less than a year.  I could only fit about 65 minutes worth of 128k mp3 audio on it (when it worked properly), and the headphones sucked.  It seems as if Apple takes a failing product like the Rio and put their own spin on the stuff for the iPod, meaning everything on it works and does so much better than any player I've ever used.  I'm convinced that all of my electronic products, from my cell phone, to my car alarm button, should have been designed by Apple.  I am so happy with this product, and am even happier when they update the firmware every few months with even more improvements to a product that has ZERO problems.  Aside from the product design, it has really changed the way I listen to music.  The Auto-Sync feature is very cool, no more spending an hour or more transferring my songs to my player.  My tastes changed rapidly when I first started burning CDs, but with my 2nd Gen 10 GB model, there are songs that I sometimes forget I have in the iPod, and then gleefully remember, "yeah that's right, I have THAT song too."  My friends are so amazed at the capacity of songs in my player, and I've used it to DJ hotel parties too.  The battery lasts a long time too!  The only pet peeves I have is that playing it through FM radio in the car really SUCKS if you have a CD/FM car stereo (in lieu of using a tape player adaptor)...NONE of the available adaptors work very well; the other pet peeve is that I wish the screen was a touchscreen/stylus kind of deal (like the Palm Pilot).  However, if you get the iPod (and if you really love music, I recommend you do) get the actual Apple iPod case with it because I have dropped this thing a total of 4 times in the last 7 months--counting once without the case, and the case has given the iPod many many lives because of my clumsiness.  This is the first product in a long time that has truly made my life better.  Run, don't walk, to get this player! 12/31/2004 Update: I have since gave this iPod to my brother in law (he also loves it) and have been using a new 20 GB U2 Special Edition iPod, and this one works even better than my old one!  Again, if you really love your music with you, don't accept anything less than an iPod.

<Title>PC users beware!!!
<Date>Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I can see how Apple enthusiasts love this product, but PC users should beware for several reasons:<p>1) The USB cable is not included with the iPod.  So tack on another $20-$25 for that.  This makes it ***extremely*** non-cost competitive with the Dell product.  However, I will admit, this is a cool product with a cool design and small form factor, so if that's important to you it might be worth the extra cost.  <p>2) When you rip the CD's you own into iTunes, the default file format is AAC.  This is a huge problem if you then want to burn CDs of your music and play in a CD/MP3 player.  Most players will play MP3s, but not AACs.  You can convert from AAC to MP3, but you lose audio quality.  So, change the default to MP3 if you want to burn and play in a CD/MP3 player.  Otherwise, like me, you'll have to re-rip all your CDs.  This extremely annoyed me.  <p>3) Beware the feature where you can have your name engraved.  If you do so, you cannot return the product.  Also, I've heard Apple only gives 10 days to return the product (Amazon may provide more), so watch out for that.  <p>4) The battery is awful.  I charge it, and after it says fully charged, I take it out and it shows as only halfway charged!  It seems a lot of other folks have had problems with the battery as well.

<Title>A review from a Mac user
<Date>Fri Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Just picked up the 10GB Ipod, and I have to say, while I rarely give the highest review to an item, this one seems deserving.  Here's my bias, I am a mac owner, having switched over from a PC last year in order to do extensive multimedia work.  The Ipod purchase is strictly a pleasure purchase.<p>Installation was beyond easy.  Since Itunes 4.2 was already on my system, it was literally a matter of plugging the Ipod into a firewire port.  That's it.  The unit turned itself on and began synching.  The funny thing was that while I was looking in the instruction manual to see what I should do next, I looked up and saw that the Ipod had already synched with my Itunes and now my 250 songs, six audiobooks from audible.com and about half a dozen Fresh Air's from the audible subscription were already on the Ipod.  Oh, and all my playlists too.  It probably took about thirty or forty seconds.<p>Frankly, I couldn't care less about the design.  I guess it looks nice, but, I mean, it stays in your pocket anyway.  But for people who weigh the importance of these things, I suppose it's pretty.  What matters is the engineering of it, which is superb.  It has that solid, well built feel about it - if you're the kind of person who attaches importance to how solid a car door feels when you close it, you'll appreciate the Ipod as well.  The controls are easy to navigate, and extremely touch sensitive.  You'll find yourself using the lock button a lot if the Ipod goes in a pocket.<p>As I said, I'm a Mac user, so ease of use isn't really an issue, but I feel compelled to add a little something about the USB/firewire issue PC users have talked about.  It does in fact appear that Apple is not playing fair with the lack of a firewire/USB adaptor.   When you look at the box, if you read it very carefully - and we're talking about footnoted text, so it's even smaller than the already very small text outlining system requirements - it says that a USB 2.0 cable is not included.  OK, fair enough.  What it does not say is that even if you have that cable, you need the firewire/USB adapter.  What that means is that ven if you read all the fine print, you will not have what you need to connect to a USB system. <p> While I find it amusing that anyone with a $400 computer would expect a $400 state of the art accessory to be backwards compatible, this issue seems somewhat deceptive on Apple's part.  They should include the adapter in the box, or they should clearly say on the box that not only is a USB 2.0 cable required, but an adapter as well.<p>Bottom line: if you're a Mac user, you'll love this machine right out of the box.  If you're a PC user, you'll need to take that extra step (but hey, don't you always have to take that extra step with a PC?  Just kidding) and you'll enjoy this machine.

<Title>The Best Personal Digital Music Player Available!
<Date>Fri Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>From opening the iPod to setting it up to listening to music, it all was one smooth experience. I was a bit worried about windows compatibility because other reviewers mentioned something about that, but as soon as I plugged it in to my Dell laptop it was instantly recognized and synchronized with iTunes. It took only about 1 or 2 minutes to transfer over 1 GB worth of music, downloading at about 2 songs per second. The touch wheel/button interface is the best and easiest of all mp3 players. The amazing thing is how it can store 10 GB in such a small size. Most other players that hold that much are big and clunky. You could easily find an mp3 player much smaller and lighter than this, but they lack many features and can only store 128-256 MB worth of music. That's like 4 or 5 CD's as opposed to 40 or 50 CD's that a 10 GB iPod can hold. It also looks much nicer than any other mp3 player I've seen. The only small inconvenience with this iPod is the back which scratches easily and gets dirty with fingerprints. Other than that it's just about perfect.

<Title>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
<Date>Sat Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>First let me say the sound quality is very good, but it can't handle the low frequencies of hip hop and rap,  but rock is fine, even impressive at the same volume (about 2/3 up).  Ease of use is good.  Too bad it does not come with a belt clip and the nylon/steel clip is $39.00 on Apples accessories page.  My complaint stems from the fact that you cannot erase the songs from your compuetrs hardrive.  In other words you cant use your computer as a platform to build a music collection on your iPod, because iPod will erase the songs on iPod that you have erased on your computer.  So you really don't get 10GB more, what you purchase is a $300 mirror, unless you set up to manually load your iPod which they explain how to do in the manual.  The factory preset is to mirror your computers hardrive which will cause you to lose your songs if you have the least bit of wanton excitement in loading songs to your new toy like I did, and like most people do. <br>     The battery lasts 18 months and then you have to buy a new iPod, but iPod does not export back to your computer so when you get your new iPod you have to start from scratch, and build your music collection again.  If you only had CD's burned onto your iPod, your fine.  You'll only spend a month of free time loading your iPod, but if you had purchased music from iTunes, you are up a creek, because they won't give them back to you, even though they know exactly what you purchased before and won't even respond to your e-mails or feedback links from their web page.   There are cheaper alternatives that last longer and probably come with a belt clip.

<Title>don't waste your $ or time!!
<Date>Sat Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>It is now January 3 and I have devoted days of my christmas vacation attempting to get my son's christmas gift to work- if it was not the poor kid's &quot;big gift&quot;, I would have given up days ago. I have never been as frustrated, I have never written a review. My guess is, you need an apple- I have two brand new dells and the IPOD really didn't work on either. The software that PC users use (jukebox) is also not great- I have now paid for an update of that and I won't use it- I am down at least $375 and countless hours!!

<Title>Help for those Looking at an Ipod
<Date>Sun Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I recently purchased an 10 gig ipod, the first thing i noticed was the unusual package it came with very different from the other typical bubble wraped items. The unit is very small and fits easyily in your hand.<p>One problem lots of windows users seem to be having is that no USB adapter is included. Well to lots this means you would need a new usb 2.0 card and the usb adapter. I recommend just purchasing a firewire card which are around 19.99. Or you can purchase a usb 2.0 and firewire card (mine cost 39.99). Your probably wondering why i would want a firewire over usb 2.0. Since the usb is 80mbs faster. Well the ipod will only upload songs about 15 mbps so the usb is pointless. The firewire also charges your unit and you already have the needed cords. Just a quick reference for those windows users looking into buying the ipod. Also musicmatch i have found is MUCH better then itunes, it allows you to fix all your song tags automatically by looking them up, which is a big help if your like me and have a ton of mp3 that are all with messed up song titles and such.

<Title>Love It!!  Love itunes!!
<Date>Sun Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I can't say enough about my love affair with my ipod.  I can store all my cds and organize by playlist.  Plus I can download on itunes $1/song site.  I am the type of person who would reluctantly shell out $15+ for cds when I only wanted one song so this is a perfect system for me.  Love itunes for all the reasons I love Amazon.  You can see what others are buying and they have these cool celebrity playlists so you can check out what Sting listens too.  <p>Lastly, ever since my toddler put coins in my car's cd player, we haven't been able to use it.  Several accessories allow us to play our ipod over our car's stereo system (for under $25) and this has allowed us to forgoe the $300 repair.  <p>I don't use the calendar function as of yet but I plan to give it a try.  <p>P.S.  I prefer the Sony cassete players vs am transmitters.  We tried both.

<Title>Love my iPod
<Date>Wed Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Have never owned an apple product as I am a PC user, but I'm very familar w/ both platforms.  It took me 3 days to get my iPod finally working for windows due to the iPod not liking the firewire card I had bought.  I had a Belkin FireWire card w/ 3 USB 2.0/2 FireWire ports and it just would not work at all.  It was really frustrating.  I did some research and found that the iPod works just fine w/ the Adaptec FireConnect 4300. Bought that and it has worked perfectly ever since. I don't use MusicMatch w/ it, I use a program called ephPod (which i dled from www.ephpod.com) but iTunes just came out for Windows so you can use that too. Earbuds aren't extremely comfortable after a long time of listening, but it could be worse. If you want an mp3 player w/ durability this is probably not the best choice, but overall I would totally recommend this product! The transfer rate is awesome.

<Title>iPod Review After 1 Month
<Date>Thu Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Overall I love my iPod, I'm no longer stuck listening to the same songs on the radio over and over.<br>Pros:<br>1. It's small...it always looked bigger in pictures and it was a surprise when I took it out of the box.<br>2. It's simple...very easy to control and navigate through the menus.<br>3. Easy, fast music transfer...I sync it with my Powerbook since I bought it before iTunes was released for my XP desktop. If iTunes for Windows works as well with the iPod as it does on a Mac I might start using it instead.<br>Cons:<br>1. The surface scratches if you even look at it funny. Seriously, buy some kind of protector if you don't want your iPod scratched up real quick.  Make sure to get one made for the 3rd generation iPod.<br>2. For me 10 GB is not really big enough.  I really had no idea how many music files a actually had until I organized them to put on the iPod.  If your iPod is bigger than your iTunes music collection you can automatically sync all your playlists between them making everything that much more simple.<br>3. The headphones sound great but they aren't very comfortable or practical.<br>So, overall I love my iPod and the scratching and headphones are my only real complaints.  I would definitely recommend it over any other large capacity player out right now.

<Title>all good except for the headphones
<Date>Fri Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I grew up using Apple computers, so was not surprised to see the elegance and simple utility of this device firsthand when I received it in the mail.  The interface is clean and quick and it does not freeze up.  The integration with Windows is impressive, and either the musicmatch software it comes with, or Apple's own iTunes software are impressive digital jukeboxes from which to manage your collection.<p>Synchronizing via the fire wire port is impressive.<p>There are two negative comments I have: (1) the headphones it comes with are uncomfortable in the ear, and the black fabric that goes over the speak must be put on by you, which is awkward (since it is so delicate).  (2) The fire wire connector is of the 6 pin variety, which requires that you have an adapter for the typical Windows four pin fire wire connection.  This seems odd to me, given that Windows computers are more abundant than Apple computers, and Apple can expect the greater number of these devices to be sold to people with Windows PCs.  Better to let Apple users use an adapter.  But I suppose this second point is a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things, especially considering how brilliant the little device is.  I only wish I sprang for the 40gb model.

<Title>Awesome- breath taking
<Date>Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received my iPod yesterday and i love it. When i received it and opened the packaging you can tell how much Apple pays attention to detail. The box it comes in is odd at first because i never seen anything like it. When i saw it i was amazed how small it was, i had been told it was small but WOW. It fooled my hand for a second with its weight. Everything went smoothly with installation with a minor glitch, which was my fault. It loaded my 2gb playlist in about a minute. Im using 4pin firewire because i have a Win. laptop, i charge with the adapter and contrary to what i've heard it doesnt fry the battery. The bad thing about 4pin is that when you download it takes a lot of battery and it could go dead.<p>Pros:<br>-Easy to use and setup (menu is pure genius)<br>-Battery life<br>-SYLE<p>Cons:<br>-scratches easily (i taped some of the plastic to it until i    get a case.)<br>-pricey, but you get what you pay for

<Title>Awesome hardware, but software is annoying
<Date>Fri Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had several MP3 players and decided to take the plunge and get the iPod.  From a hardware standpoint, the iPod itself is fantastic.  It is very small, very well built and ergonomically designed, far better than any other player I've owned.  One &quot;gotcha&quot; is the fact that the 10GB unit says that it can run on Firewire or USB.  This is true but, you will need another adapter from Apple to convert Firewire to USB if you intend to use the USB port for transfers.  Fortunately, I found a firewire port on my computer.  By the way, firewire is VERY fast for uploads and downloads.  It only took about 15 minutes to upload 4GB of music.  My complaint is the software.  For such a streamlined MP3 player, the software is really &quot;bloatware&quot;  The installation CD installs, Musicmatch, Audible Manager, and an iPod Manager.  All three of these programs want to put icons in your system tray as well as put icons on your desktop.  If you let them, they'll even start up when you boot the system.  Almost as bad as Norton Systemworks (which tightly intertwines itself in the registry too) I had software windows and icons everywhere.  I will have to figure out which programs I can strip out and still have a functional iPod loader.  So, I love the iPod, but dislike the software.

<Title>Pretty, but horribly designed
<Date>Sun Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The Ipod is sleek and modern looking.  Appears to be excellently designed.  But, it's not.  The controls are pressure designed and they are awful.  The return-to-the-beginning button is placed too closely to the other buttons, so it is too easy to accidentally press the button and return to the beginning (for example, the beginning of a book if you listen to recorded books).  All buttons are pressure-sensitive, but the pressure does not always work.  For example, you can try to turn the machine off, but pressing on the button sometimes functions normally and at other times you can press the button for minutes, with no response.<p>Do I have a lemon?  No.  I know others who have the identical machine and experience identical problems.<p>This machine is a dud.  It needs major changes in functional design.<p>I recommend against buying the machine.

<Title>Installed without a hitch on Windows XP
<Date>Mon Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Being a Windows user, it was with some trepidation that I asked for the iPod for Xmas.  I read a number of rather negative comments regarding the iPod and Windows (strange bed partners, eh?)  But, I really liked the size of the unit and its capacity, so I went ahead and requested it from Santa (a pretty sure thing, &quot;Santa&quot; being my wife and all.)<p>Maybe I was born under a lucky star or something, but I had my 7.6 gigs of music loaded from my Windows XP laptop to my iPod in less than 2 hours.  About the only real issue I had was getting MusicMatch to &quot;see&quot; the iPod.  Although I like MusicMatch, I'm not married to it so I decided to try iTunes for Windows before attempting to figure out why MusicMatch wasn't working.  The product installed quickly, automatically found my music, and hooked up with the iPod with no problems.  I did have to recreate my Playlists so I suppose someone with a lot of them might try harder to stick with MusicMatch.<p>My laptop does have a firewire port so I did not have to buy any extra cables.  iPod came with a firewire cable (6 pin) and a converter plug for 4 pin firewire (which is what I have).  Perhaps that's why MusicMatch couldn't see the iPod...it was hanging off the firewire port.<p>Other reviews mentioned the iPod battery power draining quickly when downloading music from the PC.  Ditto for me.  You'll want a fully charged iPod before starting your download.<p>I don't care much for the headphones provided with the iPod.  The music comes through clear enough but I find them to be physically awkward to use.  The headhphone jack is standard, so I've continued to use my &quot;old&quot; headphones.<p>All in all I'd have to give the iPod the full 5 stars.  It was easy to install, easy to load up with music, and I find the quality of the sound to be first rate.  The controls, although rather touchy, are intuitive and easily mastered.  They say the best things come in small packages; in this case I couldn't agree more!

<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>WARNING! If you have ANY problem with your iPod after initially installing on a Windows XP box you will be in very deep trouble.  Customer support is comfortable with telling you that details explicitly stated as supported in the user manual (access through a proxy, for example) are simply not supported.  User support was overtly nasty to me, literally laughing over the phone at me, when the iPod would not connect to a second user (my own actual account as opposed to the administrator account I'd used to set up the iPod/iTunes connection in the first place).  They refused to address the problem altogether stating that their support was strictly limited to getting it to work at all, and that it did work as far as they were concerned.<br>   I have had several other smaller issues (application not openning up and not closing properly) and there is no support whatsoever and, worse, a snide, condescending attitude from customer support.

<Content>I'll try to make this quick.  I am 15 years old and I know a lot about these things.  I asked for one for xmas, but my mom bought me a different one.  I returned it and decided to try out the iPod.  I opened the box..only to find out that in order to run it on USB, I needed a connector.  No problem I thought, I would order one online...but many companies were sold out.  I finally found it and ordered over night delivery.  I have Windows XP, and was worried it wasn't going to work.  I installed iTunes and found that it was the easiest software to use.  I was so amazed.  Within a half and hour I had 1,000 songs up and running.  The design is incredible and so easy to use.  I love the &quot;touch&quot; buttons.  Another feature is the calender and games.  You can also read Microsoft Word documents right off of it.  For the money...you get a great deal.  I HIGHLY recommend this MP3 player over anyone, and I have had 7 MP3 players in my life.  This one is truly amazing.  If you have any questions about it please ask me at nickmuk@excite.com or over AOL Instant Messenger Nick Mukhtar.  I truly want to help you guys out in deciding what to get!!!

<Title>Apple's iPod: Continuing Apple's Legacy
<Date>Wed Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Apple certainly makes attractive products. With ease of use and stunning design, the iPod is no exception. After comparing many possible candidates (iRiver iHP-120, Dell DJ 15, Rio Karma), the size, design, and ease of use leaned me towards the iPod. Great! I purchase it at the Apple Store (sorry, Amazon, but I got it for $269 with an edu. discount). What do I think of it?<p>The ease of use is remarkable. It's so damn simple, you could use it blindfolded! It's easily the most intuitive and exiting consumer electronic I have ever used. No question, if you don't need the trouble, the iPod is the player (the other players I previously mentioned are not nearly as easy to use as this iPod).<p>The design is, as anyone will tell you, stunning. You cannot deny it -- the iPod has become a fashion accessory. I can control it with a single hand, and it feels so good. Unlike the iRiver, Dell, and Rio, the iPod is super-slim, making it very pocket-friendly (Try putting a Creative Nomad Zen in your pocket).<p>The sound quality is quite impressive. I turned of the EQ, however, as I found it pretty useless. Using the stock headphones, the sound I got was pretty clear and resembled the original CDs (I use legally ripped songs from CDs as 128 Kbps AAC files). I plan to nbuy new headphones, but this is a good temporary.<p>Using iTunes, like using the iPod, is the simplest of things. Just hook up the iPod and iTunes syncs with it. It is truly amazing. No problem at all. Auto-Sync took a genius. And speed was great. I used USB 2.0 (My computer lacks FireWire) and achieved 10-12 MBps speeds when transferring. That is about a song a second. <p>The one pitfall I have seen is battery life, which I have seen range. I have yet to completely discharge the battery, but it looks like it lasts about 7 and a half hours, which isn't too bad at all, and is much more than I need (usually).<p>Final verdict: Many digital audio players may boast about having this, and having that, but for a completely painless and downright fun experience, buy the Apple iPod.

<Content>I am an iPod fan, and I would caution the potential buyer of a 10GB unit to carefully consider the value when you realize that this one ships without a docking cradle, remote control and case. You'd spend very nearly the full amount of the difference between this iPod and the 20GB unit just getting those things separately (you do not want to do without the cradle or the case; the wired remote is a toss-up). At that point, you'd have spent the same amount of money for an iPod with only half the capacity you deserve.

<Content>Just to let you know if you are a PC user make sure you by the dock for the ipod. When I did the research for this product I never found anything that said I had to buy additional hardware in order for the Ipod to work with my computer. I didn't find this out until I recieved the ipod in the mail and found out that it wasn't worth the effort to buy the extra equipment. So if you really want this product just make sure that you buy the dock and the usb cable if you have a pc. It costs an extra 50 bucks so if you think that it is worth it go ahead.

<Title>Awesome product!
<Date>Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I just got my I pod last week this thing is amazing(up to 10,000 songs) I use every part of it the audio books the songs calender games note pad and external hard drive. I use the hard drive alot because I dont live with my dad and he always wants me to take files home withe me but I dont have my laptop yet so I take a any file I lie of of his computer and then take them home and put them on my mac.i love it the backligth is really cool and usefull in the dark has a great interface my 3 year old brother can use it. I love using it on road trips because you can play a game while listnening to you fav song. Another thing is that I use it for school yes, I said school, what I do is take notes and then put rewrite them on to my mac, then I put them on my ipod in the notes so I can study for a test any where while listening to my fav song. You can also ( if your an actor) write your script or scan it then put it on your ipod and memorize them. I highly recomend u getting the ipod you wont regret it I promise. Ohh I also hightly recomend getting a mac because the just work with ease, if your reading this and your a mac. user thats awsome and if your a pc user its pretty sad that some 13 computer wiz is saying this to you.

<Content>I received my 10 GB iPod in May of this year, and I love the little thing.  I have over 1100 songs on my iPod, but there is still plenty of room for growth. <p>What I love about the iPod is the ease of use.  I can easily find a song in a matter of seconds.<p>The iPod has set the standard for all MP3 players, and in my opinion is probably the easiest to use, and best looking.

<Title>PC users Beware
<Date>Thu Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am sure this is a great product for Apple users.  However, as a PC user with Windows XP, I cannot recommend this product.  I followed the instructions in a detailed manner.  My computer failed to recognize the iPod.  After several hours of frustration, my computer finally recognized the device.  Windows XP &quot;my music&quot; defaults to a WMA format.  IPod does not support WMA.  I attempted to transfer one (1) song on MP3 format and iPod still failed to accept the song.  After several hours of frustration and consultation with a computer guru, I returned the iPod and fortunately I received a full refund.  PC users: avoid frustration and anger.  Do not waste valuable time on this product.

<Title>helpful hints
<Date>Sat Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The Ipod is great it holds alot of songs. If you like to run outside ever or be in the cold in Minnesota the Ipod gets too cold and it will turn off and becomes completely useless. You need to make sure your computer has the the proper version of windows operating system inorder to set up this fire wire card which costs about $50 dollars extra. It crashed my computer and took me a week to get it all back together. If you like to listen to music inside and not in the cold and you have a computer with some newer operating system you shouldn't have a problem and you can listen to really good sound quality. The other problems suck though.

<Content>I just got my new iPod last week.  I am a PC user and have yet to encounter the problems from the previous reviews.  I would highly recommend that you have iTunes installed on your computer before you  start working with your iPod. iTunes is available at Apple.com, free of charge.  This will resolve many of the issues associated with windows media player.  This has been one of the easiest additions I have made to my computer.

<Title>Exellent even for Windows
<Date>Mon Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I received mine a while back and have used all of its features. I can say it's a very good player even when used with Windows computer. The software is plug_and_play and it's easy to understand. However, the software used to make the MP3's on a Window computer is not as easy to use as the new Windows compatible (iTunes) is. Apples new software iTunes has an easy drop and drag format, which is really a no brainier to use. I also got a car charger and an itrip so I can use it in the car or any place with a FM receiver. I recently took a four hour trip and the ipod went through my play list and never failed.

<Title>The best mp3 player out there!
<Date>Sun Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought the new 10Gb iPod this summer. It has worked great in all situations (running, skiing, long car trips, parties, etc.) with great battery life and non of the skipping/stuttering of music found in other high capacity players. <p>My experience with the iPod was greatly enhanced this fall with the addition of iTunes for Windows, which is the best music player/organizer out there today. That's right, it's better than Windows Media, Winamp, Real Player, and much better than the Music Match software that come with the Win iPod. It gives a myriad of options for organizing, sorting, groups, ripping, burning and generally handling all of your digital music. It also has several syncing options to use when putting music on your iPod, and basically completes what is the best digital music experience currently available. ONE NOTE OF CAUTION, the emergence of iTunes with its fexible syncing options have made the 20, 30, and 40Gb version of the iPod are completely unnecessary unless you are about to be away from you computer for several months without anything to do but listen to music.<p>Make sure that you upgrade your machine to handle firewire, as all computer media will soon migrate to this transfer protocol. <br>Personally, if you want a great digital music experience and are willing to part with the cash, there is no better product.

<Title>iPod cannot organize songs to nested/tree structure!
<Date>Sun Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've been using the iPod for a few months, and when I upgraded my system recently, it automatically wiped everything out from my firewire iPod HD when I first connected!  I have other firewire HDs (Maxtor 60GB, Buslink 40GB), and I've never seen anything like this!  I don't know if iPod was trying to SYNCHRONIZE to my NEW SYSTEM!?  I suspect the synchro feature of MusicMatch Jukebox (came with my iPod) is at fault.  This has happened TWICE (each time I had a major upgrade or resintall of WinXP) with no warning, and now I'm very hesitant about using the iPod to backup any important files.  <p>Another annoying thing about this iPod is that it basically dumps all songs in to ONE FOLDER (if u can look at the internal structure, it is actually divided in to several directories, but there is no structure or organization to this; virtually, it is a SINGLE directory to the end-user).  The iPod "play-list" is not a folder and it does not physically seperate the "play-listed" songs from thousands of other songs you have.  <p>This means you have to have very descriptive tags and good song descriptions on all your MP3 files.  Otherwise, you will have ONE GIANT CHAOS.  For example, try removing a group of songs you've just uploaded to the iPod from your PC folder.  These songs are no longer grouped in a folder; it is now part of the huge flat directory structure where all your other songs are!  You will have to scroll through hundreds or thousands of songs to locate and remove them individually.  <p>If you're a Mac user and have not used Winamp (my songs are organized in nested/tree directory structure), you have no idea what I'm talking about or what the big deal is.  Anyway, something so SIMPLE to do in Winamp, is a NIGHTMARISH TASK ON THE iPOD (I've used MusicMatch which came with iPod, and also recently, iTunes for Windows XP).  <p>Why couldn't Apple JUST *KISS* the iPod???

It's able to hold more than enough music, is easy to use, and even has a calendar, games and a contacts that you can load from your computer onto the iPod.  I believe it to be revolutionary in its every aspect, and would recommend it to any who enjoys having music at the touch of a button. Its small enough to fit in your pocket, and the sound quality is incredible.  I would recommend this product to any one! It's too good for you not to buy one, so dont hesitate.

<Title>..
<Date>Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I realize there are many other mp3 players out there that are considerably cheaper.  But still most of them are over $100, and if you're going to spend that much money on an mp3 player, you don't want it breaking on you.  I haven't had my iPod very long, but I haven't had any troubles with it (except the fact that my computer didn't have a firewire port).  I have a Windows, not Mac, and it's worked FINE with it, for any Windows users worrying about that.  iTunes is very easy to use.  The obvious downside to the iPod is: the price, and then the fact it scratches very easily.  Get a case, first thing, and make sure it isn't a case that will scratch the screen (the jam jacket isn't really a case, but it prevents it from being scratched).<br>Unless you have 1,500 CDs at home, there's really no need to get an iPod with more space (and the dock that comes with those isn't needed).  I only have about 300 songs on mine.  And that's my whole collection of CDs (CD deprived...).  If you really love music, and you have the money to spare, why not buy it?  It is very expensive, but I personally never buy anything expensive, and everyone else already spent their Bar/Bat Mitzvah money buying gamecubes and x-boxes (I let my brother buy it, and force him to share it ^_^) so I went ahead and bought it.<br>Pros: It is really small and light.  I was surprised when I got mine at how small it was.  The backlight is awesome.  It organizes really nicely, the sound quality is great, etc., etc.<br>One other thing, unless you are used to little pod type head phones, the head phones are very uncomfortable, even with the cushions.  I'm just using a pair of regular headphones.

<Title>4 pin firewire vs 6 pin firewire
<Date>Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The iPod comes with a 6pin firewire connector wire and a 4 pin firewire adapter. Apple computers have a 6 pin firewire port that will both download and charge the iPod. <br>Many windows laptops come with a 4 pin firewire (i394 port). Using the enclosed 4pin adapter you can download but not charge the iPod on windows machines and you can only charge the battery thru the A/C adapter. Before downloading music to the iPod via 4pin firewire you must have a fully charged iPod battery to last thru the function.<br>  If your windows laptop doesn't have firewire you must purchase at xtra cost either a firewire card for your laptop's PMCIA slot or the iPod specific USB adapter wire. You can't use a generic USB wire.<br>  Also BE AWARE that the 3rd generation iPod is NOT compatable with Windows ME as earlier generations were, you must upgrade to XP.

It is so easy to find your music once it's on the iPod. I love the shuffle mode and the backlight is a great touch. I am looking forward to getting years of use out of this nifty device!

<Title>iPod Works Flawlessly
<Date>Sun Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I purchased the 10 GB iPod and from the moment I plugged it into the computer, it has worked flawlessly.  I have about 1,000 songs on my computer.  It took only a few minutes (less than five) to upload all of my songs to my iPod.  The product works perfectly with iTunes.  Many of the complaints about iPod, such as &quot;it does not come with a USB cable&quot; should not be taken to heart.  The reason iPod only comes with a Firewire cable is because it is a high-performance digital music player and functions best when used with Firewire.  The iPod caters primarily to higher-end computer users.  Most high-end computers have a Firewire connection.  Anyone who complains about the iPod not including a USB cable should really be complaining about his own computer.  If you have a low-end PC without a firewire port, maybe you are better off buying something of lesser quality like a RIO.  Nothing against those who own $500 Dells or eMachines on special, but having to buy a $20 cable to convert Firewire to USB should not be such a big deal.  All major video game consoles come with only AV output.  Is it the fault of Sony or Nintendo if the consumer who purchases their product has an older TV without AV inputs?  Those of you who will &quot;never buy an Apple product again&quot; because it doesn't include a firewire cable: would you also never again buy a Sony product simply because your TV is too old?  The fact of the matter is Apple's iPod blows all other digital music players out of the water.  It works great in the car with either the tape or FM transmitter adaptor.  The sound quality is superb, and simply cannot be beaten.  If you are a high-end computer user and are looking for the finest in digital music players, iPod is for you.

<Title>Pretty, but only a ten day return policy.  BEWARE!
<Date>Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Okay. Here is a write up, that I did, on the comparisons/contrasts on MP3 players. Mainly, the Harddrive versions (I.E. Rio Riot/Apple IPOD -both of which I own) and the flash memory type... (I.E. Memorex 3642 Mp3 Player, of which I own as well). <br>What prompted this little jaunt (of which you may send to as many people as you like) My (expensive) Apple IPOD died during a sync last month. Just me copying files over to it, and the battery ran out of juice. I would have not attempted to copy music had I known the battery was low, but the battery read FULL STRENGTH. Anyhoo, I called Apple, they said return it for maintenance.<br>I did. Sent it back.<p>They returned it, still broke.<p>To my suprise, there is only a TEN DAY return policy.<p>TEN DAYS.<p>I did not realize this at all... and will not ever buy another apple product.<p>So, after a month or so of messing around trying to find another MP3 player... I decided to go with a flash memory MP3 player, the ones that use memory sticks.<p>SO, here are the pro and cons of these devices.<p>Pro's for the Memory Stick Mp3 players<p>-Cheaper. WAY CHEAPER than Hard drive types.<p>-If you go into music match and file convert to MP3 Pro and shrink the size of your MP3 to like, say 3o percent... you can really make a good Kompression. Example. My Memorex MP3 player has 32mbs of memory on board. It is expandable to 256mb. 32 mb will basically let you put one cd's worth of music. It is easy to put music on and off of them, due to your computer reading the USB as just another hard drive, so you drag and drop to put on, delete them to take them off. But, after you shrink your files to MP3 Pro 30 percent, you can put twice as many. So, basically a 256mb chip will allow me to put 208 songs on my little less than palm size MP3 player. And it wieghs like 3 ounces. <p>- More on memory. These little chips are the size of the upper part of your thumb, at least my thumb anyway. They come in 128mb, 256mb, 512mb and even though there aren't any MP3 machines out there to handle them YET, you can even buy a 1.5gig thumb size chip thingy. Considering the size of the chips and the shrinking kompression I told you about earlier, I could shrink my whole KOLLEKTION down to 10 of those 1.5gig chips. At the current shrink rate I am at 5 DVD's, which are way bigger and more fragile than these little chips.<p>- Not as fragile as hard drive type. You can drop one of these chips and not scratch it. I wouldn't stomp on one with my foot, nor get one in water, but they are encased in plastic. Ruggedish.<p>- Batteries last for like two days. There isn't much going on here, no moving parts, no laser or hard drive to put power to. Most of these flash Memory types have a single AA battery. I use a rechargeable type, so we are talking very low cost here.<br>In comparison to the hard drive types, where you will get a solid 8 hours of playing, this really whupps up.<p>- Size. Small. Very small. Mine is three inches by three inches. A square. But, you can get smaller ones. And the memory chips that go in them are the same ones you use for your camera. And you can put files on them. If you want to put a word doc on your memory chip, you can. Your Mp3 won't recognize it, but it is nifty storage.<p>COMPARISON/CONTRAST<p>- Size does matter. In the case of hard drive Mp3 players... lets face it, you can, if you so chose to, put a library of congress on these monsters. They are the caddilacs of the hand held devices, and guzzle batteries like gasoline. But when it comes down to it, size is the only thing they have going for them. I don't mean to downplay the hard drive types, but don't drop them, don't shake them, and after shelling out $499 to Apple you might consider insurance. Apple doesn't care about you or your apple after 10 days of ownership. <p>- Price/Komparison. IPOD ran me $499 bucks. My memorex MP3 player ran me 45 dollars. The 128 memory chip runs you 50 bucks. Owch. There really isn't a comparison to the two. The memory stick Mp3 players just kick butt on this issue. And, you get MORE than a ten day return policy, since you buy these things at Target/Wal Mart etc... <p>So, that is my review in a nutshell

<Content>Yes, it looks cool and has a simple interface.<br>However, try to use it as an alarm clock and the<br>alarm beep for about 3 seconds! Useless.<p>Before I go there, let me say that the 10 GB iPod I<br>have comes with a Firewire cable. Most computers don't<br>have the Firewire port anymore, they have USB ports. It is<br>frustrating to see Apple use such cheap tricks, had to go<br>to the store to get a $20 Firewire-USB cable.<p>I finally have the thing hooked up to my computer, but<br>the MusicMatch software is non-intuitive. 2 h and I still<br>haven't been able to download a song to the thing, let alone<br>organize any music. (and yes, I AM computer savvy).<p>The main reason I got this, alongwith the iTrip (from<br>Griffin tech), is to use it in my car. I want to tune<br>the iTrip to my car FM so that I don't have to fiddle<br>with my CDs in my car. I haven't received the iTrip yet,<br>so lets see how that (mis)adventure goes.

<Title>10GB iPod
<Date>Mon Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is pretty expensive for an MP3 player, but its worth it!  It is small and attractive in design.  It's also pretty easy to use - I've had little trouble with mine.  I have a PC with Windows XP, so far, so good!  The one issue is that it comes with a firewire port, while most PCs these days use USB ports.  You can get a converter for like $20, but that part is kind of annoying.<p>It holds a decent amount of songs, 10 GB is quite a lot!  I don't even have mine close to 1/4 full!  It works well, though I invested in a better pair of headphones because the ones it comes with are kinda crappy!  Overall - I think it is overpriced, but it is attractively built, holds lots of songs, is easy to use and works well!

<Title>What's with the sound quality on the IPOD
<Date>Mon Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>For such a cool new gadget I must say that the sound quality sure is not really that impressive. When transfering CD from the PC to the IPOD it seems like quality is lost, as well as the music playing slower in the Ipod. With the Monster cables that hooks the Ipod up to a stereo, even more sound quality is lost, so I regret even buying those. This is still a great little gadget, but more a toy than a serious quality music machine, so if you are looking for sound to equal youd CD player at home you may be disappointed.

<Title>10GB or 20GB? They're both good.
<Date>Mon Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>For my daughter's 16th birthday, my wife and I bought her the 20GB iPod. She's been using it with an iMac. The setup was very easy and she's happy not to be carrying around a CD player anymore. (Let alone, burning CDs to take with her.) The one thing that I noticed was that the case that comes with this unit is useless, since you can't access the controls while your iPod is in it. She ended up using the case sparingly, and as a result, her iPod is really scratched up. She doesn't use the remote control either. Well, at least the $40 dock is worth the added cost.<p>So when I was looking at buying an iPod for myself, I decided to go with the 10GB model, so I could spend the difference on a better case ($40 by MARWARE) and other accessories. My PC laptop has a firewire port, and I moved over my large iTunes music collection (200 songs) in about 2 minutes. Oh yeah, my setup was just as easy for Windows XP as the Mac. Sorry, but no crashes or anything crazy to report.<p>By the way, I already went the $79 128MB MP3 player route. It was full with only 29 songs. After looking at paying another $110 to increase the player to 640MB, I decided to return it, and get an iPod. I liked Rio's Music Manager software, but iTunes is infinitely better than Rio's software and (the dreaded) MusicMatch.<p>And finally, I don't think any of the other players can match the iPod in accessories. Attachments, like the one to store digital images, aren't found for the other MP3 players. If you want a device that your relatives can buy you accessories for (e.g., a birthday or Christmas present), the Ipod is it.<p>Good Luck!

<Title>Simply Fantastic
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had to post a review of the iPod not because this piece of electronics needs my endorsement (it doesn't, obviously), but, rather, because of the inane and flat out wrong statements being made about the unit.<p>Firstly, one reviewer made the comment that PC companies no longer incorporate Firewire in their units. Well, with the exception of a few companies (Sony) they never did! USB2 does boast excellent transfer times but to complain because a $399 Dell doesn't have Firewire is just ludicrous. PC companies do not include Firewire standard because it is too expensive. Apple does, which is one of the many reasons their machines cost an arm and a leg.<p>Secondly, another reviewer complained that they had quite a bit of difficulty getting their iPod to work with their Dell. Welcome to the world of Windows incompatability. Again, Macintosh computers cost more because, generally, you do not have the same level of frustration trying to get things "to work". Yes, the iPod works flawlessly with a Mac, but for a vast majority of Windows users it's worked flawlessly as well; it's important to have the correct version of the iPod's  OS and the most updated version of iTunes in order to have a quality Windows experience.<p>Lastly, sound quality is fairly subjective. I will say that every audiophile publication that I have read (both electronic and print) has extolled the sound quality of the iPod. Remember, sound quality is only as good as the source. If you expect the latest top 40 hit downloaded from Kazaa at 96kbps to sound good, you've got another thing coming. For a portable, the sound quality is exceptional.<p>If you enjoy music at all, if you like the fact that you can have every song in your collection at your fingertips, if size and ease of use are important to you, then you will become attached to your iPod like no other piece of electronics. I am a 35 year-old father of three and have rediscovered music because of the iPod. I listen in the car, during my prep periods (I'm an 8th grade teacher) and while I run. In short, it's with me all the time. Remember, you get what you pay for, and with an iPod that's a lot!

<Title>iPod on Windows - Read the fine print
<Date>Fri Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Well, this will be the last Apple product I buy.  Nothing is more frustrating than buying a Christmas present and having it not work. Sure, the box says that the requirements are a Windows PC with USB 2.04.  What they fail to tell you is that you have to buy another special cable - one that Amazon doesn't even list and is out-of-stock at other sites.  So be prepared to pay another 5 to 10 percent for the right cable (depending on with iPod and the shipping cost).  That is IF you can find it in stock.  I don't see it listed here on Amazon.

At last - an end to my dreary, music-less commute.  Goodbye, crazy subway patrons; Hello, the sweet sounds of digital music!<br>So you can imagine how incredibly shocked and angry I was when I learned that I can't actually hook this thing up to either of my less-than-one-year-old PCs until I purchase some $20 cable that - incredibly - is not included in Apple's slick, styled $300 package.  <br>Why in the world would they sell this device without the basic equipment required to hook it up to a computer??  <br>What a complete disappointment.

There's a lot of formatting and it tkaes a little while.  The ipod has a great backlight and mkes it assesible anywhere.  If you're a kid, the earphone buds don't really fit in your ears.  Also the ipod gets scratched up a lot.  When i first used it, it was breand new.  After a few days it got a little scrathced and it was kept in my pocket the whoel time.  It's not really badly scratched though.  Overall, i would definatly still reccomend the ipod over any other project.

<Content>Pros: it looks very sleek, sophisticated, and white, you can download your entire song collection in minutes, sound quality is just as good, maybe better, than CD player sound quality, 2500 songs can be stored!!<p>Cons: price($300!!), the features are nothing special, I'm not sure PC users can get the whole experience of using an iPod<p>I just got an iPod for Christmas. The package of the iPod itself is absolute art! You have to see it to believe it, there is nothing to describe.  The iPod is so incredibly white, and all you have to do is download all of your music and you're ready to go! The battery lasts about 4 hours with regular use, which is a perfectly fine amount-who listens to music for 4 hours anyways?? At least I don't-I get sick of listening to music for that long.<p>I am a Mac user (and I have nothing against PC users LOL) and I dont think that iPods are for PC users. PCs are complicated to begin with (I switched from PC to mac and even though you PC users might not realize it, Macs are SUPER easy to use-no viruses or anything to worry about!) so iPods just make it more complicated for a PC user.<p>iPods' features are nothing special, but its looks make up everything- i catch people staring at me when I use my iPod in public-thats a good feeling haha. <p>By the way, I am a teenager, just so you know who these thoughts are coming from!!!!

<Title>BEST MP3 PLAYER EVER
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I got this 10gb ipod for christmas and I am so amazed. This is the best mp3 availible on the market. I'm a PC owner and it works almost flawlessly. Some people have trouble with PC's, but just make sure you have a firewire port, if you don't then you might have to buy an adapter for a USB 2.0. I also recommend downloading iTunes, an excellent program that is much easier to use than musicmatch jukebox, the software that comes with the computer. You can download iTunes from www.apple.com. 10gb of music is more than enough. I really don't see how you would ever need 20gb or 40gb. Note that ipod doesnt support wma format, but who cares. WMA is lower quality anyway. I recommend buying a case for this because the back can get scratched easily. Another thing I like about the iPod is the headphones. They look like regular bud headphones but the bass is great. They are surprisingly loud.  <br>    It's very easy to be pleased with the iPod. Its so small and light, it makes all other mp3/cd players look bulky and weak. The iPod is good for people with large cd collections and fast computers, or people who download a lot. Otherwise other mp3 players or cd players are cheaper and better for you. But if you have lots of music and have a computer then the iPod is the best you can get.

Or you can pay $200 more for an iPod of the same size.<p>Second, sorry it may look nicer, but the nomad has a better sound. <p>Third, checkout www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. Apple wanted you to buy a new ipod every 18 months. Finally after tons of bad press they caved and now you can either pay $59 a year for a year warranty or $99 to get the battery replaced EVERY 18 months. It's so nice to see Apple take care of it's customers.<p>If you were smart and went with the nomad you can replace the battery yourself.

<Content>I never go anywhere -- whether on a transatlantic flight or the bus to the other side of town -- without my iPod. It's the thing that sets my life to music ... the music I choose for it.<p>I've used three iPod's in my life: my old original 5MB; the replacement, an old thick 10MB; and now a (sadly, borrowed) super slim 10MB, and each represented a huge leap forward from the previous one. Starting from a well-designed and easy-to-use baseline product, the good folks at Apple have honed and advanced the technology and design until ending up with something that is so intuitive, so sleek, and so addictive that it makes other MP3 players I've seen and used appear to have been designed by cave men. <p>I'm not the most qualified person to delve into all the technical specs of this delightful little machine, and, besides, that info is fully available elsewhere on this page. But I will write that the iPod is a joy to own and when you get yours you'll wonder how you ever survived without it.

<Title>I wanted to hate this so bad
<Date>Thu Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Just because I hate having money in my bank account, I decided to buy a hard drive player last month. I checked out the iRiver ihp-120, Rio Karma, iPod, Napster, and Zen. In the end I narrowed it down to the iRiver and the Rio and wound up going with iRiver. Although that I believe that it's still the best player, this little thing certainly gives it a run for its money. Of course, it's by far the best looking player. The scrollwheel is maybe the coolest feature I've seen on anything, ever. It takes me sometimes more than 30 seconds to navigate through the 350 or so folders on my IRiver. With Apple, it's instantanious. I also can't stress enough how good this thing feels in you're hand. If you don't believe me, go down to the apple store and see for yourself. (don't if you are not willing to part with three hundred dollars)<p>As cool as it might be though, it comes down to a question of what you're getting and for how much. All these players are only a hard drive and a sound card. Firstly, you're paying 20 gig prices for a 10 gig player that doesn't sound any better than anything else out there. Most other players will include a case, and in my case i even got a remote with LCD. Other players can also act as digital audio recorders. I also can't stand MusicMatch, I'm pretty much neutral about iTunes. <p>So I leave it up to you. There's a lot of convincing reasons to buy an iPod. If you want a great looking player that does nothing else besides play what you tell it to, this is for you. For features and better Window's compatability, I'd reccomend looking elsewhere.

<Content>I just got the iPod for Xmas, and although an MP3 player wasn't the highest priority for me, once I opened the package I was gone. It was so easy to create an iTunes playlist to sync with the iPod, and the wicked fast download time blew me away! Within an hour I was listening to music. From the design (about 1/3 the total size of its cheaper - in both senses of the word - competitors) to compatibility with the iTunes Music Store to the ability to use it as a hard drive to transfer files, after one day I'm already wondering what I did without it.<p>Next steps are to sync up with my iCal calendar and get an iTrip so I can use the iPod in my car. <p>On the downside, my GF told me of the trouble she had just getting an iPod - first everyone was sold out, and then she had to deal with the salesman's FUD-inducing attempt to sell an extended warranty (the ipodsdirtysecret site is an outright lie, and anyone who does their research knows that the battery is rated for 3 years of normal use, and that it IS replaceable). I told her next time, buy it from Amazon. ;-)
