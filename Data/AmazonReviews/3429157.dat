<Title>Good buy

<Content>Bought for my children at christmas. Both were able to work the player with no help from me on downloading or settings. (kids are 11 & 14) Sound was impressive with clear highs and good bass. I enjoy the rechargable battery so now my remotes for other devices dont get robbed for their batteries!!! Everything I wanted at an affordable price what more could you ask for?

<Title>PERFECT!

<Content>After listening to my sister-in-laws player, I had to have this!  I got it for Christmas a little over a year ago, and have used it a LOT.  I love the great sound, the tiny size, the radio, the CLIP and the rechargeable battery, easy of use, I could go on and on.  This little player is getting harder and harder to find, and I haven't found anything else that compares!  Why isn't Samsung (or any other manufacturer) making items like this anymore?  I absolutely LOVE this MP3 player, and I am considering a second one just as a backup for when I need another one someday!

<Title>Just Right....

<Content>I bought this Samsung MP3 player almost a year ago and have been nothing but pleased with this item.  I use it practically everyday, mainly when I'm at work or when I run.  I bought an adapter for my car and use it there as well.  This MP3 player is tough and does have a good battery.  I was a little disappointed at first with the battery life but the longer I've had it the better the battery has performed.    It's perfect when I go running, I just clip it on to my short pockets and forget that it's there while I run.  There is a downside with that, which I've found out twice the hard way, the metal clip is rough and will rub against your skin if you clip it to the top of your shorts.  I still have a bruise from this past weekend from it.  It's my own fault so I wouldn't hold that against this item.  If you're like me and don't need 10,000hrs of music, just a few of your favorties then I recommend buying this.  The screen is bright and also has a clock screensaver, which is good for runners that don't wear watches.  I also like that fact that I can charge this on any computer with a USB, plus I can play my music through any computer by using the USB and the MP3 player.  Great for public libraries or switching between computers.

<Content>Great item with great sound.  Very small and easily clips onto clothing while working out.  The headphones that came with it have very good sound, but were fragile (had to replace it after it fell apart).  Would definitely recommend this MP3!!!

<Title>Better than an ipod!

<Content>This is a fabulous little product.  I have an ipod which I use as my home stereo but, the Samsung is what I use for my portable music player as it is durable.  Whether I am jogging or in the car, I grab my Samsung.  Sleek, durable and &lt;$100, what more could you ask for!
