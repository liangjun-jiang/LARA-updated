Sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal languaje.

<Title>decent product
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is a 2 star product but the extra star is for value. It's cheap. It works. It sounds good, but all the features don't work like the description says. I would rather spend more money on something better, but f you don't want to spend too much, then I recomend this product.

<Title>very cool product
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using this device for about a month now and can't imagine my 2 hour daily commute without it. It is very easy to setup and use, takes minimal space, and is very durable (i have dropped it a few times by accident). The quality of the music is surprisingly clear. Since I have a few flash drives, I can carry several GB of music wherever I go for a fraction of the cost of a full fledged MP3 player. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and it is the best $25 I have spent in a while.

<Title>Extremely good product. I love it.
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player that i received first did not remember the last played track and did not play in alphabetical order, though it was playing well. I wrote a mail to the seller. He said "I dont like my customers to be unhappy" and offered to send a free replacement. He sent the replacement in 3 days time as promised. The replaced one plays extremely well in alphabetical order and remembers last track it played. Above all, the quality of the FM transmitter is excellent. It is very worth for the amount i paid.

<Title>Very promising
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This car mp3 transmitter is better than a lot of BRAND NAME product.   Pro: Sound quality is FM like. No interference. Easy to set up. Resumes after power off. Runs cool. No line hassle.  No additional batteries needed. Great and handy remote control (never see in other product).   Cons: 7 channels may not be enough for some people.(I am perfectly fine with it)   It is hard to see the channel setting in darkness. (Not a big problem to me since it remembers the channel setting.  I set up once and never touch it again)   It accepts MP3 only.  I never try WMA.  If it does, it should states in the manual.   It doesn't browse folders.  It only forwards/backwards song by song.   Vendor Service: Delivery time is reasonable. I live in CA and get mine in one week.   Confirmation email is sent within one day.  Tracking number is included. Bottom Line: If you want to try a better model, he is selling a upper model for $35 with LCD screen.  It has all features that this one doesn't have.  It also has good review.  But for $25 + $5 shipping, this product is solid and promising.

<Title>Awesome product, Quick responses.
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's a very cool MP3 player cum FM transmitter with handy remote. Initially I had some problems getting it to work, that's when i found the seller to be very proactive and quick in responding and helping with troubleshooting. When nothing worked the seller did offer for replacement or refund. The replacement MP3 player works absolutely fine.. The sound clarity is remarkable. Good product at a very reasonable price. I would not hesitate to buy anything from this seller.

<Title>caveat emptor! no wma funtion
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Simple and inexpensive it does do the job rather well. I set it at 87.9 and it worked well in SE Florida metro areas from Ft. Lauderdale to the Keys; no interference. Also, I use it in-house with a power to lighter adapter and play music thru my stereo. It took me a bit to figure out why it would skip over songs, though; the reason: it does not play WMA encoded music...and that's why the 4 stars. The remote is a must for all these gadgets; trying to perform any function by pressing the buttons on the device, moves it and static starts. Just insert it in the lighter socket and use the remote to do anything else.

<Title>Handy  MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Plays MP3's to your car FM Radio.   Sound is good quality,  this depends also on your car FM radio.   I listen to this every day on the way to work, and I have no trouble with the sound.  I keep all the MP3's stored on my flash drive, then just plug into the Modulator.   The handy thing is, that it remembers the last MP3 played, so it always restarts from the same track when the car starts.   That's important, I used to have another modulator with out this feature, and it drove me nuts.  I would recommend this, to anyone who wants to play MP3's in the car, but doesn't want the hassle of installing a fixed MP3 player.  Remote control  proved to be useful.  I can always keep my eyes on the road.  The only thing lacking, is an LCD display.  But modulators with LCD displays cost about twice as much.    Also, it doesn't overheat, and stays cool.

<Title>Better than Costco one
<Date>Tue Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used FM transmitter from Costco. It was good but it cannot remember the position once you turn off the car. You have to forward every time. That is very painful. I stopped using FM transmitter after a month.   I came to know about this product from my colleague purchased this product. I was skeptical so I borrowed for couple of days. It is very good product. Now I am planning to buy one.  I forgot to tell you...  Remote is very handy. I no longer need to locate the forward button on FM transmitter while driving.

<Title>Nifty radio tuner
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Have been looking for a multi-functional radio tuner for a while, to hook up an Mp3 player to. This serves the trick nicely, as well as giving me other options - I can hook a CD player into it, or just hook a memory stick full of MP3s into it and it will play any of them through my car's sound system.   The quality of sound produced by it is decent as well.

<Title>Best I've used in MP3/FM transmitter units
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the price you can not beat this unit! With several FM station TX selections, last song played memory, low power consumption, and a remote to boot for start/stop, volume up/down, and previous/next play! I've had others and they all lacked one or more of the features above. I can even use it in the home with a 110v to 12v cig lighter converter I purchased awhile back...talk about convenient! No streaming titles, but that's not a problem for me as I know most of the songs that are playing anyway. Honest, I don't see how you can go wrong with this setup in your car when you think how much an mp3 player add-on would cost.

<Title>really cool gadget
<Date>Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i have a FM transmitter which works on battery but this one works better since it has electrical contact with the car since it is connected to the car cigar lighter and hence has a better reception on the car radio.   It is very handy to have the cute remote to skip tracks or stop / play the song.  And it came with a 1 GB usb stick to kick start your mp3 experience really quickly.  It even has an aux audio input so you can connect your ipod or anyother audio device to this FM transmitter.

<Title>Decent product
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This little gadget is very cool and inexpensive. I can just plug in my USB drive into this and keep playing any number of songs. The quality of sound output is real good. I can now stop stacking CDs in my car. The remote alleviates the problem of changing or working with the player while driving. I can recommend this product to anyone. As opposed to the product details that it supports upto 2 GB flash drive, it works perfectly for my 4 GB flash drive. This product is worth the price.   Cons: As days pass by, the operations of this player are not working on one go. I need to press as many times as I need to start playing. My keys in the Player panel is no longer working. I am just using the remote. So, this needs to be handled delicately.

<Title>Worth buying
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For what it does, this is a great product.  If you have open frequencies at the low end of the FM band, this will work fine.  The sound quality is remarkable for such an inexpensive item (and they just lowered the price!).  The remote makes using this device much safer when driving.  I rated it 4 instead of 5 because of the limited FM frequency selections and because it doesn't have a shuffle option.    I looked around the internet and there isn't a better deal anywhere at twice this price.  Also, Goliath shipped this to me in record time.

<Title>Awesome little device!
<Date>Sat Apr 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this gadget thinking I might be throwing my money away (looks cheap), but it actually DOES it job and does it quite well. The remote is a plus, and the USB really works!. Now I just use my SD cards with a cheap $7 adapter and play all my music in my car's radio. It does carry some static but what did you expect? It's radio... Anyways, the static is low and does not bother me too much. It's way better than only having the radio!

<Title>OK product not great though...
<Date>Fri May 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product based on the reviews and thought it would work very well without any interference with the other FM stations being broadcast. I tuned and set this up for channels where there was no FM broadcast, as this would be the best way to reduce any interference. Although the product works fine and the sound output is good, there was a constant hissing sound in the background which is unlike any CD player. Though I would recommend this player to anyone who wants a nice FM transmitter at this price, i think its good price. But i would suggest that they check all the FM frequencies available on the product with the local FM station frequencies and match atleast one or two channels without any interference or crossover.

<Title>Super-Duper Happy!
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The best $25 I ever spent!    I recently aquired my mom's '98 Mercury Sable - - which only has a tape player and whose head is worn,  so I needed a way of getting music into the car,  and needed it to be cheap - so I took a gamble and ordered  this device (after cross comparing to many others of same,  as well as comparing to other routes) -  -it is GREAT - honestly, and I am picky about my tunes!!    I was able to tune it in without reading the how-to and it only took maybe 30 seconds total to set up - - then I blissfully sat in the car for 10 minutes longer  then needed just because I had to try a variety of songs  (the skeptic in me couldn't believe it really sounded so good).  If you are broke or just a tight-wad,  if you have a need for music quality control in your car = this is the gizmo!  Downside, if you can call it that... is the lack of easy drag-n-drop  from iTunes -- you first need to give "Track 1" a real name if you  have multiple "Track 1" files you want on the thumbdrive, and no,  it won't read folders (ie: you will have one long playlist to forward thru).  I plan to have 2 thumbdrives to make life easy,  one with my favorites (gunge/metal/goth) and one  that is more sociable (classical/folk/mello pop)  so it will be easier to accomodate passengers.  PS: for those that will wonder, the instruction sheet has verbage  concerning a root directory, etc. (sounds like ancient DOC lingo) -  what I did was make a file folder on the drive called "MP3"  and dragged my iTunes mp3's into that, and it works fine (OS 9)
