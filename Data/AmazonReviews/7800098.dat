<Title>Don't  Buy  This !
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Update:   The player freezes with no sound and with the screen on (displaying album artwork), at random times and for no apparent reason. One of my two units had to be reset so many times that it can no longer be reset: it feels like that internal pad you press on with a sharp pin has now disappeared (it must have broken off). Our only recourse now is to wait 3 days for the battery to run dead, and hope that it will be reset simply by recharging it from scratch. We've only had this unit since August (it's now December), so I no longer feel the reliability level of this product is sufficient to justify its purchase. Buy something else that doesn't have to be reset all the time!     I bought the 2 GB model because the 4 GB version wasn't available yet and it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs.   Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.   I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.   At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.   The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.   This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.   Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.   The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.   The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.   I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.   The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.   Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.   Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.   It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.   If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.   You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.   Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.

<Title>Beautiful player, works flawlessly!
<Date>Fri Apr 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zen V for my wife a couple months ago and she absolutely loves it! It is so easy to use - we haven't had any problems with ripping or transferring or album art or anything like that. The player has locked up a couple times but that's a very simple problem to solve. ALL MP3 players lock up from time to time, even iPods!  I think the feature my wife loves most is the compatibility with subscription music services. She uses Napster to Go and is CONSTANTLY changing the songs on her player. We love not paying a dollar for every song we download!  I also want to mention how awesome this player feels in your hand. It's sort of hard to describe but once you pick it up, you don't want to put it down. It has a smooth, glossy feel and all the edges are curved. Zen indeed!  I really can't think of anything negative to say about this great little player. If you're open to considering an iPod alternative, give this little guy a look. It's durable, easy to use, cool looking - and most importantly, the sound is incredible!

<Product Name>Zen V 2GB Black/green
<Title>not recommended - freezes frequently
<Date>Sat Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a not recommended purchase.  I bought mine in April and I'd say it freezes up several times a week.  It's easy to reset - stick a pin in little hole - but if you're not near a pin, say on a bike, or a walk, or downtown, etc., you are outta luck until you get near a pin.  I keep a little box of pins on my table next to sofa so that it's handy.  I use mine for audiobooks quite a bit and it seems to freeze when using the joystick to go back and forth.  Any kind of quick back and forth can reliably cause it to freeze so I go slowly and then hold my breath that it won't freeze up on me.    I use the bookmark feature on the unit but that's actually a series of steps.  When buying mp3 player for husband for Father's Day I opted not to get the zen v+ due to freezing problem and got the Samsung (2GB* MP3 Player and Image Viewer - Black Model: YP-T9JQB) model instead and his bookmarking feature is much easier.  Just hold down the center button.  The Zen has to go through hold down the back up button, scroll down one to Set Bookmark, hit joystick, hit joystick.  The Samsung model is much easier and quicker.  The Creative forum website shows a lot of complaints about the product so Creative needs to take care of their customers and improve their products or they'll be going the way of so many other players (Rio, etc.) over the years.  It does have good sound for me and otherwise it does work well.  But not  recommended due to inconvenience of frequent freeze ups.  Husband has had the Samsung unit for a couple of weeks now and no problems.
