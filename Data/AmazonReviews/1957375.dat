<Title>SAY YOUR PRAYERS, IPOD.
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing does everything the nano does(and things it doesn't like FM tuning and voice and radio recording)for less money.  The only reason to choose an ipod is if you want to be a trendy hipster(god knows there are plenty where I live).  The battery life is great and the shell is pretty scratch resistant.  Even the screen seems pretty sturdy. I found a compatible case logic armband for it at Sears for ten bucks-good luck finding an IPOD armband for less than thirty.  I haven't tried the video feature so maybe the last guy is right about that, I don't know.  But as far as music and photos this thing is great-Sandisc has a new loyal customer.

<Title>Much Better Than the Ipod Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Longer battery life, looks alot better, cheaper, has video capability, easy navigation, radio-need I say more? Ipod nano on the other hand.....has more assessories.  That's it.  Get the e250 instead of the nano.  You won't regret it.

<Title>A great MP3/WMA player
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: In August SanDisk released a firmware upgrade. Now there's a Custom EQ capability and best of all: syncing to subscription based music (URGE in my case) is WAAAAY FASTER. It's almost as fast as if you're adding your own local files. Previously this was the achilles heel, now it's fixed.  SanDisk actually made a good product better. :-) ______________________________________________________________  I just bought this for $150, a great bargain!  I have mostly WMA's and therefore have no need for an iPod. This player is terrific and it works with subscription services. The interface is easy, the screen is sharp and did I mention it's a great deal?   Oh and another reviewer said these things:  "The scroll wheel is a very loose, flimsy, plastic ring. It's also difficult to turn. Often, I need to use both thumbs to turn the wheel."  and  "Video playback is very buggy: A movie is arbitrarily broken into tiny video files, which the player displays and treats separately. It also adds 5-seconds gaps between them!"   I found neither of these to be true --I suspect the reviewer recieved a faulty device. The video playback is PERFECT and the wheel certainly doesn't require "both thumbs" to turn ...?!  And yet another "reviewer" stated this: "Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player" as their review heading. With minimal PRODUCT RESEARCH one discovers that this device charges via USB. Basically that reviewer is asking for something that this product is not advertised to do --and whose problem is that? What's next, being upset that his/her 2GB model doesn't hold 8GB worth of songs?  Helps to read the product description. ...

<Title>Beats any mp3 in it's category, especially the Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it for the ability to play music and it's great. It is far superior to the Nano in everything except the availability of accessories but it's slowing changing. In fact, I had bought a Nano and sold it because this is better.  For instance, 1. longer battery life 2. FM radio 3. recording capability (including from the radio) 4. scratch resistant 5. user changeable battery 6. ability to expand memory by using mini sd cards 7. better price.  Outstanding mp3 player.

<Title>SanDisk has done it again!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I like to read reviews before buying stuff, I've never been attracted to iPod, becuase there have always been better alternatives at a better price. Since SanDisk announced the E200 series  I decided it was gonna be my next digital audio player. well, I got it and it's a great little device. everyone can notice the great quality of this player just looking at it. its metal back and solid apperance shows it's very durable. I like the wheel control, it works great and once you get used to the buttons layout, you'll find it convenient too.  pros. -Eye-catching design, silver and glossy-black look really sexy. -Great quality built (metal frame, liquidmetal back and hard glossy front) -Easy to copy your songs, either by using Windows Media Player or drag and drop. -Gorgeous screen display, easily visible even under direct sunlight. -Great Battery life -User replaceable battery. -Decent earbuds provided. -The right size and weight. -Hard to scratch. -Plays videos, FM radio with good reception, shows pics and records voice and radio. -Easy menu, with practically no hidden or hard-to-reach pages. -Dedicated voice recording button. -Great audio quality.  cons. -No custom EQ, you have to use the provided ones only. The normal  (flat EQ) sounds great, though. -Catches all your fingerprints even if your hands are clean. -It should show more details about the playing song (Bitrate, format, etc.) -It has a clock, but once you start playing a song, you never see it again. -It's been storing some stuff under the screen, it doesn't look like dust, it's like some white crumbs that maybe come from the interior and not from the outside. if it gets nasty I'll take the unit apart and clean it up, I just hope it's easy to do so.  This is a nice player and SanDisk offers feature packed, great quality players at a very affordable price, get it if you can. Sorry iPod, maybe next time...

<Title>iPod Nano Killer
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, I do agree that this is a iPod Nano rip off. But this player adds so much more and has value for the buck.  I just bought this player after a lot of research about this product. Read video reviews on gizmodo and engadget before I got this. I'm extremely impressed by all the things that this player can do namely 1. Music 2. Video (1.8" screen) 3. FM  4. FM recording 5. Photos 6. Voice recording  I got this for $150 and it is surely worth every penny. The mechanical dial can look and feel little ugly but once you get used to it, it is not that bad.   Also this player has same length & breadth of Nano but is almost twice as thick as the Nano. It is also heavier than the Nano but somehow this feels more sturdy than the Nano. It comes with a lanyard and I wear this all day without any problems with weight.  The screen is very bright and the interface is very very intuitive.   The software (Media converter) that comes along with player is simple and easy to use. It converts videos to .mov format to be played. Music can be transferred by just dragging and dropping mp3s. Sandisk also provides firmware upgrades on their website which worked fine. FM recording was great though the FM receiver isnt really good. It also has a micro SD card slot that can be used to add more memory to the player.   Overall, if you are looking for something that can do way more than the iPod Nano and costs $50 less, you SHOULD buy this player. If you want to follow the crowd and cant think out of the box, then you should buy the iPod Nano.

<Title>I already despised the nano, and this is the nail in the coffin
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>NOTE: If you want to be a clone, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER! GO GET A NANO LIKE THE 8 TRILLION OTHER CLONES IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAVE ONE.   Otherwise, this player is the flyest thing I've seen in a minute. I was actually waiting for the e250 to be released b/c in doing research on it, it essentially had everything I wanted. MP3s, photos, fm radio, recording, fm radio recording, and even video! All this in a small but STURDY package. The obvious competitior is the iPod nano, which doesn't even compare to the e250 on any level. The nano would probably snap in half in my pocket if I sat down wrong. The drag and drop the e250 has is so simple my dog could do it (no, really). The only thing that I recommend is looking up the user guide from sandisk.com which has way more detail than the included instructions. Otherwise, buy this! I wouldn't steer you wrong.

<Title>It's great!!!! The best mp3 player i have ever bought!!!BMO
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I have ever bought. I you ever need to buy a mp3 player TRUST ME!! Get this one. I was just a normal person looking for a for a mp3 player. I got it at best buy about one week after it was on the market. I have not had one single problem with it once. I had and i-pod before this. But it broke in the washer, and the sansa could probably be ran over with a car and not break(liquidmetal). It Plays video but you need quick time player 6.5 or more. Save it to that and you're good. The only thing i have a problem with is the music store. Rhapsody is horrible, but windows media player works perfectly. But if you want a music store choose something else. So, an overall preview on it, is,it can store up to 400 songs, plays video, fm tuner and recorder, can store info and pictures, and is great. It also can scroll down very fast. In the box comes a starting disk and manual. Trust me get this mp3 player. It beats the nano by far!!!!!!

<Content>I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books on a long commute, and I purchased this when the last MP3 player I had died after 4 months (with a 3 month warrantee) - Avoid Coby!.  Used that experience to look much more closely at what I wanted - a replaceable battery, easy to use controls, easy to read display, reasonable power consumption.  This has met my expectations and more.  A very solid, well performing player.

<Title>DO NOT BUY, DEFECTIVE
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently got this MP3 player and was very excited. The first thing I did was start charging it. Then I turned it on. The first thing it did was say "Key Locked, System Shutdown". I thought it might have just been one of those random things that happen so I tried turning it on again. Same thing happened. I tried one final time, and IT DID NOT TURN ON AT ALL AND NEVER EVER DID FOR THE REST OF THE TIME I HAD IT. I returned it and in 1 day already had a new one, thinking this one would work fine and the last one just had a defect. It worked great for about 1 week, and then one day I tried to listen to music and it said "synchronize to continue your music subscription" and would not let me listen to any songs. My sister has the same MP3 player as me and had the same thing happen to her and all she had to do was plug it in to the computer and then it worked fine, except for she could not have it on shuffle and she also could not skip songs so she had to listen through songs to hear one that she wanted to listen to. If she had it on shuffle or skipped songs it would give her that message I talked about earlier and would not play the songs. So, I plugged my MP3 player into the computer, hoping it would fix the problem, and it would not turn on at all, and still won't. Also, some of the songs on my sister's MP3 player will still not play. I have gone through two of these MP3 players and both did not work properly, and my sister's MP3 player is defected and will probably stop working just like mine did. Both me and my sister are very dissapointed and are both returning our MP3 players. I am not going to get this one again and neither is my sister. It would also be wise for you to take the same path as us. Do not ever buy this MP3 player!

<Title>WILL NOT PLAY SONGS
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this MP3 player at the end of May, and was very happy about it. I immediately synchronized songs onto it, and it worked very well. The sound quality is very good.   HOWEVER, after a couple weeks of owning this product, something very strange occurred. It was playing completely normally, and all of a sudden when it was going to the next song, it would NOT play and a message came up reading "Synchronize to continue your music subscription". I was very confused; I had obviously synchronized the songs onto the player.  It would not let me listen to any of the songs for the rest of the day. Finally I got home and plugged it into the USB port, hoping that this would solve the problem.  I unplugged it, turned it on, and it seemed to be working fine.  But then, the very next time I used it, the exact same problem occurred.  I found that if I don't have the Music Options set on "shuffle" and don't skip forward, it USUALLY will play just fine. Otherwise, it won't let me play any songs and keeps giving me that annoying message.  Even when I don't use shuffle, however, it still will occassionally not allow me to listen to certain songs.    In the end, I am returning this MP3 player and am not going to buy another one of the same brand.  There are lots of good reviews for this product, but maybe that is just because those reviewers have not yet experienced this problem.  It seems to be defective.  Everyone should save their money and time, and avoid this product at all costs!!!!!!!!

<Title>BETTER THAN NANO!
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>***The person who's title is "DO NOT BUY,DEFECTIVE" is a total idiot. I had the exact same thing happen to me! Guess what I did! I unlocked the hold switch and PRESTO! It magically started working!***  Anyway...this is BETTER THAN THE IPOD NANO. Both of my sisters have a Nano and after I got this and played with it for a while, I looked at my sisters nano and laughed at it! It wasn't near as good! The E250's screen is probably twice the size of the nano, and the bright color screen is mouth dropping. AND YOU CAN HAVE VIDEO! YES VIDEO! It can't hold A WHOLE LOT, but it can still have videos. I am more than satified with this product. Some more awesome features are FM Radio and Voice Recordings. I'm not sure if this is mentioned in the description already but YOU CAN RECORD A SONG STRAIGHT FROM THE RADIO SO YOU CAN HEAR THAT EXACT SAME SONG ANYTIME!!!And you can still listen to that song while you're recording it. Also the Voice Recorder, doesn't sound like a big deal, but mannn is it fun to toy with! haha! Another neat little feature is you can "see into the future". You press a the middle button once or twice and it tells you what song is next! Here, let me break it down for you!...   THE GOOD...  ~BRIGHT & COLORED BACKLIGHT MAKE IT MORE THAN EASY TO READ SONG TITLES,ETC... ~SCROLL WHEEL IS VERY EASY TO CONTROL AND VERY ATTRACTIVE ~THE OVERALL LOOK IS VERY ATTRACTIVE ~SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT ~MORE THAN ENOUGH FEATURES (MUSIC,VIDEO,PICS,RADIO,RADIO RECORDER,VOICE RECORDER) ~VERY LARGE SCREEN ~NICE PICTURE QUALITY! ~THE 2GB CAN ACTUALLY HOLD 1000 SONGS IF FORMATTED TO WMA. ~AND MORE!  THE BAD...  ~SOMETIME YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PRESS BUTTONS TWICE ~CAN SMUDGE EASILY ~HAS TO CHARGE BY A COMPUTER ~UPLOADS MUSIC IN A "WEIRD WAY" BUT THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM ~AND THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF!!! (SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YA?)   OVERALL : GREAT PRODUCT - I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!

<Content>I've had my Sansa for about two weeks now, and love it.  The positive reviews here are spot on.  You definitely have to download the full product manual at sandisk.com, or you'll be a little frustrated trying to figure all the features out.  There are also a couple of good discussion forums out there if you search for them. Earphones are crap, but then most every review of MP3 players say that.  Overall, I'm impressed, and glad I bought this vs. the Nano.

<Content>This player is definately worth the money, but there is one flaw that annoys me. The media converter for video (pictures work fine). The video function for me plays well, but without audio. I am still trying to find a way to correct this. If I can get this function to work, I would change my rating to five stars. The screen, music playback, and pic viewer are all great. Technically, the video playback is also clear, just without audio.

<Title>Think Twice Before Buying
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player thinking I would be able to use it to listen to my music and the radio on my daily commute.  The radio worked fine.  The MP3 player worked, but I could not load music on either of my computers.  I have a Macintosh desktop at home. The Mac would recharge the device, but did not recognize it.  The other computer I have is an HP laptop with an XP operating system.  It would not recognize the player at all, I kept getting an error message.  Once, during the two hours I messed with it, it froze and had to be rebooted.  I called tech support and found out that the Sandisk Sansa 250e will not work with a Mac at all.  His other suggestion was that the device needed Microsoft Media Player version 10 or 11 or it would not work.  I checked my laptop and it had version 11.  I sent it back and got my money back.  I bought an Ipod clone that works great on either system.

<Title>Better than the iPod nano, even better with Rockbox
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have had limited experience with mp3 players, but have found this one to work very well for me. I had used the iPod nano and the sansa m240 before purchasing this mp3 player.  This player is better than the iPod nano because:  *You don't need iTunes. You can sync files from other music ompanies. *You have a very handy voice recorder built in *You can watch video once you have encoded it to play on the sansa (free software included) *You can (sometimes) get halfway decent radio. (But hey, the nano has nothing so what do you have to lose?)  I purchased this player over the sansa m240 because I wanted to be able to play video. (something the m240 can't do.)  The format of the Sansa is decently pleasing to look at, and I was able to begin loading music within minutes of opening it up. I have always used Windows Media Player to sync my music, but you may be able to do a direct drag-and-drop sync with this player. (Locate the player in the My Computer folder, find the Music folder, and copy your music files right there)   My MAJOR complaint was the EXTREMLY annoying scroll wheel light. It glows blue when turned on and remains on while the player is in use. (Even after the screen light goes off) After using a nano, this light seemed blinding!! This is a huge drawback unless...  You install Rockbox! This free software available at rockbox.com removed the sansa software in the player and replaces it. The main reason I installed it was so I could turn the scroll-wheel light off. But rockbox offers so many more options, I probably would have installed it even if the wheel light was not always off.  You can: *change the font   *change the color of your screen *create your own folders (or use their database)  *flip the screen upside-down  *play games (none come on the original sansa) *and lots more!  I am really happy with this combination of the e250 and Rockbox. Once I loaded the software I was able to sync my music from two different computers. Basically, the computer reads the player as a UBS device, and lets me add and delete music on different computers. I have begun building my own "database" for my music by creating folders and organizing my music. Playing video was a little tricky, as the rockboxed-player will only play mpeg video. I downloaded some free converting software, and once I figured it out it wasn't too hard.    I have only had this player for a few weeks, so I am still playing with all the features. The player would probably be fine with the original software if Sansa would include a wheel-light off setting. The wheel problem is the reason I only gave this product a 4 star. Otherwise a great player, cheaper than the iPod nano, and a good starter player if you are looking for video and pictures on your mp3. If you are interested in Rockbox, visit their website www.rockbox.com and look at their free software. You can load software for other players besides the Sansa e250. Google it and see what you can find!

<Title>Exactly what I wanted in an MP3 player
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one in the first week they came out, but just now am getting around to reviewing it. Why? I've been using my iPod touch, my iPod shuffle, and a few other odds and ends for music, but the Sansa e series does exactly what I want it to do and doesn't get in its own way. Its easy to use, battery life is amazing (about a week at 3 hours a day or radio and MP3) and so far  even after I've abused it leaving in the bottom of my gym bag it's still alive and doing fine. For the commute and they gym, it's my MP3 player of choice. Oh, and I'm a sucker for the cool blue light on the dial. What can I say?

<Title>Affordable, Expandable, Small: MP3 Player to Buy in 2008
<Date>Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product to pick up right now, in early 2008, as prices drop. The Sansa e250 should be a Nano-killer, and it's a great buy for anyone who wants an inexpensive flash mp3 player for exercising, walking, or general use. I've owned a bunch of mp3 players, including iPods and one Nano, and here are the selling points for this little Sansa e250:  * Expandable memory through SD Flash. Buy a 2GB and by next fall, you can upgrade it very affordably to some mega size (16 GB? flash memory prices are falling). You'll have a cheap flash player larger as big as some iPods.  * Good sound quality. Via headphones, this is indistinguishable from any of the top mp3/iPods I've listened to. Don't know how it sounds in an audio system, but I don't recommend that for any iPod or flash player, just my tastes.  * Affordability, affordable, cheap, well-priced ... This thing is $69 online and at Best Buy. A few players, like the also excellent Sansa Click, are $49, but they are not expandable. For $20, that's a great option.  * One more note on affordability: Flash players and iPods sometimes get crushed, lost, stepped on, or dropped in rivers (did I mention I've owned a few?). That's their nature, or rather, our nature as clutzes. It sure feels better to hear your front left tire crush a $69 player, as opposed to a $149 one. Trust me.  * FM Radio. It's a great option, available on the e250. Works great.  * Usability. Compared to some of the uber-small players out now, you get a more readable screen. The interface is minimal but easy to use - what you want on a flash player.  *  Good size/form factor. It's not the Click, which is perhaps optimal in size, but it's small enough to attach to your clothes while running. I hold mine, which is plenty easy.  * Free 60-day Best Buy Digital Music Store trial (aka Rhapsody). I have gotten this with two of my past mp3 purchases. Have never signed up for the subscription service, i.e., never paid, but I love the 60-day free trial period. It's a great way to learn about new artists.  * Integration with Audible - pretty standard these days, but well done on the e250.  Negatives? There is not as wide a range of formats as you can play on a big old iPod or larger digital music player like the big Sansas or iRivers. But hey, this is your flash drive, for working out - for your selected collection, not the whole thing. And if you're strictly playing .wma or .mp3 files, you can in fact get the whole thing on there, using an SD flash card.  Bottom line: Probably the best deal out there now in the combination of features (FM, expandable), affordability (just $20 more than the cheapos), form factor/usability, and the not-to-be-overlooked sound quality.

<Title>Nice MP3 player for those on a budget!

<Content>This Sansa MP3 player is a nice, rugged piece at a great price!  Pros: Solid metal case feels substantial, long battery life, nice screen size, cool blue backlight, plays videos, lots of accessories available, great volume Cons: Controls difficult to use for someone with big hands/fingers, no ac charger included(charger included works off of PC USB port)  All in all, this is a very nice Ipod-like MP3 player. Make sure you buy a case and AC charger with it!

<Title>Love it!

<Content>Once I figured out how to convert videos, it was simple and easy!  You have to download the software for it b/c it doesn't come with it.  I contacted the company on a sunday and it was very quick and painless.  They were very helpful.  The videos are VERY clear and the music is a cinch to add.  Also gotta love the expandable memory. One way to save money up front on buying a larger memory MP3 player.

<Content>This item is wonderful!  I had some trouble at first getting it installed on my laptop, but then discovered the problem was my cd drive, not the player.  Once I tried it on my desktop, I was downloading in no time.  Fun, fun, fun!
