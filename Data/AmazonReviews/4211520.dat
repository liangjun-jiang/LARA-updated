<Title>not worth the money
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>it holds a lot of information/books etc, and therefore makes a great reference if you are a professional, travel, etc.  Also, it is quite good at finding access to the internet.  Unfortunately, I didn't heed the warnings of others.  It's hard drive has broken after 6 months of use.  Now its a great paper weight!

<Title>great little machine
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have heard a lot about these things freezing up and dying, but thats only because something was installed wrong on it.  i have had mine for 3 years now, and it only died once, because i downloaded free solitaire games off the internet.  i reset it, and it works fine.  so convenient to be able to edit all of my microsoft office applications on the go.  i went to hawaii and took this with me, and was able to use the moblie manager feature to upload my digital cameras sd card onto it, so i could continue to take pictures.  the mp3 player has always worked perfectly for me.  the interent applications are fantastic.

<Title>Died and will not reset
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After a year, the Lifedrive froze while starting up.  I tried resetting, including several hard resets, which the unit would never complete.  A call to Palm Tech Support did no good - they want me to send it back for repair (at my own expense, since it's past the warranty period).

<Title>Mine also died and will not reset
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Lifedrive died after a year and will not reset.  I've tried the soft reset, hard reset and hard reset with the Lifedrive charging in its cradle.  Palm support is non-existent.  They gave a lame suggestion (the hard reset in the cradle) when I first contacted them and now they have not responded to my follow up message.  In addition the form on their website to request support has stopped working.  I have to say the address book was really handy and it was useful to be able to read e-books on the PDA.  However, I can't possibly recommend getting a Lifedrive because of the poor support and the danger of losing important data which cannot readily be transferred to a non-Palm PDA even if you have been doing regular synchronizations with a desktop computer.

<Title>Great product.  About robust as a 3 week old apple !
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Loved everything about this product, until I paid out my cash for it.  After only using it for a few weeks it must have took some sort of knock in my coat pocket (yeah, yeah, my own fault, yada, yada).  It's not like I was rough with it or anything but the device developed the "Click of death".  So it is no longer "bootable".  To be honest if the fundamental drive aspect of this device is that it is so vulnerable to shocks then I see no reason to trust my "Life" to it.  Yet another gadget in the Gadget Drawer Of History.

<Title>Skip this one...buy Palm TX instead
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I gave the LifeDrive a chance for a year.   It was my 2nd Palm device.   The old Tungsten E was more reliable.  Even though the Tungsten E would lose data once the battery drain, I knew how to work around it...use backup software and charge it every other day.  Once I knew how to work around the Tungten E's quirks then it became a reliable hardware for me.  I do not know how to work around LifeDrive's quirks.  The LifeDrive worked most of the time, but you always had a sense that it may not work one day and you are not clear how to fix it or prevent some issues from happening again.   Sometimes it would not come on even though the day before it was fully charged.   I had to charge it again for some reason.   My current problem is that when I turn it on I can only see my contacts and the WiFi screen seems to be in loop (keeps flashing on and off).   It will not let me use any other applications.  I reset it and nothing has changed.  I should have went with the Palm TX instead.  Palm owes buyers an apology for creating such an expensive item that is not reliable.

<Title>skip it
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When it works, it works beautifully, unfortunately the older it gets the less it works, at least that's what happened to me.  Mine lasted one year.  It was incredibly buggy and crashed out frequently from day one  (preinstalled Versamail was the biggest culprit).  It takes about two to three minutes to reboot every time it crashes out on you, and after a while I just hoped that it would turn on after a crash.  I installed Iambic's Agendus, which I've used various versions of since my Newton and the Lifedrive didn't like it at all.  It crashed and rebooted left and right because of it.  The internet browser has a bug that doesn't allow you to download anything like patches.  You'll get an error message saying that your harddisk or card is full.  The last I heard the Lifedrive has been discontinued and there are no plans of a v.o 2.0.  Which is a shame really, as they had the makings of a nice piece of equipment had they worked on it a little more.

<Title>The first steps towards real convergence.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good or bad, this marks the beginning of the microDrive convergence into PDAs and cellphones.  Yes, South Korea, China, and Japan have had microDrive PDAs for awhile now, but this is the US debut of real storage, and a definitive shift away from HotSync to a more-generic external drive model.  Think about that for a moment.  Even Microsoft PowerPCs don't support a pure external drive model of synchronizing.  This allows you to just connect to a central data store (via Bluetooth, WiFi, or USB) and bring your MP3 files over.  Or Word documents.  Whatever.  It's not the data storage that's most impressive here, it's the final surrender of Palm's HotSync methodology.  That's the big news here.  Of course, this device represents a compelling upgrade for older PDA users.  Storage at near 4Gb means the iPod mini or Zen Micro are less attractive electronics, by virtue of their single-function purpose.  The OS has been ramped up, and it still runs most of the legacy Palm apps (you will find that more and more apps are not migrating, though).  The extra treat of Bluetooth and WiFi radios means you can use a Bluetooth keyboard, connect to a BlueTooth cellphone, maybe stream music to your Bluetooth BMW.. or use WiFi to stream to a WiFi stereo system, receive that stream and playback, grab MP3s from your basement machine, and so forth.  I can see this being used as a web pad in most homes, allowing for some web browsing, some MP3 playback, and more importantly, remotely viewing another PC on a home network (maybe to shuffle music playback or check email).  Of course, having WiFi or Bluietooth in a PDA is not groundbreaking; having both isn't either, but it's impressive and long overdue.  The sum of features makes this a worthy addition if you're looking for a new PDA, or if you want something much more than an iPod mini or Creative Zen Micro.  However, if you hang on a few months, maybe to Q4 2005, Nokia will have a cellphone with a 4Gb (maybe 6Gb by that time) microDrive, and then the electronics landscape changes forever, because no one will want "just an MP3 player" ever again (unless they really don't want a cellphone or handheld computer).

<Title>Wrong product..  wrong time.
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wrong product..  wrong time.  	Consumers of US have been offered new electronics products almost everyday. But how many times we look at them and say, "I want that!" PalmOne's LifeDrive is not going to make you say that, either.  Major features of the product: * Palm OS 5.4 * Intel Processor * 4G HD * Wi-Fi 802.11b * Bluetooth 1.1 * USB 2.0 * Big color display * Support for Microsoft Documents * Voice Recorder * Camera Companion Software * MP3 Player  This is not impressive.If PalmOne wants to be ahead of the curve, they should have added Wi-Fi 802.11g. Bluetooth and USB 2.0 are pretty much necessary and they are good there. 	 Lets do a quick comparison of this product,  PalmOne Treo 650: $400 (And lot cheaper with cell phone service annual contract) Features: Cell, PDA, Camera, MP3 Player, SpeakerPhone, Bluetooth, 23MB Nokia 6620: $350 (less than $100 with annual plan)  Features: Cell, PDA, Camera, MP3 Player, Speakerphone, Bluetooth 12MB  Why am I comparing with cell phones? Because we have to have one and what is missing in them is the big hard-drive. For that, I am not going to buy LifeDrive. I will rather just a get a USB drive/firewire drive for 50 bucks which I don't need to upgrade or something, or better yet, an iPod which is an excellent USB Hard-Drive (iPod Photo fo 30G $349) 	If PalmOne is thinking that this device is going to fill the gap between your office computer, home computer, camera, I think they are wrong. We need little more integration like combination of a Nokia Cell,  PDA, Apple MP3 player, small Sony camera, Big Hitachi Hard drive. And all of this still should be bigger than the Palm Treo.  Bottom Line: I wouldn't waste my money on this. I am sure something more worthwhile will come before end of this year.

<Title>On the mark
<Date>Thu May 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This PDA is exactly what the Tungsten T5 should have been (integrated Wi-Fi, voice recorder), and will probably drive the latter out of existence.  One cool feature that the other reviews haven't noted is that the LifeDrive can be used as a photo-dump, enabling direct transfer of data from a camera's SD card--something that the iPod Photo (unbelievably) can't do without additional hardware.  True the 4GB can't compare with dedicated photo-dumps (the Epson P-2000 has ten times the storage), but it's still more than enough for a photo-intense vacation.

<Title>An honest look at it all...
<Date>Mon May 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me preface this review by saying that I did in fact order mine - it should be arriving any day and I look forward to posting a very honest review of this palm handheld.    I just had to post this review to combat those many bad reviews on this item.  It technically is not available yet and will not be released until the 30th of May.  To all those WinCE users out there - stop complaining about items you don't even use!    Now I have a long history of having palm handhelds - from my first Palm V to my current Palm Tungsten T3, I have a good viewpoint on their company's evolution (albeit slow).  I recently left Palm for Sony's CLIE TH-55 which I thought was the best all-around PDA available at the time.  It had everything I could ever want, and more!  I decided to stick with Palm since Sony was leaving the market and purchased a Tungsten E which I was sorely dissapointed by.  Long gone was the metal for PDAs from this company, as seen by their recent trend with the Tungsten T5 (plastic, plastic), and their new E2 (plastic again).    I sold my Tungsten E and purchased a T3 the moment the T5 was available because that perhaps was one of the larger dissapointments in Palm's history.  Well, here were are with them satisfying our needs with 4 GB of storage space, Wi-fi, bluetooth, and USB 2.0 (yes, it has USB 2.0 unlike other's reviews).    So why did I order this item?  I plan to have it replace my USB flash drives, I look forward to checking my email wherever I am at work or in my house with the wireless networks.  Heck - even when I'm waiting for food at Starbucks or Panera I can leech onto their free Wi-fi.  Battery life?  I'm hoping its better than what I get with my current T3 - though nothing beats that Sony CLIE I had thus far in the battery life comparison.  I'll post an addendum to this review once I've used my new LifeDrive for a month or so.  Keep an eye open for my updates!

<Title>Good start, but not perfect yet.
<Date>Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Lifedrive one week ago to replace a sony Clie.  The following comments are based on one week experience. Pros: 1.  New lifedrive manager software which in most cases obviate the need for hotsync.  This is truly revolutionary. 2.  Larger hard drive.  Finally we are catching up with the rest of the world.  You may be able to replace your iPod mini with this more versatile handheld. 3.  Good voice recorder.  I just got back from a meeting and recorded one whole days worth of talks from the back of a room with 60 people and record quality was quite good and no software bugs were noticed.  In addition to the time allocated under your voice memo section, you can directly record to your hard drive allowing you to record more stuff. 4.  This machine can store an enormous number of powerpoint presentations.  This is a big plus for if you do any teaching e.g. quick review of a topic with a med student before a surgery. 5.  Nice metallic finish.  Looks better than cheap looking T5.  Cons: 1.  Poor battery life.  After a whole day of heavy use, the battery dies without warning. 2.  Repeated powering down of the hard drive causing a few second delay in opening new applications.  Annoying as hell!!! 3.  No way to customize turning off the screen after a short period of inactivity.  If you play chess on this machine, it becomes annoying.  By the way, Hiarcs chess engine runs quite well on this machine(Downloadable for 39.99). 4.  Adobe reader formats most documents well, but some with complex formatting turn into incomprehensible amorphous text. 5.  Price.  I don't understand why a piece of cheap looking electronics made in china should cost this much money. 6.  No integrated cell phone or camera. 7.  Some applications don't run on this device.  I signed up for audible.com membership to get a $100 rebate.  But so far I have been unable to make the audible manager recognize this device and download audiobooks to this device. 8.  It is very disappointing palm decided to put the cheaper and slower WiFi.  I suspect their next device will have the faster version. 9.  Size.  More bulky than other palm handhelds.  Not a true shirt pocket device. 10.  No headphone provided.  Why can't they throw in a $10 headphone for this $499 device.  I am using my old sony clie headphones which works fine.   Overall, 4 stars.  I am sure I will find a lot more annoying problems as I use it more.

<Title>Nice try, but...
<Date>Sun Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Palm is on the right track here with the LifeDrive, but they don't quite pull it off, and when you spend five hundred smackers, you want a convergence product that solves all of the little nagging issues.  Like an iPod mini, the LifeDrive has a 4GB hard drive, but attaches a fully-featured PDA to it that includes WiFi but no phone as yet (maybe in LifeDrive 2 or Treo 1000?). You can do all the classic Palm functions, plus for the first time decent video (other Palms just don't have enough memory).   The device has a beautiful, large enough screen, and finally somebody has figured out how to automatically download camera memory, turning the LifeDrive into an effective memory bank. (Too bad they figured this out AFTER flash memory prices cratered.)  But if you want real video or even significant photo storage, the 4GB just isn't enough. Battery life is weak, at under 10 hours. And the size is large, significantly bigger than an iPod maxi. Overall, it's not bad for a first try, like the original 5GB iPod. But before this becomes a killer, must-have device, Palm is going to have to:  1) Up the GB level.  2) Up the battery power (new batteries being developed by Toshiba hold much promise).  3) Upgrade the sleekness of the machine. 4) Improve the software package so it will better sync with your pics and movies. That is the beauty of iPod photo -- the syncing with iPhoto and iTunes is a joy, versus a cumbersome loading process. 5) Consider adding a wireless TV dock so that LifeDrive (or more likely, LifeDrive2) can double as a DVR. How cool would it be to be able to record the Sopranos, take it to a friend's house on your LifeDrive and play it? There are ways to do this now through your computer, but it's a bit cumbersome. 6) Cut the price so regular folks can afford it, not just doctors and lawyers and techno geeks looking for the latest toy.  Overall, first adopters will ignore the glitches and glow over the best attempt at a video/photo/PDA yet created, but savvy regular shoppers will wait a year for LifeDrive 2, or, more likely, for a video iPod, which could be headed your way by Christmas.

<Title>Very Glitchy
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When I recieved this LifeDrive, the first thing it required me to do was to reset it. I did, reluctantly, and when it began to start up again, it would "No notice" reset itself again. I was forced to hard-reset it in order to begin using it. This happened to me many times, including when I was in a meeting. Now, it won't even boot up. However, when it was not glitching, I found it very satisfying. It had an endless supply of memory, and I could store whatever I wanted-even if it wasn't compatible with the Palm OS-via the "Life Drive Manager", or "Drive mode". The graphics were superb, but many times I was not able to experience it fully because of the noticable lag. Another thing I noticed was that soft resetting it took longer than a Windows machine to boot up. There are many superlatives about this product, but wait a while for the firmware to be upgraded, because the OS included with this program is very glitchy.

<Title>Nice first take
<Date>Wed Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the LifeDrive for a few weeks now and I absoulutely love it.  The complaints about load delays are way overblown.  It's not as snappy as the t5 but we are talking seconds here to swap between apps and as they get cached, there is no delay.    Pros Beautiful screen.  Not quite as bright as the 650 but much  brighter than the t3.  The color is better too.  Built in Wifi is easy to configure and along with the browser is very fast.  PocketTunes works really well as an mp3 player.  Much better than the Real one from the t3  Versamail is a good email app.  I do wish it would load office docs into docs to go though instead of using its viewer.  Drive mode makes it easy to walk up to any pc and transfer files at USB2 speeds.  Hardware button to toggle between landscape and portrait modes.  Battery life seems good.  It's not as good as a dedicated media player but this unit does a heck of a lot more.  I like the power slider where you can lock the unit to "Off".  i cant tell you how many times i've taken my t3 out of the bag and it was on.  Cons The mp3 player skips in the background when loading off the hard drive.  I hope that PalmOne can fix this with a patch.  The video player should play a wider variety of formats and palm should provide software to convert a DVD to mpeg at the lifedrive screen size.  I wish pocketTunes would play unproteted AAC files.  It's a nice codec and much leaner than mp3.  for ~500 they shoulkd have just put 64mb of NVRAM in the unit instead of reserving a portion of the hd for storage.  Would have made the battery last a lot longer.  There are a few minor warts but overall i'd say it's a terrific first attempt.  Five stars for breaking new ground with a convergent device and getting it mostly right.

<Content>This product is not at all what I had hoped for.  After using the Palm Tungsten T5 and being a loyal follower of all of the Palm line, I was excited to receive this product.  That excitement went south in a hurry.  Initially, the product is about half again as bulky as the Tungsten, but that wasn't a big deal.  The synchronization process was slower than the Tungsten's, but again I could deal with that.  The sticking point when the thing locked up 4 times in one morning.  After that I returned it immediately and bought a Palm Tungsten TX from another supplier.

<Content>I purchased a Life Drive just over a year ago.  Tried to hot sync when I got it home with no success.  Returned it to place of purchase, and they couldn't get it to hot sync either, so they replaced it.  Took it home and successfully hot synced the device.  Loaded contacts, calendar events, an Excel spreadsheet, and an outside software program that I had successfully used on my last handheld.  Within six months, the device was not hot syncing.  Device started freezing up, and having to be reset, then jumblimg information, ending in a complete lock-up of the device.  At this point, I can get to the home page, and nowhere else.  Doesn't bode well for me when I go onto the Palm website and no longer see the Life Drive available for purchase.

<Title>What happened to Palm?
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only reason I gave this product 3 stars is partly due to the fact that I paid only $250 for mine (which is a bargain compared to what I would have paid for a TX) and it "at least" does what it advertises it will do out of the box. Beyond that this LifeDrive is insanely unstable and will crash at least 3 times a day.  Flipping the device over will proudly reveal "made in China" stamped on the back and no offense to anyone reading this, but the performance of this device aptly shows it. The LifeDrive features are nice and I appreciate being able to carry a vast amount of media around with me and have the luxury of previewing it on my device. But I am offended that back in the day Palm charged $500+ for a buggy device like this. That isn't even considering the fact that there are many customer complaints stating that the device is lucky to last beyond a year's use. Using this device made me yearn for my Blackberry in that it has yet to crash given the tasks I throw at it. What happened Palm?

<Title>Palm Quality Control & Customer Service is below Sub Par
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>BUYER BEWARE!  Read the reviews before considering buying this.  The screws keep falling out on my palm pilot, and I've found that this is a problem that many people have had (just google "Palm Replacement Screws").  If you buy this, there's a good chance that you'll be the next person having the exact same issue - so be warned.  It may not seem serious, but screws coming out basically means your unit casing will come off and that leaves the memory and all the important things you write down in your schedule UNPROTECTED.     When I contacted them about the issue, I found out what the Palm company was really all about.  That is, getting your money and not looking back.  Instead of admitting that their is a serious design flaw with their product, and doing what they could to rememdy the situation....they figure this is another way they ought to try and add to their profit margin.  Not very smart.  I'm not even asking them to apologize for their imcompitant case designs (which would help them save face imho).  What really gets me is that theres enough people that have this problem for it to be clearly visible to the higher ups, and some executives at the company actually made the decision that they would trade 75 cents in screws for the loss of their company name.  And If the guys running the PALM company are idiots, then it's time to look elsewhere.  I can't believe they wouldn't just ship out replacements and try to fix the product designs.  But as I reseacrch the net to try and find some decent replacement screws for my own unit in the meantime, I just keep finding more and more stories of good people (who don't have problems with screws coming out of other small electronics btw) who are in the same pathetic PALM ownership boat as me.  Am I ever sorry I bought the unit.  Besides the screws, it has reset on me on a number of occasions and luckily I'm religious about backing up data.  Still, you lose some entries and its a major pain.  In fact, I did miss a meeting once because I missed  reentering it after the unit reset and lost data.  Well Palm won't be fattening their margins on me anymore, and I hope you heed the warning I give.  I am in the market for a new Handheld, but I'll NEVER allow myself to get swindled by them again.  They could've used the problem as an opportunity to show their customers that they do value us and score some points.  Unfortunately for them and for us customers, the cold response I've gotten from them tells me that they really could care less and do not have a long term outlook on what it means to sell a business product as important as a scheduling device.  It's best to stay away from them.  I'm through giving PALM any more business.  If you find a better company, please do share.

<Title>not worth it!
<Date>Sun Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product and quickly learned the reason as to why it's been discontinued. It is HORRIBLY slow. It freezes up when trying to simply search for wireless networks, or when switching between screens. Then I installed some medical programs on it and it was even slower. Finally I uploaded one photograph to it......ONE!! And the thing got stuck in a reset loop. It just kept resetting itself, and no matter what buttons i pushed or for how long it just kept turning on and off and on and off. When I taped it back up in the box to return, it was still resetting itself. I think the battery died not long after I shipped it back.

<Title>Fun and Frustration
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If, like me, you were looking to upgrade from an earlier palm device such as a Zire, then forget this unit as you will quickly become extremely frustrated.  The simplicity of a Palm device has been replaced with a daily process of slow performance, soft resets, hard resets, and eventual failure.  In the space of owning this for two weeks, I have had at least two crashes per day, and been forced to perform three hard resets. In each hard reset you lose everything that is on the hard drive. It is not simply a matter of hard reseting the memory, you get a complete erase. Why? Because some idiot at Palm decided it would be amusing to use the hard drive as active memory. This not only slows down the units XScale processor, but opens you up to a hard drive corruption everytime it crashes.  When the unit is working, it is fun to use. I liked the large hard drive and Wifi, but do not ever ever use it as your main storage solution for pictures from your camera because the unit is unreliable and if you cannot get it started, then you have lost everything on the drive, unless you pull the drive out and access it manually.  Mine died after two weeks and I am trying to return it for a refund. I'll wait for the next generation unit to be released.

<Title>Waiting for the LD2...
<Date>Sat Jun 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really, REALLY, wanted to like and keep this PDA.   + great screen + bluetooth + lots of storage space + tablet-like form factor + leather case + voice recorder + headphone jack (a bit loose though) + palm OS with encryption for personal data  +/- included software are usable "lite" versions of originals +/- there is no cradle +/- "lag time" issue when accessing HD   - unit randomly resets itself - wi-fi and blazer set unit into a loop - alarm hangs sometimes - sometimes unit wont turn on without soft reset - sometimes unit wont turn off without soft reset - PalmOne customer support needs to be improved  I'm sure that there will be patches coming up and that most of the issues are software related. But for $499, why should the customer be the BETA tester? I like the LifeDrive, but feel that until the bugs are worked, it might be better to wait for an update or new model. (Remember the T, T2, and T3?)  UPDATE: I returned the unit and bought a TX instead. With a cheap 4GB sd card, the TX is everything the LD should have been (minus the voice recorder). With the money I saved, I was able to buy a nice metal case and still have change left over.

<Title>I have a love hate relationship with the Lifedrive
<Date>Thu Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>(Bear in mind that I'm writing this in June of 2005.  It's possible PalmOne will release software fixes for the Lifedrive that could take care of these issues.  I should note too that I'm on my second Lifedrive, and both have the same issues, so I'm fairly confident that these are issues with the unit in general, not specific to my unit.)  In many respects the Lifedrive is a great handheld.  Having 4GB of contiguous storage space available is wonderful.  The unit handles full screen video playback with ease, and browsing the web works as well as on any handheld available.  Palm's basic PIM (Personal Information Management) apps are wonderful-easy to use and powerful.  They finally got all the features right-built-in Wi-Fi, tons of storage space, a voice recorder, etc.  The unit's also great physically.  I thought it looked big from the pictures, but it doesn't seem large in real life, and it feels good to hold.  It's almost exactly the same size as the old Palm III or Visor Handspring series, which was a form factor I really loved.  The buttons and directional control are EXCELLENT.  Easily the best of any modern PDA.  On top of that is the great screen, which is large, high resolution, bright, and easy to read.  (It does have SOME "screen whine" that's present on most PalmOne units, but it's not as bad as many older units.)  Unfortunately I've had too many issues with the Lifedrive (and the Tungsten T5 prior to it's ROM update) to recommend it.  Documents to Go 7 included with the unit is buggy.  Installing the latest free update from DataViz doesn't fix all the issues.  Mainly, it frequently won't sync spreadsheets stored in Docs to Go format, as it thinks the file is still being edited when it isn't.  A temporary work around is to keep spreadsheets in Excel format on the Lifedrive.  From what I can gather from DataViz, there's some issue with both the Lifedrive and T5-possibly related to the fact that both the LD and T5 have extra storage permanently built-in that the PalmOS sees as a memory card.  (Around 160MB for the T5, and 3.7GB for the Lifedrive.)  They claim they're working on a fix.    There's a bug in the audio system.  Whenever a media file of any sort is playing and the audio portion gets quiet there's some nasty static.  It's not that the audio is covering up the static, it's only present when the audio gets quiet.  It also manifests itself between tracks in Pocket Tunes for the same reason.  The audio hardware is engaged, but there's nothing playing for a split second, so the Lifedrive fills the silence with weird static.  If PalmOne fixes this aspect of the LD, it'll be an exceptional media player.  (But use the excellent free TCPMP media player instead of the included "Media" app for video.)  I certainly prefer the flexibility of media formats and better controls to my iPod.  I've found a bug in the version of Palm Desktop that ships with the Lifedrive.  (The LD can sync with Outlook too, but I vastly prefer Palm Desktop for it's superior interface and ease of use).  If I edit or create a task that doesn't have a due date in Palm Desktop, when I finish editing it, the date gets set to "12/31/2031", which I have to manually change back to "No Date".   At least PalmOne did fix the "find" bug present in the T5 and E2 which prevented those units from returning more than 8 results in a system-wide search.  The LD frequently won't sync on my first press of the Hotsync button after connecting it to my computer.  It will try to connect, and time out.  A second press usually seems to work, but sometimes I have to unplug the USB cable from my computer before it will sync again.  I also bought a cradle for the LD, which I do recommend (the cradle that says it's for the T5 is the same as the newer cradle that specifically mentions the T5, E2, and Lifedrive).  The Lifedrive does have some "lag" compared with other PalmOS handhelds, but it's not really that bad.  Usually it adds less than 2 seconds to the load time of an app, if it hasn't been used recently and the hard drive is off (the hard drive takes about 1.8 seconds to start working when it's off). The real issue is just that there are so many weird bugs I've come across.  Just today I started getting a 15 second+ pause between loading many of my apps for no apparent reason.  Doing a soft reset (which preserves everything on the Lifedrive) fixed it, but I have no idea what caused it.  I've had tons of little things like that in the last three weeks, so I just can't recommend the unit.  Like the Tungsten T5, the Lifedrive's first button can only load the "home"/launcher/favorites application.  Thankfully that's easy to fix.  The free program "ButtonsEX" allows you to assign any program to the first button, making it just like the other three.  If PalmOne can fix the audio bug, and get the general wonkiness under control, the Lifedrive may be a wonderful unit.  As of June 2005 however, it's just too buggy to recommend.  It's a far cry from the "it just works" spirit of the PalmOS.

<Title>BAD, VERY BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT, REFURBISHING QUALITY
<Date>Mon Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my first PalmOne product. In three month Wireless chip gone dead and then my palm started to buzzing. Then I called them three times, and they gave me a service number and they told me to sent them. I paid the mail cost with insurance and sent them. In two and half weeks later I got the palm back. In the firts shot I saw that two keys, key 6 and key 7 were damaged. Moreover, LCD had scratch. It was not my new palm, it was the older one refurbished. I called them again. They offered me to give another service number. We started the process again... I am not using palm I am communicating them... Sometimes I thought I paid all money to talk them not to use a handheld in my daily activities. More important, they claimed that my palm has record sold in 2003. I registrered this Palm just on the purchase day March 26, 2005. Probably they have a record of new refurbished Palm and they are messing up.... They couldn't find my track in their database... So, is this good customer service??

<Title>Great idea, but . . . . 
<Date>Tue Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like many of the other reviewers, I found the LiveDrive not quite as perfect as it sounds.   I love that I can play videos, Audible books, and MP3s, and that it has a big screen for eReader and Mobipocket books plus lots of storage for office files.   Now for the bad news. The device ALWAYS freezes at the end of a hotsync. The FAQ on Palm's website recommends deleating all third-party software (the same third-party software that worked just fine on my Tungsten C!) and adding it back in one at a time until you find the one causing the problem. Did that. Still freezes, with or without the third-party software. I emailed customer support but never received a response, just an email asking if my problem had been solved. (If anyone at PalmOne is reading this, the answer is no.)    Also, my Mapopolis GPS runs sooooo slowly on the LifeDrive as to be useless. Again, it worked great on the Tungsten C.   Lesson learned: Always wait for the second generation. I can only hope that Palm will issue a software fix for all of these problems, soon. I plan of keeping the device, but will hang on to my old Palm to use as a GPS and backup for this one.

Then i found that windows dos not recognice the unit and now says that the internal disc of the Life Drive was reformatted and don't accept indormation. The product is so complicated to use. I erase the word to go function because when i wanted to see a document the Palm went off and reiniciates very slowly. Is there something i can do to reactivate the documents to go function?

<Title>ALMOST the best PDA ever
<Date>Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had been looking forward to buying the Lifedrive since it was reported as a rumor 6 months ago (or more).  It was basically a coin toss between a PSP and the LD. I really wanted a multimedia player and the PSP works very well as one. However, it doesn't have a hard drive, and stocking up on memory sticks would be inconvenient and expensive. Also, it only plays MPEG 4, while the LD plays pretty much anything.  The PSP is far cheaper, has wifi and a replaceable battery, but there's no browser (yet) and until the hackers get more into it, no useful 3rd party apps.  The LD, in theory, could be a mini laptop and ultimately it won.  But 24 hours after I bought it, I have decided to take it back.  The main reason: THE SCREEN. I am surprised I haven't heard more people talk about this, but it really, really sucks. Yes, it's bright and has wonderful resolution and graphics look great, but for video playback and pictures, it leaves much to be desired, mainly because of the poor viewing angle.  If you tilt the screen even a little, you begin to get the negative image/solarization that bad LCDs are infamous for. Ironically, the best viewing angle isn't even straight on - at least with my unit, I had to tilt it just a little off-axis to get the best possible image. The viewing angle uniformity is so bad, if you try closing one eye and then switch to the other, you'll see a slightly different picture (mainly in landscape mode, which is what anyone would use to watch a movie).  I wanted to love this device. Depite my other issues, if the screen had been better I'd probably keep it. This is really a shame, since LCD screens have made so much progress over the years, there doesn't seem to be a good reason why the LD doesn't have a better screen. I compared it with a PSP screen today and there is just no comparison - the PSP's screen is king - and Palm should realize that the PSP is more direct competition than they think.  Other than that, the LD does feel rather sluggish. The pauses loading apps, saving data and switching around aren't very long, but after a few minutes of use you really miss the snappy response of RAM-based PDAs. Palm made a big mistake by not having at least SOME memory built-in... caching would really improve performance.  Web browsing was very cool, but very, very slow. It took me HALF AN HOUR to sign in to a web site I routinely visit, read a few messages, look at some pics, then log onto AOL and send an email. Between the slowness of the connection, the time it takes to load web pages, the time it takes to just go 'back' and reload a previous page (hello, caching) and to actually type and email with a PDA, I could only see myself doing this in the future if there was absolutely no other way to get online.  Oh, and I crashed twice. Once using TCPMP, the other using the 'search' feature.  The LD is a great idea. It has all the right bits and the layout, even most of the excecution, is well thought-out. The sound over headphones was great and for non-video apps, the screen looks very nice. The speaker was better than expected and the unit is light and attractive.  However, a bad screen in a device that can play back video and store photos is a serious blunder. Not having even 16 megs of RAM for cache, especially when RAM is so damn cheap, is a major oversight, especially when it would have REALLY sped up performance.  It makes me sad to bring it back, because now I am back at square one - there is basically no device out there that does what I want well.  If the PSP had a hard drive and a browser, it would be perfect (and at $200, the LD wouldn't stand a chance).

<Date>Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Another beautiful example that Palm DOES NOT LISTEN to consumers. I have owned MANY palm units in my career. I have 2 needs that are paramount. 1.User changable batteries and a long battery life. 2.Flash memory that doesen't loose data. Palm has a WONDERFUL OS. Seeing patients all day and not being near a charger made me trash this. I would settle for a grayscale screen if I could change the batteries myself and have flash memory. Palm all but completely lost the medical community with its new units.   Bottom line: All the bells and whistles of this machine are worthless if the battery doesent last.

<Title>nice as "laptop lite"
<Date>Sat Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Most of the reviews seem to be from people very familiar with Palm or with using PDAs, so I figured a review from someone who hasn't had a PDA since 2001 (and that an HP Jornada) may be useful if readers are intrigued by the LifeDrive and, like me, are not sure that they really need (or want) to lug around a laptop and are looking into PDAs.  I've had this for about a month now and have been very happy with it. There have been reviewer complaints of a lag time between changing screens and yes, it happens--but I haven't found it distracting. The fact is the PDA waits far longer for us to input information than we do for a PDA to display it. I have also had occasional unexplained shut downs and restarts, but they have been infrequent.  When I got it I was expecting something the size and bulk of the Jornada, but was pleasantly surprised to find that even inside the aluminum hard case (which I recommend getting) it fit inside most of my shirt front pockets. I was also pleasantly surprised with the clarity of the screen and ease of reading; I've had no problem reading documents and pdfs on it on the train without eye strain or having to hunch over like I used to do with the Jornada. Usability of the various functions is great.  I've been trying the LifeDrive as a laptop replacement to write reports and access the Web and email while outside the office and so far it has worked pretty well in that capacity. I use the ThinkOutside Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard for typing and it's worked well and in many ways feels better than some of the ultraportable laptop keyboards I tested in stores. The two items together are much lighter than what a laptop would be and take up much less room. If mostly what you need a laptop for are Word, Excel or Powerpoint documents and not doing design (or watching DVDs, which is what I see most businesspeople with laptops doing on planes), this could substitute as long as you don't need a large screen.  Battery life is better than a laptop (but not all that much greater), and it is stupid LifeDrive isn't also a phone and camera, which is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. As someone coming back into using PDAs after a few years away, I'm very happy with it.

<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a Palm Tungsten T and it serves my PDA needs well.  I've been looking seriously at a Sony PSP.  What I really want is an updated Apple Newton, here is my recipe:  One Tapwave Zodiac (gaming but Palm compatability)  One Sony PSP (screen aspect ratio and quality, build quality, 802.11g/USB (add WPA security), and a (soon) real game library)   One Zaurus SL-C3000 (modern CPU hardware, form factor with keyboard and touchscreen (twistable), open source OS (linux or xBSD), hard drive, CF slots), real I/O)  Add iPod mini functionality and storage >= 10Gb  Add Newton HWR(inkwell?) and general Newton goodness  Add replacable AA batteries that will last a FULL day so I'm never stuck  Vendor support of an active OSS development community  MS Outlook sync for PDA functions  (my job requires it, what can I say....)  Stir to make it all cool and integrated and still be work meeting/date/wife safe  I would pay $699 tomorrow for all of this and even pay $50 a year for a software subscription for the basics.  I'm going to wait to see what Palm has to offer with the LifeDrive.  I hope that it meets a lot of the above needs.

<Title>New Era
<Date>Fri May 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The LifeDrive is the beginning of a new era in PDAs.  It is the first pda to have an integrated hard drive.  Thanks to this fact, pdas can now become true mobile media units.  If you are only going to listen to MP3 formated songs, there is no need to get an MP3 player in addition to this unit.  The integration of the PDA and the MP3 player is now beginning.  If you care about why this is took so long, read the following paragraph.  Otherwise, skip it.  Many are wondering why it took this so long to happen when the ipod has been out for years.  Well, almost the entire ipod is made up of the hard drive.  On PDAs, this space is needed for the processor, RAM, the screen, ect.  Recently, Toshiba and other companies have introduced a .85 in. 4 GB microdrive that has been small enough to fit in PDAs.  This has allowed the creation of the microdrive and will undoubtable filter down into other PDAs from both Microsoft and PalmOne.    In addition to the hard drive, PalmOne has included bluetooth, wi-fi, a  320x480 hi-resolution screen, and a 416MHz XScale processor.  Bassicly, this PDA has just about everything you could want or need.  Some may want am integrated keyboard or have other design complaints, but this is a mater of personal preference.  Now the only place left to go is to integrate a hard drive into a new design of the palmone treo.  We should probably expect to see this sometime in the 4 quarter of this year.  This would spell the integration of PDA, MP3 player, and phone, which is ultimatly where we are heading.  If you don't need an integrated phone, then this is a wonderful choice.  I however will wait on the hard drive to be brought to the PDA phones out there.

<Title>LifeDrive Should Be A Real Boost for palmOne

<Content>I think the LifeDrive is going to be a huge boost to palmOne's sales. Despite the price (which is less than an HP iPAQ 4700 series device, by the way), the power of the LifeDrive will certainly attract a lot of buyers. For instance, at $499.88 it will be less expensive than buying a Palm Tungsten device and an iPod mini, and can do pretty much the same function as both devices in one nice device.   I'm also thoroughly impressed with the built-in Bluetooth and WiFi. With the exception of the Tungsten C, palmOne's support of WiFi has been extremely weak. I sincerely look forward to seeing this device in a few weeks!

Let me comment on the main selling points I have read:  Wi fi and Bluetooth, sorry folks, HP got there first, the Ipaq 3715 has been offering this since last year.   An integrated hard drive, what is the point when you can buy 2GB SD cards (with 5GB coming soon)? Cheaper than the Ipaq 4700, yes but you do not get that gorgeous screen. Finally, as an ex-very loyal Palm user, I am sorry to say that the hardware produced by Palm in the last few years was (to put it politely) not impressive.  Just read the user comments on any of them. My advice, have a second look at the Ipaqs.

<Title>Not different enough
<Date>Mon May 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As a lifelong Palm user (ok, for a brief year I did own a Clie), I find this product nice but not nice enough. Why? Because a 4GB hard drive is simply not enough of a differentiator compared to the existing PDAs (Palm or otherwise). 2 GB Flash cards are already available and by middle of next year one will be able to add a 4 GB Flash card to any PDA. At that point this would become an oddity.  My T3 plays music and videos just fine. The only reason I carry an 15GB ipod is because of storage, and a Palm with 4GB is simply not enough reason to move particularly if I can wait for another year and just add flash to my PDA. Now if they can cram a 20-30 GB hard drive into this chassis, that becomes a whole new ballgame and palm would have an absolutely killer convergence product on their hands.

<Content>As a Palm owner since the original Pilot 1000 I have been somewhat confused by Palm's tentativeness of recent times. Probably a bit too much marketing mumbo jumbo going on back there. Feature sets are playing catch up but with tantalising possibilities. Eg I am waiting to see what eventuates from the BeOS acquistion.  The device needs a phone and camera with decent resolution, much more memory, a multitasking O/S - possibly even realtime, straight forward programability for third party apps and software to keep an event log if it really is to be a Life Partner. Great natural handwriting recognition and  voice recognition for dictation and commands would make this the world beater it should be.

<Date>Tue Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Palm Life Driver is so easy, versatile (stores files, Music,photos,memos, addresses, etc, etc, etc) and lots of memory. Don't mess it up by adding a phone. You'll want this way longer than your next phone server.

<Title>piece of junk
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Lifedrive is an absolute ripe off.  It's no wonder it cannot be purchased on the Palmone web site.  It's like having a regular pda with 64MB of storage attached to an uncooperative 4GB SD card. Most third party software doesn't recognize this space, therefore it's difficult to download directly the this extra storage and the device space limits what you can transfer there.  The moblie manager allows you to drag and drop files directly into the Lifedrive area, but then you can't find them.  It crashes often, gets hot during use, and you have to buy the sync cradle separately.  It come with a "sync cord" that causes the unit to fall or get knocked off the work station.  The "hard case" is a piece of thin,flimsy. tin with rubber on the back. The unit is slow, and difficult to work with.  It's like having dial up in your palm.  I don't know when I've been more disappointed in a product.  I'm sending my lifedrive and that worthless tin case back for a refund.

<Title>Dead as a door nail
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Used infrequently while traveling, in lieu of a laptop. Dead as a door nail in 7 months. Thankfully it's in warranty, but unfortunately all data is lost. Will likely be replaced by a reconditioned product per Palm warranty ... and that reconditioned product will only be warrantied for up to 90 days, regardless of the warranty period left on the original.   I chose Palm because of its reputation, but I'm disappointed with this product and wish I chose the iPAQ instead. After all the Palm add-ons, etc., it would have cost about the same.   I won't be purchasing another Palm product again.

<Title>Enjoying learning about features
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This PDA had so much memory and so many features, I discover something new every day.  My previous (and first) PDA was the very basic Z22.  I had no idea that a PDA could have the capability of the Lifedrive.  This really is the closest thing to carrying around a laptop.  I am enjoying all of the bells and whistles of the Lifedrive and have hit no major snags yet.

<Content>The lifedrive does everything my old 505c Palm did, and the one before that.  It also moves large files between office and home so that my briefcase is lighter.  Most of the "gee whiz" features don't set up or work as cleanly as the core Palm functions.  But I have computers that handle the gee whiz stuff on an ordinary basis.

As a doctor, resources are plentifull and the ability to have them in hand all the time is very helpfull. I tried the music player and discovered an excelent sound quality with headphones, bad with the speaker, but still better than cellphones.

<Title>like it, wouldn't give it up
<Date>Mon Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought my lifedrive back in June just prior to going on a business trip. The thought of lugging around a laptop through airports was not attractive. Before I left, I ripped two DvD's to avi files after reading the the LD would play video. I hooked it up to my mac and began dropping files on the send to handheld icon. A couple hundred family and vacation photos, about a gig of mp3s, 2 movies, a couple spreadsheets, a half a dozen docs. I set up my work ldap mail and my home wireless network and experimented with browsing. Everything worked well, movies were vieweable but not shareable, After one movie on the plane I noticed the battery gauge dropping and shifted to mp3 listening, playing video poker or solitaire  for the rest of the flight. These seemed to use less battery power and when I landed I still had 25% battery left. For the rest of the trip I continued to check email through the wireless in the hotel, surf the net checking news sites, yahoo, and doing a few searches on google, I found it very handy when traveling and performed for the most part as advertised. It did lockup a couple times but I attributed that to my sloppy pointing. A simple push of the reset rebooted it and it gave me a error message detailing what happened. Also forget surfing and listening to music at the same time. The starts and stops are way to irritating.

<Title>Good all around tool
<Date>Wed Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased this device about a month ago.  I've been playing around with it trying to figure it all out.  For the most part it works well.  As with any device it will lock up from time to time if I try to do to many things at once.  The quick buttons are not like the old palms so it takes some getting used to.  I'm happy with this product the only down side right now is it is too new so there aren't many useful accesories available.  for the most part it has tons of memory and can hold every file I've thrown at it.  The Documents to go program works well and any windows document can be trnsfered on to your palm so you can work on it on the road.  If you don't need all the things this on can do though go with the tungstun (sp?) series.  My girlfriend has it and is very happy with it, memory cards can make up the differance between the two.

<Content>The handheld is stable, beautiful, not so slow as some people say (sometimes it takes 4 or 5 seconds to open an big aplication but in average, it takes 1 or 2 seconds). The memory is an absurd: You can put all your pictures and a lot of photos. It's perfect for health students (to put books and medical softwares), businesmen, etc.  The main problem is its size: If you put it in your pocket, your pocket will become stewed and it's a little unconfortable.

<Title>What happened to PalmOne?
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using Palm devices for a long time. From the first 5000 to the T5 I've worked with almost every palmtop of theirs. I have no doubt when I say that this one is the worst palm ever. It's slow, way too complicated, freezes a lot and, the worst of all: it brings desktops problems to palm devices!!! No more smooth and fast navigation. Get ready to wait for windows and to pray for programs not to jam. The hotsync itself is outrageous. It always, and I mean ALWAYS jams the LifeDrive AND my desktop in the end of it. The online support can't explain what's happening. And I'm only using software that came with this thing. I'm sticking with my old Zire 71 with poors 16m of internal memory. My sugestion: Get the Tungsten C2 and lots of flash memory cards. You'll won't regret it.

<Title>Mega Storage but Slow...
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am a medical professional and to me, the primary use of a pda is to access medical information in a jiffy. The palm Lifedrive is a great product in terms of its storage capacity, but here are a few deficiencies that it has, particularly when it comes to its use in the healthcare industry:  1. Most medical software that are out there for the palm will run from the main memory OR, get this : from the memory card. I have been endlessly frustrated by trying to get the software that I have to run off the lifedrive. Now, if I have to buy an additional memory card for my Lifedrive, inspite of having a huge 4 Gig hard drive, that doesnt make sense.  2. The delay in accessing information stored on the hard disk is pretty evident. Although it is a barely palpable 2 seconds, it becomes irritating when, for instance, you have to run the same application again and again - like for instance, the software I use to check drug contraindications and medication side-effects.  3. The lack of a keyboard is a painful thing to me, particularly since I have been used to having one on my Tungsten C that I faithfully used for the past 2 1/2 years.  But overall, for a product innovation in the PDA field, taking into consideration that this is the first PDA on the market to incorporate a harddrive in the package, I would give it 4 stars. However, if you are a power-user, a business/medical professional, I would suggest you go back and reconsider the Tungsten C.

<Title>Innovative New PDA
<Date>Wed Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I recently purchased the Lifedrive to replace my Clie. The things that attracted me to this product were the 4 gig harddrive, the Palm OS, and the large screen.  I also purchased a Treo 650 for my daughter.  After comparing the two I have to say that if the Treo were to add a 4 gig harddrive, it would probably be a far superior piece of convergence technology.  The setup and installation of software on the Treo was fast and trouble-free.  In fact, even though I had neglected to delete the old Clie software on my computer, I had no trouble with the Treo set-up, which simply replaced and updated files as needed, and then transferred user files onto the Treo.  I then downloaded a large number of e-books and a variety of software (games, utilities) onto the Treo also with no problem.  It was remarkable how fast the installation went.  It took only a couple of minutes to install about 76 e-books.  I had the whole thing set up within an hour.    By contrast, the Lifedrive setup and installation was very buggy.  First of all, it's not directly compatible with other Palm devices.  Before installing the Lifedrive software, it's essential that you uninstall Palm Desktop and HotSync from previous PDA's.  The Lifedrive version of these programs is different.  Installing it over the top of an already existing version renders it unusable.  The Lifedrive setup doesn't give you an option to install in a different directory either.  It automatically installs where it thinks it should be.  In fact, I couldn't get it to stop installing in the old Clie folder until I manually deleted everything having to do with Clie on my computer.  After deleting all old Palm and Clie files, I was still unable to reinstall Lifedrive until I replaced a couple dll's. I did finally get it running as it should, though I was disappointed that it hadn't been possible to automatically transfer user files from my old Palm Desktop to the Lifedrive because of the incompatibility issues.  After that I started adding utilities, games and e-books.  Unlike the Treo, installations were very sluggish on the Lifedrive.  I was able to speed it up by customizing the installation process so that it only added the specific things I wanted.  Even so, the process was significantly slower than the Treo partly because the Lifedrive had trouble handling multiple simultaneous installs.  Due to the number of glitches during set-up, it took a couple of days to complete it.    Over the past month, I have noticed that Lifedrive tends to shutdown and reboot at odd moments. The reboot is so interminably slow I thought at first the Lifedrive was freezing.  There are also significant lag times when switching between applications. Besides that, applications run very slowly compared to my daughter's Treo...they're even a little sluggish compared to my old Clie.  Part of the problem is that the Lifedrive has no actual RAM.  Instead it uses a part of the harddrive to simulate RAM.    Like other users, I'm a little disappointed as well that the Lifedrive has no keyboard or camera.  The Lifedrive does let you easily reassign buttons.  Still, I really miss the "back" button on my old Clie. The Lifedrive is also a little thicker than most PDA's making it too large to fit comfortably in a pocket, though I've had no trouble carrying it in a purse.  As for the price, I consider it a good deal considering the current cost of a 4 gig memory card.  In fact, it has so much internal memory, I haven't even bothered to purchase a separate memory card yet. As with most PDA's (including the Treo), the battery life is too short.  I fixed this by purchasing an external power accessory.    Despite some negative comments above, I do really like the Lifedrive and I use it extensively.  I think it's a significant step forward in convergence technology.  The fewer pieces of hardware I have to carry around the better.  Lifedrive would be vastly improved though if Palm were to give it some actual RAM, fixed some installation and compatibility issues, and added a keyboard and camera.  Better yet, add a 4 gig harddrive to the Treo!

<Title>Do not buy this unit - Many problems
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Like many others, I am profoundly disappointed with Palm's latest release, the Life Drive Mobile Manager. There are many positive reviews posted here, but the majority of them are from users who are relatively new to the Palm PDA line.  As a power user, and having owned nearly every model they released, I can say with confidence that if you are a power user, you will be returning this unit within two weeks. The majority of the third party apps that I used to use are not compatible with it and that causes fatal errors and random soft resets. When the app is uninstalled, the error stops, but because the unit boots off of the hard drive memory and not flash memory as all previous models did, a soft reset takes approximately TWO MINUTES 16 SECONDS from start to being ready to use again. It is unbelievable. You should really drive down to play with one to look at the lag time BEFORE you order it here at Amazon. I promise you - it will be time well spent.  The power switch on the top of it is a slider that is made of plastic, looks very cheap and I'm guessing will last maybe 3 or 4 months tops before it needs to be replaced.  If you are thinking of buying this for watching videos and playing MP3s or as a replacement for your iPOD, keep your iPOD. Sometimes I wish Apple would buy Palm. Maybe then we'd start seeing some quality.  No cradle - a flimsy breakaway  plugin to charge it. The hard case looks sexy and sleek, but you will soon tire of having to pry it open several times a day with your thumbnail. And if you don't have any thumbnails, you're out of luck. Don't get the hard case or you'll never be able to open it.  Overall a big disappointment for me. I made the mistake of selling my T3 and putting the proceeds toward the LifeDrive. I still have time to return it - and I likely will - but am having a huge problem trying to decide what to downgrade to from the LifeDrive.  T5 didn't get much better reviews and T3 is a few years old now...  If you absolutely MUST buy this unit, please wait until the LifeDrive 2 and LifeDrive 3 come out later this year or in early 2006. Remember the T, T2 and T3? My guess is the same thing is going to happen to this one. They would have saved themselves a lot of headaches if they waited until it was ready to be released as a quality product.  Now I don't know what the heck to buy to replace it. T5 maybe, but still nothing compares to the T3 thus far.  The only good thing the LifeDrive has going for it is a lot of storage and internal WiFi; HOWEVER, the version of wifi they chose to install is the slow version - it crawls; and I have no idea what all the fuss is about people being able to use this as a 4GB USB drive.  Yes, it works as an external drive. It's slow but it works. Big Hooey. Go down and get yourself a 1 GB USB flash RAM drive (tiny) if you want that level of portability. For me as a longtime Palm user, the ability to use this as an external drive is NOT a huge deal. I've been using USB flash drives for years to do what this does.  Perhaps the biggest annoyance - and primarily the reason why I am returning the unit - is the lag time switching between apps. You click the stylus on an app and since it is no longer booting from the flash drive, there is a two second noticable lag time before the app launches. It's ridiculous. They say that putting a hard drive in a PDA is an achievement that will allow for a great deal of things to come.  It would be. If they had left the unit booting to flash ram and used the 4 GB for storage only. Big mistake. Bad Developer. No cookie for you.  This crashes as often as a PocketPC, but it is much slower. That's the best way I can describe it.  Hope this helps!  Adam Boettiger  UPDATE: 22 AUG 2005 - Wanted to add a post script to this to let readers know that I did in fact return the LifeDrive to the store and purchased the Tungsten T5 and some accessories instead. While the T5 is not everything I want in a PDA, in my opinion it is the best unit Palm has on the market - primarily because it has fewer problems than the LifeDrive.  After setting it up last week, I've had no problems with the T5 since. As a longtime Palm user, it was nice to see the zippy flash drive again, with no two-second delays in switching between apps, no Fatal Exception errors, etc. It just worked.  If you must upgrade now, buy the T5. If you can wait 4-6 months, hold out for the OS 6 devices due out in Q1 or Q2 of 2006. You'll probably be glad you did.  Hope this was useful.  Adam Boettiger

<Content>If you are a "newbie" Palm user who never installs 3rd party software and who uses only basic stuff, you might like the LifeDrive [but then you might not need one].  If you are a "sophisticated" Palm user, then you will soon find out that the LifeDrive has way too many serious problems which interfere with using it.

<Title>Nice for a first harddrive PDA
<Date>Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Palmone LifeDrive is certainly the best PDA on the market right now.  I won't list the feature set.  Check above for that.  The features I really like in comparison to my previous PDA, a Palm T2, are:  - Web and Email via WiFi  - Web and Email via Bluetooth (to a supporting computer or mobile phone) - file transfer ability via either virual drive or LifeDrive manager  What I do not like about the LifeDrive: - weird connection cable, not nice like the dock of my T2 - weird power cable  I will venture that these cables do not have the durability of previous Palm docking stands.  They definitely do not have the elegance and leave loose cables on your desktop for synchronization and recharging.  However, you can sync via WiFi or Bluetooth to avoid part of the problem.  Lastly, the battery life is less than desirable.  My old T2 had way less functionality so I probably didn't use it as many hours in the day as my new LifeDrive.  However, I never remember having it run out of charge in use.  A couple of visits to the dock for sync in the day for several minutes was usually enough to keep it going.  I would leave it on for most of the day if I noticed the battery below half charged which was way less than once per week.  I have to plug in my LifeDrive and leave it there for a while a couple of times per day just to make it through the day.  An well-designed docking station would make this less painful.  Maybe one will come with time.

<Title>Exceptional start to a new concept for Palm
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After much consideration of the many reviews online about the Life Drive I took the plunge. My choice came down to the TX and the Life Drive. I chose the Life Drive for it's integrated 4GB (3.85 usable) hard drive. That translates into little less then 40x the usable storage space of the TX. It's been widely reported that the Life Drive is much slower, bulkier, and prone to inconvenient crashes and unreliability. However, as with any new product there are bugs and then there are fixes. Palm as released significant fixes to address these problems. All I have to say is, I am glad I waited. I got mine online for less then $240 plus shipping. For that price it was a terrific deal. I don't think I would feel that way had I paid the full $499 or even the new price of $399. For what its worth, the Life Drive is slower then the previous Palms but that's to be expected with a 4 Gig hard drive that has to spin up. I've owned the Handsprings Visor in the past so I am familiar with Palm Handhelds.I've experienced application launch lags from a fraction of a second to up to 2 seconds at most. It's still much faster then any PC. This thing is my do everything on the go device. I LOVE IT! Both it's WiFi and Bluetooth are incredibly fast on my wireless network.  I have to say that the Life Drive not only does everything, it does it very well. I note that some third party applications occasionally cause soft resets. Data has never been lost, and none of the applications that came with Palm have ever rest the unit, only the apps I've added. The touch screen is colorful, bright and beautiful to behold. The batteries last about 5-6 hours with the screen set to its dimmest (Still ample backlighting).I give it 4 stars only because every new concept has room for improvement, the Life Drive is a very good start.  I'd like to see a 8GB or more, Compact Flash in place of the Micro Hard Disk for speed and integrated TOMTOM GPS! Lets upgrade the battery to 2300mAh instead of 1600mAh and make it user replacable. Then we would have perfection! Then it would be worth paying $499 or more.

<Title>One point no one has mentioned
<Date>Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>One of the big hype items for the LifeDrive is as a storage place for digital photo's on vacation, so you don't have to take your laptop - note it doesn't take a compact flash card. It only supports SD, SDIO and MultiMediaCards. I called Palm and the only other way to download photo's into the LifeDrive is thru your computer - defeating the purpose.  Also, the amount of extra time and software upgrades is a pain. Many of the features listed, you have to subscribe to and even then aren't user friendly. Audible is one example, another is the Pocket Tunes.   And with all that memory - when I try to view the slide show example under "media" with the preloaded sample photo's - it won't - it displays the error message - "not enough memory to perform this task".  Also, no cradle - very tacky for the price. And the $30 leather case looks just like blue/cheap vinyl to me.  It could be great, but just isn't yet...I'm a technology lover and am bummed. This new business tool/toy will be going back to the store.

<Date>Fri Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The device provides a lot of flexibility not only with regard to the standard haldheld features such as: calendar, to do, notes, e-mail, etc, but with regard to its ability to connect via wi-fi to wireless networks (it works great in this regard).  The drive mode is a great tool since you can avoid to take your laptop with you while taking all your important files with you. I have been connected with several desktops as an external storage device and the access speed is high. You can not even realize that you are accessing an external unit.  The only negative comment I would have is regarding the access speed to the harddrive. It always takes a while to get there.

<Title>awful- don't buy this.
<Date>Sat Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>have owned many palms. Decided to upgrade my m515 as battery life is getting short. Thought I could play music at work off of this as well, avoiding purchasing an ipod. This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made. Was very relieved to read Amazon and find most people hated it. (wish I had done so earlier before plunking down $500). Unlike earlier palms, it doesnt just "go"- you have to be connected to your computer to add any files. It won't recognize ipod (AAC) files. It will only hold 300 songs. And the hard drive is slow and keeps shutting off. Worse, my computer intermittently won't recognize the device. This will NOT replace your laptop on the road. Its slow function makes it unsuited for such use on the road or at work (am in medicine). While I am not sure any handheld will live up to hype, this one is particularly bad. Think I will downgrade to a palm m515 equivalent and cannot wait to return this- I want the last 6 hours of my life back, that I wasted on this way overpriced, substandard piece of equipment. If i had paid 1/5 the price I would still feel way cheated.

<Title>Just not worth it
<Date>Sun Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ive had my LD for 3 weeks now and just cant find a good reason to feel like my $500 was well spent. Im not an experiened PALM OS user, so just starting up, getting updated software, figuring out the how to HotSync and how to store what to which of the 3 memory locations war real frustrating for a few days. I really only wanted some music/video portability and good Chinese language translation software (PLECO DICTIONARY, which was only available on PALM until a few days ago...) But after 3 weeks, Ive had all kinds of trouble and I just dont know what to attribute the probs to. Many LD have shipped with bad WIFI, so these needed to be replaced. My WIFI was real poor too, but i didnt really know if it was my LD, LDs in general, or the the WIFI systems I was trying to connect to. In my classroom, everyone with notebooks (Mac and PC) could acces the WIFI, but not me. Uhhgg.... Also, my LD screen just started buzzing yesterday and wont stop. I read that other LD uers are having the same prob. THis is real annoying in that its a high pitch and can be heard when the LD is just sitting on my desk under normal noise conditions. Its driving me crazy. Additionally, my HotSync seems to get locked up a lot. Other issues: yes, accessing the hard drive is a little slow and will cause small skips when simultaneously playing music. The 4 plactic buttons on the face of the LD could easily be pulled off by a fingernail or thin piece of plastic or metal. The built-in speakers cannot handle very much volume so are more or less a waste of space. Finally, you will be frustrated about the lack of add-ons for the LD at this time, but Im sure that will slowly change.    GOOD stuff: Hard drive capacity (4Gig) is fine, and should easily hold 800-1000 MP3s (BUT it doesnt recognize WMAs out of the box!!!!!). Plus you can use your SD cards. Most PALM OS apps are easy to use, though not quite as intuitive as Windows apps have become. PALMs can carry and manipulate MS Office files, but not very thoroughly.  Bottom line: Im returning my LD today. Just not worth $500. Period. Maybe give it 3 stars if was $250.

<Content>I was afraid that this was a gadget that wouldn't live up to expectations but it truly shines. I finally have all of my contacts, documents, and databases (thanks to Filemaker) in my pocket. Even family photos and an episode of Seinfeld are there when I need them. The WiFi connects flawlessly to the internet at work, home, or at the many free hotspots popping up around the country. Bluetooth synching works great with my Powerbook. The display is beautiful and you have a choice of hand writing recognition or typing on a keyboard on the screen in qwerty style or alphabetical. If you're interested in this type of device than the LifeDrive is the way to go!

<Content>If you are used to machines that respond faster than thought, one minute bedtime stories and 2 minute microwave meals every day, then no, you will not like the LifeDrive. Wake up people! You have been watching too many futuristic movies.  Yes, it has a bit of a lag time, and yes I had to reboot and reinstall several times when I first got it. Guess what? Problems were due to my PC and my own stupidity in setting the thing up. Now it works great!  I can listen to music for hours, run my favorite programs, and keep up with my life. My T3's screen died just after the warranty was up, and I had no money to replace it, so I had to go back to a paper planner for nearly a year. Not fun, believe me! I am overjoyed to have a Palm again.  One wish: better encryption of data without choking on larger files.

<Date>Sat Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, first, I do not want all my data in my cell phone since my cell phone goes places which are dangerous and my PDA does not (mountain hiking, kayaking, etc.)  Also, I want my cell phone to remain small and light. I chose the LifeDrive for its storage and functions of external documents, email, WIFI - all the "mini computer" functions I like to have without carrying a laptop.  And I love my LifeDrive.  It has functioned great, handles document transfers great, music, internet, you name it.  Yes, I've had a Palm PDA since 1997 and hung on it for dear life all these years but I also did my homework of reviewing all the new products (PDAs and cell phones), and talking to users of those products, from doctors, casual users, to just plain geek heads. The LifeDrive came out on top in all those conversations and not just for the 4G size.  And I've been happy with mine, it has done all it said it would.  I've been thrilled to download GEO CACHING documents and have a larger screen to view them as i bush-whack through the woods, "big screen" photographs to show friends from my trips, my work and personal WORD and EXCEL documents to work on where ever I want to be, not to mention the eReader books! This PDA has been a wonderful addition to my electronic arsenal and I now can not imagine making a move without it by me (except on those mountain tops....)

<Content>This is a very serious expansion of the PDA concept.  Not only is the memory expanded, but there is also a great expansion of functions.    Naturally there must also be an expansion of learning requirements for the user.  The LifeDrive is not nearly as easy to use as the Palm Zire.    Ah, but the rewards for mastery of the LifeDrive are immense for a creative person who must travel lite.  You will love this little pocket sized wonder.  You will just love it - until  next year when something better comes along.

<Content>This is my third Palm product, after first using the Palm III and the Palm M515 over the past six years.  Very disappoinging.  It crashes frequently and needs hard resets once or twice a week.  This never happened on my ealier Palms nor on my wife's Palm.  Some of the features are good, such as a very readable screen.  However, the hassle factor of having to reset the hard drive, which takes sevearl minutes to reboot, make it sluggish and unappealing.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Palm has finally created its Edsel...
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had several Palm products over the past 6 years: the m505 (yikes!), the Zire 71 (LOVED IT!!!!) and the Death/LifeDrive.  I didn't even stop using my Zire 71 after purchasing the LifeDrive because it still worked a lot better for most applications; I stopped using it only because I cracked the screen about 8 months ago.  My first LifeDrive lasted practically 1 year to the day and the screen gave out on me.    Tried everything: digitizing with a screen protector, without one, cleaning the screen, hard resets, soft resets.  So, since I didn't purchase the extended warantee from Palm, I was out of luck when it died.  I bit the bullet and bought another one JUST THIS HALLOWEEN...and tonight, the screen died again.  I kept that baby in an aluminum bubble and it still died!  So, tomorrow I'm taking it back to Best Buy and getting a T/X...it seems a lot more to my liking...and the screen and casing looks a bit more hardy than the LifeDrive (which weighs a boatload, BTW).  I work in healthcare as an E.R. nurse and I need my Palm for everything...the LifeDrive just doesn't cut it.  Palm, cut your losses and stop selling this sucker!!!!

Palm killed handhelds basically a long time ago & keeps driving the spike into the coffin with this one.  Handsprings were so much more solid & worked alot better. Huge corporations like Palm ruined the industry unfortunately with their non-existent technical support and lack of updates & cross functionality with phones & computers.

<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The hype "revolutionary" and "new in its kind"  sourrounding lifedrive launch truly put me in the enthusiast mood I would not miss my old Tungsten E, however after some days dealing with frecuent crashes, I missed the reliable OS the others models have.   Palm made a big fault rushing to release a not so fine tuned device in compliance to third applications in the market, even Lifedrive works well with its built-in apps, it's gloomy for a intermediate/advanced user of PDA to deprive the scope of applications to essentials or taking risky bets that the new apps you choose will get along with the new Lifedrive OS.  Getting a lifedrive will make you feel as the owner of a bulky mp3 player, and odd portable storage device and a weak PDA. If you enjoy taking advantage of your PDA as a productivity enhancer and spare time improvement using third applications I would recommend you to replace the lifedrive capabilities you are looking for pointing your choice to a Tungsten TX that has a much faster and reliable OS, an ipod with a cooler look and a digital voice recorder.

<Title>Decent unit - until the unit freezes
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using a Lifedrive (LD) for about 12 months. A friend of mine gave me his in November, 2005.  I previously had used a Palm T|C, and before that I had a Palm 72, and then I had a Handspring Visor.  Note:  both the T|C and the 72 are still operational years after purchase.  So, I have been a Palm (and related products) user for approximately 7-8 years.  So I am an experienced Palm user.  My main complaint with the LD is that the unit unexpectedly froze up.  It froze up during the hard reset process and will not turn off unless/until the battery drains.    Pros: 1) a lot of storage 2) rotating screen was particularly great for watching videos 3) converting files for viewing on LD was a pretty straightforward process for someone who has some interest/experience with .avi and .mpg files 4) good audio quality both with headphones and using the speaker 5) decent browsing experience, and wifi is adequate  Cons: 1) My unit did not last beyond 18 months total.  Which is unacceptable for a unit of this price, IMO. 2) very slow operation, especially when the LD recovers from a hard/soft reset 3) somewhat heavy when considering other PDAs - tho this isn't a serious con  In summary, I would give this a 4 star rating if the LD was built to last.  Given it's serious system problems, I'm pretty disappointed in this Palm product.  Please note and a warning to all new purchasers:  for the reviews from people who have had the Lifedrive a short period of time, I liked my lifedrive for several months.  It just did not last a long as I feel a PDA of this price should last.

<Title>Great device and media player for kids
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my Lifedrive for my birthday and I love it. Not only can I store all my office documents (more on this later) but I can surf the web (though without pictures-which makes it lose a star) at any wi-fi hot spot, maintain my phone numbers and addresses, play games, and most importantly watch movies. As long as you rip a DVD or media file into an AVI, MPEG, WMV, or some versatile format, the included software will convert the file to the LifeDrive's native file format and compress it's file size. 4GB doesn't sound like a lot but I have over 5 hours of various videos for my child on the drive and it's not full. This device was a lifesaver when my family flew from Germany to the states and we needed to keep my child entertained. I ripped some Elmo and threw it on the Lifedrive and it made the trip more tolerable with less screaming. Last point: For MS Office documents, it will open any MS office file (powerpoint, excel or word) but password protected office documents will not open unless you pay for an upgrade. A bit tacky I thought, so I give it 4 out of 5 stars. GREAT PRODUCT AND I AM VERY MUCH A TECH CRITIC!!!

<Title>No Goodwill
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned the lifedrive for about 1 year.  During this time it worked well and I enjoyed owning it.  Prior to owning it I've owned other PDA's. I use my PDA everyday, and can not get by without it.  The PDA recently stopped being able to hold a charge.  Changing the battery did not resolve the problem.  The cost to have Palm take a look at the PDA is about $185 (including the cost of shipping).  According to the Palm website this is a generic fee that they charge for any problem.  Palm had a discussion board on their website for Lifedrive owners.  I never posted to it, but I read the posts in hopes of finding a solution to the problem I was having with my PDA Lifedrive.  There were posts from many users that had purchased the lifedrive in mid to late 2005 and 12 +/- months later were all having the same problem with the unit ceasing to work.  Many people paid the $185 and received a refurbished PDA.  Many people weren't pleased that they weren't told in advance that they would not receive there original machine back.  Many were displeased with the cost of repairing the PDA.  The biggest overall complaint from people that had their PDA repaired, replaced, refurbished was that it broke again within 3 months +/-.  Other people found that if they took the unit apart and unplugged the battery, the unit would then work for a few days, weeks or a month.  Unfortunately Palm took down their discussion board with all their customer complaints (approximately the middle of December 2006) and has replaced it with a message that they will have a new and improved website in January 2007.  Some tech gurus have told me that it is possible that there is some kind of timer on the motherboard that after 12 +/- months has gone off and is purposely draining the battery making the unit useless.  I can't believe that this is true.  At the same time I can't understand why Palm isn't standing behind their product and risking all the Goodwill that the Palm brand has built over many years.  Currently my unit is being evaluated at a PDA repair company I found on the internet.  If they can get the unit working I will enjoy using it again.  If it is not feasible to fix my lifedrive I will definitely buy another PDA; just not from Palm.  READ THE COMMENTS BELOW FOR THE LATEST UPDATE ON GETTING MY PDA FIXED...

<Title>Amazing hardware, but very deffective software
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the LifeDrive to replace a Toshiba PocketPC.  The hardware spec of the lifedrive are you amazing. Display quality is awesome, even video can be seen with excellent refresh rates and resolution quality. Storage capacity is just amazing for a mobile device. I was able to store all my work documents, and most of my pictures and videos on it. Though it is a little bit bigger than most PDA's, the lifedrive can hold up must of your digital information.  However, when it comes to software, are is a lot to improve for this device. I'll give you some examples of what has happened to me:  1. Opening some Word documents that contain images can lead the device to crash and reset itself. 2. Refreshing available wireless networks doesn't work very good. You have to turn off the wireless connection, activate it again and then run a scan so you can get a realible listing of the available wi-fi networks. 3. Battery runs out of life very fast. 4. Letter recognition is very poor. You'd better get used to write very slow, because when you add speed to your writting, letter recognition will start doing very weird things, like thinking an "a" is a space or a "q".  When a PocketPC manufacturer produces a PocketPC with the hardware specs of the lifedrive, it will definitively beat Palm's Mobile Manager with a tremendous margin.

<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is our third palm pilot and it kicks ass! Four gig's of memory and the wireless card is the highlight of it. The internet is pretty fast, so if you are located not too far from the source your connection will be super fast. Plus it has java script so you will see all the pics. The built in digital recorder, the ability to play MP3's and videos are also great features. The size and weight were not a problem - it is barely noticeable and we got used to it quickly. The down side is that it takes a while to load the applications or to switch from one to another. Palm does not provide a cradle in which to sync the palm, instead they give you a USB cable which we're always afraid will break. What we loved about our old Tungsten T3 was that the screen could expand but not so here. Overall, we give 4.7 stars to this awesome Lifedrive. We ddefinitely recommend buying it.

<Title>Life Drive has problems
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had to return my first Life Drive.  Frequently it would not shut off, it reset itself frequently, and it froze frequently.  The second unit was much better, but I found if I used VersaMail to synchronize my email the unit would freeze and occaisionally not shut off.  After I disabled VersaMail synchronization most of the problems went away.  I've only had one or two resets in a month of operation.  I think VersMail may be at the root of the LifeDrive's software problems. The unit does have some very nice features like file synchronization and a look ahead at To Do's and appointments. But, I wish I had more confidence in its dependability. And I wish it was multitasking, although when you leave an application to go to another, then open the first application again, it starts where you left off.

<Content>Purchased 2 of these to replace our m515s which have been rock solid GREAT over the last few years.  We have been using Palms for just under 10 years for business; the added shortage of the LifeDrive was a real selling point for our work.  But alas newer is not always better.  We have been unable to get the Palm remote keyboards to work at all - period - despite calls to Palm techs who just do not seem to know what to do other than to tell us to do a hard reboot (losing all data) and reinstall the software - but the keyboards still do not work; they both just crash.  One of these Palms crashed all together and would not power-on even if you hot-wired it (just kidding) and it had to be replaced, which Palm did in about 10 days after i sent in the broken one. Watch out for the 90 day support limit!!!  But the new one still crashes for unknown reasons - answer - it seems to work as long as you do not add any other software, including the software Palm provided like Documents-to-Go. We are back to the m515s and will look elsewhere for future needs. I am sick - not only for the loss of $ but i really did like Palm and this new LiveDrive sounded so good - if it only worked.

The Built in wi-fi works very good and the blazer browser is a good companion. You can actually see images. I already used Versamail and it seems just fine too. My only complains from this unit are:  1.Low battery life. When I'm using Wi-fi the battery starts to drop Very fast. 2. Sometimes it's unstable and crashes. (Not Too Often).  Anyhow, I give it 4.5 Stars as it has got awesome features like: -Good quality Video Playing. -Very good sound via headphones. -Hold button for safe music playback. -The screen can be turned off for saving battery while listening to music. -Nice Voice Recording. (Lots of space for that) -Good Looks. -VERY easy access to files with (included) LifeDrive Manager Software. -Excellent Software for surfing the web (included). -It comes with a decent carrying case. -And Of Course: The spacious 4gb Hard drive never seen on a palm.

<Title>Not good playing music
<Date>Thu Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I will only refer to the Music Playback trouble I encountered with the Lifedrive.  I owned a Sony CliNX70V before the Lifedrive. When I heard there was a device with 4 GB and a 416 MHz processor I thought I should have it, so I sold my Cliand bought the Lifedrive.  First of all, I think the Lifedrive should come with a faster processor because everytime you open any program, it causes a delay of a couple of seconds, which is very annoying. But that, I can handle.  What I cannot handle is the interruptions it causes to music playing while navigating through other applications (this never happened on the Cli.  I don't know if this happens only with the Pocket Tunes 3.0.9 program (included with the Lifedrive) or with every other player, but I think that if this is the one included with the device it should play flawlessly.  When you are working, let's say on Docs To Go and are listening to music at the same time, every time you access a file or save a file, the music momentarily stops and then continues, which is really annoying.  This, not only happens with Docs To Go, but with EVERY other application (including even the Calculator or the Calendar), and it also happens when switching between applications.  As a recommendation I think it will be better to wait until PalmOne releases a Lifedrive with a faster processor, because I think the 416 MHz they included are not doing the job.

It looks very nice, it feels sturdy and well made; except for the charging, and syc cable, very flimsy, as well as on the palm itself.They should it build it with a better  plug in.

The worst is that when you are ready to load you other palm software (even if it's already Ok for the OS, the unit will crash.

Do not buy it for the memory 4 gb, get a T5, or the TX (new one this week, and way better,with WIFI,and Btooth,faster -even though slower chip? or purchase an sd card for extra storage.

<Title>Excellent
<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I use the LifeDrive for medicine and have been very happy.  The other reviews are correct in that there is a small 1-2 second delay when you stylet in a command (minor problem).  Other than that the memory and function are outstanding.  I was initially dissapointed when I could not easily find a T3 replacement and was a little worried about some of the reviews but I have been very happy and have had no real problems.  I love the cradle-less feature.

<Title>Very unstable device 
<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, I bought it as my first palm device very excited because everything it was supposed to do. And finally after trying everything and consulting with forums over the Internet I have to say it's a very unstable device. It resets all the time and for no reason, no matter what soft you are running... Besides this, that it's already a non-purchase recomendation, it has a poor battery life if you use wifi, and if you don't use it, it has a poor performance too... Don't believe when people tells you the unstability of the device is cause of the soft you are running. It crashes no matter what you are running, and anyway is not the idea that you have to be studying what soft you install in your device. I am very dissapointed with this device and I don't recommend to buy it.

<Title>4GB insufficient hard drive, poor customer svc, short battery life
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>... I loved the idea of the LifeDrive. But I also have a cell phone, Palm Z22, and an iPod - and I have to tell you honestly the LifeDrive is the worst of the four products. I wanted something that would do it all except replace my cell phone (which I adore).  I needed something I could have my entire calendar & address book on, store over 500 photos, keep track of notes & tasks, and try Wi-Fi. So about 7 months ago I bought the LifeDrive.  The dislikes far outweigh the likes.  Dislikes: -The iPod's memory for photos and music makes the LifeDrive's 4GB a joke.  I can't be carrying memory sticks around everywhere either.  -Overpriced at $399 compared to getting 80GB memory on my iPod for $330 which has a calendar, but can't do wi-fi or Palm-organizing. -Slow as molasses Wi-fi -Poor battery life -Freezes for no reason -Lousy disgraceful customer service, no email contacts from Palm, no one to answer questions. Very disappointed there.  Likes: -As always, Palm has  great calendaring. You can't beat their calendaring system. -Love the voice recorder -Wi-fi is wonderful to at least have even if it is slow. I can get into email during meetings and send emails with documents to business associates.

<Content>I would have liked it to be thinner and lighter, also easier to use- For example, I was used having  quick notes for things to do and appointments separately-also yearly reminders in a separate list-  Contacts are cumbersome to put in- and display only one thing-either phone # or email initially- emails cannot be deleted by "selecting all"- have to be done one at a time- Does not give you enough space to make notes- such as directions to a person's house under the info-etc or store hours for  the business-  Love the color display and the ability to "sync" with bluetooth technnology- In addition to online, I would have preferred a written owner's manual as well- Overpriced for what it does-

<Title>Useless product
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this from a retailer on Amazon as a factory refurbised unit (I wonder which factory).  Worked for about 2 months after which it stopped working al together.  battery is OK though, nothing else works.  Be careful from whom you buy this from.  There are lots of merchants waiting to make a quick buck out of trusting buyers like us.  Tried contacting them, but no reply till date.      And remember Palmone does not give service that easily.  They charge $25 for every telephone call (if out of waranty) and 129$ starting fee for repair service out of warranty.  And their products are made in China, so you can gurantee that you are going to end up in some problem or the other.  Nice way to make a tidy profit

<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I bought my Palm LifeDrive, I have two requirements: 1) be able to synchronize calendar, contacts, tasks (to do list), notes with Outlook.  2) Have an offline drive that allows easy backup/restore of files on my notebook.  Palm LifeDrive satisfied these two requirements completely.  In addition, I am able use it as an MP3 player, connect via wi-fi to my e-mail account, read PDF files, view photos and videos.  One complaint.  Sometimes Versamail causes a reboot of the device when choosing the application on the menu. I have not been able to troubleshoot why, nor have the time to investigate.  On the other hand, it might be possible that 4GB will not be enough for all my future storage needs.

The sceen is sharp and noticeably superior to the Tungsten I previously used. Definately larger than most Palms, the storage case provided is useless.

<Title>Best PDA I've ever owned! And I've owned a few...
<Date>Sun Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is by far the best PDA I've ever owned. I've owned the original Palm Pilot; then a HandSpring Visor; then a Palm Zire.  I tell people I'm disappointed in it - which is true - because it wasn't as blazingly fast as I expected: at 416 mHz, I expected lightning-quick response (being used to 1mHz and 8 mHz and 16 mHz from my previous models). The speed is disappointing, but it is still faster than the older models I had.  The best part is the built-in 4 GB hard drive. I use a mapping solution from Delorme. With my other PDA models, I was limited to the PDA's built-in memory. With the LifeDrive's hard drive, I have all of northwest Indiana (and Chicago) on the LifeDrive, with gobs and gobs of room to spare. The same way with eBooks: I can hold a vast number of eBooks on the unit.  I also love the wireless component. Although I do all of my emailing from my desktop Macintosh G5, it is nice to quickly check whether or not I have any urgent email, using the LifeDrive.   This display is crisp and fantastic. The large size of the display, along with the ability to change portrait/landscape orientation at the click of the button, is nice.  My only grievance is the lack of a built-in camera. But nothing is perfect, right? It does have a voice-memo recorder, which none of my prior PDAs had.  I've been waiting for Apple to come out with a full-blown iPod that is a PDA (like their old Newton). I can't wait forever, so I bought the LifeDrive. No regrets at all.

<Title>Good for some things, but needs work!
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned my LifeDrive for a week now, and this is my experience.  I reinstalled everything from scratch, as I'd heard about software incompatibitity problems causing crashes and have been fairly careful to have the latest versions of things, though I suppose there's a few Exceptions!  Pros. 1. Heaps of Storage - really good for playing avi movies or mp3s on the 1 hour train trip to work. I can carry quite a few movies and several hours of music, and still have plenty of room for other stuff. I even use it as a small protable HDD for taking things to and from work. 2. The screen is great. 3. Love the Wi-Fi, though I wonder how much better 802.11g would be. 4. Video Playback flawless from the HDD, using TCPMP. 5. Good quality audio playback (provided you don't use it for anything else whilst playing music!)  Cons. 1. Regular crashes - I expect 3 or 4 a day, with about 4 minutes to reboot after each. Crashes normally happen when launching or exiting software and I get at least one a day at the end of a hotsync - I've never had one whilst playing a video or listening to music (provided I'm not switching applications) 2. If you try listening to music whilst doing anything else, particularly launching apps or having alarms pop up, you get severe stuttering. I even tried moving the music off to my SD card, but that hasn't helped much. 3. If the HDD has powered down, it can take up to 15 (average about 3-5 seconds) seconds to launch apps - I'm used to almost instant with my old T3.  Overall, I think it's more positive than negative, however I think it could have done with 64 MB NVRAM for running the OS and apps, something like the T5 setup, maybe. I think at the moment, it's like your computer, loads everything into Volatile RAM from the HDD. Then they could have just used the HDD as a big SD card. I hope they're going to release an update to deal with the crashes!  Given my time again, I think I might have gone for a TX with a 2GB SD card or two!

<Title>Best PALM yet
<Date>Tue Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had a few problems with this at first when setting it up, resets, freezes and such, until I figured out it was the software I was installing which turned out not to be compatable with the new LifeDrive OS, after that, I only installed a couple of apps that I really needed or wanted that were compatable and have not had any problems with it since. No freezes or resets. By far, this is the best Palm to come out yet, before seeing this online, I was planning to purchase a notebook computer, but now, I am not even considering it, this totally replaces my need for a notebook. I also bought a wireless keyboard for it and a car charger, for when I am away from home and use the wifi to access the internet or use my keyboard alot. I can say, all the complaints I read from others saying it crashes, resets or freezes alot, or is slow, I have not noticed any of this on mine. I would say any problems other have had stems from incompatable software installs.

<Title>Think of it as a tiny laptop from 10 years ago
<Date>Fri Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the lifeline instead of a lighter, smaller and cheaper PDA so I could actually make changes in Powerpoint presentations on it. I can also go onto the internet wirelessly while traveling. I use the bluetooth function to sync, eliminating one cord from my computer.   This machine is like a tiny, tiny laptop from the 1990's. Like those older laptops, it tends to freeze and crash when the software applications are first installed and being tweeked, or if they take too much memory.   It can be used while traveling instead of a laptop, if you don't mind some crashes, and if you can stand reading all your e-mail from a tiny screen.  I have had this for a month and still find the music functions to be very difficult to use. The new graffiti is not an improvement. The i and t's tend to miswrite. It is much heavier and thicker than my last PDA, which makes it irritating to carry in a labcoat.  But, I would buy it again just for the extra functions.

<Title>Excellent PDA with some (minor) flaws.
<Date>Fri Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Having been using this for about 2 weeks, i began to see what a great mobile manager this is. Its great becuase i can put all my contacts in here, knowing therye all safely stored. Movie and sound quality is great but i REALLY reccomend getting a headphone. Having the Dialer is great becuase i can phone anyone on my contact listt and yes it does cost becuase your using it through your original phone. Playing games is excellent - I have all the emulators Snes,Gameboy,Gameboy Advance,Sega Genesis - All work fine again though you need a programe called UMDH.   The LifeDrive is very easy to use, first time i was able to know how to do everything - but i suggest reading the manual (I don't)becuase there are some neat tricks to learn.  The LifeDrive programe is great! unlike other PDA's - instead of hotsync -  now you can drag all your favourite files without a sweat!  I was dissapointed with the WiFi (Wireless Internet) use at first but i found out there was an update that fixes the problem now it works great and looks great too, but don't except to use it too much as its a battery eater.  Speaking of battery, without using Bluetooth or WiFi it runs about 6 hours, With Bluetooth and WiFi its about erh 2 hours (Yes its that much of a killer).  Yes its true there is like a 2 second freeze when you open a programe but its not THAT bad - Can't you guys wait. I cant see why people have reviewed it badly - i really don't, i wonder if they actually owned the device...  Overall i would suggest this device to those that are constantly on the go - Either at Work or College, this device will be the other Foot of your body. It will carry you throughout the day.

<Title>I'm convinced
<Date>Thu Jul 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've been intrigued by handheld computers for years, but was never convinced that they could be truly useful. Last year, I was thinking of buying an MP3 player, especially for use on long trips. Then I saw some dual-function players that also served as photo viewers, and thought maybe I'd get more use out of something like that. Still, I didn't buy anything, as it seemed as though none of these devices really lived up to its potential.  Then I saw the Life Drive last spring and decided to get one. I have to say that I've got more pleasure out of this device than from any other electronic purchase I've ever made. I can use it to listen to music or to show off photos, but I also have found many other uses for it that I hadn't even imagined. I carry it with me everywhere and use it multiple times a day.  I now use the Life Drive as my only reminder system, keeping it synchronized with Outlook on my desktop. If I'm walking down the street and remember something I have to do, I pull out my Life Drive and enter it in my Task list. The next time I synchronize (recharging the device at the same time), the task gets added to my Outlook tasks. If someone gives me their email address, no more writing it on a paper napkin! I enter it in my Life Drive contacts, and the next time I send an email, it's already in my Outlook address book.   The Life Drive has a 4 gig hard drive, which is a lot of storage. I never used an older handheld, so I can't compare it to what older models had. However, it holds a lot of stuff! I have the Oxford Compact English dictionary on it, a very complete Italian-English dictionary, the Britannica concise encyclopedia, the CIA World fact book, the entire Bible, and my entire recipe collection. (Have you ever been in a supermarket and can't remember what you need to buy to make tiramisu?) There's still plenty of space left! If 4 gigs isn't enough, you can put more stuff on an SD storage card. These come in sizes up to 2 gigs.  The Life Drive comes with a version of Office software, so you can put Microsoft Word files on it, as well as Excel and Access files, and modify them on the road. There is also a version of Acrobat Reader,which has a desktop companion that will convert normal Acrobat files to a format more suited to the small screen.  I didn't think I would like using a stylus for input and was planning to buy a keyboard. However, the Graffiti 2 hand-writing recognition system is very intuitive and quick. I just started writing without reading the instructions for forming the letters, and the only one I had trouble with was the letter "x". I found out on my own that Graffiti 2 will recognize many more ways of writing a letter than they officially claim.   I bought a text-completion program (by Teal) so that it suggests words before I finish writing them. The one problem with this is that I use both English and Italian; the program recognizes both, but I have to manually switch vocabularies before beginning to write, which is a drag. I wish it could figure out which language I'm using and switch automatically, as Microsoft Word does with its spell checker. Teal also makes a useful program (Teal Glance) that displays a daily to-do list with a clock when you turn on the Life Drive. However, some programs override the Teal Glance screen if they were the last program you used before turning it off. (Usually the Life Drive picks up right where you left off when you turn it on.)  For Music, the Life Drive has two programs: Pocket Tunes and Rhapsody. Rhapsody is great for organizing music on your desktop and digitalizing your CD collection, but it has some kinks in it. It also transfers music to your Life Drive, but I find it quicker to just drag and drop the music directly onto an SD card (using a USB card reader). Pocket Tunes organizes and plays the music once it's on the Life Drive. I've noticed that if I'm listening to music and want to use the Life Drive for something else simultaneously, there is a pause or click in the music whenever I touch the menu with my stylus. I had read that this could be avoided by keeping the music on SD cards, but I still hear the click. I also read that installing and updated operating system from the Palm web site would address this problem, but it hasn't. However, that's a minor complaint, because usually when I'm listening to music, I don't multitask.   The Life Drive has both Blue Tooth and Wifi incorporated. I haven't really used either. There is an email package, Versamail, that looks pretty straightforward, and also a web browser called Blazer.   I've also installed a few games to amuse me in the dentist's office and while waiting for trains. There is an enormous amount of stuff available on the web.  I've heard rumours that Palm will be abandoning the Life Drive, or replacing it with something else. I really hope not. One of the things I've heard is that the Treo cell phone will replace the Life Drive. I have no desire for a big cell phone that does everything, and the Treo doesn't have the hard drive. Plus it costs a lot more. The functions that the Life Drive already has are plenty for me. I had been planning to buy a new laptop, mainly for travelling, but I don't think I will need one. If I can find a wifi hot spot, I can check my email with the Life Drive, and also look up train schedules and the like on the web.  There are other features that I haven't used much yet, such as the voice memo. This allows you to dictate a reminder into the Life Drive if you don't have time to jot it down with the stylus. You can later attach an alarm to the memo. I don't know if these can be synchronized with Outlook. You can also use this to record a lecture.   I find that the battery lasts for several days without recharging, more than my cell phone for sure. There is a dual cord that will charge and synchronize at the same time. The only complaint I have is that this cord seems to have a weak attachment. When I press the synch button, sometimes the connection with my computer gets broken and I have to straighten the cord out, press the button carefully and lay the device down carefully. Probably I should get the cradle with built-in cord to avoid this, but it would be nice if the cord that came with the device worked better. Some people complain about the case (or sleeve might be a better word) that comes with the device, but I think it's sufficient and haven't thought of getting a real case.  I can only say that if you're thinking of getting the Life Drive, go for it!

<Title>Different Reasons
<Date>Mon Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are a lot of reviews about the Lifedrive that focus on its quirks.  My reason for liking it are not because these quirks aren't there, they are, but because of its physical design.  My previous experience with Palm powered PDA's began about three years ago with an inexpensive, monchrome CLIE.  No connectivity except for PC serial synchronization.  Not very useful, and I gave up on it quickly.    Late last year I read about the Palm T|X and purchased one for myself for Christmas.  The main reason I bought it was that it has WiFi and Bluetooth and didn't cost the $500 the Lifedrive did at that time.  I figured that if it turned out to be as worthless as my previous PDA experience, I wasn't out that much cash.  To my surprise it did fill a need, and really well.  I began trying to find software that would allow me to leave my laptop at work when traveling and rely on the T|X, and I did!  Then the LD started to come down in price.  I saw one, and I was hooked.  There's nothing sexy about the T|X.  It's really very ugly.  Also, it's hardware buttons are fairly useless because of their size and position.  The LD is thicker, but it's sleek silver metal.  Its hardware buttons are larger and much more useful.  It feels better.  I had to put the T|X in an aluminum case for protection.  That makes it much larger than the LD.  Anyway...the LD feels like a much more serious device, a keeper.  That said, all told, the T|X performs better.  It's faster in all ways.  It has more RAM.  It doesn't have the LD's 4g HDD, but now that SD cards are cheap, you can get a T|X and a 4g SD for less.  However, I still perfer the LD.    For reference I also prefer Apple laptops over Dell...similar kind of thing.

<Title>Uneasy usage of built-in Wi-Fiand Bluetoothwireless support functions causing technicial problems
<Date>Fri Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the LifeDrive yesterday and turned it back the next day. I faced some problems below: 1. When I connected the wireless function, the device shut down. 2. When I turned it on again, the stylus (pen) function disappear. I called Palm's customer service center, but the most surprising thing was that the person was not patient enough to listen to my questions but just hang up on me suddenly when I asked her to give me further explanation on the instructions to solve my technical problems of the device. 3. When I turned off the switch to the left, the device still turned on.  I think the device might meet my need but the system is not stable, wireless and WiFi support are not easy to been used and understood, the weight and price is pretty high, the calculus function for medical software is slow, and the most important support from customer service center is their weakest part far from I could image, so I would not recommend you to buy this device for using it if you are a pharmacist, physician or other professional staff needing a quick function to use many medical calculation formulas.  If you are buying this device for music or other entertainment stuff, I think I'll rate 4 stars due to its large memory for those stuff.

I think this issue is caused do to many task at once, i.e. touching one link then another then the fist link again real fist seems to make the system or processor move slow or freeze. I your palm freeze's just take a brake because you will need to wait for it to die before you can use this item again. Other then that which is caused by the operator not the gear itself this is assume. Everything your read on this site is accurate and correct. Hope this helped

<Content>I was considering buying this seemingly "cool" product because my friend had one. My friend used to bring it to work but that lasted only for a month. Why? It froze.  I was lured by the manufacturer's presentation of its specs but I knew that they were only deceiving me. Most of the cool stuff featured are the ones that customers of Amazon are complaining about. My opinion is based on the 117 reviews on Amazon. I have painstakingly read every one of them. I have noticed that the customers who gave high ratings are the ones who have been using their Lifedrive for less than 4 months and/or those who have never experienced a major crash yet. Wait till they do.  I have read all the reviews on Palm T|X and I am convinced that this indeed, outperforms the Lifedrive.

<Title>Buy at your own risk
<Date>Mon Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I won't re-hash the issues that others have experienced.  However, be forewarned that, if you do purchase this device, think twice about installing Software Update 2.0.  There have been LOTS of problems with this update.  It rendered my device completely unusable, and after returning the device to Palm for repair (which didn't correct the problem), and three subsequent calls to Customer Support, it still isn't working properly.

<Title>PalmOne Life Drive Review 0 star customer service
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the PalmOne Life Drive as a replacement for a PDA I left on a plane last May.  I loved it at first.  Now I can't even use it and the customer service from Palm is horrible.  It is outsourced to India and they have no clue.  I e-mailed there customer support via their website 3 times and they kept over simplifying the issue. I can't open a Word file without an "Save File, You must save the file you are working on before switching to Documents to Go".  However I don't want to be in Documents to Go. When I save the file it takes me to "DataViz Documents to Go" and I have to do a manual search of every file I have ever opened.   After Palm didn't respond the 3rd time, I called their 800 number.  Sure we'll talk to you for a $25 charge. Here I have owned 5 months and haven't been able to use for over a month.  When turned off the product keeps turning on and beeping in my brief case until the battery dies.  I will never buy another Palm product due to their horrible customer support. Chip in TX.

<Title>I'd make it a minus 1 if I could
<Date>Thu Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I also won't rehash the previous reviews.  Suffice it to say, nothing has been improved.  My infra-red does not work and never has, my hot synch crashes my network, changing applications takes 10 seconds, the speaker for the recorder is in the back and sound is muffled by the case I carry the device in, I can't get the MP3 player to synch with my hard drive and India also says "nothing wrong."  And today I discovered that all of a sudden the device is not synching to my case management system so I am double booking my time.  I've had the device for 2 months and it has been a miserable and frustrating two months.  I am headed out to buy a different device and say "expensive lesson learned."  My problem is that I am now gun shy.

<Title>Great for College Students
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought my Lifedrive used last week, and I managed to grab it for under $200.  I have to say, it was worth the pricetage I purchased it for.    I was having some trouble finding a decent laptop for under $500, and running on a college student's budget, I found that the Lifedrive had everything I needed.  After using it for a couple of days, overall, I'm really satisfied with it.  I just bought a Bluetooth keyboard and the cradle (since I bought it used, it didn't come with the HotSync cable, only the power adapter.).  Here's what I've found about each of the features thus far, and why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  1) The Wifi: A great feature on this little device, particularly the ability to download Powerpoint presentations my professors make before class.  I'm able to run down to the library, download them online, and then have them in front of me in class to review at my own pace during the lecture.  I think this is pretty fantastic.  The WiFi does suck a lot of battery life out of the device, but if you're just popping on to do simple things like I do, then it's worth it.  I just needed something to check the various websites that I use for my college and download a few Microsoft-based documents.  If you're going to use the WiFi for anything bandwidth-intensive, then you could find yourself wanting to pull out your own hair, but this is a PDA, after all, and NOT a computer.  2) Documents-To-Go: I love this program.  It's wonderful.  Since the Lifedrive is made for looking at high-resolution pictures and small type, viewing Powerpoints is that much simpler.  The only problem I have with it is that the machine is a little slow opening and closing the documents, particularly if they're full of graphics and high-res photographs.  Other than the few-second delay, however, I think it's great.  Especially the fact that you can have it automatically zoom in on the slides.  I also like the fact that it has full funnctionality, so I can edit rough drafts right before class if I forgot to do something at home.  I wouldn't recommend writing a whole report on it, but that's one of the reasons I went ahead and bought the keyboard.  3) Voice Recorder: This was actually what sold me, aside from the Bluetooth and the WiFi.  Not only can I keep up with the online bits and pieces from my professors, I can record lectures in class on the same device, either to an external SD card or to the drive itself.  The recording quality isn't what it would be on a couple-hundred dollar digital recorder, but it's enough to be able to go back through the lecture and re-take notes, and good for studying, particularly when I get to a point in studying for the exam when the question of "Hm.. I don't remember what she said about that..." comes up, and I don't have time to email or visit during office hours.  4) Bluetooth: Once again, sucks up a bit of power out of the device, but as long as you have it on ONLY when you need it, and don't use it too much along with the WiFi, then you don't have the shock of physically watching the battery life suck down.  The Bluetooth is quick, too.  My boyfriend and I were exchanging photos and MP3s from his phone to my Lifedrive, with absolutely no problem.  I can't say how the keyboard is going to react with it yet, since I won't receive it until Monday, but I'm sure it won't have a problem.  5) The Hard Drive: 4GB is more than enough for what I need to do on this device.  Keep in mind, I'm not downloading any extra programs or games, or using anything that didn't come directly from Palm.  In my opinion, that's not what this machine is for.  It's used to organize and to edit.  If you want a gaming system, buy a PSP.  The Lifedrive is what us poor college kids settle for when we don't want to carry around a laptop on top of the books we already have to lug around.  I imagine people who are trying to use anything RAM-intensive are having problems with it, because it does lag with the graphics in some programs.  I just like the sheer amount of stuff I can carry around on this thing all the time, and not have to worry so much about whether I have this notebook or that handout with me, 'cause it's right on my PDA.  6) Photo and Video Viewer: Absolutely flawless.  Photos look better than they do on my computer at home, especially with the button to turn the images on their side and look at everything in landscape view.  This is where hiding the Graffiti area is really useful.  7) MP3 player: A wonderful feature to have in combination with all the other files I store on here.  The sound quality isn't an IPod, but it's great that I'm not carrying around 5 different types of expensive equipment in my bag at all times to do everything I need to do.  It's an all-in-one device, and it's made to be used as such.   8) Overall Organization: Keeps Tasks and Calendar in the same view, so you can see what's coming up during the week (again, GREAT for me, since I am the queen of the procrastinators, because I forget how much is coming up during the week).  I know it's just the OS that it runs on, but everything integrates fabulously.  This is what Palm is great at.  Organization.  Use everything in this device to keep your life straight, and it will be good to you.  All in all, I feel like I got more than I needed out of the Lifedrive.  WiFi's a bit slow and sucks battery life, Bluetooth sucks a little less battery life, but if you're not using either of them, the battery seems to last just fine, particularly for a device that can do so many other different things.  For a college student who doesn't like keeping all of my information in 20 different places, and losing papers, and losing my mind, it's wonderful.  I couldn't have picked anything better.  I can't say it's worth it to buy it new.  I shopped for a couple of months before I found it for the price I did, but if you can find one used around the $200 range, it's definitely worth it.  I know I wouldn't have purchased it for almost $400, when I could've gotten a laptop instead.  Not to mention, I don't have that kind of money to blow.  As long as you don't want it to play games or JUST because it can surf the web, the Lifedrive is for you.

<Title>IT DOES EVERYTHING WELL
<Date>Fri Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have owned my Lifedrive for about 4 months.  It is easy to use with the Palm Software, it has many great features, and with the thousands of available software titles, you can do anything with it. What makes this possible is the built in 4GB hard drive (the only PDA with one).  It will also take 2GB Secure Digital Cards (some other PDA's only take 512MB cards maximum). I upgraded the MP3 player to Pocket Tunes Deluxe and I purchased Etymotic Earphones from Amazon. With the 2GB SD card I take with me thousands of songs.  I am an attorney and I can also take all of my Microsoft Word Files, legal resarch and photos from my law office.  The Lifedrive Manager software automatically synchronizes all my files with my office.  The WiFi Web Browzer is easy to use.  The large screen allows web pages to fully load. The life drive plays videos too.  This is a great multi-function handheld computer.  It is like having a PDA, I-Pod, and multimedia player all in one small package. Go for it.

<Title>Excellent!! (minor gripes notwithstanding)
<Date>Sun Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Reviews on the LifeDrive has been up and down.  Mine is way up, despite a few gripes.  I've had mine for three weeks now as an upgrade from a Palm m515.  With the m515, I was already dependent on a PDA for managing my daily routine.  I was surprised, however, how much the LifeDrive has significantly expanded what I am able to accomplish with a PDA.  First, upgrading the DataViz software suite to 8.0 (7.0 is in the box) is a necessity.  I am a criminal defense attorney, and I am always reading a variety of different documents.  With the LifeDrive, I can do all reviewing on the PDA anywhere.  I convert documents to PDF on my computer, load them on the LifeDrive's capacious hard drive, and read them with DataViz's PDF To Go (part of Documents To Go v. 8.0 -- MUCH better than Adobe's free PDA reader)  The large drive allows me to load all docs for my whole case load, plus research materials like the criminal code, onto the PDA with plenty of hard drive space to spare.  The large screen (which goes landscape at the press of a button) combined with the ease of PDF To Go allows me to read it all at any place or time (such as during down times in court).  Second, how I use a PDA has been transformed by software that allows me to convert and play video files.  I can rip movies from DVDs at reduced file sizs, and then play them back at very decent quality video and sound.  A two-hour DVD rips well into a compact 256 meg file for easy playing, all accomplished with free open-source software tools.  More importantly, I can load video files from work onto the device and play them in similar fashion, again allowing me to review critical work materials anywhere at any time.   I like the hard drive concept a lot.  It is slower than your computer's drive, and there is indeed a lag as data loads.  However, the lag, although noticeable, is very tolerable and doesn't reduce the practicality of the machine at all. Once the data is loaded, the fast processor crunches it very quickly.  I use a utility called SharkCache to reduce lag time to practically nothing for a few frequently-used applications.  The capacious storage and free SD slot absolutely compensates for the minimal lag issue.  My PDA did crash a fair amount after doing the first hotsync.  This was cured by going into the Palm data on my computer and deleting the SavedPreferences file, then hotsyncing after a hard reset.  My PDA now crashes occasionally, but not inordinately, and I haven't had any need for a hard reset since.  Some minor instability is another inconvenience that is far outweighed by huge gains in usefulness.  The obvious question is why this device as opposed to a laptop.  A laptop will have these and more powerful features, and low-end models don't cost much more than the LifeDrive.  For me, it boils down to portability (not just size and weight, but also necessary laptop add-ons like power cables), battery life (constant use for at least all day without fear of losing power), instant power-up, and ease of data entry (in a courtroom, it's easier to review a calendar and enter a new date or new contact by pulling a PDA out of your pocket and handwriting it in than it is to lug a laptop around and type).  The LifeDrive's screen is large, bright, and well-saturated.  The Palm OS gets gripes about being outdated, but I like it and it is what I'm used to.  Grafitti 2 is easy to learn and fairly intuitive (less so, though, if you have to unlearn the original Grafitti).  The battery life is sound as far as I'm concerned, since I never go more than 24 hours between hotsyncs, and I haven't yet been in danger of power loss. The device is pleasing to look at and ergonomically sound.  Wireless internet works flawlessly in public hotspots, but curiously I haven't been able to get it going on my home connection (again a minor inconvenience, since if I'm at home, I am likely to use my computer over my PDA for net surfing).  The LifeDrive isn't a miracle machine out of the box.  It took a week after I bought it to configure the device and figure out the other items I needed to make it  the miracle machine I now think it is.  These items include a cradle, case, 1 gig SD card (better video frame rates when played from the card), and DataViz Documents To Go vers. 8.0.    Now that I've got it tweaked and tuned, I think it's a great PDA.  Because I had to tweak and tune it, and because of the few inconveniences I've noted above, I can't give it a full five stars.  But it is my pleasure to enthusiastically award it at least four.

<Title>Doesn't live up to billing - plus poor customer service
<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the LifeDrive to replace my Zire 71. I hoped that the unit would help do all of the following; give portability to my office documents, room to back up e-mail from outlook, listen to Audible books, and carry some music on trips. First the unit size is not as nice as the Zire. Sure it's only a little bigger than the Zire but that little bit makes a big difference when I had it in its case and tried putting it in my pocket. Also the LifeDrive needs administrative rights to work on the Office XP computer. My IT guy was not happy. Office documents worked when I got the administrative rights, but I liked the non-wireless keyboard I used before. The e-mail wasn't the Palms fault but the Docs-to-Go Premium will not look at subfolders in Outlook. My biggest gripe is with the audio applications. I have static between every track transferred to the palm. When I go to the support site I find a forum complaining about this issue. The static also showed up while listening to a book. The battery life while using the audio was sub-par compared to any MP3 player. So you may ask why I haven't sent the unit in for repair. Well, I did and the unit is still bad and now the stylus does not stay in when it should. If you get one be prepared to do a quick erase and a secure erase. You'll learn what they mean. If I could return the unit I'd get a different Palm and a separate MP3 player.  Update: I'm on my third lifedrive and spent over eight hours talking to customer service. I've been complaining about the quality of the audio. Every lifedrive emits a hiss at low volumes. Jim, at Palm corporate told me it was a software problem. I sent Pocket Tunes his comments and they tested the device finding it was a Lifedrive problem. I sent the comments from Pocket Tunes to Palm today, Palm called me tonight and admitted it was a Palm issue. They told me they never advertised the unit to be a good as a digital MP3 player,(they have an analog output). When I asked him to downgrade me to a different Palm, since this doesn't fit my needs, he told me to sell it on ebay.  End result of months of phone calls and e-mails --  Palm Wasted My Time with poor customer service.

<Title>Great Device with Tons of Storage
<Date>Tue Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had this item for about 2 weeks now, and I love it!  I can place hours of music, a couple of movies, and still have over a gig of storage for my doc files!  (I currently have 700 MB of music, a 700 MB movie, two 175 MB TV shows (converted from DVD), over 400 pictures from my honeymoon and 1 yr anniversary vacation, and a couple of documents with 1.7 gigs free! Some of the issues noted (squealing while listening to MP3s and stability) have been updated by Palm as of Dec 1.  You will likely have to do the update when you get it, but it's worth it!  One thing to note, be very careful when installing 3rd party apps.  I have had 2 apps crash my system causing me to do a hard reset (erase).  As well, sometimes those apps will corrupt your sync login.  If you create a new sync account, and copy your contacts, etc. over to it on your PC, you can sync back up just fine. So be careful, not every piece of available software will work on this machine.  Of course the software titles I am referring to are freeware apps found on the net.  Other than the 3rd party software issue, this machine has been stable for me, I even dropped it from about 3.5 ft while the HD was spinning!  It still works.  The lag doesn't bother me so much, but that's probably because I didn't come from using another PDA, and it's really not that bad.  I tested another Palm product in the store just to see, and it didn't seem that much faster to me.  I don't know how long a PDA's battery should last, but mine lasts me all day listening to MP3s and 2 days if I just use it.  Palm reccommends 30 minutes of charge everyday anyway, so I usually use it enough to run it down and let it charge overnight, although I haven't done that everytime.    I highly reccomend this device, but be sure to download the update before doing anything else with it... it will make your life easier.

<Title>BEYOND disspointed
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Of the 60 days I have had this unit, it has been functional perhaps 20. Starting right off, it crashed constantly, I had to reload the desktop software four times when the conduits to Outlook 2003 failed. About 3 weeks ago, the unit froze. No power off, no reboot, nothing. Calling palm, after a 30 minute wait, yielded no help, and I had to return the unit. At my own expense. Now one would expect that after paying $499 plus S+H.. I would be entitled to advanced replacement, or at least pre-paid shipping.   Anyhow, I sent the unit in, waited 2 weeks, and it finally arrived yesterday (No signature required I might add). Today, in a fit of patch management, I decided to load the new 2.0 updater. Unlike normal, I actually read the instructions, and followed them to the letter. I NOW have a $499 paperweight!!! If you have a LifeDrive DO NOT LOAD THE 2.0 UPDATER!!!  Yet another call to Palm, an even LONGER wait (seems quite a few people are having the same issue as I) and guess what? I have to ship the bloody thing back, AGAIN. At least this time they are paying the inbound shipping. However I would say it's a good guess that by the time I see a replacement, it will be out of phone support period, will most likely be a beat down re-furbished unit, which will STILL take 5 to 7 business days to send back to me.  I have been a long time user of Palm devices from the days of the PalmPilot Personal. Most recently I had a Tungsten C, Treo 600, and Treo 650. If there were a way for me to return my LifeDrive back to Palm so they can complete the beta process on it, you can believe I would.  In short, Great Idea, Crap implementation, infuriating service and support.

<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have my Lifedrive a couple of weeks now and i can't imagine my life without it any more.   Before this palm i used a Palm M515 and i have to say the application lag that people talk about is almost the same as on my m515 and i don't mind it. It's a great tool for me the battery life is better then i expected (i don't run out of power for days).  The only things i don't line about this palm are: - Power switch. it's a slider switch and for me it just doesn't do the trick. Ok i like the part that you can lock your palm with it.  - loose power connection. I would have liked it better if it would be possible to charge the lifedrive through your usb cable. Now you have to take the power adapter with you on your trips.   So all said i love this palm and be smart if you get it first upgrade to version 2 (free download at the palm webpage)  Till now my palm did a soft reset once and never hung on me.

<Title>Nice WHEN IT WORKS 
<Date>Sat Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love all the features this unit has, but mine crashed less than two months after i purchased it.  I purchased the hard case for it, the protective sheets for the screen and took extra care of it.  One day it was stuck ON and i could not turn it off, the battery had to run down.  I tried doing a hard reset and it stuck on the PALM ONE screen.  I was very upset when i found that i had to PAY for the return to a repair center that is only 7 miles from me!  It cost me 15.35 to send it 7 miles! I shipped i via UPS -  THEN when they returned it - they shipped it via DHL - i never received it because DHL returned it to the repair center because they could not find my house.  I called DHL and i called Palm -  Palm said they were sending an order to ship me another REFURBISHED replacement.  This really angers me to have to settle for a REFURBISHED unit after this thing crashing in less than 2 months.  I should have purchased a REFURB or OPEN BOX in the first place.  Palm assured me that REFURB is GREAT - it will already have ALL THE NEWEST UPDATES INSTALLED.  Now that really makes me feel good. . . . .  NOT!    I too have had several Palm units in the past and loved them.  I am afraid after reading all the reviews i have made an expensive mistake.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Mon Apr 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the Lifedrive for about a month.  I was mainly looking for an MP3 player and when I found that the Lifedrive had the capability + a lot more, I bought the gadget.  I've had an old Palm m125 (monochrome screen) for about 5 years now and have had very little to complain about it.  It does the main job of keeping my addressbook and To Do lists organized. I also use it to import (into Memopad) any articles that I find interesting to read during the daily 1.5 hr roundtrip commute. I also use Avantgo to read more articles.  So by buying the Lifedrive, I hoped to be able to dump my addressbook and calendar onto it plus be able to do the other cool things - wifi, bluetooth keyboard, picture slideshows,  viewing word, excel and powerpoint + pdfs and of course MP3 music.  I also backup about 500 Mb of files monthly between home and office and so the 4 Gb is more than enough.  The good news is, I can do all of the above.  When syncing 2 different devices (my old Palm m125 and the Lifedrive), you need to be very mindful of what is syncing to what or else you could lose data.  To do this, you simply customize the  hotsync options.  The only drawback is that the battery doesn't last very long. Using the mp3 music player alone and nothing else, I get about 4.5 hours max of listening.  Due to the short battery life, I've decided to continue to use my old reliable Palm m125 as the main address book/calendar/to do list since the batteries (2 AAA) last 4 weeks before needing replacement. It's proven itself dependable and durable - I've dropped it a few times.  I think that if I drop the Lifedrive (accidentally of course),  I doubt that it will survive as well as my old Palm if at all.    So I'll use the Lifedrive as a backup and as a toy.  I'll also use it to read articles (in Word docs) on the train. It's still a cool gadget to have but I can't be bothered to worry if the batteries will die while I'm searching for someone's address and phone number.  I also don't want to worry what would happen if I accidentally drop it.

<Title>Finally - something that can do it all
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had previously owned a Palm Zire 71 and liked it but it was very limited by its small memory capacity.  The Life Drive has 64 mb of memory in addition to a 4GB hard drive.  It is fantastic - I love the screen resolution and the ease of downloading picture files, music and documents.  Wifi is super easy to use and has nice graphics - unlike the Palm TX.  It can be viewed in the vertical or widescreen mode, which is great.  Nice size screen too. Battery life is not the greatest, but who wants to look at a small screen for more than an hour at a time anyway? I love the lock mechanism, ensuring that it can not turn on by itself during transport.   SUPER HAPPY with this PDA.  One small drawback is you will need to buy a case or skin as their case is super tight and not easy to get off.

I've held on the phone for over 45 minutes each time listening to their crummy music only to have my call abruptly disconnected. It's sad that most companies don't offer good, easy to reach customer service, but Palm manages to out do everyone else in their absolutely horrible customer service.

<Title>Mine is perfect
<Date>Sat May 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had the pleasure of reading some of your reviews, and quite frankly, I don't know if I should feel fortunate or laughing out loud, not to be rude, but literally, given that there is absolutely nothing wrong with mine.  After you received your LifeDrive, the unit turned on ok, the jacks don't fall out, the screen is not scratch etc, then, folks, there is nothing wrong with your unit.  I can say with 99% confident that it is all software related.  Here's some advices for you that might help:  1). You should not use the operating software come with the CD; instead, you should download the latest version from the Palm site.  And you should install the update 2.0.  Then you need to know how the unit works, there are two storage areas in the unit, the internal memory and your 4 GB hard drive.  You need to understand how backup works, and how to backup your cache as well as the files in the hard drive. Use Drive mode to backup your hard drive to your pc, and resync often for backing up the other portion.  There is no need to use LifeDrive manager come with the CD.  2). You must have some sort of Uninstall software installed in your unit, because chances are you will installed something and want to get rid of it.  I am using Uninstall Manager from Palm, and it works great.  Oh, and for the one who complaints about the unit turned itself off after 3 minutes of inactivity ... There are softwares to prevent that, check the web.  Now here is the truth.  This unit by itself may be over-priced; however, the synergy this unit can provide after you cleverly match it with well chosen softwares will give you a return on investment that is completely unmatched even at 2 to 3 times their combined price point.  It's like having an assistant working for you 24/7 and you pay him/her 50 cents a day.  My LifeDrive is a powerful breast after I mate it with the following personally chosen softwares: Uninstall Manager, DateBk5, ShadowPlan, DayNotez, Supernames 2.0, Repligo PDF Mobilizer. Doc to Go 8.0, SmartList to Go, MyBible, etc.  You get the point.  (alternatively, you can replaced Datebk5 with Agendus, and Supernames with Beyond Contact, ShadowPlan with ListPro, or Life Balance etc).  I don't play games, watch videos, or listen to mp3, but you can if you like.  I have not had one single reset that I am not aware of.  Perhaps the only down side is that the unit does take an extra second to load, but after a while, I hardly notice it.  It doesn't have a camera which some of you might prefer.  Other than this, great unit.

<Title>inquiry for allan lee or anyone!
<Date>Mon May 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am sorry to use this space for this very technologically novice inquiry, but I enjoyed your review so much, in the sense that I am looking for an excellent PDA, and your comments reflect my hope and sense that this is the one for me...but my question is...(sorry if it is mickey mouse...)....Blue Tooth wireless is one step above Plug and Play technology right? I ask just to verify this because the last technician I dealt with re. transferring my data from my antiquated Casio to the Palm in question that I received(which I am giving away, hoping that the LifeDrive will be the one, and be easier for the transferrence of data too), and a feature that I should look for....at very least right? Again, sorry this was a very novice question.

<Title>Life Drive great concept - poor software reliability
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Life Drive - with lots of disk storage - is a great product concept with extremely unreliable software.  Unlike the Palm IIIx and earlier models with the rock solid Palm operating system and Graffiti handwriting recognition, the Life Drive frequently locks up and crashes.  The Grafitti 2 software has very poor recognition (as well as being less intuitive than original Grafitti), runs slowly, and often cannot recognize "T" and "L".  With an unreliable digitizing pad (which causes characters to breakup and be read as other characters), text entry is an exercise in frustration; on average characters must be entered twice.  Mine is being returned for repair for the 2nd time in 18 months but it has never operated anywhere near satisfactorily.

<Title>Dead Life Drive.
<Date>Thu Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased a Life Drive PDA because of the large memory capacity.  I upgraded from Sony Clie.  I have been unable to  get any help from Palm, since my Life Drive crashed after a long holiday weekend.  I guess the battery ran down and it will not recharge.  A $500 device that is now useless.  I have now returned to using my Sony Clie which continues to work.  If I were you I would think twice about buying such an expensive PDA that does not contain replaceable batteries.  Take a look at Palms website where they tell their customers that sending the device back could cost you more than the amount it would cost to buy another.  "Let the buyer beware!"

<Title>Lag Drive
<Date>Sat Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this in june and had to return it.  I use it as a physician and have had a Tungsten C, and Visor and Palm V, each of which represented continuous improvement in speed and usability.  The lifedrive was so slow switching between applications, up to 2 minutes and usually thirty to 90 seconds that I couldn't function.   Also the programs I used ran more slowly (10-20 seconds for steps that were instantaneous before) than before or than on the T|X with which I have replaced it .  Iuse a prescription program and it links to epocrates which meant every time it would take several minutes to perform a task that took 10-20 seconds previously.   On the plus side the multimedia and PIM functions worked well if you waited for them to start.  It has a sharp screen and pictures.  The dictaion feature was great.

<Title>Lifedrive has potential , but  it is a disappointing upgrade from Tungsten C
<Date>Wed Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I migrated from a Tungsten C to the Lifedrive.    The Lifedrive seemed very appealing because it incorporated Wifi and Bluetooth, a larger display, landscape and portrait mode, audio file capacity, recording ability, a 4GB harddrive, ability to store SD card material from a digital camera to the hardrive.    Although these are significant features that make the Lifedrive very attractive, buyer beware. The major downfall with the Lifedrive is the long reset time.   Imagine you are talking to a friend or client inputting a person's phone number and the system freezes.  You reset the Lifedrive and it takes an agonizing two minutes or more to reboot. This is not practical.  I have owned the PalmVx, M505, and Tungsten C and none of these models were plagued with such a long reboot.  Some may argue that the advantage of having a large harddrive does not allow for quicker reboots. But this is a true disadvantage.    Despite an upgrade patch for Lifedrive, the system still remains very buggy.  There are too many freezes or resets.      For those of you who are used to accessing applications with rapid speed, the Lifedrive takes a while to initiate programs.  This is a real setback.     What is also very frustrating is that programs that worked flawlessly on Palm Tungsten C or Palm OS 5, do not work as well on the Lifedrive.  Programs such as Fireviewer do not recognize the Lifedrive hardrive or SD card.  Avantgo has difficulty using the SD card.  Shadowplan can't fully utilize the SD card or desktop.  Pocketmirror, the program that allows you to sync Outlook with more specificity to the Palm requires a fee for an upgraded program to fully utilize features on the Lifedrive. Hacks that enhance Palm use seem to not work as well.  So many users have invested in programs that worked, that it seems unfair that the "upgrade model" does not allow compatibility.  Nor does there seem to be any effort on Palm's part to facilitate program usability.     Palm support states that because of the new memory feature or configuration some programs will need updates or patches.  But come on, why can't very popular programs that worked successfully before  be compatible.   Previous accessories are also obsolete with the Lifedrive.  You now need an new sync cord and can't use the extra cords or cables that you may have had with the Tungsten C.     Although Palm Support will assist you, if you wish to give some feedback, or get more assistance, or raise some concerns, it is very difficult to do so.  You have to navigate through  many limited search menus.  There is no effort to make a "suggestion box" or easy contact like so many other websites.      Too bad Palm opted to not incorporate a keyboard as found on the Tungsten C.  Yes, you can purchase a keyboard accessory, but it is not the same in terms of convenience and portability.  A keyboard truly enhances the speed and accuracy of data input, that will always surpass Graffiti input.  The Treo models have a keyboard, but they do not feature as much memory.     Reviews from many periodicals such as Consumer Reports and  PC World rated the Lifedrive favorably.  However, for professionals and powerusers who have come to accept and expect the rapid speed, program compatibility, stability of previous Palm models, you may feel very disappointed.       There was a time it seemed Palm  put the customer first and welcomed input from its users in enhancing the current and newer models. Each new model seemed to expand upon speed, feature, memory expansion,productivity, and convenience. One does not get that feeling anymore.

<Title>Life Saver
<Date>Sun Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the LifeDrive for 2 wks now.    1. The FIRST one I bought was a complete lemon.  Performed 30+ soft resets and 8+ hard resets in less than 24 hrs.  The unit would crash on its own software and was extremely slow!  We returned it.  2. After much convincing and seeing how much faster the one in the store was, we bought a SECOND one the next day.  I upgraded from a m130 and I must say this device is wonderful!    Pros -Storage space + SDcard compatible -Wireless hotsync (if you have a wireless network) -Excellent picture quality -Music is of decent quality, but a little quiet through the speaker -Can copy things onto it like a USB thumb drive -Can open and edit native word and excel documents (had to convert them w/my m130) -A lot faster (could be mine was just ancient) -Nice calculator/converter  Cons -Size, A bit bulky -Pricey, around $500  Battery Life- My m130 would last 2 wks before recharging.  This one doesn't compare, but it also has many more features.  WiFi, Bluetooth, and music will eat up your battery.  I go about 3 days before I recharge.  In addition to medium usage, that's of no Bluetooth, about 30 mins of WiFi, and some light music play everyday.  I also love to play games on it.  WiFi- It works super fast when I hotsync, but pretty slow for internet usage. This could be the same with any pda, not sure.  Buttons- It will only recognize one button being pressed at a time.  This is mainly used for gaming.  However, there is software out there to fix this (Lifekeys).  AddIt- An annoying software built into the ROM to get you to buy other software.  It also significantly slows your HotSync.  I find deleting it and telling the HotSync to do nothing is the best solution.  It will still be on the pda, but inactive.  Integration- It has no camera or cell phone, but I am bad about not charging things.  I would much rather loose the use of one device vs. two or three.    Resets- My FIRST one reset all the time.  I mean every 5 mins of usage.  This SECOND one has only had 2 uncommanded resets ever.  Mine is very stable and I have installed numerous 3rd party apps on it.  The 2 resets were caused by incompatible apps from my old palm.  It also only takes 2-3 mins for mine to reset which isn't a big deal to me.  OVERALL- I give it 4 of 5 due to the initial lemon I purchased.  Yes, this has some initial quirks, but it is a wonderful product after they have been dealt with.    ***UPDATE***  I've now owned the lifedrive for about 2 months.  It has continued to work wonderfully and has handled everything I've thrown at it.  It has soft reset maybe 6 times total, but again, it's usually upon initial install/trial of 3rd party apps.  No hard resets.  The only conflict I've had is connecting with the computers at work.  We can't install ANYTHING on it due to a lack of priviledges.  This includes the software required to use the Lifedrive as a USB drive.  To solve this, I bought a USB/SD card to transfer files at work to/from my lifedrive.

<Title>Do not buy this
<Date>Fri Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This device is a disaster.  Believe it or not, it is slower than the Palm III I had five years ago.  The versamail never worked and, naturally, palm will give you no support whatsoever.  After less than three months using it, the Life Drive died.  Palm did not respond to my e-mails but sent me a customer service survey.  Infuriating. I think the problem is they tried to put too may functions into it and the technology is just not ready.  I would like to avoid all palm products in the future, but unfortunately I have five years of data in palm format and reviews for other PDAs are just as bad.

<Title>This is a great PDA
<Date>Mon Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had the pleasure to own this PDA for about two weeks. I purchased it used and must say I am very impressed. I have been involved in the technology business for about 8 years. I service and repair computer systems and have had to repair many Windows system's. I have heard all the good and bad reviews and understand peoples frustrations with tech products. Now I do not own any of the windows PDA's so I can only review my experience with this Life Drive PDA. I like the storage capacity of this unit, and it's expansion capabilities. I have added 100 photo's, 100 songs, and 2 movies using TCPMP and find the experience to be quite good, especially the sound quality with a good pair of headphones. So I have a multimedia device that works very well in this capacity, and with the ability to switch views from vertical to horizontal, this is very cool, and would not buy any device without this function.  I also have a internet device that I can surf the internet and check Email's. Being a tech guy, I just love this ability, though I probably would use my laptop for a truly pleasurable experience. Having said this, I am so glad that Palm put this in the Life drive. I decided to try using just the Palm Lifedrive on a business trip. It worked just fine for my needs. The real reason I purchased the life drive was to get more organized. Well I must say this has a life saver, Such the name Life drive. I have never owned a PDA before and since I needed to take notes on the business trip, I decided to use just this PDA. I could have used the built in voice recorder, which I feel will be a great benefit, but the speaker asked me not to, so I took notes in the notepad. I had purchase the universal wireless keyboard and when I returned to my room, took my handwritten notes and transcibed them to word. When I returned home and networked with my home computers and instantly had backed up all of my work. Since then I have found many more use for this PDA and I am sure have just begun to scratch  the surface what this little wonder will do. I hope you don't let those bad reviews, keep you from going out and test the Palm Life drive at a store near you. I must say I will be walking with this device just about every where important I go. I hope this review helps you make the right choice. Like I said earlier, I have only tested Palm PDA's.

<Title>The LifeDrive -- My 9th Palm and Probably My Last
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was really excited about my new LifeDrive when I bought it in November. Now I'm not a happy camper. It crashed often, taking forever to reboot. Finally, it just quit. Won't complete a charge, won't turn on, won't reset, won't make change and is too small to be a doorstop but too big to fit in a shirt pocket.  I live overseas, so I've got to wait to get the U.S. to have it fixed. I hope the guarantee (and extra one I bought) will be honored and that it will be replaced on the spot.  Palm let it escape before it was ready.

<Title>Great device-- Very pleased!
<Date>Sun Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had my Lifedrive for about 3 mos. now and have been very pleased with it.  There seems to be quite a few negative reviews about the Lifedrive so I was a little wary at first.  Many of the complaints seemed to stem from running older Palm software that didn't operate on the new Palm OS or from people who weren't used to using Palm PDA's.  Although Palms are very easy and intuitive to use I think the Lifedrive is a little more complex due to the integrated hard drive, which at first doesn't seem integrated at all.  I didn't reuse any of my older Palm OS software which must have spared me from some of the re-starts and lock-ups some people experienced.  Once my unit was charged I started with a new user name (so a new synch profile is created) and then immediately installed the 2.0 software update.  I've only had 2 restarts on the device since I started using it, but I use it quite a lot.  One restart was apparently due to a poor wireless connection and another I think was caused by Versamail while downloading an e-mail with an attachment.  Other than that the device has been very stable and the restarts haven't been repeated.  At first I wasn't very pleased with the new Graffiti II but now that I'm used to it I'll concede that maybe it is an improvement over the older version.  Handwriting recognition on Palms has always seemed far superior than on Pocket PC's to me and the Lifedrive's no exception.  Some reviewers have mentioned a "lag" problem when starting a new program.  I was a little worried about this before I purchased the Lifedrive after reading it in several reviews.  However, I tested a couple of Lifedrives first at electronic stores and didn't really notice any lagging or hesitating.  It might have been 3rd party software issues as I haven't noticed this problem-- and I'm very impatient.  www.palmfocus.com has a list of Palm software rated for compatability with the Lifedrive.  Before installing older Palm OS software it would be a good idea to check this list rather than struggle with your device.  (Any software written for the new OS isn't an issue as far as I know.)  Pros: +Wireless works well and connects easily. +Being able to store, view and edit MS Word and Excel in their native format is a plus. (no conversion step as on Pocket PC) +Store tons of videos, music and photos and take it with you everywhere. +Synchrone entire folders from your desktop computer (Only folders on the root drive of your device can be synchronized so nested folders won't be synchronized unless you spread them out in the root directory of the drive.  This will change the folder heirarchy on your device but not your desktop if you want to keep all the folders synchronized) +The USB synchronization and connection has been flawless.  (This hasn't been my experience with Pocket PC's) +Very powerful yet elegant PDA!    Cons: -Battery consumption high when using wireless.  Don't leave on any longer than you have to. -It's a little big and bulky to hang on to compared to older Palm PDA's.  (Wish it had a place for a lanyard) -Working with other applications while listing to music causes interuptions in the music playback. -Versamail synch setup didn't go very easily for me.  Make sure your default e-mail profile on your desktop is Outlook before you even get started with mail sync setup.   I've installed Dataviz Smartlist which is an excellent and fairly sophisticated database application which can sync with Microsoft Access.  It works very well on the Lifedrive.    Also installed Mapopolis and it also works well.  You must install maps to RAM or on a SD card and not the hard drive.

<Content>After suffering with every problem listed in the reviews on this product  I am wondering if anyone is aware of a class action lawsuit against Palm for this product which is not acceptable for the purposes for which it is to be used. Within 60 days my Palm froze and I had to send it back.  I too got a "refurbished" unit which I couldn't understand.  $500  and it dies in 60 days and you don't get a new one? Then the new one is doing ok,  little by little I add software and I am starting to think ok this is good.  Then I get on an airplane and try to plug in my headphones.  The socket is loose and moves around so much I have to hold the jack just right to make it work.  So this one is going back and I will have to go through the whole thing again. Wish I had read all the reviews before I bought it.  Anyone have any notions on getting to Palm?

<Title>Lifedrive  Nursing problems
<Date>Sun Mar 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Lifedrive to use for my Nursing classes.  There is a lot of Nursing software that is available to purchase for students and professionals.  Unfortunately the added space for the programs does not make up for the constant resets and freezing of the handheld.  I too, have had two refurbished Lifedrives sent to me for a replacement and my Lifedrive was only two months old.  The refurbished Lifedrives sent to me were defective so finally Palm decided to send me a new one in the box.  Guess what the new one in the box reset itself right away and froze.  I have purchased software that the companies say is compatible with the Lifedrive and I have had nothing but trouble.  My friend bought the Tungsten E2 and has the same software as I and she does not experience any problems with resets or freezing and her Tungsten E2 is faster than my Lifedrive. Nursing students should not purchase the Lifedrive because of all the problems with the software issues not compatible and the resets.  It is very frustrating to experience all the problems I have and they are not resolved, even with the 2.0 update version from Palm.  The technical help is located in India, and it is absolutely useless.

<Title>Lifedrive  Not SO Good
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this item because of the 4 gig hard drive. It was priced at $436.00 new. The OS crashed the first day I used it. It then crashed at least twice a day there after. I figured that the item I got was defective. PALM stated the the hard drive was messed up. Amazon did a quick return and I purchased another. To my disappointment the second one did the exact same thing. I read several reviews and it seems that 1 out of 10 Lifedrives actually works good enough that you can depend on it. I heard recently that there is some sort of class action lawsuit against Palm over this item. Anyhow I returned it to Amazon again and now use a notepad that fits perfectly in my pocket. I recommend that you stay away from this product unless you can get it for under $75.00  Good Luck!

<Title>Could be a great handheld
<Date>Fri Mar 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like LifeDrive - nice design, great screen, wi-fi and bluetooth, hard drive that could be mounted to your PC as a USB drive... Synchronization was much faster than in my earlier Palm. I really wish I could keep it as my new Palm - but it has terrible reliability.  The device keeps resetting it all the time (and it took a whole lot each time). I have added just five of my most important programs - both developed for OS5 and large screens. In addition to it I used Web browser. Typicaly, after about 10 min of work I have a reset. Worst, twice the reset was cyclic - the unit was not going out of reset loop - if you leave it, it goes through this reset nonstop. So, I had to do full hard reset to stop it - and re-install all my files. If you think it is easy - consider entering several 16 digit keys to personalize software... After second hard reset I feel it is simply wasting of time to put any of my stuff there again. Note that I have installed the recommended the ROM upgrade...  Interesting enough, each time the reset happened when I was using some of Palm own programs - not one of those I have installed. Most frequently Web browser, often preferences screen or wireless settings. Other Palm programs were reasonably OK.   I was thinking that I am just unlucky with a flawed device - but after reading the comments I realized that the chance to get a good one on the second attempt is low - besides everyone tells that Palm sends refurbished devices. So, switched to TX that is not as cool, misses several features - like drive mode, but seems to be very stable.  Palm, please, can't you make this LifeDrive reliable? And, if possible, add the phone in. I used to have Visor Prism with a VisorPhone and miss it very much. Treo is not a good replacement - screen is too small, no wi-fi, and no grafiti area. Well, some like buttons, but grafiti is faster. A combnation of LifeDrive with Treo 650 would be an ultimate handheld.

<Title>Love the Lifedrive
<Date>Sun Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was looking at specs and prices for a laptop, wanting something lightweight, easy to type on, and perfect for gaming.  If laptops were light enough, they were too expensive for me.    So.  I looked at PDAs.  When 1 compared what was available, the Lifedrive jumped out at me.  And it is perfect for me.  It holds all the music, info, and data (and games) I want with me and more.  It's easy to learn, and so easy to work with.  I've had it for just two months and am still learning new uses for it.

<Title>Stay clear of this piece of junk
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Luckily I got my Lifedrive for my birthday so I didn't have to shell out the 500 bucks or so that this piece of crap cost. I've owned a Palm PDA from every generation back to the very first Palm Pilot and was very excited to own this "top of the line" PDA from Palm, specially with all the cool features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and of course: FOUR GYGABYTES OF STORAGE SPACE. Unfortunately I was in for a nasty surprise. First of all the Lifedrive's software suite sort of encourages you to take advantage of the possibility of importing your old programs and data from the desktop. I had a bunch of cool stuff on my tungsten so I gave it a shot, This is a BIG mistake.Almost nothing coming from the previous OS is compatible. The programs would either not work at all or be real buggy and make the lifedrive crash a lot. After several hours of fighting to get my old stuff into the LD, I gave it up and erased all palm desktop software and performed my first Hard REset which took a ridiculously long amount of time. I could have hard reset any of my other palms in 1/10th of the time it took me on this one reset. After I cleanly installed everything again and even updated to the latest patch from the website I managed to get the lifedrive to work and realized that this is one very Slow PDA. Native apps lag lazily for several seconds before they open and even turning this thing on or off took time! My old Tungsten E is a lightning bolt next to this clunker. The hard disk function did work properly and I managed to load tons of pics and music into it. The built in player software is ok but you can do a lot better with a third party app. I resent palm for not including a standard mini USB like they used to on some of their previous models. This seems like a cheap corporate money grubbing plot to push their crappy proprietary cable which is feels very flimsy and comes off a lot so don't dare move an inch if your transferring something into your LD or you could probably screw up the Hard Drive or who knows what else. In my case I didn't even get  the satisfaction of killing my Life Drive by dropping it or jerking the cable off in the middle of a hot-sync. It just rached the mature old age of two months and turned into a "Death Drive" on its own. Since it completely froze and did nothing whn I tried to hard/soft or warm reset it, I called palm support and sent it back. They say that someday they will be sending me a refurbished unit. If they do it will be on e-bay faster than you can say "LIFEDRIVES STINK!"

<Title>LifeDrive-nice Ideas but poor performance
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I upgraded from a Tungsten/c and, after using the Lifedrive for about 3 weeks now, I'm considering sending in my Tungsten/c for repair and sending this thing back. The apps are great but my biggest problem is the speed. It is slow. One tech at the support center credited the hard drive. Hard drives are usually a speed upgrade. Maybe the drive they chose is substandard. I'd say wait a year and try again. Save your money.  I decided to update my review since I've owned it for about a year now. My opinion hasn't changed, for the most part. Lately, it has a habit of doing a reset if I try doing a graphic transfer via wireless. The resets render the unit useless for about 5 minutes. And software titles, the useful ones, not games (let's face reality. You don't go out and buy a $500. PDA so you can sit and play solitaire) are not too many. I really regret having bought this thing, and I think it will be my last Palm based PDA. Customer service is non- American and stinks.

<Title>EXCELLENT product with few minor drawbacks
<Date>Wed Apr 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an excellent product. PROS:  I love the 4GB memory and the capability of running larger programs which I couldn't run on my Sony Clie or my Palm Zire.  Very well built.  User friendly.  Excellent graphics (probably the best in the market).  The infra-red, Bluetooth and Wi-fi features are definitely useful.   Drawbacks:  it is slightly bigger and probably heavier than most PDA's.  Can't multi-task, especially with large programs.  Running music in the backgroud will slow it down even more.  looses battery life fairly quickly if you use the internal speaker.  lacks an internal camera. Overall, I love this unit and I highly recommend it :-).
