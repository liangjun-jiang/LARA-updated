<Title>SAY YOUR PRAYERS, IPOD.
<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing does everything the nano does(and things it doesn't like FM tuning and voice and radio recording)for less money.  The only reason to choose an ipod is if you want to be a trendy hipster(god knows there are plenty where I live).  The battery life is great and the shell is pretty scratch resistant.  Even the screen seems pretty sturdy. I found a compatible case logic armband for it at Sears for ten bucks-good luck finding an IPOD armband for less than thirty.  I haven't tried the video feature so maybe the last guy is right about that, I don't know.  But as far as music and photos this thing is great-Sandisc has a new loyal customer.

<Title>Much Better Than the Ipod Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Longer battery life, looks alot better, cheaper, has video capability, easy navigation, radio-need I say more? Ipod nano on the other hand.....has more assessories.  That's it.  Get the e250 instead of the nano.  You won't regret it.

<Title>A great MP3/WMA player
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>UPDATE: In August SanDisk released a firmware upgrade. Now there's a Custom EQ capability and best of all: syncing to subscription based music (URGE in my case) is WAAAAY FASTER. It's almost as fast as if you're adding your own local files. Previously this was the achilles heel, now it's fixed.  SanDisk actually made a good product better. :-) ______________________________________________________________  I just bought this for $150, a great bargain!  I have mostly WMA's and therefore have no need for an iPod. This player is terrific and it works with subscription services. The interface is easy, the screen is sharp and did I mention it's a great deal?   Oh and another reviewer said these things:  "The scroll wheel is a very loose, flimsy, plastic ring. It's also difficult to turn. Often, I need to use both thumbs to turn the wheel."  and  "Video playback is very buggy: A movie is arbitrarily broken into tiny video files, which the player displays and treats separately. It also adds 5-seconds gaps between them!"   I found neither of these to be true --I suspect the reviewer recieved a faulty device. The video playback is PERFECT and the wheel certainly doesn't require "both thumbs" to turn ...?!  And yet another "reviewer" stated this: "Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player" as their review heading. With minimal PRODUCT RESEARCH one discovers that this device charges via USB. Basically that reviewer is asking for something that this product is not advertised to do --and whose problem is that? What's next, being upset that his/her 2GB model doesn't hold 8GB worth of songs?  Helps to read the product description. ...

<Title>Beats any mp3 in it's category, especially the Nano
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought it for the ability to play music and it's great. It is far superior to the Nano in everything except the availability of accessories but it's slowing changing. In fact, I had bought a Nano and sold it because this is better.  For instance, 1. longer battery life 2. FM radio 3. recording capability (including from the radio) 4. scratch resistant 5. user changeable battery 6. ability to expand memory by using mini sd cards 7. better price.  Outstanding mp3 player.

<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had mine for less than a week and already I know it's great way better than a nano. Part of the reason i love it is because with it i can buy cheap 10 cent mp3s not rip off itunes.

<Title>SanDisk has done it again!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Since I like to read reviews before buying stuff, I've never been attracted to iPod, becuase there have always been better alternatives at a better price. Since SanDisk announced the E200 series  I decided it was gonna be my next digital audio player. well, I got it and it's a great little device. everyone can notice the great quality of this player just looking at it. its metal back and solid apperance shows it's very durable. I like the wheel control, it works great and once you get used to the buttons layout, you'll find it convenient too.  pros. -Eye-catching design, silver and glossy-black look really sexy. -Great quality built (metal frame, liquidmetal back and hard glossy front) -Easy to copy your songs, either by using Windows Media Player or drag and drop. -Gorgeous screen display, easily visible even under direct sunlight. -Great Battery life -User replaceable battery. -Decent earbuds provided. -The right size and weight. -Hard to scratch. -Plays videos, FM radio with good reception, shows pics and records voice and radio. -Easy menu, with practically no hidden or hard-to-reach pages. -Dedicated voice recording button. -Great audio quality.  cons. -No custom EQ, you have to use the provided ones only. The normal  (flat EQ) sounds great, though. -Catches all your fingerprints even if your hands are clean. -It should show more details about the playing song (Bitrate, format, etc.) -It has a clock, but once you start playing a song, you never see it again. -It's been storing some stuff under the screen, it doesn't look like dust, it's like some white crumbs that maybe come from the interior and not from the outside. if it gets nasty I'll take the unit apart and clean it up, I just hope it's easy to do so.  This is a nice player and SanDisk offers feature packed, great quality players at a very affordable price, get it if you can. Sorry iPod, maybe next time...

<Title>like it even haven't open it yet.... 
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Actually, haven't tested the MP3 yet, just bought it last weekend. This is a graduation gift to my son.  I thought the looks and price is quite reasonable to compare with the "hype" Ipod Nano.  Plus I find all the reviews on this product fair and right on the money.

<Title>iPod Nano Killer
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I start, I do agree that this is a iPod Nano rip off. But this player adds so much more and has value for the buck.  I just bought this player after a lot of research about this product. Read video reviews on gizmodo and engadget before I got this. I'm extremely impressed by all the things that this player can do namely 1. Music 2. Video (1.8" screen) 3. FM  4. FM recording 5. Photos 6. Voice recording  I got this for $150 and it is surely worth every penny. The mechanical dial can look and feel little ugly but once you get used to it, it is not that bad.   Also this player has same length & breadth of Nano but is almost twice as thick as the Nano. It is also heavier than the Nano but somehow this feels more sturdy than the Nano. It comes with a lanyard and I wear this all day without any problems with weight.  The screen is very bright and the interface is very very intuitive.   The software (Media converter) that comes along with player is simple and easy to use. It converts videos to .mov format to be played. Music can be transferred by just dragging and dropping mp3s. Sandisk also provides firmware upgrades on their website which worked fine. FM recording was great though the FM receiver isnt really good. It also has a micro SD card slot that can be used to add more memory to the player.   Overall, if you are looking for something that can do way more than the iPod Nano and costs $50 less, you SHOULD buy this player. If you want to follow the crowd and cant think out of the box, then you should buy the iPod Nano.

<Title>I already despised the nano, and this is the nail in the coffin
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>NOTE: If you want to be a clone, DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER! GO GET A NANO LIKE THE 8 TRILLION OTHER CLONES IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAVE ONE.   Otherwise, this player is the flyest thing I've seen in a minute. I was actually waiting for the e250 to be released b/c in doing research on it, it essentially had everything I wanted. MP3s, photos, fm radio, recording, fm radio recording, and even video! All this in a small but STURDY package. The obvious competitior is the iPod nano, which doesn't even compare to the e250 on any level. The nano would probably snap in half in my pocket if I sat down wrong. The drag and drop the e250 has is so simple my dog could do it (no, really). The only thing that I recommend is looking up the user guide from sandisk.com which has way more detail than the included instructions. Otherwise, buy this! I wouldn't steer you wrong.

<Title>It's great!!!! The best mp3 player i have ever bought!!!BMO
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the best mp3 player I have ever bought. I you ever need to buy a mp3 player TRUST ME!! Get this one. I was just a normal person looking for a for a mp3 player. I got it at best buy about one week after it was on the market. I have not had one single problem with it once. I had and i-pod before this. But it broke in the washer, and the sansa could probably be ran over with a car and not break(liquidmetal). It Plays video but you need quick time player 6.5 or more. Save it to that and you're good. The only thing i have a problem with is the music store. Rhapsody is horrible, but windows media player works perfectly. But if you want a music store choose something else. So, an overall preview on it, is,it can store up to 400 songs, plays video, fm tuner and recorder, can store info and pictures, and is great. It also can scroll down very fast. In the box comes a starting disk and manual. Trust me get this mp3 player. It beats the nano by far!!!!!!

<Title>A Winner!
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books on a long commute, and I purchased this when the last MP3 player I had died after 4 months (with a 3 month warrantee) - Avoid Coby!.  Used that experience to look much more closely at what I wanted - a replaceable battery, easy to use controls, easy to read display, reasonable power consumption.  This has met my expectations and more.  A very solid, well performing player.
