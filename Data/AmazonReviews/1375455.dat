<Content>I love it! I just bought it recently and it works great. I love that it has wireless connection and you can send music, pictures and videos to your friends. I got pretty excited when they decided to make smaller zunes. The price on the 80gb is incredible. Too high for my range. This 4gb zune is great for me.

<Content>I bought the red 4gb Zune from Amazon for V-day and bought my wife a Sansa e260 from Radio Shack so we could have different ones.  I am not a Microsoft fan, at one point was going to replace computers in my house with Apples because of the crashing, etc.  I was reluctant to get Zune having no experience with it, but knew itunes and wasn't impressed with itunes.    The Zune is wonderful.  The Zune marketplace is easy to use and easy to do things like subscribe to podcast.  With my wife's Sansa we must convert videos using Sansa Media Converter to watch them on her player, and we must download a "podcatcher" just to receive audio podcast - what a hassle.  My daughter's ipod nano obviously uses itunes and it has more options (like TV shows, etc) but everything is DRM'd (majorly protected) and unless you strip DRM (which can't be done easily on the latest itunes version) - this makes saving backups to an external drive or allowing me to listen to songs of hers on my player (which I paid for) next to impossible.    The Zune's radio displays not only the station but the songs or programs on it - not something talked about much.  The big button on front can either  be set to be touch sensitive or you can use it like a click pad.  You can customize the background display - unlike most mp3 players.  The sound quality is excellent - even with the headphones that come with it sound good, but I bought some better quality ones.  Some say the wireless downloading feature is "worthless", but I don't agree if you have wireless networking in your home.  It is very convenient for me to sit on the couch and do a wireless sync vs having to find the cord and plug it into the computer just for the latest podcast or to download a song (but if you are syncing a bunch of stuff - best to plug it in).   The negatives?  The display on some pictures and album art doesn't seem as crisp and sharp as on my wife's Sansa or as on my daughter's nano.  So far, there are not any TV shows on Zune Marketplace (but probably will be in the near future).  If you are going to watch tons of videos and have thousands of songs, you should probably get an 8gb.  I found that 4gb is plenty for me as I have 200 songs now and plan to have less than 1000 songs that I would want to listen to consistently anyway.  I have read that some people have problems with the headphone jack, but I have not had this issue at all (maybe quality control fixed the issue at Microsoft?) The Zune was also was more expensive than my wife's Sansa (hers was 50 dollars cheaper than my Zune at Radio Shack).  The only other "negative" that I can think of (and to me this is not a negative) is that you have to use Zune software (the Zune Marketplace) to get your songs.  Overall, it is really a great product so far.  I bought a clear case for mine which works good and will hopefully protect it.  I love this thing.

<Title>Better than iPod! Love it!

<Content>I bought the 8gb Zune in black after owning two ipods. My first ipod (mini) got stolen and my second ipod (nano) just stopped working after I got done with a run. My body heat created condensation that some how got into the nano's plastic frame and ruined it. It just kept blinking on and off till it died for good. So I decided to give a Zune a try as I heard great things about it and honestly Microsoft knows how to enter a market and make great products, i.e. xbox. Anyway here are my pros and cons of the zune:  Pros:   >Beautiful video and sound quality >easy to navigate >wireless link >love the navigation pad (touch/slide/click it) > cool customizing if ordered from zune webstite > Marketplace is easy to use > ulimited downloads for cheap (zune pass) > songs cost less than itunes  > Automatically adds album art to songs (even ones not from marketplace)  Cons:  > Album art may not load right away > Sharing feature only allows playback of songs 3 times > Marketplace doesn't have Tv shows

<Title>Very impressed by Microsoft

<Content>I bought one two weeks ago and am really happy with it. It is very sturdy and built from high quality material. Browsing menus is much easier that iPods. Menu design is elegant and very intuitive. Headphones have very high quality, better than iPod headphones. Sound quality is excellent. The software that came with took a while to install, but works fine and is more intuitive than iTunes. Radio quality is very good. I have not yet used the wireless capability, but it is cool that you can "wirelessly" share music with people around you!
