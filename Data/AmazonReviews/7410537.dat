<Title>EXCELLENT mp3 player

<Content>This Philips mp3 player is excellent, I have had in my hands ipod nano, Sansa c260 and other cheap mp4 players and let me tell you this one rocks, better than all of these.  The sound quality is excellent, even with the earphones included on the package, the scren is awesome, 2.2 inches, really sharp and big. It looks really nice, the black color and the big screen looks just great.  I really have no complains about this player, well jist one but not very important, it gets fingerprints all over the front due to the glossy front that makes it look great. Just take with you something to clean it and youre done.  Transferring music and pics is really easy with Windows Media Player 11, videos too, but its a little bit more comlicated, however it isn't too much.  I highly recomend you this mp3 player, excellent in everything I was looking for(big and sharp screen, excellent sound quality, nice look and with fm radio)

<Content>I buy this audio-video player for my bro but i'm seriously thinking buying one for myself. OK it is not an  I pod but the sound quality is excelent, good bass and the earphones are decent, the only flaw is the time that takes a movie to be compressed with the software, but who wants to watch an entirely movie in small secreen, im not for it. Good price if you are not rich or I POD-MAC -fanatic.

<Title>Do not buy this item

<Content>I bought this player for my wife and I'm sorry I did. Basically, it's just an average media player with synchronization issues. In a nutshell, this is what you get for your buck:  Sound Quality: Pretty good for most people. If you're an audiophile, you may want to spend a few extra bucks in getting better earphones but the same can be said about most other players.  Video and Picture Quality: Pretty good too. Kind of a small screen for video but who will sit through "Citizen Kane" in front of this thing anyway?  Portability: Really light and it slips nicely into pockets. No complaint.  Battery life: I listen to it at work (sometimes during 11 hour shifts) but it still never falls bellow half its battery's capacity. I'm happy with that.  Storage: 2GB is enough if you listen to the same few albums all the time but that gets old for everybody sooner or later. You'll spend long nights synchronizing new music into it; which takes me to the next point...  User friendliness: NOT friendly. When you're trying to synchronize, after the first 1 to 10 songs, the synchronizing process freezes without any warning and you'll have to stop the process and restart it (if you're using Windows Media Player 10); if you're using Windows Media Player 11, you'll have to unplug the device and plug it back in altogether. This can easily make you spend a whole hour synchronizing just 4 albums, no joke. Allegedly, you can eliminate this problem by rolling back to WMP10 and updating your firmware; I tried that and spending 2 weeks reading forums on how to get over this nuisance in vain. I consider myself really computer literate and I still can't find a way to fix the little thing.   Compatibility: Linux users, nothing to see here! As of late December, I tried this fellow with 10 different Linux distros (Ubuntu, SimplyMEPIS and Freespire among them) and it didn't work with any of them! I didn't try with mac at all.  In general, this player could be it for people who don't own a large music library if the folks at Philips sat down and wrote the sync drivers properly. Until that day, save yourself the trouble: there's other MUCH better players out there for this same price.
