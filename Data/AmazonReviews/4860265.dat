<Title>Misleading Specs
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>1) I bought this item believing that it had an FM transmitter ... it does not!!  RCA says they don't even make an MP3 player with a built in transmitter.  It has an FM tuner and 20 presets but it does not stream FM to a nearby radio. Amazon needs to check with RCA and get the specs straight.  I think RCA changed their ad on this item after I bought it.  2) Another feature I relied on doesn't exist. RCA says it will record FM in mp3 or wave format.  It records only in wave.  You have to copy to your PC and then convert the wave to mp3.  3) I found that songs on the player will not play directly through your PC.  You have to copy them onto the PC and play using a media player.  Nevertheless, I will keep the unit.  It records FM radio; voice records with a built in  mic and In Line records from an attached source with good quality (all in wave format, however). It sounds great through the included earbuds and is fairly easy to use.  Amazon shipped in a timely manner and their support people were considerate, helpful and willing to either exchange for another or mark for a full refund if returned.
