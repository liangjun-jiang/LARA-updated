<Content>This is a nice compact MP3 player/recorder and I like the size of it and colored backlight; however, the manual with instructions leaves a lot to be desired.  I am very computer oriented and still this took me awhile to figure out as many important items are not in the manual.  Also I have never figured out what the "hold button" is for -- the manual doesn't tell you nor the website.  Occasionally my player has a "mind of its own" and switches modes when it wants to.
