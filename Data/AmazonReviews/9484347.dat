<Content>creative zen stone requires no software and will work on everyones u know computer.it also will play almost any format of digital music. plus itruly is the "working mans"  fav music tool.cretive doesnt make a bad product, however,as with all mp3/media units, if you have more than 4 gigs dont drop it buter fingers, or else you besad with no sound,saying something like 80 gigs, i didnt need that now i dropped and its got a crsckrd disc and the laser wont read it any more! 2 to 4 isperfect like a mini flash drive and is very hard to bust.          stone plus the perfect sound machine,complete with shortcut and an lcd screen. 50 dollars you wont miss for long, peace

<Title>Useless and Creative's Customer Service Department stinks

<Content>If this is your first venture into MP3 players like it was mine DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this device. First of all, there is no legally downloadable music to play on this thing. Nothing is compatible. But, go to their website and click on the "Fill Your Zen" link from the Zen Stone Plus 2GB webpage and it gives you all kinds of links to compatible services. Go to the service, sign up for it, and Guess What? It's not compatible. But wait!!?? They advertised that it was? Now try to get help from customer service. They talk in circles, oh yea, by e-mail only... and then to top it off you have to wait at least 24 hours between e-mails to get answers that get you nowhere. In the last e-mail I got customer service finally told me..  "[We] Apologize for any inconvenience caused from this experience. Please allow me to assist you further in resolving the issue.  Prior sending us an email, our website suggested some solutions for the issues that you are having. Some information that I provide might be repetitive, but I want to get you the solutions that have highest probability of resolving your issue.  I regret to tell you that Zen Stone Plus doesn't support Online Music Subscription Services. Therefore you won't be able to transfer any of the online music that you have subscribe whether it is itunes or Yahoo!Unlimited."  Well now, there's some help. All that stuff that they linked me to on their website, its not compatible. And I'm not comfortable downloading pirated music. So now what? I've got a device that does not do what the website said it would do. I call that false advertising and, Oh Yes...hmmm, its a piece of junk.
