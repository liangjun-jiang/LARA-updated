<Content>Guy at store recommended Creative Brand-first in this technology, bought from Amazon.  First experience with MP-3 and I am so impressed with download speed, sound is awesome which is amazing since it is so tiny.  I am definitely hooked on this wonderful way to buy only the songs you like put them all on my MP-3 and I'm on my way.  Can't wait to add the FM radio output and other add ons, and am already planning on puchasing the larger one that does pics and you can view on TV.  But this one is awesome for size, memory.  HIGHLY recommend.

<Title>Little Package, Little Price, Big Value

<Content>I've had cigarette lighters bigger than this mp3 player and I was amazed at the quality of sound, the number of songs I could put in it, and the ease of installing the software and using it.  I love this little player for many reasons: it is tiny and will fit anywhere; it holds a lot of music; it has a radio; the sound is as good as any bigger stereo; the price was low enough that I didn't have to hock my dog to pay for it. The only thing I don't like are the earbuds.  They hurt my ears..so, I just switched them out for the over the ear type headset.  No biggee.  The string that makes it easy to put it on over your head and wear like a necklace is super hard to put on it.  I hated the sealed-against-nuclear-explosion packaging it came in..but that seems to be the trend nowadays for anything electronic.  I liked this so much that I bought several to give as gifts to my grown kids.
