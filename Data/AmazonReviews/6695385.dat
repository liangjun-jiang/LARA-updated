<Title>Long delayed follow-up to the NW-HD5 comes up short
<Date>Thu Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Following the disastrous move by Sony to stick XCP spyware on their Sony/BMG cds, I had decided NO MORE SONY. However, because their previous hard-drive based player (NW-HD5) produced the best sound I'd heard, I admit to being anxious to see what they'd come up with next. Unfortunately, Sony decided style was more important than boosting capacity as this model is a relatively paltry 8 GB, and that is just not enough. The NW-HD5 was 20 GB. I was expecting more this time, say 30-60 GB. If Sony had been SMART enough to heed this, I would have ordered one. I am disappointed. However, kudos for design. Sony is usually cutting-edge in that regard (with the exception of their AWFUL remotes). NO SALE, Sony. Try AGAIN!!

<Title>minus 5 stars.
<Date>Mon Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Too bad you don't have a minus star rating system. This player was a nightmare! I bought it last evening from the Sony store and I learned that looks ain't everything.   1. Can only be used with SonicStage.  2. Does not transfer music bought elsewhere. MUST be from the Sony Connect store.  3. Does not transfer my OWN Abraham-Hicks cds!  4. Not user friendly.  5. Extremely unintuitive.  Well, I could go on. However the key thing is this: When I thought about buying an MP3 I envisioned coying my cds and dropping them into the MP3. I envisioned dragging and dropping music from other sites I have bought music from. NONE of these things were true for this player. Instead I got SonicStage who decides if my own cd is worthy of a transfer or not! I don't think so... Off to buy a Rio Carbon 6GB

<Title>Don't write it off
<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Loads of things have been said about Sony and I have stuck with them.  Sonic Stage was awful to start with and restrictive but now it is pretty decent, open and fair in terms of rights and file types it handles.  I got the A1200 recently and it has been great.  A solid audio player no more no less, superb quality.    My collection is all WMA and I like that now most of the Sony players (including the A1200) don't need to convert to ATRAC before you can load them.  That is better than iPOD etc.  It also plays MP3 and AAC all natively without needing conversion to ATRAC.  Just getting into the Artist Link feature and once you get the idea (and set it up) it is cool way of searching through your collection.

<Title>Poor software and display
<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used this device almost daily for 2 months, then sold it for the following reasons.  First, the SonicStage software never worked properly.  I installed about 100 symphonies at one time without any difficulty, but on several different occasions, whenever I tried to add a single new symphony to the unit, the software could not find the 100 already installed even though they were all present according to the unit and any could be played.  Each time this happened I was forced to re-initialize the hard drive, erasing the symphonies already on the unit and requiring that they all be added again.  Second, the display has no backlight, making it almost impossible to see the display in daylight.  I often had to cover the screen with my hand to see it.  Another complaint (admittedly minor) is that, if I turned the unit off while it was playing a particular work and later turned it back on, the unit would resume playing that work.  I regretted buying the unit and got an Ipod Nano instead.

<Title>Good But Could Be Improved
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This Sony is a solid player that like everything else, has some flaws but for the most part, does the job. I've had this for over a few months and here's an honest review:  Sony's Connect store has improved alot since from even a year a go.  I've used I-Tunes, and Sony Connect and while I-Tunes I think is still the better store, Sony Connect is fast closing in.  Of all the songs I've wanted to purchase, maybe about 10% of the time I could not find it.  Usage is very simple and transfer from your computer to your player is simple as well.  I have not had any problems importing the CD's I purchased to upload into my player.  I think as time goes on and Sony gets its negotiations with the record labels (It HAS it's own of course), Sony Connect can really propell itself but it does currently have a large selection of songs for 99 cents.  The player itself is very good.  The volume level is great and you can set your own base/treble settings to your liking - there are preset setting for rock, jazz, classical, etc. which aren't very good, so it's best just to preset your own to your liking and leave it.  The screen as you've probably read is its greatest shortcoming.  It is difficult to see in direct sunlight but I personally never been bothered much by it.  So if you are going to be looking at your screen in the sun constantly, it could pose a problem for you.  The buttons are good and it's difficult to turn the player on while in your bag (without you knowing draining your battery) and the hold button, to prevent your player from accidently turning on in your bag or purse, is placed perfectly at the top so never need to search for it.  There are 2 ways to power your player either through your computer or a separate outlet power cord that's provided.  Accessories are a little hard to purchase.  I've recently purchased a speaker stand (similar to the Bose you've seen for the IPOD all around) but I had to get it from a merchant online.  I've noticed that this player has been in Europe, specifically the UK, longer than in the USA and I've seen much more accessories for this player in Europe.  I am hesitant to purchase such accesories from Europe as things are configured different over the pond (ie. power plug).  I don't know why Sony has not introduced the accessories in the US as of yet, but they are available online if you do a simple Google search.  The earphones that come with the player are ok but not great.  I recommend buying the $40 Sony noise canceling earphones which work really well with this player.    The size of this player is great.  It's small (about 2 inches x 4 inches) and about a quarter inch thick and isn't bulky at all.  For the price, I think this is a solid buy and most would be happy with it.  It does not play videos and is strictly a music player - so if you're looking for something that plays videos, this is not the player for you.

<Title>Aweful product and aweful customer support
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I gave this to my 14 year old in August, the hard drive went bad in October, we got it back from the repair shop December 5th, and the hard drive went bad again December 14th.  $200 and he has been able to use it only weeks.  The Sony Customer Support is useless, because they act like they have never even seen this model and have no clue how to troubleshoot it.  I have spent hours on the phone with them to get no help.   The repair service hours a terrible, so I have to call them from work to arrange any repair.     My Ipod is going strong after 3+ years. Go Apple!

<Title>PLAYER SUCKS
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>SHORT AND SWEET. PLZ DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE. I WAS FOOLISH TO HAVE BEEN SO HASTY IN REVIEWING IT ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER I RECEIVED IT. NOW THAT I HAVE HAD THIS PLAYER FOR 5 MONTHS( ABOUT 2 OF THOSE MONTHS BEING SPENT IN A SONY REPAIR CENTER) I CAN SAY THAT THIS PLAYER IS A PIECE OF CRAP. TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, IT CANNOT BE REPLACED ONLY SERVICED.

<Title>the biggest mp3 sony has now what a shame i'm affarid ipod holds 15000 songs more
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off you must know about me I have over 8000 maybe even 8500 cd's in my collection all of witch are not bootlegs or downloads or copys. thus I need a very big machine to put as much music as I can on it.  when I went for my first Mp3 player song had the Nw-hd5 on the market but where phasing it out and it was hard to find i came across it only to have it stollen after filling about 9000 or songs on it out of 13000 songs it was supposed to hold.  when I went to look for the biggest song to take it's place they kept telling me at Sony a bigger one will come out with no luck so I gave in and had to buy 3 of these 8 GB players.  what I found out was while there are some very nice features about this Sony model there are some bad ones too first the good  1.  you can take the songs off your machine and put them back to your computer witch the IPod will not do. 2. you record in a special Sony mp3 format called atrac witch hold more music in a smaller space thus between the 8 GB IPod and Sony the Sony is better. 3 the battery life is better then the IPod 4.  the colors are better then the plan back or white IPods  that is about it.  I gave in last week and went and bought a 80 GB IPod these are the reasons I don't like this Sony player  1. it takes way too long to upload the songs on your computer and the machine sometimes freezes when trying to upload the music.  2.  you can only upload from a non mac computer anybody with a mac computer is out of luck  3.  there is no hold button and the machine turns on by itself when bumped into sometimes.  4. scrolling down to find curtan songs artists or albums takes way too long as the machine is very slow  5.  the worst thing about this son mp3 players is if this is the biggest mp3 there going to come out with (5300 songs) it will never hold enough music for us music fans with  a very large music collection.  I don't expect my whole collection  to fit on one machine but come on you could at least give room for 10000 to 15000 more songs.  apple did and now that's what i use.  in the end I sold my sorry little Sony player to my friend with a smaller CD libary.  this is not to say if you don't have a big CD libray and 5000 song is enough for you then this machine might be right for you if you don't mind the long time it takes to transfer your music.  Just for me a very large CD collector it is just too small and does not hold enough music.  until Sony makes an mp3 player that holds enough music to equil or out do the 80 GB IPod I'll stick with my IPod.

<Title>good device, awful software
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>pros:  -super lightweight and easy to handle. It fits excellent in the pocket  -the screen shows the information very properly  -supports atrac3 and mp3. the atrac3 format reduces the files in about 35% of their previous mp3 size (the software itselfs converts the mp3 to atrac3 if you ask it to do so). So in that 8 gb I have 2100 songs. Despite what you can think, the Atrac3 files in 105kb quality sound great!  -it's cheap: I had it for only $138 new. about $50 less than the 8gb ipod nano (and this one has a much stronger body)  -the rechargeable battery CAN be replaced when it fails. and it's not expensive (I've seen it for $16 + shipping)  -supports, as far as those which I have tried, all the Sony portable devices remote controllers.  -I haven't tried, but as far as I know, it can be used as a normal pendrive to carry any type of files   cons:  -the sonicstage software. IT SUCKS!!!! it's the only way to transfer music between your computer and the player. So, if you are in another place without your own computer, you can't get the songs from the PC to the player, unless that computer has sonicstage installed. It is not friendly to use.  -My computer is a little old and it has no USB 2.0 port, only USB 1.1, and the file transfer ratio is annoyingly slow. anyway, I have been told that in newer computers, it is super fast - I haven't seen it yet  -the body and the screen can be sratched VERY easily, so yo MUST have a protecting case (I have a neoprene one which also works as an armband) and a cover for the screen. Otherwise, in just a couple of months your player will look terrible.  -the usb cable is not the standard one for the common mp3 players (the usb-usb one, like the ones of the digital cameras). so if you lose it, you may not find a replace easily  anyway I'm happy with it, It fits my needs OK
