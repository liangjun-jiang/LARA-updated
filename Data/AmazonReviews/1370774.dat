<Title>It is easy with XP and performs beautifully
<Date>Tue Oct 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't get the "Microsoft Professional"; sounds more like an insider for them. This was very easy to install to my XP Pro PC - downloaded Itunes from Apple, charged up the battery, ripped a CD to the software and transfered it to the Nana...it is that simple.  The sound is amazing.  How do they create such a huge volume of sound from this little device?  I am a PC guy, and this gets me to start transitioning to Mac. The Nano is a buy, recommending to my wife and family.

<Content>I've never owned one of these, it's so cool! I love this ipod! I'm not an expert, but I think it sounds great, it looks good (I got silver), holds a lot of music and it's small but substantial. The only problem is those earbuds, they really hurt my ears....

<Title>I'm a Pod person now
<Date>Wed Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I give this iPod 4.5 stars out of 5. I always wanted an iPod so last year I bought an iPod mini at the low, low price of $300. I was disappointed that I had paid so much for something that didn't even have a radio and I returned it to the store. Instead, I bought a Creative Muvo Micro, a tiny pink player with a replaceable triple A battery and an FM radio. I thought, why should I pay $300 for an iPod with several gigabytes of space that I don't need just because it was pink and cool looking, when I could have a $100 player that has more. Me and my Creative Muvo Micro were getting along great for an entire year before the unthinkable happened...I lost it. I searched for 2 weeks for the little thing and I still can't find it, so I needed a new mp3 player. If I'm going to get something new, I want something with more space, better sound quality, a better screen, just something of better technology than the player I bought a year ago. I didn't want an iPod, but every other player sold in stores is big, black, and ugly. Since the iPod Nano was now a more reasonable price at $150 for a silver one, I bought it. I wanted a pink one, but I didn't need 4 gigs of space and besides, you should get a case that covers your iPod to protect anyway, so I just bought a pink case instead. I've had this player for a week and so far I love it. It came in a small box with nothing but a usb cable, earbuds, and the iPod itself. You have to download a certain version of iTunes from the Apple webiste. Afterwards, I didn't know what to do. I'm pretty computer savvy but it took about a day before I figured out how exactly to get songs on and off the player. The directions on the website are in a video tutorial and I didn't find them that helpful.  The sound quality is excellent. Much better than my previous player. The earbuds fit very well, they're comfortable and sort of small so they don't hurt my ears.  The color screen is very bright. It even allows you to put album artwork with the songs you play, which is really sort of useless to me, but it's still looks cool. There is no radio which means that I can't listen to the tv at the gym. However, I just discovered free podcasts. I downloaded some free upbeat running music as well as some educational stuff to learn to speak Spanish. There are many, many podcasts to download so I might not have a problem filling up the 2 gigs of space. You can buy a radio for it though. Battery life is excellent, I've had a full battery every time I turn it on. There is one thing I don't like about the player and that is the placement of the headphone jack. It's on the bottom of the player which is very awkward. If I've got the iPod clipped on me while I'm working, the headphone cord gets in the way and sometimes gets pulled out. I've actually had one problem with the player since I've had it, so that's not really a good sign. The thing completely froze with the screen light turn on. I couldn't turn it off or do anything with it and since there's an internal battery, I couldn't just pull out the battery to shut it off. I had to go home and search the apple site to figure out how to reset it. It took a couple of seconds and now it's working fine again. I think Apple could have at least included a belt clop or a case for the player, but you can find cheap stylish cases with clips at online stores.  *UPDATE* I've had my iPod Nano for about 2 months now. I haven't had any more problems with it. I use it just about every day! I've never run out of battery life and rarely have to charge it up.

<Title>Joining the iPod Movement
<Date>Wed Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this iPod for listening to a salespitch at work and consequently did not have a choice in color, size, etc.  I have owned various mp3 players in the past and most have been decent.   iTunes is great software compared to some necessary for other mp3s.  With a little experimentation I have almost mastered it.  Any other question are answered easily by checking online.   The 2GB is larger than any player I have had in the past and so far I am good with the number of songs it holds.   Good sound quality, tiny and light although almost too light.   Although I don't have a high-speed USB port, the song transfer is pretty quick.  Never experienced the supposedly scratch-prone Gen. 1, but so far this seems durable.   Miss FM radio but the area I currently live in doesn't have great radio stations anyway.      Overall, a good product.  Still don't know if I would spend the money to buy one.  But definitely awesome, especially when it is free!

<Title>Love this 'pod
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got a shuffle a year ago and loved the quality, I was iffy to purchase a Nano due to my clutzy nature with electronics. I have to say, this baby is TOUGH, I love the brushed finish of the Aluminum casing, no fingerprints!!!My dog has sat on it...twice, it has fallen on the floor and I have fallen down the stairs with this in pocket.....Not ONE SCRATCH on the Ipod....Me, I had a nasty break in my tailbone.  I love the games...but does anyone alses know any games that can be downloaded onto the Ipod Nano? I love, love, love this product, almost as much as my shuffle (My husband took my shuffle from me) but I am never giving up my Nano!  Peace! J

<Title>I'm sold on the 2nd Gen.
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I used to have the ipod shuffle but was frustrated that I couldn't dictate which songs to play. The nano is the perfect solution; I can play by specific song, artist, specific artist's albums, playlist (music folder I create), or genre. This ipod gives me the flexibility I want! Although I mostly just play music, the stopwatch feature has come in handy a few times. I haven't tried downloading games or anything else, though.  I recently went on a 24-hour road trip. I used my ipod the whole trip, and I still had battery life when I got home. The thing is very intuitive, which was nice trying to choose a song while driving at night on strange roads. I've heard people complain that it is too simple, but who wants to spend a lot of time surfing the thing when all you want is to play music NOW! The backlight was REALLY bright at night, but I like that I can determine how long the light stays on after I'm done (10 second, 5 or less after last touch).  Negatives: The earbuds are just OK but not bad enough to make me buy new ones. I would love to reorder the thing so I could get the 4 GB instead of just 2; I have A LOT of songs I want to put on it, and the 2 GB is just a little bit under what I need. There is no carrying case or anything, so you have to put it in your sweatshirt or whatever while transporting the thing. By doing this, you can accidentally increase the volume or change songs. However, I think you can lock the controls to avoid this. My shuffle has a lanyard, which is nice.  I researched mp3 players in depth, and the nano sounded like the player with the least problems (in this price range). I'm glad to know that I made the right buy.   I wrote extensively here because I truly benefitted from other people doing the same.

<Title>Grandma can do Nano's!!!!
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Having zero experience with iPod-type devices and with purchasing music online, this grandma put music on her grandchildren's Christmas gift of the Silver 2GB Nano in only half a day with only 2 calls to customer support. If I can do it, anyone can. The Apple support are incredibly patient, helpful, have a sense of humor, and you don't have to wait long to get through to them. I just wish the iPod Nano came with a written manual. I did go online and print the 60-page feature guide and it didn't help me with my problem with getting the audiobook out of the music category. Once I did the "Manually manage music" option, the audiobook went in the correct category. A 2 1/2 hour book took minutes to download from the iTunes store (that's the Apple online site where you can purchase books, music, etc.)and minutes to transfer to the Nano. I loaded about 50 songs and 1 book and used 0.1 GB of the available 1.7 GB capacity using a DSL connection and a pc with a USB 2.0 port. The best part was listening to the music. It's stereo sounding, clear and the best I've heard coming out of a radio/cd player in ages. I just laid back in the recliner and listened for an hour. I bought the Tough Skin Nano holder which does have screen protection, because the Nano's are going to a 6-year old and an 8-year old. The Skins come in colors which will differentiate silver Nano's going to the same family.

<Title>Apple 2 gb Ipod Nano (2nd Generation)
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod Nano is a sleek, perfectly sized mp3 player.There are many great things about it, but I have found one thing that frustrates me.     The great things about it are its sweet sound quality, size, graphics (for such a small screen), strength, and smooth click-wheel. I don't know about other headphones yet, but the ones that came with it sound great! The Ipod weighs 1.3 oz. and is 8.9 cm. long, 4 cm. wide, and 0.6 cm. thick. The graphics on this are great especially on the games!(brick, music quiz, parachute, and solitaire) I have dropped my ipod so many times and it is still working great!!!!!! The click-wheel is very smooth ;although, I expected its size to hinder its capabilities.     The only problem I have found is that it cannotplay videos, but it can show photos.     I hope this review helps you find the right Ipod for you!!!

My only complaint would be with the ear buds; they sound great but do not fit in my ears properly.  Certainly not a reason to send it back!!

<Content>Although I prefer the 1st generation look, the iPod itself works perfectly. I couldn't find a thing wrong with it if I tried unless it's my fault (its pretty dirty). The delivery was great too. It arrived one day before the delivery date range was up. I had not gotten an email from amazon informing me that I could track my purchase so I emailed the seller at the given email. I had walked into my house around the time packages are delivered, and i saw no package so I went to my computer to read the email response from the seller. The email stated that it should have arrived that day so I walked back out 5 minutes after I had walked in, and there was my package.

<Title>The best of all the Pods
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned 5 or 6 iPods: several shuffles, the original iPod, the video iPod, and this - the 2nd gen nano.  This little guy is by far my favorite and I use it all the time while my clunky video-pod gathers dust.  It's easy to use, the perfect size, light, and incredibly wearable - especially with the lanyard headphones.  It's so much more convenient than the big pod but holds plenty, and it's way better than the shuffle because it has a display.  I LOVE it!  I'm sorry Apple saw fit to make a 3rd gen nano (with video - which I DON'T want).  They no longer sell this treasure.  Why?  As far as iTunes being hard?  I've never heard that.  My Mom and both my kids easily use iTunes and sync their pods with no trouble.  I find it incredibly user-friendly and idiotproof, myself.

<Title>Excellent, but would get the 8gb version
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was an upgrade over my old dell mp3 player. It is durable, easy to operate, and the sound qualtiy is good.  My biggest gripe is the memory. I was able to fill up 2gb much faster that I expected and I wish had purchased the 8gb nano. My other gripe is that you cant delete songs from memory or playlists using the ipod itself...only from the computer using the itunes program.  The best thing about this nano is the size. The 2nd generation nano is the perfect size to fit in a pants or shirt pocket or on an arm strap. It is very thin and very narrow. My wife just got a 3rd generation nano which has a larger screen, but is wider and feels thicker.  The full size ipod is just a little bigger than the new 3rd generation nano.  If I were in the market for an ipod that is easy to take everywhere (including to exercise with), I would buy an 8gb 2nd generation nano.

It's sleek and stylish. The only problem I've had is that it randomly turned on because something was pressing against the buttons; thus causing the batteries to eventually run out.

<Title>Oh GOD------
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Oh GOD is right! DON'T BUY THIS IPOD! I purchased one a couple months ago...and this is the story: The box arrived at 3:30 AM - 3 in the morning! I rolled out of bed and sleepily opened the front door. A very irate looking UPS man thrust the box into my arms and said "I hope you choke on it!" Needless to say, I was very perturbed. I put the box down and fell back asleep. I opened the box that morning, the sunshine flooding my house. I remove the iPod from the packaging and a very disturbing odor filled my olfactory organs...it stank like whitefish! I gagged and dropped the fishy piece of electronics. After vomiting 6 times, I cautiously placed the bad-smelling iPod back into it's lair. I was very very disappointed! I spent the whole day staring out the window while some scratched CD played some old Beatles tunes. My day was ruined...my life no better. I called UPS and informed them of my "situation." They promised to come back and return it. They did come back, 4 weeks later! My whole house stank of spoiled whitefish! Even the mailman dared not step in the vicinity of my abode. I never got my new iPod and am not sure if I even want a new one...all I know is that if not for a wonderful product called EnviroClear, a odor-eliminating spray, my life would have been ruined. Indeed. EnviroClear saved my life! PS---Don't buy an iPod, unless you like spoiled whitefish!

<Title>Excellent music listening package 
<Date>Wed Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've heard all the hype about iPods for years. Wanted to see what its really like.  Overall, it is an excellent music listening package. By package I mean iTunes and iPod. Much of the credit really does go to iTunes. It does a good job of making your music collection accessible in an interesting way. It tracks number of times a song has been played, you can rate songs, etc. It has several interesting play list choices. Highest rated, most listened to, most recently added etc. While using the iPod you can easily create a new playlist even while music is playing. This playlist is then synced back to the PC where you can rename and save it.  iPod itself seems strong and durable. UI is simple, efficient. Clickwheel is an excellent way to quickly zip through menus. Generally feels very high quality. Display is excellent, albeit small. It has better viewing angles than other devices.  I do have one serious concern however. The primary purpose of an mp3 player is to listen to music. The headphones that come with the Nano are quite lacking in low frequency response. Luckily the iPod includes an equalizer where you can boost the bass. However, is what I consider an inexcusable oversight, it often boosts the bass so that songs play very distorted. There's no excuse for this. Its trivial for the equalizer to reduce the volume of the entire song by the same amount it boosted the lows. Practically one line of code. Instead, I'm sure millions of people run around listening to distorted music thinking it sounds great.  There are freeware tools out there that can alter your music on your PC to lower the volume enough to prevent it from distorting on the iPod. The one I've used is mp3gain. It works, but its an amazing pain to have to go through this process when the iPod itself could have done it trivially.

<Title>Just hype, not enough substance, not really worth the $$$
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has a great appearance and a huge marketing machine behind it. The iPod software(not the iTunes)is great. I like the wheel and the generous display(although it is not used to it potential since the iPod Nano does not support video). But that is where all the good stuff ends.  ** The interface with the PC and especially with the iTunes is really really bad. The programers that made the Nano software didn't work on the iTunes software unfortunately. ** The Nano does not use a regular USB cable to connect to the PC, you have to have the Nano cable. ** The Nano does not support many audio formats besides mp3s such as OGG, ASF, FLAC. ** The Nano does not create a usable drive for easy media upload in Windows. ** Because you have to sync it with your PC, you can't sync it with any other PCs. ** The Nano does not have an FM tuner. ** The Nano does not have a voice recorder either. ** And worst of all...you can't replace the battery. How long will this Nano recharge...we'll find out.   I got my Nano as a gift, but by choice I would not buy it at any price because there are many other players, perhaps not as hip, but with many more needed functions.

<Title>The Only iPod Review You Need to Know
<Date>Wed Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have used the iPod mini (4GB silver), the fifth-generation iPod Video (30GB white), and the second-generation iPod nano (2GB silver), and also an iBook (white plastic). All through these years I have gotten to know Apple's products better and better. But here I am going to comment on the new iPod nano that I have.  First, the good things.   Beautiful design! I have looked at all kinds of mp3 players for a long time and have also tried at least a dozen of them, but the iPod series of products are easily the winner of all. No other products can compete with the iPod in terms of design. I don't understand why all of the other mp3 player companies have no sense of aesthetics whatsoever! If any one of them wants to compete with the iPod, they should at least know they need to excel in design first and foremost!   Superb software! The iPod is easy to use and fun to use as well. I am using a PC. But WMP11 is so unattractive and stupid compared to iTunes. It is such a shame for Microsoft to continue to turn out crappy products like this. We all know IE7 is so raw and buggy and ugly! I have read some other comments that iTunes did not work well on PCs. But I think those people might be just a little challenged when it comes to computers. For PC users with a little bit more knowledge of using computers, iTunes should work just as well as WMP11 or even better. Personally I found that iTunes has a better editing interface when you need to edit album/song information. It's very intuitive and it works, while on the other hand WMP11 is not intuitive and many times it just does not work, and you need to search for solutions on line. So iTunes DOES work seamlessly with Windows XP.  Better clickwheel! No one has even noticed it before, but the clickwheel has been improved. If you look at the iPod video, you will see that the clickwheel and the center button are on the same level, viz. they are flat. But the new clickwheel on the iPod nano is grooved in the middle, fitting the shape of your fingers very well. It's a small physical improvement, but it is indeed a major functional improvement. It makes the clicking even more smooth and enjoyable.  Stellar choices of accessories. There are just too many cool accessories to mention here. But if you have an iPod, the possibility of expansion and extension is just endless. No other mp3 players can compete in this respect.  Easy subscription to Podcasts! No doubt one of the biggest impact the iPod has had on people and society is Podcasts. There are just so many things offered and you are sure to find many things you like. It is just a breeze to subscribe to and manage your Podcasts on your iPod. No other mp3 players can do this, or even if they can, they cannot do this well enough.  Okay, of course there are tons of nice things to say about the iPod, but most people have already heard of such comments too many times before and now I am going to point out some really, really disappointing flaws that made me mad.  Build quality! One word: inferior! That is not a word that people associate with Apple, since Apple tries to look as hip and highbrowed as possible. With an award-winning design, the iPod should at least deliver the quality that matches the superiority of the fine aesthetics. But it does NOT. The first iPod video I bought had quite a few bad pixels on the screen. Some were more noticeable and more annoying; some were less, but as annoying. The other day I bought a 2GB silver iPod nano at Walmart. When I first turned it on, I immediately found out that the screen was not set correctly inside the iPod, and in fact it was so obviously slant! I had to take it back and exchange it for a new one. The lady at the customer service counter at Walmart  could easily see what the problem was and agreed to get a new one for me. So it is not that I was fussy or picky or whatever, but it was a defective product. So I got a replacement. You know what, when I opened the new package, voila! the screen was also slightly slant, but not very noticeable, and I almost decided to keep it when I spotted a bad pixel on the screen. It is either a bad pixel or some dirt trapped inside the screen cover. But whatever it was, it was very annoying. This made me remember my first iBook. The screen was defective and I had to call Apple and got a replacement. But upon unpacking the new computer, I noticed more flaws on the screen and on the keyboard as well. With all of these in mind, I think it is reasonable to draw the conclusion that the low-end products of Apple are of low quality as well.  High price! If you look at the build quality of the iPod, you have reason to believe that the cost of each unit cannot be more than $50! But they charge $150.00 and more for it! Why? Because it is so popular! But frankly such business morals and conducts are questionable. If you want to stay in business forever, you have to be honest with your customers.  Disappointing earphones! How ironic! Why does the iPod not come with nice earphones? If you ever tried the Creative Zen and iRiver Clix players you would hear the difference. The earphones that come with the iPod are beautifully designed, and they have nice clear sound. But the bass is so lacking and so weak that when I listened to some songs with rich bass lines they all sounded muddy and crisp. Well the word crisp might be a good word in other contexts but not when you are talking about bass performance. I have read quite a few "authoritative" reviews of the iPod mp3 players, and most of them laud the "beautiful sound quality" of the iPod. But may I disagree? With a price tag like that, and a hip profile like that, how could the earphones not live up to expections? The fact is they do not. I am by no means an audiophile, but I can tell which earphones are better. I can only say that the Apple earphones are just mediocre. Speaking of this, I think of the iPod Hi-Fi. I played with it in an Apple store, and it made me extremely disappointed. Again the performance of the iPod Hi-Fi fell short of my expectations. And again the culprit was the bass performance. It just sounded muddy and incompetent! Yesterday I played with a JBL Time Machine Alarm CLOCK/DOCK For iPod (white), and I was really impressed. I like it, and recommend it to anyone who is serious about sound when it comes to sound anyway.  I like Apple and its products, but I am also deeply disappointed.

<Title>Poor customer service
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The features of the iPod are phenomenal.  Unfortunately, the service offered by Apple is sub-par.  Beyond 90 days, your only option is to submit a request on Apple's website (Apple only permits one free support call within the 90 day window).  A service request I submitted was cancelled with no reason given and no method to respond.    Beyond the 1 year warranty, expect to buy a new mp3 player rather than have your existing iPod serviced.  To have a battery replaced, the service charge is $70, with an additional $30 in shipping.  For all other issues, your iPod will be replaced for $170, with an assitional $30 in shipping.  That's more expensive than the 2GB Nano that's on the market!    Utterly ridiculous, and not what I have come to expect from Apple's reputation.  Needless to say, my next purchase will be from one of Apple's competitors.

<Title>Perfect blend of art and science!
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>iPod arrived late thanks to blunders by Amazon, shipping 2day order via UPS Ground and UPS, forgetting to load the package to delivery truck. I never liked Apple anyway. Never had any Apple device. Never like their policies of using proprietary devices and software not compatible with anything else in the market. But I love gadgets and work with computer hardware so I love modern technology. I hated Apple purely on other people's views. So finally when my daughter told me only thing she wanted this Christmas is an Apple iPod I was mad. But I love my daughter so I decided to swallow my pride and order an iPod thinking I will be able to return it quickly when she compare it with the MP3 player she already have. Last Christmas I gave her best non Apple MP3 player I could find. iPod arrived today and I wanted to just make sure it work so I opened it. It was a mistake!  It was a long time since I experienced this feeling of love at first sight and it was an incredible feeling. I just stared at the package for a long time. The colors (or the absence of it), the shape and size is breathtaking (yes I am talking about the box, and I have not yet opened it). Then I open it WOW, every thing is so logical and easy from how you open the box to presentation and color selection of every component in it including printed words and beauty of absence of lengthy instructions but preserving essence of order and logic of natural progression of events that lead from one to another building up on each to guide you seamlessly is breathtaking. It is a perfect blend of pure art and advance science to create minimalist but highly functional device design to educated and empower you instead of being your slave. It defines a new life style that changes your habits and expectations. I have no feeling to fully describe it. Yes I know it has no FM radio but Podcast, it has no multiple file format support but iTunes, it has no voice recorder but touch-wheel. It does not give you the past but take you to the future. It is long time I have felt this way and I thank Apple for creating a device that touched my soul and brought out the hidden passion in me I thought lost long time ago.

<Title>I love my new iPod nano!
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first iPod with screen, I had an iPod shuffle and I liked it but I always missed having a screen and selecting songs easily, so I sold it and bought the new nano... I love it, it's beautifully designed, it's so small that everytime I hold it in my hand I keep thinking how Apple managed to make it so small...  -I love the battery life, I dont have to recharge it constantly... -The interface for selecting songs is very intuitive and easy, in fact, everything about the ipod nano is easy to use... -I love the sound quality, it's excellent  The only thing I don't like about my new iPod nano is that it doesn't have an option to adjust the level of brightness of the screen, in normal lighting it is perfect, but I use it before I sleep at night with the lights off and when I want to change a song the brightness of the screen blinds me...

<Title>A Nearly Perfect MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After getting a year of good and hard use out of my 1st generation 4gb iPod Nano, the hold key snapped. Since it was out of warranty, Apple said that it would cost $180 to fix. Forget it. At that price, I might as well get the new one. So I did, and as of now I have a fantastic impression. I'll go through all of it step by step, so prepare yourselves.   1: The case. Though relatively minor, the case that the Nano comes in, as well as what's included with it, has been slimmed down to the bare essentials, which I actually prefer. The small plastic case uses very few materials, which is good for mother nature, and has no CD that you need to install before using it, which is good for your patience. There's also a few apple stickers, which I promptly got rid of as well as the new Apple headphones, a bare-bones manual, a warranty card and an adapter for a dock. One minor thing, the case can be a little frustrating to open, though it's worth it, believe me.   2: iTunes/connectivity with your computer. As with all iPods, this think has nigh on perfect harmony with iTunes. I've got around 2 gigabytes worth of music, and it was all transferred and ready to play within 7 minutes. Unless you balance the Nano on the cord just so or get a dock, it's going to be lying on your desk, so make sure not to have any dust on it. As with the other iPods, the Nano uses the proprietary connector, which is cool with me, with the slew of accesories that are available for it. Just don't lose the cable, since you'll lose all ways of charging and syncing it. Again, a small complaint here. The Nano isn't fully charged right out of the box; you have to charge it for around 45 minutes to get it 100% juiced.   3: The differences. If you were to go through the pros and cons of the 1st generation and 2nd generation Nano, 2g would win hands down. It is a hair thinner and a hair taller, but the curved edges make it feel simply, well, Nano. Another very good addition is the use of color. With the previous generation, the lovely dark color ended as soon as you flipped it over. Not so with this sucker. The whole thing is clad in anodized alumium, which happens to be nigh on scratchproof and extremely resistant to fingerprints. The bad part about that is that the case is seamless, so anyone trying to open it up will have to go for the much more difficult top or bottom openings, which are still plastic.   As for the differences with the guts of the Nano, they are small but noticeable. The vaunted click wheel is still here [and with good reason, it's the slickest and easiest control scheme in the portable world], along with the only other button on the thing, the hold key, which I hope proves less breakable than the one on the previous generation. The screen is noticeably brighter, easily the 40% claimed by Apple. There are also some handy new features on the inside: when you're scrolling quickly through songs, a letter will appear in semi-translucent text to make it easier to tell where you are. There's also a search function, and you can set a volume limit if you don't want to give yourself a headache. Other than that, things are pretty much the same.   Finally, the complaints. First of all, I dislike Apple to a very large extent as a company. They make decisions that would stop me from buying this iPod if I hadn't already made a substantial investment in the songs that I had purchased. For example, Apple makes it impossible to use the 1st generation Nano dock because they moved the connector port about 1mm to the left, for no apparent reason other than to get people to buy the dock, again. This'll also be a problem for any other docks/radio transmitters that have an enclosed connector, since those are bound to be designed to the first generation.   Those complaints aside, I am well and truly happy. Apple truly has made a great product, and if they stop making these stupid money-making changes they will have no significant obstacles in retaining their title of Maker of the World's Best MP3 Players.

<Title>Bad software
<Date>Sat Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Cute device and works well when it works, but I wasted hours and hours of frustrating software problems and still can't get iTunes working right with my Nano.  iTunes often does not see the iPod - it took hours to find the reason hidden on their site. iTunes mysteriously starts blocking browsing to buy music after sampling several songs. I don't know if it's a bug or some kind of browse limit. Why they would want to stop people from buying songs is beyond me. You have to reinstall iTunes every time this happens - what a pain.  The folder structure is confusing - if you delete songs and sync, no memory is freed on the iPod, because the songs are still there hidden in a "Songs" folder. There is a folder called Music and other folders that you create for your music - does that make sense? Not to me. To really delete some songs you have to go into a manual management mode which creates even more confusion. Delete a file in manual mode and you get a long delay with no indicator of what is going on.  Without exaggeration, iTunes has the reliability and illogical approach of amateur shareware. I'm on the Windows version. I guess they think they'll sell more Macs if their Windows software is horrible enough - not to me. The time I wasted just trying to get the songs I want on my Nano thru the poor iTunes software was way way too much.  And forget about support. There is a place to enter your S/N to prove you own your device but it did not recognize my S/N. I tried twice. This appears to be a bug they don't want to fix. And the iPod is hardware so why should I have to proove I own it at all?? Then you have to fill a form and fax proof of purchase to register for support - like people still use fax machines.  That's not all. In iTunes you can't hide the ads even though it's a pay service! The iPod connector pulls out the bottom plastic part of the case if you are not careful.  Here's my theory - Apple's success with iPod made them think they are doing everything right. They should offer tech support without playing games, not for the benefit of their customers, but rather so they can see what a mess they create for them, which might persuade them to write software that works as good as their products look. I'll be searching for a way to use my Nano with anything but iTunes.  iTunes and iPod are designed to work together so I reviewed them together. I gave 2 stars based on the average of 4 stars for the iPod and negative -2 stars for iTunes.

<Content>This is a great product, probably the best mP3 for $150.  The backlit screen is much brighter, the battery life is longer and it is extremely light.  The sound quality is very good and unless you have jumbo-sized hands, it is the perfect size.  It does have games that you can play while you listen, it has and adress book and a calender that can bee synced with iTunes.  The only flaw that I have found so far is you have to charge the battery on the computer by plugging it in there.  So, when you plug it in, it tries to sync with iTunes as well and is a pain in the neck.  I would suggest this product for everyone because it does a little something for people of all ages.

<Title>First MP3 player, wow!!!!!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A couple months ago I bought a black 2 gig ipod nano, for just $50. Why??? I simply didn't want to spend a couple hundred $ for an MP3 player. Yes it was partly used, but the person selling it bought it for his wife and she never used it(I bought the ipod off of Craigslist) so I got it. It was missing the USB cable and docking thing, so I bought the cord off Ebay for a couple bucks. I didn't see any reason to buy the docking port, and so I just stuck with the USB cable. Instead of downloading music off the internet, I just took songs off of Cds I had. And wow, does 2 gig hold quite a bit! The nano works great except for one thing, the battery. My battery work for about 6 hours, more or less. I am not sure if that is the average battery time for a second generation Ipod nano, but it does seem kind of short. Some of the features I liked about the ipod was the fact it kept world time, and has a pretty detailed calendar in which you can mark days. Right now my nano has a couple thousand pictures on it, once I put into it over 10,000 photos, and it took over an hour to get all of them downloaded! No surprise, it took a huge chunk of memory, so I erased most of them. To keep you entertained, there a four games:music quiz, parachute, solitare, and brick. One other feature I'd like to point out is the hold switch on top. It's very useful if you are the kind of person who carries their player everywhere. Once the switch is on, nothing you press will turn it on. I recommend the ipod nano to all music lovers!!!

<Title>iJobs: Why Must there always be a fatal flaw?
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One pictures the gestation of this product unfolding thusly: Steve Jobs raging at his engineers that the device has to be even more sleek and futuristic than its predecessors.  That it must possess superior sound and ease of use.  And that it must possess some element designed to leave its owner incredibly disappointed, almost to the point of anger.  Such has been the Apple tradition since at least the first gen. iMac, probably longer...  In this case, Jobs ruins an otherwise perfect product with vexingly designed earphones that will not stay in your ears.  They sound awesome.  The bass sound is particularly impressive.  And yet, they are so slippery and ill-fitting, expecting them to stay put even while sitting perfectly still- is simply unrealistic.  Again, one imagines Jobs in his sanctuary, personally directing the earbuds' nightmarish design, then testing them on Senior Managers who have fallen from his favor.  As the unfortunate test subjects are tantalized by scads of U2 songs monopolized by iTunes, they find themselves trying to somehow flex their earholes to keep the buds from popping out just as they are getting into a groove.  Musicus Interruptus..  Ah Jobs, the angry genius.  We pray for his forgiveness while he roils in his disappointment of us, the general public... "The World must PAY for choosing Windows over the Mac OS! It must PAY for the shunning of NEXTSTEP.  I will make them WANT this...but they can never listen to their precious music comfortably... without paying for aftermarket earphones! Mwuh-huh-huh!!!"  When we see the launching of an Apple product that does not include a fatal flaw, we will know at last mankind has reconciled with the psyche of Jobs.

<Title>Amazing!
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this iPod! I got it for Christmas and it is just the best!  It is easy to put songs and photos on it, charges WHILE you are putting songs on, super compact, and not only great for on the go, but great if you want to play some games, look at pictures without going through the trouble of finding your photo albums, you can listen to music at the same time, if you are in a place with no electricity or at a sleapover or something with no clock you can adjust the date and time along with the city, set "to do's" and "notes" along with calenders, and you basically have your own little compact organizer!    I personaly think that this iPod is overrated, I mean this is great, but I'm sure that there are a lot of nice and maybe even NICER things other than this although it is great, but the first thing that comes to people's minds are "iPod!" But it IS a really great product.    It has a long lasting battery... 24 hours!    I don't think that the earbuds aren't good because of the iPod, I think that earbuds are just uncomfortable and aren't good in general. Plus, you can just buy a pair of headphones that you can find for cheap.   The sound is great, really clear and everything is always organized.  Overall, I think it is really nice to just have.  Hope this helps!

<Content>This is my first experience with any type of ipod device. Downloading music onto it is a breeze as well as removing the ones you might change your mind about later, although getting pictures onto it has been challenging. However, the manual is in .pdf form and is quite helpful. There are games, a calendar and lots of other goodies. It's a combination of a Palm and MP3 in one in many ways.  The sound quality is phenomenal and while you listen, it is though the artist is right next to you. Not bad for 2GB and 500 songs!   Downloading free podcasts from the iTunes store is also a nice feature, whether you want to learn Spanish or famous speeches. Although the Nano does not have video capacity, you can download video podcasts that you can watch on your computer, just as though it were on Windows Media Player and then erase them as you go.  Overall, this is a great value for your money. Enjoy.

<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just received my Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Silver (2nd Generation) today. I am very pleased with Amazon so far. Amazon told me that I would receive my iPod nano between late January and Early Febuary (they were out of stock), and I received it Dec. 27.   I like the 2nd gen nano much more than the 1st. the battery lasts almost twice as long, the screen is brighter, and the aluminum design is much more scratch resistant, and even a little lighter. The only minor annoyane that I found is that the LCD screen is unprotected, unlike the original nano, which had that layer of plastic over it.   I do wish that the 2 GB nano came in the same colors that the 4 GB ones come in. I have no need for more than 2, but I would have liked it to be in a color, like green. I find this to be one of Apple's schemes; trying to make us spend another fifty dollars.   I am very happy with my new nano. I have to say, I like the iPods much more than any other mp3 player. The click wheel is handy, easy to work with, and fun. I also love the sleek design. I recomend Apple iPods of any sort to anyone who wants to pay a little extra for something that can hold a minimum of 500 songs and adiobooks and 10's of thousands of digital pictures in an attractive way to show off to friends.

This completely does not work for me since I use it at the gym with audiobooks. So now I am using the wheel to fast forward...at 20 second intervals which is not how it is supposed to be either...my mini jumped forward in much larger intervals so can only think this feature is not working on the Nano correctly either. Completely frustrated but I'll trade it for another. Apple gets one more chance and then I'm moving to another mp3 player.

<Title>IPOD, 2G
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great little product, and it's nice and small.  The product was really easy to get up and running, although I have still continued to have issues getting an Internet access directly from the iTunes application.  For the price, the product is what I expected from this technology.  If I needed more, I'd buy one of the newer iPods.

<Title>IPOD 2gb
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>An IPOD is to my kids and grandkids as 8-Track Cassette players were to me in my teenage years. A "must have" these days. With 500 song capacity I think a 2gb IPOD is plenty of capacity. 500 songs? WOW! What will they come up with next?

<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you've never owned an mp3 player before, and are looking for a no-brainer, this is a great one to consider.  It's so tiny and light that you barely remember you've got it on you (still have dents from where your Walkman would bang into your body as you ran?) My only beef with it would be that I've had trouble finding a compatible adapter for my car.

<Title>Incredible
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I think that the Apple iPod is the best thing that's happened to portable media players.  It revolutionized how the device was set up.....especially this version.  Small, yet quite durable, these little buggers can hold a lot of music, and iTunes sets up the player so effortlessly that there is no need of panic.  It is almost completely dummyproof!  With that said, it will freeze up on the best of us, and all that's needed is a quick switch of the hold button and a press of the menu and select buttons, resetting the device and resuming your magnificent device to work. No, I am not being paid for this review....I'm a student in college....but the fact that it plays music so well (and can also view your text files onscreen....so you can stud for exams!)....makes it the best there is. Most definitely a worthwhile buy.

<Title>Great Nano!
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved my 1 gig nano so much that I bought a 2 gig silver nano for my husband.  It has plenty of memory to hold all the songs he wants on it and then some.  Nice small, sleek size, no hard drive to damage if it gets dropped, and is easy to operate.  That's why I choose the nano - no hard drive.  I jog a lot and wanted something to listen too that could handle getting jostled and treated roughly without breaking.  Bright, clear, colorful screen with tons of options - like datebook, pictures, etc...  The nano is perfect!  Good price too.  Easy to sync with the PC and download any songs you want, or load them from your personal CD collection.  You do need a computer if you want to use an iPod, and I suspect most people buying iPods have personal PC's.  Absolutely no complaints about this little gem of technology!

<Title>Very good for first-time ipod owners..
<Date>Sun Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>[Disclaimer: I'm not a kid]  First of all, I've only had the ipod Nano 2GB for only about two weeks, but I already can't imagine how I got through those "bored" or "waiting" moments before. Everyone used to say "How can you live without an ipod?" and I would just reply "It's a little pathetic if you can't go ONE day without your nano." But now I understand how useful this prodect really can be.  Aesthetics: From what I've read here this generation is much, much better as far as durability goes;However, I chose to buy a silicone skin just in case..[I couldn't bare to see a scratch..]  Interface: Very simple. Perhaps to simple for some, but I prefer this look. Just blue on white. Shows a little picture of the "album art" when you buy anything from iTunes.  iTunes: I think this is actually the reason why the nano [Well, I guess an ipod in general] is great for first-time mp3 player owners. Yes, it may be a bit slow importing CDs, but it's very easy to do and understandable. Most first-time owners probably wouldn't have to deal much with converting files [etc.] because a lot of their music would either be imported or bought from the iTunes store. In this way, iTunes is beneficial to novice mp3 player users.  Charging: The first time it took about 3 hours. I've seen a little bit of hostility over this fact, some say that the nano should come charged right out of the box, which would be nice, but is it really THAT much of an inconvience? Even to the point where it becomes a deal-breaker? I don't think so at all. After the first charge it takes about an hour to fully charge and the charge lasts maybe 10 hours [I'm not sure I've never run the battery dead] As long as you don't keep the backlight on for more than 5-10 seconds.  Storage space: This, in my opinion, is one of the nano's only faults. Apple advertises this as "2 GB" when in reality it's about "1.78 GB" because they take up space for the interface.[etc.]Not a HUGE deal, but people should be aware of this, because for some people it matters.  Earbuds: They're terrible. But what do you expect? No company is going to give you more than they have to. I found this a bit ironic since the whole point of having an ipod is to listen to music [you think they could give you decent quality earbuds] but oh well. Tip: Don't try to shove them in your ears. The first week I did that and my ears hurt very badly after about an hour. Put them in gently an they'll be much more agreeable.  Click Wheel: Amazing. Makes life so much easier. No problems at all.  Conclusion: Have a positive attitude and you'll probably discover that the ipod nano 2GB has many more pros than cons. Give it a chance. You won't be dissapointed.

<Title>Best MP3 player out there- no doubt about it
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this Ipod as a Xmas gift, and I think it's awesome. It holds up to 500 songs, which is just plenty. It also holds podcasts and photos, and it's the only ipod compatible with the new Nike accesorie that you can buy for it. I love how thin it is, it fits nice and snug in my pocket. It it also hard to break AND hard scratch because of the titanium outer shell.I've dropped it many times and it still looks like it just came out of the package. There's really only one problem I had with it, and that is that it requires Itunes 7.0 or higher, which took kind of a long time for me to download on my computer (if you have broadband, than it should be no problem downloading.). Besides that one con, I think this device is Flawless, take my word for it. This MP3 player is completly worth your money.

<Content>The Nano is easy to use, great for working out motivation, and alot of fun to share favorite music.  It would be great if it came with instructions on how to download music, add or delete music.  Also, the only thing I would like to see is that you could lock the volume.  The volume adjusts very easily, and when I'm working out it tends to rise easily.

<Title>Incompatible with many sources

<Content>I am very disappointed with this portable device. I bought it primarily to download audiobooks from commercial audio book sellers or from a libary system in Oregon which rents downloaded books for 10 days.   I have discovered that because of the Ipod's proprietary software, programs used by the library system and some of the major on-line audio book sellers cannot be downloaded to that unit.  Even such common files as Windows Media Files are not downloadable.  THe WMF software for syncing files does not recognize the presence of the "portable device".

With 2 GB of storage, you can store around 500 songs and alot of photos. You can even view your photos as a slideshow, complete with transitions. The click-wheel is intuitive and easy to use.   Battery-life has been improved (up to 24-hour playback now) from the 1st Generation Nanos and there is a handy on-screen battery indicator.  The all-aluminum body feels solid in your hand and does not get scratched easily.

However, you do have to have a credit card to use your iTunes credit, which is kind of weird.  It is perfect for the gym, or for the car when he wants to listen to his Green Day and you want to listen to your Drive by Truckers.  The battery charges quickly and stays charged a really long time.  There are bigger, better iPods, but for a young user or recreational user, this is the perfect choice.

<Content>I have been very pleased with the Apple iPod Nano.  The display is quite bright and easy-to-read. Navigation is logical and intuitive.  Even though I bought the 2 GB model (as opposed to the 4 GB), I am able to include 2 to 4 audiobooks, 2-3 classical music albums, and a couple of dozen photos.  Using the iPod with iTunes, on an iMac Intel, was as expected - quite easy. I did not like the ear buds that came with the iPod - hard to fit in my ears.  Instead, I use Sony over-the-ear ear buds which I find much more comfortable.

<Content>The iPod itself is perfect -- everything I had hoped for.  My only complaint is the ear-buds fit very tightly; it's either my fat ears or the size of the buds, but the sound is first class, as are the size and ease of use.  For the price the 2-Gig memory is plenty for my use (songs from my CD's).  I think it would be convenient to have an optional lapel clip but the unit is small and light and almost disappears in my shirt pocket.  The length of the ear-bud cord is plenty as well.  All in all, I'm very satisfied with this unit.  You may want to purchase after-market earphones just for the comfort, not because of degraded sound quality from the stock buds.

Also beware, this iPOD doesnt have an AC adapter to charge it, you have to charge via the USB port, i didnt know that...good thing i have another older iPOD that i can use the AC adapter to charge.  You def get what you pay for, and thats size, amazingly small.  Great buy!!

<Content>I recently bought this for my fiancee and she loves it. The sound quality is superb and the size allows it to be put anywhere. The only drawback and the reason i only gave it 4 stars is that you have to use iTunes. I'm a PC user and iTunes is a royal pain to get used to and is almost counter-intuitive at times. But other than that it was one of the few purchases i've been completely satisfied with.

<Content>I had already bought two of these at Wal-Mart for $147.88 each plus tax thinking I had gotten the best price. My dad mentioned checking Amazon and I found these for $136 with no tax, no shipping. I saved $32 total. (Worth it to me!)The iPods work great. I bought one for my almost 8 year old daughter and my 10 year old son. They love them. The iPods are so small you can take them anywhere. You can also download their favorite CDs onto the iPod-you don't have to get all your songs by paying for them. Amazon even had some great iPod nano covers/protectors with my son's favorite NBA player and some pink bling for my daughter.

<Content>My 13-year-old daughter left her Shuffle in her pants pocket and washed it.  The Nano is a little more difficult to miss.  Plus, the importance of having a screen cannot be overlooked.  If you simply want a lightweight music player for exercising, go with the Shuffle.  The Nano, however, is the cheapest way to get a good mp3 player.

<Title>I like it but need a bigger one
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So I got the 2gig nano for christmas last year ('06) and for the most part it's worked quite well.    I read through all of the 1-star reviews and it seems there's a lot of bias and stupity involved.  I would expect there be a small percentage to be faulty.  That's just manufacturer error.  But most of the complaints seem to be about expecting a lot more from the ipod than it's designed for.  Perhaps lots of rough handling too.  Many just seem to denigrate it in order to promote a competing product.    Don't get me wrong, my ipod function hasn't been flawless.  But it's been better than I expected.    I'll list the bad things first: -Battery life.  It seems to be very temperature sensitive.  If my nano got really cold such as in the winter it might lose all of its charge.  I can see where the metal chassis wouldn't be much help here.  Thoughout this summer though it's been much better.  I tend to charge it once a week but only listen to it for maybe 5-10 hours total in that week.  There have been times when only a day or so after giving it a full charge it went completely dead.  But I plug it into the charger, give it time to charge up the battery and reset it and it works again.  Rechargeable batteries are not designed to last forever which is one of the downsides for sure.  I'll be interested to see how long it lasts.  It's been going for almost nine months now.  Typically though a full charge tends to last about 8 hours of use.  This also depends on how much the display is lit up as that drains the battery much faster.  I set my backlight on for no more than 5 seconds.  Plus you must lock it for extended use as it lights up everytime something rubs the controls.  -Ear Buds - I got the newer ones but sadly they didn't fit my ears very well.  I never liked the white ear buds anyway.  I could tell right away they sounded terrible.  I went and bought a set of $40 Sony ear buds with 3 different size rubber plugs.  They sound MUCH better.  Better ear plugs are a must!  Now I know most people have never even HEARD of a headphone amp but they do exist.  The tiny little chip in the ipod used to drive the ear buds is ok but pales when compared to a good headphone amp. (Headphone.com)   I have a few quibbles with iTunes but have gotten used to its shortcomings and have learned to accept its limitations.  For the best sound quality you really need to convert your songs to Apple Lossless or AIFF.  I use the former.  It takes up 10 times more space though so there is a price to pay.  I prefer better sound quality over the convenience of having hundreds of songs available.  This limits me to roughly 60-70 songs on the 2gig nano.  This is why my next one will probably be the 80gig ipod.  The default on iTunes though is AAC which makes for nice small files but it compresses the life right out of the music!  To sum up, it's not perfect.  But given its limitations it's not terrible either.  Once again for the best sound quality you need better headphones, convert your music to Apple Lossless, and for the best effect get a headphone amp.  One last thing, the newer Alpine Car stereos work very well and sound great even with the AAC files.  They must have a better digital converter or something.  Cheers!

<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I must agree with it being counter intuitive. I have a Sansa and use Windows media player. The windows system is so easy. Windows has a simple column labled Sync that allows you to simply drag songs from the library into that column and press sync. Windows Media player is so logical and well laid out; not to mention very colorful (check it out). Ipod and I-tunes are frustrating. I hate that Ipod will not work with windows. The I tunes system needs to take a look at windows. Overall I recommend Sansa over Ipod. I gave it three stars because I compared it to another MP3 player I own.

<Title>iPod's Great...Headphones notta
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This review isn't for the iPod as much as it is for the headphones included... The ipod works fine, I love it. The problem is that my headphones have gone bad...by now I've had to throw them away. The headphones started breaking down a little while ago when one of the earpeices was making a deafening buzzing sound for no reason--I ended up cutting that headphone off. The other (I could only listen with one ear) worked okay until yesterday, when it actually shocked me in my ear. Very painful. I don't have an earwax problem, and the headphones were covered in the little black foam pads included. But really--the thing shocked the inside of my ear, almost like the feeling of touching an electric fence, but INSIDE YOUR EAR.. I have to get new headphones. I don't know if it's just mine (it may not be, because this has happened to a few people I know) but if you're gonna get this, be careful with the headphones. Or just get some new ones. Getting shocked in the ear hurts, people. Trust me!

The tracking number for USPS that was sent to me from amazon was the same Tracking number that appears on the letter...  BE AWARE!!!! I just call customer service and they sent me another iPod via 2 days delivery shipping ( I've never received the first iPod) The girl from the customer service did an excellent work and solved my problem.

Learning to adjust the volume has been a real hassle for me, the Shuffle was much easier to adjust and to keep in the desired setting.

<Title>Warning to globe trotters; the worst music software
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Nano is everything its fans say it is: slick, well designed, plays forever on a charge.  But globe trotters should note: you can manage the Nano's music only through a computer loaded with iTunes.  Also, you can't plug it into an outlet to charge; the USB plug goes into a computer.  If you're not taking a laptop, it might not work for you.  iTunes is the worst music management software of all time.  Years ago I converted all my CD's to MP3's, and have them arranged on my computer.  I cannot transfer a folder on my hard drive, say "Beatles," to a folder in iTunes: you can transfer either one file at a time or, if you transfer an entire folder, it puts the songs in the Library with everything else.  And it doesn't arrange them neatly at the end of the Library; it spews them all over, so you have to hunt for them one by one.  To make matters worse, it strips off whatever name you've given the MP3 and replaces it with "Track 3" etc.  And iTunes won't let you change a track' name; it's Track 3--along with 1,000 other Track 3's--forever.  If you delete a file from your ipod, iTunes deletes it from the library too, whether you want it to or not.  And there's no way to stop a song from playing while in iTunes; no black square that means "stop playing."  The worst!!

<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This purchase is replacing a Creative Labs MP3 player that had an FM transmitter and the same memory. The I-pod is lighter, easier to sync and sounds 10 times better than any other product that I tried. The new generation has a much better battery life than my wife's 1st generation Nano. The only negative for me is that the ear buds fall out of my ears so I went back to a pair of Sony headphones that wrap around my ears. I wish iTunes was more compatable with other formats because I have to burn songs from WMP9 to a disc and then import them with iTunes. Other than that a great product, I can't wait for the iPhone.

<Content>The Apple DRM sucks, like all DRM sucks, but the integration between the player (ipod) and the software (iTunes) can not be beat.  Sound quality is alright with standard headphones and good but not great with higher end headphones. Battery life is awesome, and seals the deal for me.  I run with it all the time and I can not even feel it in my pocket. Considering the iPhone will be out in six months, you are going to want a smaller ipod for times you do not want to carry a cell phone.  Get this product as the perfect companion to the robust iPhone.

<Title>A Great 2nd iPod
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this one for my wife as she can't pry my hands from my original video iPod. Apple's atttention to detail shines in every part of this device-- from the experience of opening the package through to loading it with music and photos. Nice bright screen that I pre-loaded with family photos, ample storage since it doesn't handle video, and the iPod's famous ease of use and interface.  This was the first Apple product my PC-using wife has ever used (a very well-received Christmas gift). She's on the way to recognizing what she's been missing.

<Title>iPod lives up to my expectations
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you like to listen to music, and love, as I have come to love, the convenience of podcast subscriptions, iPod is a great product. I use mine all the time at home and while travelling. It makes bringing my digital music files simple to carry along, and the iPod nano is a well designed product. I will buy another one in future that has more memory, but my 2GB nano has plenty for what I need it for at the moment. I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for an MP3 player!

<Title>Apple Nano 2G  I-Pod
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very happy with my I'pod.  I printed out the instructions provided on the webb but I still had some problems when I downloaded some of my CD's onto iTunes and then to the Nano.  The problem I had was then taking off the songs I didn't want on the Nano.  I did figure it out.  I still am trying to figure out how to change some songs that were titled Track 1 etc. etc.  I want to replace them with the artist and title of song.  I probably have to rename them in iTunes and then synce them again, but haven't tried that yet.  I love the sound that comes out of the ear buds, almost as good as a high priced stereo system.  I can't wait till my budget will allow me to purchase a Bose docking system so I can share my music with everyone.  There is so much to learn on this fantastic I-Pod and hopefully will figure everything out in my lifetime.

<Content>Ladies n gentlemen out there, this is it. The perfect remastered music player. Where you choose the 2gb silver (my choice) or the colored 4gb ones, or the top of the line blackie (beautiful, but expensive), the 2nd generation nano is the best little player out there. Functionality is awesome and so intuitive, design is a masterpiece, sounds excelent, and the size and weight.. perfect. I mean why hang around with a bulky, heavy ipod whose hard disk is bound to fail within a year? the truth is, if you need so much storage space I suggest you get a laptop and stuff it with all you've got. Bur real portability means small, slick and lightweight, and thats what this little guy's got.. big time. Long live the little nano..the best music player out there. period.

<Title>good for what it does
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this because everyone else seemed to be happy with theirs. It is solid, and has an nice interface. My problems with it are as follows - it has less features then nearly every other mp3 player on the market, and you can not change the battery with out having apple do it for you (it costs as much as the nano to have it replaced). Batteries only last a few years, so this item is really a consumable. If you dont care about the many features that most other players (of nearly the same size) have (radio, voic recording, etc..) and you dont care that it has a limited life then get it. The build quality, and interface are nice.   Pros: well built, and nice interface Cons lacks features, limited life

The screen and scratch problems have been taken care of with this update.

<Title>Exceptional Value
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This review is for those of you that have not yet made the I-iPod plunge.  I was a bit late to the game myself on this one.  My children, and their friends, really led the way on this.  Now that I am finally all in, I cannot say enough about the various uses of the iPod, and its overall ease of use.  In addition to being able to download the latest and greatest from iTunes, you can also put any of your own existing CD collection on your iPod.  I personally take advantage of the many available books on CD.  I have downloaded audio books from various sites on the Internet.  In fact, I do not have an iPod/MP3 adaptor in my car, so I purchased a device that allows me to play my iPod via the radio.  This really is an incredible device that is well-worth the price.  To not have an iPod in today's day and age is a bit like not having a VCR or Microwave in the 80's.  By the way, putting songs/books on your iPod is very intuitive.  Once or twice will teach you how to do it.  If you have a problem, just have a teenager give you a brief class.  This is a 5 star product.

<Title>IPod Nano is a hit!
<Date>Tue Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my IPod Nano that I purchased.  Their were certain reasons that I ordered this specific IPod, the most important reason being it's size.  I run and work out with weights, so I needed a MP3 player that was small in size, but that could hold a lot of music.  The Itunes program makes it easy to download my favorite songs off my CDs, plus I can purchase songs through the internet.  I really do not care to watch videos, so this model fit the bill.  I reccommend purchasing an aftermarket armband that the IPod can fit in.  My workouts are much more productive now that I have my IPod to listen to.

This device is simple to use simple to load and has wonderful sound.  I have a cable that hooks it to my radio and allows me to listen to Audible books. If you wish to do this, be aware that Audible and Amazon offer an amazing discount on your first device. Do not be confused by the "small" memory.  My 2 gigabites stores dozens of books, over 100 songs, concertii by the score.  What's more, the price has recently dropped!

<Title>Need better marketing people
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally broke down and bought one of these, based on recommendations by fellow musicians.  I wish the people who make these devices would be more aware that people other than 19 year old mindless fans of pop music are interested in carrying around their personal music collections.  I was TOTALLY turned OFF by i-pod in the past because the advertising focuses on downloading "songs" from their i-tunes, etc...  Does that mean I can download over 500 symphonies, operas, or piano concertos, too? I wish they'd clarify what 500 "songs" means.  Is a five hour opera one "song?"  I will find out when I get the thing in the mail.  But, at any rate, I wish they'd rethink their marketing, and try to cater to a wider public, rather than the uneducated masses. And, by the way, a symphony, piano piece, chamber work, etc. is not a "song!"  Thanks for letting me spew.  Fed up with pop music, and those that perpetuate it....

<Title>very good product
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The two gb Nano is a very good product. It has many features such as an alarm clock, games, and calender. The Nano itself is very easy to use and being a first mp3 owner I really like the portability and wide range of music avalable. The space on my Ipod filled up suprisingly fast so if your music library is large you may want to go with a model with more capacity.You have to download Itunes from the Apple website and it took me several tries on my home PC. The Ipod is geared mostly towerds Mac users so if you have a PC than you will have a little bit of a harder time getting your Ipod going.The only thing I don't like about the Nano is the fact that Apple moved the head phone jack and made the Nano slightly longer than the first generation Nano. These changes made getting a case and other acsessories a lot harder than it should have been. Overall the Nano is a very good product and it is compleatly worth the money.

<Title>Love it except...
<Date>Tue Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my ipod nano for mothers day less than a month ago. I thought it was great except when it froze up. Looks like I'm not the only one who experienced this inconvenience. If there was an instruction book, I'd have been somewhat comforted. I had to use trial and error and finally reset it by holding down the top two buttons. Which then erased all my stuff and I had to set it all up again. Last night, when it got stuck, I tried this trick again and my stuff was still there. Makes me nervous with an item that was not (imo) cheap. I also have trouble turning it off. Again, an instruction booklet would have been helpful. I think you need to pause whatever you're listening to and then go back to the beginning screen and then hold down the bottom button. At least that worked last time. Otherwise, it's a great little invention.

<Content>Yeah - it's cool, it's sleek, it's powerful, but it drains the life out of its little battery very quickly. Make sure you have virus protection on your computer because the iPods are susceptible to viruses. And if it doesn't light up or work at all, have no fear - it's just the battery. Give it a day and then recharge it again. Once it gets going, it is very, very cool. I highly recommend a home system to play songs on - it can be very impressive for such a tiny thing.

<Title>Not same quality as 4th gen iPods, but still the winning design 
<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Pros: It has the perfect design - both hardware and software. Its minuscule size and excellent music management software iTunes makes up for the missing Bluetooth & WiFi. Great sound and battery life too. Not as expensive as previous generations of iPod.  Cons: Not same hardware quality as older Apple products - I bought two 2nd gen nanos last week - the 2GB and 8GB. I've owned a few Apple products for years now and I noticed that the quality of the new nano is not as robust as the previous iPods or other Apple devices. The hold button on 2GB nano is loose. The 8GB black had a flimsy wheel that won't stay put. A click felt like 2 clicks, and soon started to make funny sounds as if its going to fall apart. I eventually had to return and get a replacement twice ! I had a similar experience with another Apple product (not iPod) a month ago, the 1st piece was defective so had to replace the next day.  Conclusion: With the price-performance factor, I still give nano 5 stars since in the big schema of things, its a superb MP3 device, specially because its music management software iTunes works much better than others (which by the way is one of the big reasons for iPod's success). It is VERY easy to transfer music to your iPod and that is a big time saver, especially if you plan to change your playlists or download new podcasts everyday.  Bottom Line: I highly recommend iPod nanos. I just wish that Apple paid tad more attention to the hardware quality. Make sure you test your piece well as soon as you get it. You would love listening to your music on it.

<Content>I have to recommend this product, because of its overall look, feel and ease of use. I have owned 3 Ipod products and have never had to return one, take it in for repair or have it break.    Pros: -Easy to put music onto, easy to make playlists. -Durable, great for workouts or jogging -Extra feature set is very nice for an mp3 player -stylish appearance -New rugged material, like IPOD Mini  Cons: -the ability to put different file formats on -no ability to get your own mp3s off your ipod, unless they are purchased from itunes and those are mp4's. -color choices? Why did apple take away black/white in all sizes?  I have the 30 gig video and have owned a silver 4 gig mini.  I loved both and they do a great job of what they should: Playing your music when you want to hear it!  I think no electronics product is "perfect", of course there will be some that come off the line with flaws/issues, thats part of being a consumer.  I used to own a Sandisk mp3 player for the gym and honestly it has nothing on the Ipod Nano...  If anyone is interested in a Used 2gb Ipod Nano with 250 Songs, check Ebay item #:  230032366669

<Title>Very Hard to Setup with I Tunes 7 in Windows XP
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I am a Microsoft Certified Professional, it took me 3 days to finally make my iPod to sync. First, I downloaded iTunes 7, but then I couldn't install it with error 2793. That was it, only error code, no communications. I tried to re-downlaod iTunes, uninstall it and re-install it. Still not working. So I googled to find iTunes 6, which I was able to install. Then it didn't suppor this version of Nano. After all these, I finally found the answer on Apple.com, obviously, this must be common issue for them. I have to go to Microsoft.com to download the newer version of Visual Basic script. Then modified my Windows Registry entry to apply this VBS. After all that, I was then able to install this stupid iTunes 7.  Then, it wouldn't found my iPod. It shows up in Windows, but not in iTunes. So I had to go to apple.com to try everything they suggested, still no goal. BTW, Apple has a long list of how-to instruction on how to fix this KNOWN issue.  On the third day, I gave up and brough the iPod with me to work, installed iTunes on my work PC. Then it finally recongized my iPod, but it said my iPod had to be restored. So I tried to restore it. Then iTune kept saying that it couldn't find my software update server, which was installed by iTune as a package.  I had to uninstall iTunes, re-installed it again, then this time it finally worked.  I usually charge people $25/hr to fix their computer problems, if I have to paid for someone to fix my iPod, it will cost me over $200 to make it sync with my computer.  It really sucks.

<Title>Wow this thing is small! I Love it!
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Very small, very thin and very powerful. I love it. It put all my songs onto it (180) in less than 4 mins. Song quality is excellent. Easy to use. Very touch sensitive wheel. The best Mp3 Player out there. People have complained that the 2GB only comes in silver, well big whop. LOL. I don't buy an Mp3 player for the color, I but it for its functionality, sound quality and ease of use. This is my first ipod. APPLE YOU ARE BRILLIANT!!!

<Title>Not worth the effort
<Date>Thu Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I deciede to get this ipod because my mp3 player stopped working. It is a pain in the neck to even get the songs you want on the thing. When i tried to do this all it did was just put random songs from my libary on it because it has only 1Gb of storage. I went to itunes help about how to put songs on my ipod and i follow the directions but it did not work. After the second time i plugged it in to my computer it said that the ipod was damage and i would have to go to there website and refresh the dam thing. Speaking of Itunes it took them more then a day to put my Wma music files into it which consists of 4gbs of songs. Also it takes itunes longer to copy cds into your libary. I checked back at a cd i was coyping and after 20 minutes only half of the cd was copied. Another thing that bugs the hell out of me about is the wheel you use to navigate the ipod. What also gets on my nerves is that you cant put batteries in it, Apple does this because the want to make money on the replacement of the charger on your ipod. Luckily i got this at Target which has a good return policy. I have a very slow computer and all but Windows Media copys music files way faster then itunes and is alot easier to use. Ipods can be very expensive with all the stuff you have to buy for it and it is stupid that you cant put music on it you got from other music sites like Napster. My advice is to get a cheap Mp3 player becasue they all break down anyways or stick to portable cd players.   review updated on 9/5/07 i know so much more about itunes now then i did when i bought this player If i were to buy it again i can easily get it to work but why bother. Apple is coming out with a new one with 4GB of storage and it also plays videos and games it will cost the same price as this one. When my shuffle's battery dies i will get this new one.

<Content>Ipod is great.  My problem is with the shipping that Amazon used.  I live 40 miles from an Amazon warehouse center, but they shipped my Ipod from 1200 miles away.  My Ipod was promised to be delivered on Dec 22.  Plenty of time for Christmas, but due to a blizzard in Denver, and their choice of warehouses to ship it out of, my gift did not arrive until the 26th.  Very disappointing.

<Date>Sun Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought each of my teens this IPOD for Christmas.  It was a surprise.  They both wanted on but guessed I wouldn't make the splurge.  I had waited to purchase one of these because I am not one to hunt things down anymore and chase hard to find items especially with so many other MP3s available.  I've purchased other, less expensive IPODs but none got the excitement that this one has generated.  And here we are nearly a month after Christmas and they are still going strong.  I highly recommend the case for them - my son I got him the acrylic case.  It has enough storage.  A good companion gift is the iTunes gift card.

<Title>first MP3 player-old dog/new tricks
<Date>Sat Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am 48 years old and have never owned an MP3 player before. Prior to this, I saw the MP3 player as  one of those gadgets that teenagers were always fiddling with.  I finally learned that with an MP3 player I could just buy the songs I wanted and not the whole CD, so that is why I decided to look into them.  I could not care less about "brand names" and did not have any preference towards any of the players as I knew nothing about them.   I was looking at Zune, Ipod, and creative (the three main ones that I could find) and did a lot of reading up on of them before I bought the Nano.  All three sounded good and it was a tough choice.  In the end, I bought the Nano because:  1.  I did not like the sound of the $15 dollar "rental" fee that Microsoft charges for the Zune.  If you want a song permanently, you have to buy it in addition to the rental fee.  I don't like the sound of the points system, either. 2.  Ipods come different models and sizes.  The Nano was the size and price that best suited my buget. 3.  Ipod Itunes has more music than the others, and music is my main use. 4.  I already had a satellite radio boombox  that also doubled as an Ipod player, saving me the expensive of buying an additional player for one of the other MP3's.  5.  The Creative was harder to find in my area.   I just began using the Nano today and am thrilled with the purchase.  I bought a prepaid music card and used it immediately.  I had no trouble at all with installing software, purchasing, or downloading the music.  The Ipod sceen is somewhat small, but easy to see and navigate. The click wheel is also nice, a little hard to get used to, but very fast.  There is a "hold" button that you can use to prevent the device from accidently turning on.  There is a clock and calender included.   I cannot believe something this fun comes in such a small package!!  (But I guess that applies to all MP3's)  I wish these were around 30 years ago!  I am now a older person fiddling with a gadget.  I found the Apple web site to be very helpful with tutorials etc.  The information included with the Nano was not very helpful.  I also bought the Ipod and Itunes for Dummies book and have been very pleased with it.     I can see myself buying another in the future, but will also still consider Zune if I want to upgrade.

<Content>I know there is some controversy around the proprietary issues of the Ipod as well as Apple Itunes (why can't I play the music I got on Itunes with other players, etc?) - but I personally don't have any problem with this - They got it right with the Ipod, and it works SO SEAMLESSLY with Itunes, it's a joke.  Do yourself a favor, get an Ipod (at least the Nano) and give it a try.  You won't be dissappointed!

<Title>Apple really does have the best product
<Date>Fri Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Whenever I hear about one brand dominating the market I am always skeptical and look for alternative products where I can get a better value (price in relation to what you get). With Apple's iPOD I made no exception. I first bought the Creative Labs Zen 4G and was seriously disappointed with how many problems I had with the software. It froze more than 10 times on me and each time I had reformat the unit and reload everything which cost me 2 hours each time. Needless to say, I returned that unit and was so frustrated I thought I'd give the iPOD a try. To my delight this product has proven to be far superior! The hardware and software are super quality. I was able to 2Gs of music on the unit in less than 10 minutes! The unit has yet to freeze on me. The features on the unit are really good too. In how to organize your music, your are afforded just about every option (by song, artist, album, style, etc...). I was also delighted to discover games on the device too! It comes with Parachute, Solitaire, Music trivia, and Bricks. I love this thing and I'd hype it to anybody. I still don't like the price all that much, but you truly do get the best MP3 there is. Don't settle for inferior brands unless you are looking for hassle. Convenience, quality, and even value describe this product.

<Date>Sat Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>From my perspective (I'm a 10 year old) the iPod nano totally ROCKS! I own a Mac computer, and one of the main reasons why I like IPods are because they work with Macs, obviously since they are both made by apple. (They work with PCs, too, though).    Before I got my iPod, we looked at all the options, and iPods seemed like the right choice. We looked at iPod shuffles, videos, and every other model of iPod. SOme of my friends have Nanos, and they seemed to like them, so I got a 2gig. iPod Nano.  It works great, comes with games, iTunes is very easy, and I love the controls.  My parents also enjoy iTunes, because they can monitor what kind of songs I can download. Ipods ROCK!

<Content>I finally did it.  I got myself an iPod.  For the longest time, I'd see people on the train or walking down the street with one and I couldn't see that big deal.  Now that I have one, I found out what a big deal it is.  I am crazy about my iPod.    The Nano is small and compact and does all that I need for it to do.  I have music, photos, podcasts - and I can set up playlists for different occasions.  One of my most favored playlists is the one I set up for when I work out.  I have another with soft soothing music for relaxing.  I have several others.  On one occasion when I turned it on to listen to music, it froze and wouldn't do anything.  I merely synced it again and it worked fine.  From speaking with other iPod owners, they say that has happened once or twice so I don't think it's a problem specific to the Nano.  I'm still learning all of its features and how to use these features, but I have a new play toy.  I feel like a kid at Christmastime.  Maybe some time later, I'll upgrade to a bigger one that can handle video.    For now, I just need a docking station so I can listen to it at home without headphones.

<Content>I wish I held onto my Apple stock. I still don't understand why everyone using Apple computers.??? Well, one thing's for sure . . . almost everyone is using some form of Apple's iPod! The Nana is great at a great price and Amazon is the place to buy it from. What could be improved about it? What feature is it missing? I French Maid to do my uploads. Buy it!!!

<Title>Get a Zen instead
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my son a Creative Labs Zen 30GB (under $200) and my daughter the Nano ($149, it's what she wanted). When the two arrived, she regretted her choice. I regret it even more. I can buy and download music from almost anywhere for the Zen - no problem. The Nano is a dog. The less expensive music sites (e.g., Walmart) don't offer iPod-format tunes. Converting them is a bear and waste of time. Apple has ripped customers off for 20 years. I remember the "IBM-Big Brother" SuperBowl ad way back when. Turns out Apple is Big Brother. Incompatibilities among its own products. Doesn't play nice with other hardware and software. Locks customers into proprietary formats. Fixes prices (ever see an iPod discounted?). Can't wait for the Feds to investigate - one of these days. I wish I'd bought two Zens -- there's a great product. Don't waste your $$ on a proprietary system like iPod, no matter how "hip" it is.

<Title>A critical opinion
<Date>Mon Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to own the Rio MP3 player by Sonic until it broke. After reading all the positive reviews on this page and all the hype, I expected a similar and even better designed user interface and trouble free connection to PC. I was quite disappointed:  1. My PC (XP with no SP2) freezes after I plugged the USB in. It freezes for several seconds whenever I try to view IPOD drive using explorer. After I managed to copy some mp3 files to the IPOD drive and unplugging the IPOD, I cannot see or play any! It was not until then I realized I had to download and install the 37MB iTune software to be able to transfer mp3 files to ipod.  2. The Apple click touch pad wheel drives me nuts. When you are playing a mp3 file, and go back to the menu, I don't think I am the only one who gets frustrated when mistakenly clicks on the &lt;&lt; or >> key while using the trouch scroll wheel. What a disasterous user-interface design to put two totally un-related functions on one button, and requiring user to fine control his finger pressure!  3. It's also inconvenient that you cannot change volume when browsing other files. It would have been much better if there were some volume control buttons on the side like Rio.   4. Again the touch wheel volume control is totally a disaster and you will find yourself constantly having to switch on the key lock on the top to prevent the volume fluctuates when you want to hold it in hand without having to worry about not touching the wheel, or when you want to put it into your pocket.   I will give it one star for the much larger capacity than my old Rio and another star for the adorable shape and color.  P.S. The "newly designed" earbuds initially hung well to my ears but they soon got greasy and started to fall off. I found that I need to clean them using detergent so the thin rubber ring regain traction. I never had to do this for any other earbuds I owned before.  P.S. I am getting used to the click wheel and now can better control my finger pressure. The click wheel comes in handy when you use the search function, but is not better than normal buttons for other uses in my opinion.   Despite the above shortcomings, ipod nano 2nd gen is still the only mp3 player with metal case and flash drive, which makes it light, quiet and feel good in your hands. The green one which I have is very beautiful with the green goes so well with the white color cord. Nobody really needs tens of GB for only mp3s, so it is a better choice than the aluminum case creative zen with 20GB hard drive.

<Title>Apple 2 GB iPod Nano (2nd Generation) Silver
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love it...as a busy mom of 4 girls, I do not have much time to myself, when I do, I go to the gym, and the sound from this iPod is amazing!! You hear layers of music that you don't really notice when listening to your car stereo etc, the sound is so great! Having it makes it easier to get through my cardio routine, I actually find myself working out longer to finish out a song sequence etc.  I had an old generation shuffle and actually ended up giving it away, but I love the Nano and the artwork that shows up on the screen for each song. Plus, its really easy to navigate through the controls whether it's just to change songs or volume.  I don't even have to look at it anymore to do it.  You barely have to touch the control for audio control.  I was worried about buying 2GB instead of 4GB....but so far I have not even filled 25% of memory when I sync the songs I want on it, 2GB is alot more music space than it sounds like.  It's also great to dock on a docking station when you're busy at home.  Total thumbs up on this one!

<Title>sound quality poor
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's a very nice looking player and works well in terms of adding songs and navigation and all that but the most important thing by far for me is sound and the sound to my ears was terrible. Very weak bass and just sounds wrong and lifeless. Gave it to someone else who liked it. I'm going to look at some other players like iaudio, iriver and zen and samsung.

<Title>Unbelievable
<Date>Fri May 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Can you believe it? I have had this just short of a month and it already does not function properly. I have been unable to turn it off and cannot do so after repeated attempts. I still have my receipt and am taking it to an apple store to see if either they can fix it or give me a new one. I hope they do because if they dont I will swear off apple and ipods forever. I thought these things were a bit sturdier and I have barely used mine and have treated it very carefully. Shoddy.

The non-existent directions that came with it were of no help, but I have enough friends that have them, that they were able to walk me thru it.  Very lightweight...nice sound....just wish there were better directions with it.

<Title>Locks after a month
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first the ipod nano seems fine: the itunes software is easy to use - many song purchase choices, the ipod click wheel is cool, the playlists you can create allow for a lot of organization in your collections, but if you are going to actually use the player after the first fews weeks when the initial excitement wears down, it may be a different story.  It has been for me.    I've already returned one of these, for the same reasons I'll describe here.  I started with the 4 gig and returned it for 2 gig hoping the problem was that Apple failed on the larger storage scale, but both sizes have the same problem - the 4 gig started having problems after 2 weeks of use, the 2 gig after 4 weeks of use.    NEVER ENDING PROBLEM:  the nano just starts to skip through songs never playing any of them - scrolls and scrolls -  can't be shut off till it runs through this scrolling behavior on the entire playlist it gets stuck on. Once it is finnally able to turn off, turning it back on, will start this scrolling thing again from whatever song is selected.  Then the games, start at one speed, and randomly change to slower and faster speeds during the same level of play.    The thing is just a mess.    I went on the troubleshooting discussion sites for users of this product and this condition is not uncommon. One temporary remedy is to reset the entire unit on itunes to the factory settings which removes ALL SONGS - meaning you have to start from scratch copying things back onto it and so forth, including playlists.  The other temporary remedy - only occationally works, and requires "thumbs of iron" - is to hold the "menu" & "pause" buttons down at the same time, till the thing "reboots", so to speak -(got that from one of the discussion sites).  This "reboot" brings up a black screen on the ipod with the "Apple" on it and the unit will then work a day or two before returning to the endless "scroll without playing anything" in all playlists.  Definately not worth the money.  If there was a zero star, I'd rate it there, if we could do negative stars, that would be better due to the pricing - the price is very bold considering the unstable nature of the product.  Can't just shrug it off and call it a throw away.  At the moment, my current ipod is locked up - unable to respond to it's own fly wheel - a condition I noticed someone else had mentioned on this site. Not sure what will allow it to work again, as basically, owning one of these is a never ending research project to get a few days of play time out of it before the next quirk renders it unusable.  Very frustrating product.
