<Title>HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE!
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again. How many versions do you need???  First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again. Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPNB52/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-2136909-3390043">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Pink (2nd Generation)</a>  Could not get it to sync, charge, etc. The only thing it said was "Do not Disconnect". Sent it back and, after a few days, Apple returned it with upgraded firmware, but did not admit there was a problem. Works good now. Note to Steve: I have used DHL for electronics returns twice and have had miserable service both times. Please use a better freight company.

<Title>Awful product, awful customer service.
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first experience with an apple product and it's going to be my last.  Heard a lot of hype about iPods and I was going to upgrade my Rio so I bought an iPod.  HUGE mistake.  It arrived Saturday.  It didn't come with software, the software had to be downloaded.  Since I had just ordered a new computer I had given mine to a relative going to school my old, old computer didn't have the os to use the iPod software.  On Monday I set it up on my work computer until my new computer arrives.  It didn't work.  Kept telling me that I had to restore factory settings - it was brand new!  Got someone on the phone in customer service, he said that he had had at least seven calls (!) so far that day on the same problem.  First told me that if I had an apple computer I wouldn't have a problem, nice attempt at humor but not exactly welcome.  Then told me that there was a problem with the drivers for the USB port.  (Funny how it's always the other products fault -this supposedly great technology is being waylaid by a USB port - not exactly great technology.)  He got it to work by running me through a long list of procedures.  Great, thought the problem was fixed and was able to download music from the iStore.  Yeah, not quite fixed.  Had it working for about 24 hours when I decided to add more music.  When I connected the iPod it again insisted that I restore the factory settings, which wiped all the music off it, then it kept telling me over and over that the factory settings needed to be restored, but wouldn't actually work.  Called customer service again.  This time they told me that I had to send it back to them and in 7 to 14 days they would send me another one.  Yeah, right.  Talked to a friend who has an iPod, she doesn't have a problem with her iPod, but her iPod came with software.  Several of her family members also bought an iPod, but they had to download the software and they have been having continuous problems ever since.  I checked the website to see if I could get the software that came with the product and the site basically said that you were out of luck if you couldn't download it, that you'd better borrow or buy another computer to be able to run the iPod.  That is the most ridiculous and pompous thing a company could write about their product - that you must spend at least a $1k to make an mp3 player work!  DON'T BUY THIS (unless you have an apple computer) because it really doesn't work and it's extremely frustrating dealing with all the problems in a product that should be plug and play.  The new Rio is less expensive and I never had a problem with the software or hardware.

<Title>Good product with minor issues
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my third iPOD nano purchase (second from Amazon). All were for my kids and the kids love them. I did have to get this one replaced due to a defect but Amazon replaced it  promptly. This review does not address the "coolness", music features "shuffle, etc.." and functionality of the product since I don't use it at all. However I played with a it a bit and it looks very well designed and made, I wish the headphone volume could have gone higher. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:  1) Very expensive compared to other brands 2) Did receive one defective unit and I had one needing repair in the past

<Title>Apple Customer Service is for the birds
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this ipod for my daughter as a christmas gift.  The setting up of the ipod can be very confusing and frustrating but once that part was over she has really enjoyed the ipod.  PROBLEM:  Thier customer service bites, we have had problems on and off and really have not had any helpful guidance from apple custumer service.  Recently her ipod was dropped and I sent it away to be repaired (paid the 30.00! shipping fee) and it has been returned to me because it is not covered on warranty.  They won't even tell me what is wrong with it, I now have to drive over an hour to an apple store to find that out. Why charge 30.00 if I can't even recieve a report of what is wrong with it an an estimated repair cost.

<Title>Apple and Microsoft
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had mine for about 2 months then i went running with it, then all of a sudden it went "hay wire" showing an unhappy face.  When i tried to restore it it showed up a "1418 error" saying it couldn't perform the function.  So I had to send home to my brother in California so he can take to an Apple store because they don't have an iPod store in Aomori, Japan.  I would much rather send it back to Apple so they can replace it, but whatever...The cool part is the support but on the other hand you think they would make these things a little bit more tougher so someone who actually works out can use'em...Or Maybe i just pushed to hard...All and all this hasn't turned me off from Apple it just boiled my blood a little bit, that's all.

<Content>Being a Mac lover and a music nut, buying an iPod was inevitable.  I put it off mainly because I knew what was ahead of me . . loading in selected cuts from hundreds of CDs and lots of vintage vinyl.  My only disappointment is how hard it is to wrangle the USB turntable to Mac process. Also, the ear buds are a little chees-y.

<Title>Excellent for music!
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This iPod was able to store a lot of my music.  So far, I have over 670 songs on it, with quite a bit of room still left over (and most of the songs I have on there are 4-5 minutes long!).  Not only that, but it's so easy to use!  Also, instead of paying for songs on iTunes, you can just rip music from your CDs, put them into iTunes, plug in your iPod, and it'll automatically put them in.  However, if you want to be able to make backups of your music so you don't have to go through all those CDs all over again, I'd recommend buying "PD+Rescue for iPod."  Since my laptop crashed, I lost all of my music in iTunes, and once I installed that software, I was able to transfer everything from my iPod back onto the computer.

<Content> The box was a little tricky to open. You have to pull out the top plastic part that holds the iPod then bend it to get it out. You'll actually charge your Nano using your computer -- the adapter is not included, have to buy it separately at the apple store. Otherwise, it's great. Songs played on it are VERY clear. Love it!

<Content>This is my second iPod. My first was a "mini" which the nano makes look like a "jumbo". It's very lightweight, sound quality is typical of these devices. The battery life is outstanding (again, compared to the mini). I've only had it for a month, but the battery so far is lasting over 8 hours. I haven't completely run it until it is dead yet, so I don't know how long it will really last. Awesome!

<Title>Good value for music lovers
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my fiancee who has never previously owned any iPod or MP3 player.  She uses it while doing lab work with the Altec iM7 boom box (which produces good sound, considering the compression limitations of the source material) that I also got for her.  She loves it and, like tens of thousands of others, is becoming addicted to it. She doesn't want it to be a video player or a phone but rather just to play music and NPR downloads so it is jsut about perfect for her needs.  So far, the only drawback is that we're having difficulty finding a car-radio attachment that works well since she doesn't have a cassette player in her car and needs to use one of the cigarrette lighter plug-ins.  But that is not the fault of the Nano itself.  But remember, you do need to buy a shell or a case because the Nano (like all iPods) easily scratches.

<Content>Ever since the iPod made it's appearance on the scene, I've resisted buying one, for various reasons.  Well, I finally decided to try the iPod Nano recently.  I was delighted to find the sound amazingly clear, the capacity for so many songs on such a small instrument staggering (I have the 4GB)and the task of transferring songs very easy!  Only one complaint; you don't receive detailed instructions with the purchase and there are important instructions missing from the help site on iTunes and in the instruction manual (found available on the Apple website).   I've already transferred almost 400 songs to the iPod.  I'll never have to carry around tons of CD's again!

<Title>Great fun despite a couple of bugs in the programming...
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Because "turn off" and "play" are activated by the same function (press and hold for "off", press once for "play") the Nano seems not to register the "off" at times. Instead, it flashes the playlist (indicating that the file is being deleted but it doesn't delete it!) and reverts back to playing. You can go back and forth trying to turn it off. Otherwise, it's a great device for jogging and travel. Advice: get the power adapter for recharging the battery (otherwise you have to keep your computer on); and get the sport headset if you're going to the gym or running -- it stays in place and doesn't hurt like the buds that come with the set.

<Content>Great! Now I can take my music wherever I go. Just in a small case (really small) and a couple of wires I can listen to ,my favourite music in any place. If you are not eighteen and don't have thousands of songs that you wanted to listen (I dont have even a thounsand)4 Gb it's more than enought (I already have 700 and it's not full).

<Title>Exceptional Value - Gobs of Space
<Date>Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This review is for those of you that have not yet made the I-iPod plunge.  I was a bot late to the game myself on this one.  My children, and their friends, really led the way on this.  Now that I am finally all in, I cannot say enough about the various uses of the iPod, and its overall ease of use.  In addition to being able to download the latest and greatest from iTunes, you can also put any of your own existing CD collection on your iPod.  I personally take advantage of the many available books on CD.  I have downloaded audio books from various sites on the Internet.  In fact, I do not have an iPod/MP3 adaptor in my car, so I purchased a device that allows me to play my iPod via the radio.  This really is an incredible device that is well-worth the price.  To not have an iPod in today's day and age is a bit like not having a VCR or Microwave in the 80's.  By the way, putting songs/books on your iPod is very intuitive.  Once or twice will teach you how to do it.  If you have a problem, just have a teenager give you a brief class.  This is a 5 star product.

<Content>I received this IPod for XMas and am thrilled with it.  Not being a techy, I've found it very easy to use.  The sound is very, very clear and with several different ways to charge-either by computer or plug in backup-it can be taken really anywhere.  I would highly recommend this as a beginners product.  I love it and the accessories you can purchase seperately to enhance your use of the I Pod.  Seriously think about this model-I love it!

<Content>I am in love with my iPod nano!    Initially, I was having trouble with the computer not acknowledging that the iPod was plugged in.  I had to reformat it (it was formatted for a Mac), and download all the upgrades for Windows, iTunes and Quicktime.  Now that that's all over...we're inseparable!!!    I bought it for the sole purpose of listening to music without having to lug a cd player around, but it actually has a lot of features I didn't know about (like contacts, alarm clock, games...).  I highly recommend it!!!

The packaging that it came in was very well oraganized almost classy in some way. It has great memory for it's size (4gig) and I remember when I had a computer with that abount of memory.

<Title>I think "NANO" means dont work
<Date>Sun Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this item for approx 3 months... Within those three months, the nano has locked up on me 4 times with no explanation (this has also happened to two other people I know).  As I'm scrolling through the songs, the nano will simply stop responding and there is nothing left to do but wait a day for the battery to completely drain. It becomes very frustrating at the gym! SO do yourself a favor and go buy a "no-name" brand for less money. I will be going back to my old 2 gig "no-name" brand that has worked flawlessly within the past 3 years. Good luck to those who skip my advice and buy this piece of garbage.

Amazon beat Wal*Mart (hard to do) and everyone else by at least $10.00 and with free shipping and no sales tax to boot!  It arrived quickly and well packaged as all Amazon merchandise does.  My daughter loves it!  It works flawlessly and she's 100% satisfied with the product and I'm 100% satisfied with the great deal and service I once again received from Amazon.

I Have put about half of my music on it and barely filled it. If you Do get it I would sugest that you get a case for it right away just so that you do not scratch the screen and the body. i got a case that has a screen cover. And if you want you can get a variaty of cases i have a silicone case it works great. Ilove that case taht it comes in from apple it is so cool. I LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!

<Content>This is one of the most colorful ipods like the shuffle and the mini.But the nano is the best out of all of them.For a few reasons the nano has a color screen and is 60% more brighter then the first generation ipod nano.And the shuffle has no screen at all and that can make it very hard to find the music you want to hear.And the mini has the same sized screen as the nano but the mini's screen is also not colored.But the shuffle doe beat the nano in size because the shuffle can fit on your shirt.(Because of the clip)But these three ipod all have something in comming thay are all have flash hard drive. (Shuffle:1GB 140 songs) (Nano:2GB 500 songs/4Gb 1,000 songs/and 8GB 2,000 songs)(Mini:4GB 1,000 songs/And 6GB 1,500 songs) So I hope you find this helpful.    Thanks

<Content>I bought this for my wife for mother's day and she loves it. We both use it when we hit the gym, which makes working out that much more enjoyable. I also purchased the Logitech MM50 portable speaker system which is an excellent addition to the Ipod. We have used the duo at the beach, around the house and in hotel rooms on trips. We have a ton of music and managed to fill up the 1000 songs rather quickly, but since we can change these around, it is not an issue. I would highly recommend this product. We have had no problems and it provides a nice, crisp sound.

<Title>makes an ugly paperweight
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned three ipods.  This is the worst one.  Three months in it begins to freeze and freeze and freeze.  The first ten times resetting it worked.  After that, it no longer worked. Tried everything Apple suggested.  The screen finally turned off, but then it never turned on again.  So I drove 25 minutes to the nearest Apple Store to have the people in the Genius Bar look at it.  The guy looked at me and told me that I was an ipod abuser and had to have beaten the crap out of it when I did no such thing.  He declared the warranty void and said he was "sorry." I was going to buy a Mac laptop.  I don't think so anymore with Apple's failure to fix my broken ipod and the attitude of the guy who "helped" me.  Apple doesn't back this product. It still has problems.  I'll never buy an ipod this size ever again.

<Content>My only usage of this product has been for audiobooks. It currently has 10 unabridged books on the device and the memory is less than 1/3 full...amazing, for such a small thing!    The only glitch I've encountered has been a "freeze" that has happened a few times. It's easily corrected by pressing and holding the Memo button and the center circle for 20 seconds. If this had never happened, I would have given the product 5 stars (rather than 4).   I'm delighted with my iPod.

<Title>great, not ideal
<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 4Gb Blue Nano as a replacement for my old 6Gb Blue Mini that finally died from a hard fall. I liked the size of the old Mini and, the Nano being so much smaller, was afraid that the Nano would be too small. I was wrong - the Nano's size is perfect!  + The clickwheel is very responsive in the Nano, + The menu navigation is much more "snappy" than that of the Mini, part of which has to do with the absence of a hard drive to spin up.  + Great screen. + Excellent battery life. I really mean it - the battery simply refuses to die (and I thought that my Mini's battery was good). +Just like the Mini, the Nano's casing is not prone to scratches, a big improvement from the 1st gen Nano. + Podcasts are marked as read/unread. This is very useful.  - Syncing the Nano seems to be perceptibly slower  (~2x) than that of the Mini. I used to sync my Mini through both USB 2.0 and Firewire and either was faster than syncing the Nano.  Some reviewers on the web also note the 2nd generation Nano specically being slower to sync than the 1st gen. Bugs in software or using cheap parts by Apple? -  In three days of my owning it the Nano froze three times, exactly as many times as my Mini in two years. This happened when trying to navigate to an Audiobook and trying to change volume immediately after the Nano wakes up. After one of such freezes, the entire Audiobook menu disappeared from the Nano submenus until the Nano was synced to a computer.  - The Mini used to come with a belt clip, which allowed to securely wear it. How am I supposed to wear the Nano??? Unsecured, it will fall off my pocket in no time. Aftermarket cases that provide a belt clip are UGLY as death. After a very long search of the web I finally found a third-party belt clip for the Nano, the same as the Mini used to come with.   Overall the Nano is a GREAT product. Despite my long-winded description of (mostly minor) negatives, they are EASILY outweighed by the positives: absolutely wonderful design and great functionality. Highly recommended.

<Content>iTunes wants to install a bunch of @#^%! but if you trim it down to just the player it's user friendly even if it's bloatware. One thing I didn't like about the iTunes store is you can't see the URL. So I was leery about putting in a credit card number to buy songs because I couldn't tell if it was a secured site of not.   The player is flawless. If I was a MAC person I would probably give it 5 stars instead of 4.

I put all my CD's on it, just insert CD, list of songs appears, check the ones you want and transfer. Just as easy to buy tunes. Sound is excellent. Portable. I didn't like the earbuds, but I bought a cheap pair that hook over the ears and still sound great. I had a portable CD player, it skips, is big, and have to carry CD's around. None of that with the ipod. If anything happened to this, I would buy another Apple ipod.

<Content>Pretty much what you would expect from an iPod.  4 GB is enough space to load songs for a week's worth of gym time.

<Title>Great but some problems
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my iPod Nano but I have encountered several problems. Twice on shuffle the songs started then shuffled to the next without playing audio and I had to reset the unit. Also I encounter this problem EVERY DAY: the enter button in the middle will not respond. I have to click the menu button, scroll to now playing then hit enter. Then the enter button will work. Also, sometimes the scroll wheel gets overly sensitive where it will go to volume control if my finger is near it and it will make the volume jump up and down instead of smoothly lower and raise.

<Title>Quality At It's Best
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I decided to break down and spend the extra money after going through three mp3 players from another manufacturer.  After a few months of use, I can honestly say that I made the best decision.  The nano is by far the best flash drive player out there.  I currently use the Nike+ technology to compliment my running workouts.  I love it.  I don't have to run the same route anymore.

<Title>Don't...
<Date>Fri May 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Don't buy the iPod Nano. Why?  The iPod's not the only music player you can get,  It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met.  If they just knew what the other players had in store for them,  They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen.   The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites,  But why not get a better player with more gigabytes?  Sandisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices,  Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices.   The Sandisk Sansa E200 has many, many things,  An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings.  Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not!  The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot.   The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal,  It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal.  Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player,  For less than the Nano...are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer.   There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space,  It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place.  FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy,  The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry.   The Creative Zen Vision: M is better than the Ipod Video,  Better screen, more features, and better value make it glow.  The fact that the Vision: M is thicker doesn't really matter,  The features are what make the Vision: M unimportantly fatter.   So you see, my friends, the iPod is a waste of precious time,  The fact that Apple cheats you out is basically a crime.  They make their iPods fragile just to make them really "cool",  Anyone who buys one is just a ridiculous crazy fool.   ...that's why.

<Content>I was considering to buy the other players just because of the video feature, but then decided on Ipod.   But buy it from the Apple website so that you can get your name carved on it!!   It is the PERFECT mp3 player, with colors, but the only feature that is missing is video, which by me is fine.   As a 12-year old, its perfect. SO BUY IT NOW!!

<Content>I was really thinking of just buying the video ipod instead of a nano after my mini broke since the video doesn't cost that much more. But in the end, I chose the nano because I really just wanted an ipod to use for working out. The small, slim design makes it really easy to run with, even if you don't have an arm band. And Kudos to the color, it's my favorite. I'm in love with this ipod, it's my lil' baby.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I love it. I have had no problems so far. It is everything that i had hoped for and more. I only hate the ear buds because they don't stay in my ears when I exercise. The 4 gigs is more than enough space for my new music and old CDs.

<Title>My Nano
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Apple Nano a couple of weeks ago and I'm in love with it. My husband has the iPod Video and I use to borrow his all the time. Now that I have my own I take it with me everywhere I go. I love the color and the scratch resistant surface. It's such a neat little piece of technolgy and the sound quality is amazing. I'm already anticipating upgrading to an iPod Video in about a year.

<Title>Great for Live Music!
<Date>Fri Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned two MP3 players previously but never an ipod.  I decided to purchase one because my last iteration broke and because I am a big fan of iTunes.  What a lovely device.  I download a lot of live music; two things the ipod does that many other MP3 players don't: 1.) gapless playback and 2.) WAV playback.  This makes listening to my favorite shows easy and enjoyable.  The click wheel and the rest is fabulous.  The headphones are uncomfortable but not a major drawback -- easily swappable with another pair.  Maybe I should have bought the 8 gb version.

I think they could lower the price seeing other mp3 players are cheaper to stay competitive. But the reason I payed for the nano is because of iTunes is very easy to use and the Nike+iPod. I really enjoy using the Nike+iPod. Its fun! Overall this is a good mp3 player.

<Title>What a fun new toy!
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I resisted getting an i-Pod since I thought the compressed music format would not sound good.  After trying out my new i-Pod Nano, I regret having waited so long.  The sound is a little different than on my CDs but it is not that noticlble and some of the added brightness even helps when listening in my cars.  I am old enough to remember using cassettes and vinyl records to make recordings of my favorite tunes.  That process took many hours and the results were not always very good.  With a little time on my computer, I can have days of music custom arranged in my own mix.  The Nano is light and small, fitting easily into one of the pockets in my purse.  The "ear buds" are OK but try using it with Bose noise cancelling headphones; the sound is great!

<Content>The best player i ever used, small, thin, easy to use i just got a remark on the packaging: the player came in its usual case in a relatively large amazon box and the air bags were accumulated in one side of the box which caused the CASE of the ipod to move from one side to another while shipping and made some scratches to the CASE but only the case, the ipod was truly safe

<Title>iPod nano mini-
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple's solution came in the form of the iPod nano, a mini-mini-version of their current iPod color line. That's right, it's more miniature than the iPod mini, and the display is color! It's clear that these two superior elements are the reasons why Apple decided to do away with the original iPod mini line; however many consumers are upset that the iPod nano's storage capacity is smaller than what the iPod mini used to be. At 2GB and 4GB, though, the capacities are higher than the current iPod shuffle line and the pricing falls right in line in between shuffles and regular color iPods.I made mistake buying to small iPod Nano 4GB, I wish it was bigger like 30GB.

<Title>I love it already!
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just received my new iPod in the mail today.  Took a while to get here with the free shipping, but it was worth the wait.  I am going to attempt to write a review that normal people who might not be the most technologically savvy can follow.  I'm one of those people.  The user interface takes a little while to master.  I didn't say it's hard; I said it takes a little while to master.  I'm not an idiot and I can operate simple electronic devices.  I say it takes a little while to master because you have to get used to running your finger around the white circle to navigate.  The menu button takes you forward and backward.  So, you have to go forward until the end, like let's say, Music to Albums to Songs and then back to Albums and then back to Music.  But, that's not bad.  There's really nothing bad about this iPod.  The sound quality is so much better than I ever thought it would be.  You can hear the treble and the bass quite clearly.  It also goes very loud, which can be bad for your ears.  There's a setting such that it doesn't rise above a certain volume.  I've seen lots of people with these, and I think a good rule of thumb is that if someone else can hear what you are listening to, it's too loud.  It says 4GB capacity, but the actual is 3.66 GB.  That should still hold plenty of music for those of us who don't have gigantic music collections.  The unit is pretty sturdy.  I had it attached to my laptop to tranfer songs and put the laptop on the floor forgetting that the ipod was there.  It was only about a foot fall, but I was still worried that it might be damaged.  It wasn't.  I would strongly recommend getting a case to cover the screen and protect it.  The one I bought was not officially from Apple, so it doesn't quite fit the bottom where the headphones and the USB cable go.  I mean, it fits, but it needs to be trimmed a little.  I've heard accessories can be quite expensive for this unit, but think of it this way.  Spending $20 on a case can save you from having to spend $200 on a whole new unit.  All in all, I think this is a great little gadget to have.  Who would benefit from it?  Kids would love it, but given the cost, I'm not sure I would buy it for a child.  A teenager, of course.  That's my honest review of this product.  I am very, very pleased that I ordered one and now I can't imagine my life without it, just like when I got my mobile.

<Content>I had originally bought my Ipod at a store.  When I found it to consistently freeze up on my use of it, I took it back to the store and got my money back.  Then I looked on amazon.com and found the same product at a cheaper price.  I thought I'd take a chance and see if it was any better.  I have yet to have ONE problem with this IPOD.  It has been a pleasure to use it this time.  Next time I buy a new electronics device I'm seriously going to look at amazon.com first.

<Title>can't compete with iPod...
<Date>Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This iPod is just awesome... if you want to get an mp3 player, there is no doubt about getting an iPod... besides, think of all the accessories available for iPods.... that doesn't happen with other mp3 players...   There is only one thing I don't like about it and that's why is not 5 stars... Apple should fix the fact that the iPod will repeat many songs when shuffle mode is being played and never play some others... you can see how many times the songs have been played by connecting your iPod to your pc and opening iTunes. You will see that some songs were played 15 times and some others were played 0 times...   everything else is just perfect...
