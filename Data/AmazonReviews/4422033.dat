<Title>Best player out there right now
<Date>Mon Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Been looking around for a good mp3 player for about 6 months now, ever since I realized my iPod sucked (between the lack of real battery life and the complicated software intrface, I had had enough with Apple).  Believe me I looked into everything from Microsoft Zune to Creative Zen to the 30gb iPod, and a few lesser known players. THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST ALL AROUND MEDIA PLAYER OUT THERE RIGHT NOW, and here's why:  1) Unprecedented battery life! It's been 4 days of on-and-off play for me since I first charged it out of the box, and I STILL HAVE 2 BARS LEFT.  2) Easy software interface: uploading songs and pics through the samsung program can get tedious if you want to make playlists, but other than that, I simply use the plug-n-play option (simply dragging media files into the removable disk folder).  3) Awesome sound quality! I was truly amazed with the cd-quality sound of the FM radio feature.   4) Plays WMA along with MP3: you will find that this NECESSARY feature is lacking in many of the other big wig players out there right now (ie Creative Zen)  5) Beautiful seamless controls (no "buttons")  6)YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE!

<Title>Looks good but...
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this cute little player because it promised so much!  Granted it sounded AWESOME, if you can get it to sync to Windows Media Player (which is one of the requirements for your player).  I was unable to get it to sync.  The first time I called customer service, I talked to a less than technical person who told me that the player was not compatable with WMP 11 and to roll back to WMP 10.  Guess what!  WMP 10 is NOT compatible with Windows XP.  So obviously that did not work.  I didnt stay on the phone to talk to that guy.  The second time I called (yes, two customer service calls in less than 24 hours since I could not get my player to sync), I spoke with someone who actually had some training.  He didnt understand why guy #1 told me to roll back to WMP 10 since the player should have worked with WMP 11.  After talking with him for 45 min he had to transfer me to a secondary help section.  Sorry, I am not going to sit on the phone for another 45 minutes listening to their awful wait music so someone else can tell me they dont understand why it is not syncing.  I also tried to sync the player to another computer.  Didnt work.  So I returned it and tried a different one.  Nope.  It didnt work either.  When I took the second one back, the girl at the store said that Samsung had been having a lot of issues with their players not syncing.  That is too bad.  I am done with Samsung.  If it would have worked, it would have been exactly what i wanted.

<Title>A Great Player with a Few Quirks
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This device has lots of good points and only a few bad points and bugs.  First, the good.   1. The sound quality is fantastic, much better than my first generation iPod. I am using my own headphones, the provided ones have not been opened.  2. Transfering files is fast and simple, no software is needed although a CD is provided.  3. The response is super fast. This is also bad, see below.  4. There have no glitches, no freeze-ups, no occational skipping. That last one is important as my old iPod got jittery all too often.  5. Although it is not the cheapest, it is substantially less that the iPod Nano.  6. The screen is bright, colorful, and clear, at least indoors.  7. The battery charges quickly and lasts forever.  8. I don't use pictures much on these tiny devices but the images I tested by loading them through the Samsung software were excellent, considering the tiny screen.  9. It looks nice!  Now, the bad.  1. The controls are so fast I still haven't figured out how to avoid holding them down too long. The screen sometimes goes wild jumping from menu-to-menu as I clumsily try to stop pressing buttons!  2. The provided software is mediocre at best and doesn't run very well under Vista. Everytime it starts up, it goes into convulsions before settling down. After that, is is fine. Works properly on my XP desktop.  3. I have yet to figure out how to get playlists over to the device. Every playlist, rather than being a reference, starts copying duplicates of the files already there. I don't have the space for that.  4. It is easily scratched even just sitting there. Get screen protectors for it before you even take it out of the box.  Finally, the ugly.  1. My 1 Gig iPod was never filled so I got the 2 Gig Samsung. Wow, it holds less that the smaller iPod. However, I think the sizes are larger which may be why the sound quality is so much better. Get the 4 Gig model.  2. The device is really geared for Europe. None of the free-for-30-days music stores with free downlaods are available to those of us in North America.  3. The on-line registration is crazed, I filled out the form at least 5 times and each time some silly tiny "mistake" was made. It didn't even like my address! I gave up.  Over all, this is a great compromise between the expensive iPods and the error-prone cheaper models of mp3 players.

<Title>Great MP3 Player, 
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Samsung has made a fine digital audio player with the YP-K3. Its slim and sexy in black and looks very classy. The screen is pretty big and looks just fine. Audio quality is pretty decent but the included headphones are crap. I am probably going to buy a decent pair of Shure's to replace the ones that were included with the device. Also, when I tried to play music from the K3 over my car stereo I noticed it did not have a lot of driving power i.e. the audio was not loud even at high volumes. Transferring songs from Windows Media Player is a breeze and I never had to install the Samsung Media Studio.  The only gripe I have about this player is the display interface. Now the touchscreen is great and all but the display seems to be lagging a bit when I am scrolling down the list of my albums. The animations that play when I am listening to music also seem to be a bit choppy. I hope they resolve that through a firmware update. Overall a great player, especially for people like me who want to buy anything but an iPod :)

<Title>Great Player!!!!
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an awesome player. I started with the YP-JAB model that has the slide out speaker, which I still have and am in love with. Well I decided I wanted the slim version for running purposes. The previous was a bit heavy for the type workout clothes I wear.  First of all the controls are a bit sensitive but adjusting the amount of pressure when using them will definitely do the trick. You don't have to press these controls just a little tap will do.   Secondly, I have Windows XP and I use Media Player 10 and everything performs as it should. The one time I accidently upgraded to MP 11, it still worked perfectly so I can assure you that this little device is indeed compatible with that version also.  Lastly, creating the playlist is a bit tricky and it took me longer than I wanted to figure out but once I had it, I was able to add my playlist as easily as I add my albums.  The only con as far as I am concerned is the lack of accessories for this device. I wanted to buy an arm band or a case for it and the few I found were very unattractive and all were black. I happen to love my red player so it would have been nice to buy a decent looking case that doesn't take away from the appearance of my player. ~~~~~~~ All said, I definitely recommend this product and if you take the time to actually learn to use its features - I am pretty sure that you will love it as I do!

<Title>Fantastic Product, Stupid Customer Support
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>How could I give this little guy anything other than 5 stars.   Pros: It's sleek and shiny. The sound is fantastic, even my lower quality mp3s still sound good. The volume goes higher than my ears can stand. The fm tuner works well. The photo capability is nice, though I really can't say that I use it. Syncing it through Windows Media Player couldn't possibly be easier. The battery life is simply unbelievable, at least compared to some of the old creative and apple mp3 players I have used. The touch interface works well, although every now and then it isn't quite as responsive as I would like, although that may be because I have a screen protector on it and then the belkin case over that.  Cons: Not a lot to talk about here, but here are the few minor things that come to mind. If you don't get a case or plastic screen protectors the front will become a mess. The on/off/hold button can be a little difficult to use with my large fingers. The only feature that I wish it had is video playback.  Oh yeah, and best of all it's not an apple product!   **************************** UPDATE *********************************  Still nothing but love for this player, Samsung Customer Support on the other hand can go to H*ll!!!!  I lost one of the little foam covers for the earbuds (and thus one side no longer fit snugly), which really saddened me because they were some of the few earbuds that comfortably fit my ears. I figured it was a common situation and as such it wouldn't be a problem to just order a new set of covers. WRONG!!! you can only pay another forty bucks for a whole new set of earbuds. Anyway, I emailed Samsung twice and they never responded. So finally I called and when I told their foreign representative the problem she said "So the problem is that you can't transfer music from your IPod to your K3?" WTF!!! Eventually I got the problem communicated but she simply told me that the problem isn't covered by the warranty because it is my own fault and that I should buy new earbuds, which is stupid because I just wanted to order a replacement part not for them to send me new earbuds.

<Title>A quality  MP3 player with radio to boot!
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player because my CD/MP3 walkman had died and an iPod that I liked was a bit out of my price range. What sold me on this player was the size (this thing is really small!), design (super sleek!), and the FM radio receiver (Ah, radio...). Also it seems to hold up well. I dropped mine right out of the box, and it works just fine. I bought the red one, though I think the color could more accurately be described as garnet. I love that the only real button on the player is the power/lock button located on the side. The rest of the interface is touch-sensitive. There are severeal different sound equalizer presets, an equalizer you can set manually, as well as repeat and shuffle modes. The sound quality from this player is great, but I'd recommend discarding the earbuds that come with it and getting some quality earphones to truly enjoy the sound. The music organizing software that comes with the player is a little difficult to figure out at first, not terribly intuitive to use. Once you figure it out, though, you can set up your playlists in that program and then load them onto the player. Be aware that if you do a search for music on your computer with that software, it will only recognize MP3 files. If you have any of your favorite music saved in wave format, the program won't notice it. I have yet to try to sync my YP-K3 with Windows Media Player. Also, be aware that the radio dial only goes up to 107.5. If you like any stations located above that on the dial, you're out of luck. Other than that, this is a high quality music player. Battery life is awesome. There is plenty of volume available to blow your ears off if you want to. It holds quite a bit of music and pictures, too. I would buy this player again.

<Title>The Ipod Killer (as long as you upgrade the firmware...)
<Date>Fri Aug 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can stop looking because you have just found the best MP3 player on the market today. Yes, this is the fabled "ipod killer" that beats the ipod Nano in almost every conceivable category. It probably won't actually outsell the ipod, because lets face it: if features were what sold ipods, Apple would be out of business. But I digress.   Unlike other players on the market, the Samsung K3 focuses itself on being an audio player first, and ignores some of the more gimmicky features found on other players such as video support. Personally, I would rather drive nails into my eyes then watch a movie on a 1-inch screen, but maybe that's just me. The other notable feature missing on the K3 is album art support, although I have my fingers crossed that a future firmware upgrade will correct this. Samsung more than makes up for the missing features by offering what is (in my opinion) the best sounding player on the market. The sound quality and number of customizable sound options such EQ settings, 3D sound, bass boost, etc are outstanding, particularly in the latest firmware versions. Personally, I listen to my K3 in normal mode with high quality Sennheiser buds (CX300) and I have zero complaints about the sound quality. This is a music player, not a media player. Some other cool features of the K3 are a great sounding FM radio, photo viewing, and text / lyrics viewing.  The K3 also wins out in the looks department, being the slimmest, most stylish player you can buy. I have the red version of this player and I actually get complements on my MP3 player! Everyone who picks it up tells me how cool it looks. The K3 also has nice a solid feel to it in your hand - it just FEELS like a quality product. This is an important consideration, because some other players on the market, such as the creative Zen-V, feel like a children's toy that just fell out of a box of Frosted Flakes (seriously, go hold one!). But where the K3 really shines is in the looks department. No other player on the market comes close in terms of style. Not only is the player razor thin, but it has a nice clean design. The great menu designs and graphics on the player all combine to offer up a sense of style that is rarely found in electronics. And then there are the ultra-cool touch buttons. They take a little bit of getting used to, but once you have them down, you will never want to go back. The touch buttons are a great rival to the ipod click wheel.  So the player itself is great, but where most MP3 players fall short is in the software / media management side of things. A short explanation of the two main types of MP3 players is necessary here: MTP vs UMS.  MTP stands for 'media transfer protocol' and refers to the scenario where software running on your computer manages the transfer of media to your portable device. This is the ipod / itunes model, where only itunes can get music onto your ipod. The alternative is UMS, which stands for 'universal mass storage' meaning that the portable device acts like a mini hard drive and can be connected to any computer. There are pros and cons to each method, with the primary advantage of the MTP model being ease of use and transparency, while the UMS devices offer simplicity and portability at the expense of placing the responsibility (and control) for managing the player onto the user.  What makes the Samsung K3 so great is that they cater to BOTH of these markets by making the K3 firmware upgradeable and offering both an MTP steam of firmware AND a UMS stream of firmware. This does not seem to be a well advertised fact, and I will warn you that it is not exactly easy to do the upgrade, but the point is that it CAN be done.  Any experienced computer user should be able to manage it.  Myself, I cannot stand MTP devices or itunes-like software, which is what makes the K3 so attractive to me. Unfortunately, the K3 comes out of the box as an MTP device, meaning that you have to install the bundled Samsung software at least once to get things running. The Samsung software is about as good as any MTP software (i.e. complete crap), but it does what it is supposed to. The nasty little surprise that Samsung bundles with their software I could live without though. Samsung has silently bundled some DRM software / spyware called "Markany" with their program. After installing the software, you will notice two new programs that will run at all times in the background on your computer. One is the Samsung software, the other is the Markany program. Some people won't care about things like this, but it drives me completely bonkers!  The good news is that by upgrading the firmware to UMS, you can successfully ditch both the Samsung software and Markany, and enjoy all the great features of the K3, without having to bother with any software at all. Just plug in the player and copy your music over like it was a flash drive. Simple, easy, clean. Once this minor headache is over, you are left with one of the most powerful, best sounding, and definitely most stylin' music players you can buy.

<Title>Good, but not great for the price
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The battery life lasts just as long as my old mp3 player, the IAudio 1GB, so that is not its selling point. It took only 2.5 hours to decrease by 1 bar out of 4, which means total life is approximately 10 hours. Sound quality is better than average. Design, however, is very stylish and easy to use. Charging battery/transferring files is also quite fast. The photo feature is a neat addition. Basically, this product offers higher memory, slightly better sound, photos, and attractive design. Battery life is not as good as I expected.

<Title>Treat yourself!!
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had been wanting a new mp3 player but was not impressed by the ipod as much as the other "sheep".  A close friend has this model and I was able to "try before you buy".  This was the most worthwhile purchase I have made in recent memory.  The operating program included with the player is very user friendly and allows for easy transfer of songs or podcasts.  It is also capable of storing photos but I have never understood who would want photos or videos on a piece of equipment that has a screen smaller than two inches.  This player has a locking feature to prevent skipping of music if you slip it into your pocket.  The touch screen reacts quickly and requires minimal pressure to select options.  The sleek design (size and appearance) beats the crap out of the ipod for the price and has all the same benefits for half the price.  It is worth you time to check it out (and purchase)!

<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just received the Samsung 2G YP-K3JQB Mp3 player. For me this player is perfect. It stores more than enough music for me, has a FM radio option, and is easy to use. The sound is great. I found it easier to load music on it through Windows Media Player rather than the CD they give you. I was having issues with my CDs being read as duplicate tracks but if you go through WMP it is fine. The only thing that I found to be a slight annoyance is the touch pad is really sensetive so you have to be careful when you are handleing it. I would recomend this to anyone who wants an easy to use, good price MP3 player.

<Content>I was looking for a simple, but stylish mp3 player about a year ago.  I came across the Samsung K3, which is so incredibly thin!  It works really well, has a radio which is handy when I'm looking for new songs to put on it, and a clock, pictures and is over all really awsome.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  It has a very clear screen, and has various backrounds when you're playing music, and is easy to use.  The earbuds stink, though, so you'd need to buy your own.  I would definatly recommend this to someone who wants something that's not too complicated but has lots of nice features. : )

<Title>Right Features, Right Price, Fabulous Unit
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me preface this by saying that I have been looking at MP3 players for almost 9 months and couldn't find one that had the right features for a price that I was willing to pay.  Samsung has always been able to hit my "sweet spot" when it came to technology and the K3 is no exception.  Pros 1)  FM Receiver - This was a big one for me. When I started my search, only the lower end units even thought to add this on. 2)  Incredibly slim and sexy design - This says it all.  The K3 is perhaps the skiniest electronic device I have ever seen.  3)  Durability - I have already dropped it, banged it, and kicked it... It still holds up. 4)  Seamless controls - This adds to the sleek image and the controls are incredibly responsive 5)  Ease to upload - The firmware interface is extremely easy to use. 6)  Hold button - The hold button (which you need due to the incredibly responsive controls - see above and below) is perfectly located.  Cons 1) Incredibly responsive controls - It took a little getting used to quick taps.  If your finger hangs out to long, you zoom right by the menu that you were looking for. 2) Owners manual - The menus are not exactly straight forward for a first time user. So you will need to skim the owners manual (which is only provided on CD). 3) Location of earphone jack - The earphone jack is located at the bottom of the unit, which while it keeps it out of the way of the controls, isn't the most convenient for everyday use.  All in all, the Pros WAY outweigh the Cons on this device.  If I were starting from scratch or buying a MP3 player as a gift, the K3 is the way that I would go... hands down.

<Title>Great product, good price.
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this for about a month and so far it's great.  Good storage capacity (enough for me anyway), great sound, sleek design, cool OLED display, simple functionality and an awesomely powerful FM tuner.  Everything I expected from the product description and the other reader reviews.   The tuner is what amazes me the most.  I work in a very old building with very thick walls (lots of concrete and rebar throughout) so I always have trouble picking-up radio stations.  I love listening to talk radio so having the FM tuner was a critical function for me and this product did not disappoint.  Even deep within the building, in areas that were virtual dead zones to other radios, this picks up a clear signal.   The only dings I have against this player are the battery life and lack of an album art display option.  I probably get 20-25 hours of operation on one charge, with much of the cool display options shortened to a few seconds of display a piece.  Overall, it's not that big of a deal because I just plug it in to the computer to recharge it for a couple of hours and I don't have to run and buy more batteries but this minor annoyance is sometimes exacerbated by spotty battery drain.  There are times that, even after a full charge with the same power consumption settings, the battery just drains more quickly and I might get a few hours less than before.  There are a couple of options for what is displayed on the screen while the music is playing, including funky pulsating graphics or a graphic equalizer.  However, since this player can display digital images I wish it would provide an option to display the album art instead.  I personally would find that more appealing for the few seconds that the display stays active while a song plays. Al in all, I love the player and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great player with loads of features at a good price.

<Content>I sold my Ipod due to problematic Itunes problems & overpriced accessories and bought this. You get all the same features plus better sound quality, better display options and an FM radio. I didn't give it 5 stars because the radio reception is okay. And it's only FM radio, no AM for you sports fans.

<Title>Flashy graphics, good battery life
<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After trying out a lot of players, I decided to go with the Samsung K3. The player is sleek and thin, just a bit larger than the Gen 2 iPod nano. The navigation is pretty easy, and the on-screen graphics are appealing. The touch buttons can be bit tricky, especially for larger hands. Make sure you buy a protective case, since the face of this player scratches easily. However, the buttons can be hard to activate with a plastic cover. The device is pretty much plug-n-play (even though it comes with player/organizer software) and works with Rhapsody To Go subscriptions (meaning it can also play WMA format). And the battery life is exceptional. Overall I recommend it for those who want a slick, basic player. It will display photos but not video.

<Content>This MP3 player is by far better then the IPod Nano.  The menus are easy to use.  The battery life is amazing on it...even holds a charge well when not used after an amount of time.  Its really easy to put music on it using the sync feature of Windows Media Player.  You can put pictures on it and make them screensavers, which pictures are crisp on the color screen.  The sound that the player produces is clear, crisp, and it can get very loud.  On top of all that it is very stylish with its touch sensitive buttons and thin sleek appearance.  I would reccomend this product to anybody.  I bought my wife a red one that's exactly like mine.

<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great product overall.  I only have two complaints. Of course, as everyone says, it is too sensitive on the buttons, but after some time to get used it it, its fine.  Also, the screen has a strange line of discoloration, making the pictures slightly less than perfect, and this occured just days after usage.  However, the radio works great, it loads up quickly and is easy to use.  Overall, its well worth the money.

<Title>The perfect MP3 player....almost!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just purchased the K3, and I have to say, "WOW!"  This beauty is sleek, stylish, and packs a powerful, rich sound.    I'm 34, and have been listening/playing music devices since I could walk.  I've been through 4 differnt MP3 players over the course of the past few years to include: iPod and Sansa models.  All I can say, is the K3 is a listening experience second to none.  I'm sure if you have thousands to spend on a music player/earbuds, etc, you could beat this device in the sound quality department, but for the majoriy of us wanting a quality player without taking out a loan, this is a winner!  I have several aftermarket earbuds ranging from $10 to $40 in price.  I was expecting to use them when this product arrived (I ordered through Amazon.com).  However, I was surprised to discover the included earbuds produced a much richer sound than my other buds.  I switched these buds between all my other MP3 players, and the results were the same, the Samsung ear buds won hands down.  To verify the sound of my new K3, I checked it against the Sansa and two iPods, and it too won hands down (using all different configuration of earbuds/players).  I can't stress enough, the K3 puts out a great rich sound.  The sound remains constant throughout the volume spectrum which was really impressive.  The insanely picky individual might detect slight distortion at the maximum volume level, but I did not.  The K3 drives loud at max volume, and is uncomfortable but still clear, crisp, rich and un-distorted.  Although clear and crisp, I couldn't imagine anyone needing to crank this device up.  In fact, the K3 has an option under settings to limit the maximum volume level if you so desire.   I haven't read a bad review yet concerning the K3's appearance.  Therefore, I won't go into details except to say, the awe factor is a definite plus.  This device does everything I want out of an MP3 player, it plays my MP3/WMA collection and allows me to have an FM radio on the fly.  This is a handy feature in my opinion for bad weather days, when power goes out and you don't have batteries for the boom-box/radio you haven't used in 5 years.  The FM tuner has 3 settings from low, medium, to high sensitivity.  This allows you to pick up distant stations.  In my experience, this tuner is very good (close to excellent).    The picture viewer is a non-issue for me, but it can be used as such.  If you are wanting a quality picture viewer I would look elsewhere (personally, I think the majority of us use our cell phones for this purpose).  However, if this is an important feature for you, I would suggest going to a Best Buy or CC and look at this model on the floor (it comes pre-installed w/approx. 15 pictures so you can decide for yourself).  I've read numerous complaints about the software that came with the K3.  I decided not to install it.  In fact, I have yet to even open the CD case it came in.  Windows/XP will recognize and install the K3 as soon as you plug in the usb connector.  I use Window Media Player 11 as my sync interface.  Reviews have complained about playlists, etc.   What I do, is create several playlists in WMP such as: workout, easy listening, country, rock, etc.  I then go through my WMP library, and add songs to these playlists.  When I'm done, I just drag and drop the WMP playlist over to the K3, and it catagorizes all the music via the ID3 tag, as well as creating the actual playlists I just tranferred over.  I never drag and drop individual songs/artist/albums to the K3 (just playlists).  Because of ID3 tags, the K3 will not only catagorize the song in the playlist you just transferred, it will also catagorize all the songs according to artist, album, and genre.  Therefore, if I have several songs from AC/DC in my workout playlist, I can still go to artists, and listen to AC/DC seperate from the playlists.  So why did I say the K3 was "almost" the perfect MP3 player?  The only fault I have with this device is the touchpad interface.  As mentioned by everyone else, this touchpad is sensitive.  In my experience, if you don't pick it up by its sides, you'll end up touching a button causing the track to FF or REW.  There is a lock feature which disables this problem, so it is not a great concern.  However, if you're the type of person who likes to change songs, volume, settings often, you'll hate switching back and forth from lock/un-lock.  If you don't lock it, you'll inadvertantly touch buttons each time you pick it up to change settings.  However, if you are the type to push play and forget it, the lock feature makes this unit a perfect fit.  I would imagine this would be for the person who listens to music at work, or on runs/walks where you push play, lock it and forget it.  While not a design engineer, I would suggest Samsung make the device less sensitive or recognize the difference between and actual input versus random touching.  This would bring this device closer to perfection.  There is also a feature which shuts the screen off after a user defined time limit.  This helps combat the above problem.  When the screen shuts off under this feature, the first touch brings the screen back to life (instantly with no delay), and the subsequent touch will provide input commands.  Therefore, as long as a random touch is limited to 1, you won't have a problem.  If you keep the device in a pocket or hold it in your hand, you will have to lock the device to prevent inadvertant inputs.  My last complaint, while minor and of personal preference, is the inability to go direct to the "Now Playing" mode.  For instance, if you are listening to a playlist and decide to change the EQ settings, you must navigate back through the menues to get to the "Now Playing" mode.  The "Now Playing" mode allows you to jump around within the selection of music you are listening to.  Overall, I'm extremely impressed & pleased with this device.  Sound quality is excellent.  Firmware version 3.05 (latest version, and installed on my device) allows user defined EQ settins along with bass boost.  Extremely slim and elegant looking with a sturdy construction of stainless and plastic.  This device feels solid in your hand (not like a plastic toy).  The pros definitely outweigh the cons on the K3.  If the sensitivity issue with the touchpad were addressed, this would be the Perfect MP3 player.

<Title>Beautiful MP3 player, works with Linux
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player as a present for my wife (opted for the refurbished as I am a cheapskate), and she is very happy with the gift. If you want all the details, please refer to all the reviews, which I found were very helpful. My post here, is  simply to confirm that I was able to trivially get the player to work on Linux (Specifically Ubuntu 7.10 "Gusty").  Here is what I did: 1-Plug in the player, and "Music Player" pops up. 2-From the player menu select "Edit" then "Plugins.." 3-In the dialog that appears, enable "Portable Players - MTP" (MTP is the Microsoft MP3 player protocol that this device speaks) 4-Close the plugin dialog, and the music player app will now display "Samsung YP-K3" under the devices tree on the left.  After this, "Music Player" will automatically detect the player upon connect/disconnect. I only wish that Samsung had not been so "evil" in confining itself to MTP.

Will synch up to any computer with software installed, easy to transfer songs back and forth.

Cheaper then the I-Pod Shuffle, very user friendly with a viewable screen and well organized menu, plus a nice compliment of settings. Oh yeah, and an FM radio, which by the way, has better reception then my expensive component stero system at home.  Buy this MP3, you won't be sorry.

<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this as an Xmas gift for my 64yr old Mother. To give some insight, my mother is one of the most technologically inept people I know. On top of that, she doesnt have the patience it takes to learn how to use most electronics.   That being said; This gift was the best received and most used of everything I ever purchased for her. Once I got her to understand how much information this MP3 could store, I was employed to place all her CDs and two Audio Books on it.   Essentially, you know you have made a great purchase when the use of an item is so simple that our elders can adapt to it with ease.

<Title>An excellent companion
<Date>Sun Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought it after an extensive market research. There would be no research if iPods came with FM tuners, but they don't. Well, Samsung YP-K3JQB beats iPod in this respect. Here's the skinny:  Sound quality: very decent especially with a pair of high-end headphones. FM tuner: automatically searches and sets up up to 30 presets at the push of a button. Interface: very intuitive, you really don't need a user's guide. IT-factor: most definitely. Cool and practical.

<Content>I have to admit that I didn't do much research and bought the Samsung for the "cool factor" (I got the red one). I charged it up the first time and wanted to run it completely dead before charging it again. It took forever to run out! The ads say 25 hours. Mine was definitely that. I run with it every day and my kids listen to it and it was still over 3 weeks before it ran out. The software is easy to figure out and I love having an FM tuner with it too! In fact, there isn't much I don't love about it.

<Content>Loved it at first but the playlist function does not work.  You are suppose to be able to create an album out of whatever songs you have in your library and when you transfer to the unit, it should show up in  your Playlist (according to samsung support).  This did not work despite several attempts.  I was hoping the playlist function would solve the annoying issue with playing music on this unit. You have two choices when listening to songs on the unit, If you select "All Tracks" it puts every single song in alphebetical order!.  Or you can listen to each Album and when the all the songs for the album are done the unit stops and you must select the next album.  You cannot listen to all the albums in a row without telling it to play the next album.

Bottom Line: Unless you're really into Apple, I see no reason to choose the Nano.  The K3 is a cheaper, sleeker player that does pretty much the exact same thing.  Plus, everyone has an ipod nowadays.
