<Title>Excellent quality, great features
<Date>Thu Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Model: Creative Zen Nano Plus (1GB) I purchased this primarily for the features it provides and so far I am very satisfied with the quality and the features.  - Line-in recording. records in mp3 format (96, 128, 160 Kbps). It requires a smaller plug for the line-in and the included wire is very small, so recording from TV etc. might be problematic. But I guess you can buy a longer cable.  - FM radio and recording. Records in WAV, not sure why they would do that. No time-based recording. Recording FM will need the headphone cable plugged in, coz thats the antenna.  - softwareless transfer. So I can use it as a USB stick. U can also transfer the recorded track to your pc, without software, just copy-paste.

<Title>great player- no problems
<Date>Tue Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had one of these for 6 months now and it has held up to steady use and being knocked around in a backpack and in and out of my car. It works great, is light and small, easy to use. I love it. Triple A batteries last a long time in it and they are cheap too- no pesky recharging time.  My wife, who avoids electronic gadgets, wants one for Christmas.  If she's happy I'm happy so soon we'll have two. I don't get to be in the ipod clique, but I save money and have a player that does more, takes music from more sources, plays more types of files, and is just as easy to use, so I'm surviving. The controls: there are 2 volume buttons, a power/pause button, and a scroll wheel. I can hold it in one hand and handle all the controls with my thumb easily. Without reading the instructions it took me one minute to figure out the controls. Highly recommended.

<Title>Excellent!
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Bought the Zen Nano Plus for my 13 year old son. I am pleased to say it was an excellent choice, as it's very easy to load with music and to use the controls. The sound quality rivals the best of players. And most of all my son loves it. Some of his friends who have ipods even envy his player! Bravo to Creative for bringing us a great product at an affordable price!

<Title>Creative Zen Nano Plus is a bust
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I ordered the Creative Zen Nano Plus, and it was a bust. Amazon.com had fantastic customer support on the returns, but the Creative help team was nonexistent. You are put on hold and then disconnected. The players would not turn on, so you are stuck with no help from the maker, nor able to listen to music. I will stick with better quality products like an IPOD.

<Title>It even grinds Coffee Beans!
<Date>Sat Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got the Nano Plus for Christmas and it is too cool.  I have already used all the features (except the line-in) and they all work great.  I can record all my favorite radio shows and make e-mailable podcasts right on the Nano.  Thanks to all the research I did on Amazon I helped my wife get me the perfect gift!!  I am not anti - iPod, but this player offers so much more.  I spent at least 2-3 hours in the Apple store talking with the rep. (who by the way was very helpful) he showed me all the features and went over the software and I went for about 3 weeks saying that I wanted an iPod until I did more research.  I learned that you can get so much more out of other players.  Based on my research I know that you get more for your money with this player.

<Title>Doesn't install easily, help nonexistant, manual uninformative
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This looks good on paper but:  None of my three computers at home recognize it (XP home SP2, XP Pro SP2) so I can't transfer files. I've tried installing CREATIVE's software but their software nor WMP 10 recognize this.   Play for Sure? Not in the least.  Check out the website? Not much help there. A few things to try that don't work. Look at the manual? Not much there. They don't even tell you how to use anything more than the most basics. Call support? Well its a toll call and they are only open when I am at work (9-6 central time M-F). Looks to me that they don't really want to help their customers.  I am a fairly advanced computer user and I am very dissapointed. I've check the USB ports, used multiple computers, and check the web. Four hours and I still can't hear a single song.   Stay away from this one. Even if it works for you, supporting a company with such poor customer support is a bad idea. No more CREATIVE for me.  (OH, and it comes in one fo those packages you have to destroy to open to returning to AMAZON is not an option unless you accespt a partial refund.)

<Title>Creatively lacking support
<Date>Tue Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased my Zen player with high hopes that were ultimately crushed by their technical support.  I am a pretty savvy, techno-geek but I met my match with the mp-3 player from Creative.  After experiencing set up problems, I contacted their tech. support.   I spoke to a friendly girl who seemed to be dazed by even the smallest technical problem which she was obviously enslaved to answer.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  When I was told I would be contacted in 24 hours by a supervisor to clear the problem, I returned the product.  I never heard back from the girl's supervisor, nor was the problem ever resolved.

<Content>i-pod? whats that? this thing is the best MP3 player in its catagory. #1. its TINY TINY TINY ! #2. it plays all MP3 and WMA formats #3. if you get one of those HORRIBLE proteced CDs that SONY makes you can RIP it directly into the unit by using its built in analog audio input. Battery life is very good and the sound is truly excellent. I have not tried the build in voice recorder or FM tuner, I didnt buy it for those features. I should point out also that it does NOT come with a neck strap however it does come with an arm strap. You could use a neck strap if you have one because it has a hole for it. Only bad thing is the battery cover comes off a bit too easily so i just put a peice of tape on it JUST IN CASE !

<Title>sounds grate
<Date>Wed Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my first MP3 so i am new to the game.It sounds grate after you mess with the EQ.The headphones they give you suck but after geting my sony ear buds(walfart$10)i realy like the thing.It was a little tricky at first to figer out how to down load my music.The player uses a drag and drop process.It may be me or windows but it would not sinck my playlist from windows sinck list.Every time i tried it would put songs from the same album in thier own folder.it only holds 30 folders.So if you have just a few songs from each album and more than 30 songs you have a problem.But once i figerd out what was going on it was all good.Thier software works good becuase it keeps all the songs as singls and you can make play lists with it.And with a simple click,drage,drop you have your music.I gave it a 4 becuase of the lack of instructions in the manaul.It just tells you how to turn the darn thing on and scroll thru folders.I do wish it was a 2GB player.But for my first MP3 it will do until I get the 30GB M-Vision.

<Title>Great Until It Quit After 13 Months
<Date>Thu Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I owned my Zen Nano Plus for 13 months before it stopped working.  The LCD will still light up for a few seconds after I try to power up, then it shuts down.  My computer won't recognize it, so I can't update firmware.  Since I'm 13 months out, I can't get any support from Creative, except for paying $13.  I'm going to buy a different, cheaper brand.  I dont expect things to last forever, but 13 months?  C'mon.

<Content>I owned this device for 5 months and it just stopped working... I went though all the proper channels for repair and was told they want at least $25.00 to "work" on my warranty repair. It turns out only parts are covered for a year and labor only for 3 months. This is NOT what I call standing behind your product.  DON'T BUY CREATIVE PRODUCTS! Not only are they poorly made, but Creative knows this and doesn't stand behind their own products.

<Content>I have had my player for a little over year now, and I like it.   But what I want to tell you about is it's durability.   I have dropped my mp3player, and all the normal things to abuse it.   But two nights ago I dropped it in a cup of iced tea.    I got it out, got the battery out, and blew on both the player and battery it to dry them.   The music stored on it still played, and after one day of drying out, the radio works as well.  That's what I wanted to say.

<Title>A few more comments
<Date>Wed Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Others have described this unit fully, so I won't do so here.  Highlights are: (1) About the size of a pack of gum and comes with an arm-band carrier which is great for running (2) Has an FM radio and microphone built in (and a line-in jack) (3) Runs on an AAA battery (my sons' Ipods all died prematurely because of the rechargeable batteries which aren't replaceable)- for me it is easier to carry a few AAA batteries than a charger (4) An incredible number of settings and modes that are easy to access once you get used to the toggle-press switch (5) Extremely easy to drag and drop songs into organizing folders on the PC interface (6) Tiny display is amazingly informative, with song time, repeat mode, battery life, equalization setting, and song title all displayed when a song is playing (display changes when accessing other functions).  I have only one minor complaint, that is not documented: You are limited to 60 song folders (including the one or two folders that are built in).  You can set up more than that on the PC interface, but the player ignores them.

<Title>Zen Nano dies yet again
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first nano(black) and replacement(under warranty) nano(black) have both failed. After the duracell provided battery was used up and I replaced it the unit shuts off after about two seconds. I followed the instructions the first time to replace the firm ware via download but it didn't work and just erased all my music. Creative Zen technical support was not very helpful and only repeated the exact same instructions that were on their web. After a series of calls they finally agreed to replace the unit. Well here we go again the exact same problem has now happened with the replacement nano shutting off after two seconds. Stayed tuned...Too bad -- I did enjoy it when it was working. My husband has a blue nano and has not had any problems so I wonder if the black nanos are defective?

<Content>I bought this for my girlfriend; no special reason I just love her so much; It's twice as big as mine, and since she enjoys music so much I just love to make her happy.  I love you Alicia!  Hours and hours of music in the palm of your hand. . . .can't go wrong really.  Got a letter, resume, or other document to take with you, it doubles as a flash drive.  Also plays FM radio AND records it. You got something like this, you got control over your music.  Wish I had this in hand while in other citys that are playing HOT HOT music on a weekend night!  I'm gonna make Alicia my wife.  This is my testament to one of the most beautiful latin girls I've ever seen.

<Content>mainly used for music playback.  works great.  it's small and does all i need it to do.  i tried to do mp3 encoding to record stuff but i haven't gotten it to work yet.  only drawback for me, is it takes a while to scroll for songs that i want to hear.  i dunno if there is an easier way for me to scroll through songs.  i love how u can just drag and drop songs into a folder.  it can be used as a portable hard drive.  it comes with a case that is white.  i wish it was darker so it would match the mp3 player itself but i don't mind so much anymore.  if u can get this sucker for less than $50 i'd say it's an awesome deal.  if u have more than a gig of music, i would recommend something that could hold more songs.  when i get the mp3 encoding to work, i will be very happy, haha.

<Title>Zen Nano is decent for the price, but prefer the iPod Nano
<Date>Sun Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently upgraded from the Zen 1GB Nano to the 4 GB iPod and am much happier with it's performance. There are pros and cons to both, but the iPod is the better of the two.  One thing about the Zen and any other non-Apple mp3 player is that if you download songs off of iTunes they are only formatted to play on the iPod in the mp4 format. What this means is that you can't add purchased music to the Zen without converting it to the mp3 format and the only way to do it and be able to load songs onto the Zen is to burn a disc of the converted mp3's and then re-add them onto your computer. This becomes a nuisance and Apple hasn't done anything about it - they essentially are limiting their competition by doing this.  The sound of the iPod is superior to the Zen as is its functionality - the iPod allows you to search through playlists much faster. Also if you want to play the Zen through your home or car stereo the sound quality is poor. The iPod also has faster song download time.  Another issue with the Zen is playlists - once you've created them and downloaded the songs you can't change the order, you have to load them in the order you want them to play. Also, the earbuds that come with the Zen are too big and become uncomfortable if you leave them in too long.  The Zen does have positives, it's small, has the FM radio (decent reception), the recorder is great and you can also delete songs directly from it which you can't do on the iPod. It also has a equalizer that lets you set up your sound preferences and the iPod only has preset equalizer settings.    I liked the Zen but it just isn't as nice as the iPod. I know the larger GB models of the Zen are great, I would either get one of those or the iPod.

<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my mom sometime late last year and she loves it!  It's great for a long daily commute or jog.  It's so tiny and she no longer feels the need to lug around her CD player and CDs...I've put all her favories in the mp3 player.  The headphones aren't that bad, but it all depends on the person and individual comfort.  I came close to buying her an ipod but realized that I would have to buy a separate piece to have radio.  The zen nano already has radio which is a huge PLUS if you need a break from listening to your own tunes.  I recently dropped my beloved ipod and now it's BROKEN!!! so today I will BUY a zen nano until i'm able to get it repaired...if i get it repaired b/c the zen nano will do the job just fine. Buying batteries isn't such a big deal for us..our office supplies bulk batteries and we use those..shhh. each player has its own pros and cons for battery life vs rechargable in a portable player..so weigh your options and decided what's best for you!

<Title>Great, Solid product.  Great for Audiobooks
<Date>Fri Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I spent a good deal of time trying to find my perfect MP3 player.  realized it doesn't exist.  but here was my criteria list 1. Plays Mp3 AND WMA's 2. at least 1 gig 3. less than $200 4. FM Radio (which records) 5. AM Radio (which records) 6. Small 7. good battery life 8. Pause track when turned off. 9. Superb sound quality and loud enough. Well, NO mp3 players have AM radio functionality unfortunately.  Other than that, this little puppy is nothing less than a marvel! small as a cigarrette lighter, it slides easily into any pocket.  i read some complaints about the battery compartment, and it's not the best, but it comes with a rubber case, which covers the battery compartment completely, and the best part about the case, is it doesn't interfere with any of the buttons!  I keep mine in it's case all the time, and i tuck the earbud cord under the clip so it won't rip out of the player.  Which brings me to the only downside the earbuds.  HUGE!  however, do yourself a favor, shell out 20 bucks and buy the KOSS Spark Plugs.  They are so comfortable you don't notice them in and the bass is fantastic on them.  I was also pleasantly suprised when i changed the battery out it held my place on my book!  Don't hesitate with this player.

<Date>Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>&#65279;I was very satisfied with this player while it was operating: however, after about 6 months of use the player wigged out on me.  The volume control became non-functioning and music would bellow out of the left speaker while nothing at all sounded from the right.  Nothing I could do could resolve this issue. I tried everything from adjusting the player utilizing the menu screen to updating the firmware.  My efforts were futile.  I thought it was a fluke until I was discussing the problem with one of my students and he said that his player had the same problem.  Coincidence, or manufacturing error: It appears to be all to clear to me.  Be forewarned that if you purchase this MP3 player you could either be very happy (as many are and I was) or very disappointed (as others will be and I am).

<Content>I wanted to purchase an MP3 player to use while I was working out in the gym.  I looked at the IPOD, but did not like the fact that you could only download from ITunes or your own CD collection.  So I did some research and found Creative.  This player is ultra compact and lightweight...perfect for the gym.  This little player not only stores lots of music, but has an FM radio and records voice.  The scroll button takes some getting used to; but once you get the feel it is like second nature.  When it comes time to upgrade, I will be looking towards Creative again.  Great product!

<Title>Great product
<Date>Sun Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this little player.  It's small, light, runs a long time on a single AAA battery, and is user-friendly.  The software was easy enough to figure out, and I found the sound and headphones to be just fine (but then I've never used expensive headphones, so I may not know what I'm missing). The small size makes it easy to put the device in a pocket or carry it around in a small purse when you're not using it.  Recording off the radio works well also.  I have about 350 tracks on the device (and some are considerably longer than 3-4 minutes).  I definitely would recommend avoiding anything smaller than 1 GB if you can help it, though.  The only things I don't like:  the line-in recording does not work on my device. I haven't contacted the company about it because it isn't that important to me, but one of the reasons I chose this particular model was for that feature.  Another thing is that I'd really like it if while it was displaying the song title it would also display the artist.  But that is a very minor matter, and at least the title will display.  Also, the headphones have a very short cord going to the left ear, a very long cord going to the right ear and an overly long cord going to the device, so that is a little strange, but still totally functional.  Overall, I definitely recommend the Nano Plus.  I've had it for a couple months and would buy another for a gift.  It's a great little invention.

<Title>Bookworm in my Ear
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>As most reviewers here, I did quite a bit of research before choosing a player.  Unlike most here, I bought it nearly completely for audiobook listening. There was a $100 discount given on Amazon if one signed up for Audible.com for a year and purchased the MP3 player from Amazon.  I happened to luck into that promotion and immediately bought the player.  Best choice I ever made.    I'm a little past middle-aged and not very technically minded.  I did not have a single problem learning how to download audiobooks or music and was tickled that the sound was so clear.  I've listened to about eight books now, downloaded Mindy Smith's album, and bought some music from Walmart.com, and have not had a single problem.  I did notice that sometime it bookmarked my place in a book and sometimes it didn't.  Paolini's Eragon had no bookmarks, A Changed Man did.  I think that's the recording's choice, not the player's misstep, however.  Anyway, if someone out there is interested in listening to an audiobook while working or taking a walk, I would highly recommend the Zen Nano Plus and audible.com.   One complaint:  The belt clip gets pinched just opposite of the on/off button...I quite often turn off the player while squeezing the clip to attach the player to my belt.  Otherwise, I'm in heaven.  I drove to Charlotte last weekend and honestly slowed down a bit so I could have more time to listen to "The Lincoln Lawyer" by Michael Connelly.

<Title>GREAT Product
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been doing alot of reseach into a new MP3 player and reading alot of reviews, checking prices, etc. I have an RCA2012 and was not happy with it (see my review regarding the RCA).  I didn't want one with an expansion card (too complex, been there, done that), one that would work with Windows Media & hold most of my songs (which worked out to be 1GB), one small enough so you could hide it in your pocket at work (it measures 2.5 inches by 1.5 inches in it's case), and a case with a belt clip so I could wear it if I didn't have a pocket and didn't want to jog (the case is rubber flexiskin with a rubber belt clip on the back, although it also comes with an armband for those joggers out there).  All Creative MP3's are well reviewed and recommended.  Although this price is the lowest for this player, it's a little more than I wanted to pay.  I thought about a 512, but I have more music than that on my computer and experts recommend that you buy the most memory that you can afford.      When everyone said how easy this was to download I definately had my apprehensions (last time I tried to download the RCA it took me a trip to the store to exchange it and 8 hours to figure it out, not to mention the damage to my blood pressure).    I didn't want to start in the evening because I'm not one for patience and if it didn't work I'd be up all night fuming.  WELL, I took a chance and WOW. My songs are all in Windows Media and it took literally, I'm still amazed, under 10 minutes to install the software (the software will tell you how long you have before you'll be hearing songs on your player) and another 10 minutes to download almost 1 GB to the MP3 player. I am a little past middle-aged and no techno-whiz (if the computer comes on and the internet works I'm happy).  Believe me, if I can get this to work anyone can.   Also, the sound on this is astounding. I WOULD definately recommend this MP3 player and from now on will not buy another unless it's a Creative.

<Title>Zen Nano Plus is too cool (1 Gig)
<Date>Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didn't do a bunch of research before buying this. I liked it because it had voice recording in addition to being an mp3 player. I've just had it a few days, maybe I could write a better review if I waited a while. But it's hard to wait, this thing is too cool.   It's nice and small and holds one gig! This is so amazing. It wasn't that long ago that we all ooohhd and aahhhd when a friend bought a 1 gig hard drive. We thought that was ridiculously large. And it cost him $2000! And now here's this little thing about the size of your ring and little fingers together that can hold a gig. And indeed you can use it like an external drive.   Most things seem to be well thought out about the Nano Plus. It doesn't take long to come to life after you power it up, unlike a cd player. It remembers what it was doing when it was turned off. The menus are easy enough to follow and figure out without reading a manual or anything. The display is legible and titles of songs scroll so you can read the whole thing.  It comes with an arm band. This works great for carrying the unit on your arm. I think an additional clip or velcro strip or something for carrying the earbuds when not in use would be nice too. The clear silicone rubber case that holds the clip to the Nano plus has a nice feel to it.   It plays mp3s fine. The preset equalizer settings seem ok and you can make your own setting as well. I haven't tried the custom setting. I don't care about playing wma files. I like to avoid microsoft/windows things whenever possible.  The Zen Nano Plus is not sold as something that plays wav files. However, if you put the wav files in the Recorded Tracks directory, they will play. Why they configured things so you have to trick the thing to get wav files to play I can't fathom.  The microphone records to wav files. I think it would be much better to record to mp3 files. Or even better, let it be user selectable, mp3 or wav. The line in records to mp3. That ought to be selectable too.   The voice recording part works OK. I actually recorded music with  it. Definitely not hi-fi of course, not really usable for music, although it is recognizable. The signal gets clipped for one thing. But voice comes out OK. You can record a lecture and understand what's being said on playback. I heard a fair amount of echo when I tried it, but it could have been the room I was in. Close up recording of a voice is fine.   I don't really like 1/8" plugs. It seems like they are unreliable. But at least the ones on the Nano Plus (headphone and line-in) have a quality solid feel to them.

<Title>Ready To Say That After 1-Week...
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my unit for a little over a week now and I am impressed! I struggled with the decision of which mp3 player to buy. I came very close to buying the Ipod Mini but ultimately decided on the Zen Nano for the following reasons:  1) No hard drive: Unit uses flash memory so I don't have to worry about internal part damage when jogging or exercising, or dropping the unit on the floor. 2) Unit is SO small it fits in your pocket and you won't even know it's there.  3) The menu is very easy to navigate (yes, you'll have a lot of scrolling to do but it's easy). 4) The sound is very very good. 5) You can customize the equalizer for better sound.  One thing I don't like is the fit of the earphones (would have given a 5-star rating if not for this). The right side seams to fit me well but the left side does not and falls out all the time. After searching for a good set of earphones, and reading many reviews, I just purchased a Sony MDR-EX71SL set of headphones from Amazon. I hope they work well. So, if you plan on buying the Zen, plan on spending at least another $28 for a better set of headphones.   In closing, I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend this unit to everyone!

<Title>not up to snuff
<Date>Sat Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wanted a very small mp3 player to use when I run.  I found the Zen Nano Plus 1gig on sale for $100, and it came with an armband, so I said what the hey.  Pros: 1.  Small and lightweight 2.  Has an FM radio 3.  Runs off an AAA battery 4.  Syncs with iTunes 5.  Has a display  Cons: 1.  Cannot make a playlist using iTunes- you can only dump files 2.  Earbuds are ridiculously big and will fit nobody's ears 3.  Battery cover is cheaply made and even the Creative rep told me it snaps easily 4.  Takes forever to load up firmware when it turns on 5.  In shuffle mode, it freezes sometimes for 10+ seconds when you change the track 6.  Armband is really uncomforable  All in all, the thing that eventually made me decide to return it is the freezing while shuffling thing.

<Title>overall solid mp3 player
<Date>Thu Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this  mp3 player for a couple of weeks and for the most part it is a pretty good buy. Pros: SMALL (almost too small), no need for propietary software like ipods and other brands, can use windows explorer to drag and drop songs and other files, 1 gig is more than plenty and can easily hold over 250 regular sized songs, really liked the fact that it is one of the only mp3 players that also have a direct line in and built in microphone Cons: Biggest drawback, cant browse through other songs while current one is playing such as in Ipod or Iriver, I found volume to be a bit low when trying to play through car stereo (this might be the same for other players I dont know), since everything is controlled through one button I am concerned about how long it will last.

<Title>Very happy; very small, great sound and add-on features
<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I did a lot of comparison shopping.  I'm extremely happy with my Zen Nano Plus after a week.  My demands included (a) at least 1 GB, (b) runs on AA or AAA battery, (c) build in FM player, (d) must have a screen (Ipod Shuffle - out), (e) line-in music recorder and voice recorder highly desired. Obviously, the Nano Plus has all five features.  How do they hold up?  (A-Memory) It holds ?30 hours of music in WMA or MP3 sampled at around 50-60 kbps, the latter is still "FM quality" which is pretty good, especially if you're listening on airplanes, subways, etc.  More if you use audiobooks (e.g. 60 mb = 8 hrs).  (B-AAA Battery).  It's 12-hours plus.  I'll likely get a four-pack and a recharger.  And boy is the Nano Plus tiny. It's really featherweight. (C-FM). It's high quality and records well.  It works great in my gym, where for example my Sony CD&FM Walkman gets little but static.  Stations of intermediate strength will shift in sound quality with body distance.  So you can set the sound just right, start the Record function, but as you walk away the antenna/reception balance may shift.  So far I've taped for example a random hour of radio to listen to on an airplane.  I expect I'll sometimes be recording a specific program to hear later.  (D-Screen).  When the Ipod Nano came out, I almost shifted my purchase plan, but I still wanted all the other features of the Nano Plus.  I figured out most all the menus in the first day or two of playing around.  But the first 5 minutes are confusing.  You don't get sophisticated playlist options, but I didn't care about that.  Albums or other media go in folders sorted alphabetically, and songs list alphabetically.  I thought it would have a folder structure, but it appears to just list folders alphabetically in a series you can toggle through.  For example, Folder A, Folder B (subfolder 1 and 2), Folder C.  You'll toggle linearly across Folder A, Folder 1, Folder 2, then Folder C.  I was a little disappointed with this, but you're unlikely to have more than 10-20 folders.  It auto-bookmarks books from audible.com.   (E: Line-in and voice).  Voice recorder is a little tinny but quite workable.  Line-in is pretty high quality. I think I may use this alot - for example, record a talk show on Tivo and later listen to it on the Zen Nano.  I also have a hobby of listening to movie soundtracks (the whole audio track, not just the songs) and this will import them from vhs or tivo.  [People think this is extremely eccentric of me but talky movies hold up very well as a soundtrack only, especially if you're stuck in traffic, planes, etc. I've even listened to favorite tv series (e.g. six feet under) this way.]  You can drag to your PC both FM recorded files and Line-In recorded files.   AND WHAT I'D CHANGE:  Two GB flash memory would be nicer (and the competing iPod nano has come up to 5 GB flash memory).  A timer for FM recording might be nice.  An option to set FM to "mono" mode would increase the reliability of middling-strength stations.  Ability to actually toggle between two levels of folders.  And why not simply record both line-in (now WAV files) and FM files as MP3?  More range of options in setting resolution (quality) of recorded files.  The included earbuds are real big; I upgraded to Sony MDR-EX71 earplug phones (list $50, avaialble $30) which have rubber cuffs that reduce noise alot; I'm very happy with their sound and comfort.

<Content>Lots of cons, but for me it was extremely negative that the battery cover is sooo poorly and cheaply made that it breaks easily.  SO if you still want this player, be avare! (and operate it very gently)  In addition I still find it anoying that there comes a small beep when the player switches on/off and somtimes with low volume the same occures between songs.

<Title>Most Features For The Money
<Date>Wed Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>High-quality MP3 sound along with voice recorder and FM tuner. Replace the earbuds as soon as you get it, though; they're uncomfortable and not high quality. Hoping that Creative will issue a firmware update to make this player compatible with subscription music services (like Napster To Go). It's great for the gym or running--very easy drag and drop file transfer with WinXP. Included software is ok, but not needed with WinXP. Flash MP3 players are in their infancy--1GB is not very much, but the minimum for me. Price at this point is very reasonable. I've had it for 5 weeks, and it is very durable and easy to use. If the ipod Nano had voice recorder and FM, I would have spent the money on it. Maybe next time?

<Title>i use this bad boy strictly for line in recording
<Date>Fri Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i work on a talk show at a radio station, so sound is a huge thing for me. i have this mp3 playa always plugged into my tv. its super easy. they give u a cable. one end goes into the tv's headphone port, and the other end goes into the bottom of the mp3 player. its decent quality and just an all around easy, quick process to turn tv sound into mp3s.  one option i turned off was "sync track". sync track basically starts recording when an audio signal comes down the line. but the downside is that a lot of time youll miss the first second or two of the audio you want, especially when its the transition b/w the end of a commercial and the beginning of the program and theres black screen and dead silence for a few seconds. and line sync cuts off recording when the audio signal ends. so if youre like me, and youre rewinding and fast forwarding your tivo around like crazy getting to the right spot, youre gonna have about 20 2 or 3 second long mp3s when u finally are ready to edit. put it simply, its a big pain, so just turn sync track OFF.  ive had this for about 6 months. i get tons of audio from it. i pull sound from 60 minutes, saturday night live, the office, letterman. i could grab something from a dvd i suppose, but i havent tried that yet. the quality isnt top notch, but it is coming out of the headphone jack and i do have an on-the-cheap-side 20 inch lcd tv. but it does a great job for what i need, and i have no complaints.

<Title>excellent features, flimsy construction
<Date>Sun Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Good: The feature set makes this player the clear winner for me: standard USB drive, replaceable batteries, plays WMA and MP3, and records voice.  I used mine heavily almost every day for a year, and replaced it with another.  The sound quality is adequate, and after a short time the controls were easy to use without having to look.  Playing WMA files at 320 kbps, a rechargeable NiMH cell lasts about 3 hours, which is fine.  When the battery poops out just pop in a new one.  The player is very small and light.  It's not locked into any proprietary music sources, and it's not made by Apple (which has the worst environmental record of the big players).  The Bad: The battery case snapped off pretty early.  I had to keep it in place with a piece of removable painters tape.  The whole unit feels flimsy and delicate, and it stopped working after a year.  1 Gb isn't much if you prefer higher bitrate encoding.

<Title>Great Podcast Tool
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I settled on this Flash mp3 player since my primary use was going to be just podcasts and other players seemed too expensive for what I wanted.  I also only use it when I exercise and the idea of punishing a hard drive during a workout seemed risky: a flash drive made more sense.    I use iTunes to manage podcast subscriptions on my PC.  The Creative Zen Nano gets hooked to my pc through its USB cord and appears like any other flash drive in my directory.  I usually trash everything that's on it and just copy the podcast folder from my iTunes directory after all the new downloads are done and I've deleted on iTunes things I've already heard.   Once the Zen Nano is loaded you can ratchet between folders quickly.  The interface can't be called "intuitive" but it also isn't hard once you focus  on learning it for a few minutes.  Now that I have the hang of it finding things is very fast and easy.  The software that comes with it is truly weird.  I spent 10 minutes with it and gave up.  iTunes works fine and is free.  It's simply a flash drive that plays mp3s so lots of things will work.  To my surprise the radio function works very well so I've added listening to the radio while commuting on the light rail.  Battery life seems to be about the 15-18 hours promised.  I have listened to some music but mostly podcasts. Sound is great for both.  I am concerned about its durability.  Can't make a judgement on that after three weeks. The USB connection to the Zen is unique to Creative products which is a drawback.  The industry needs to standardize on a micro connector. The cord is also very short.  I had to find a USB extension so that I wasn't digging behind my pc to hook up each time.    For what I wanted--a podcast tool-- this thing is great.  I typically have at least 10 hours worth of podcasts on it and haven't used 20% of its memory yet.

<Content>This MP3 player is rich in features. It has FM tuner, recorder and MP3 playback. You can also record songs from other sources. It also has a arm band to use it while you workout. The FM radio has a decent sound. The voice recorder is average. The recordings are not very clear and they are stored in WAV file format which takes up a lot of space. The MP3 sound quality is good, but not with the supplied headphones. I use my Philips noise canceling headphone and with that the sound quality is really good. You can adjust the equalizer (4-band) or use the preset. The supplied software is good to transfer & organize your music. The battery can be detached. This unit also can be used as a USB drive to move files between computers.   Overall this product is value for money. I would strongly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for value.

<Title>A reason to like the 21st century
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So far, the new millenium hasn't shown me much, but this cool little matchbox-sized gadget makes me appreciate the 21st century.  I have at least 10 CDs loaded onto it (in WAV format to save space), plus a bunch of stray songs, and it is only about half full.  The radio tuner is a giant plus over the iPod nano.  I haven't yet used the voice recorder or the FM recording capability, but it's nice to know they're there.  I'm not an audiophile, but I'm very pleased with the sound quality.  I was pleased with the sound quality of the earbuds, too, but the foam covers fell off almost instantly, and then the earbuds wouldn't stay in my ears.  I give the Zen Nano Plus five stars, but it isn't perfect.  The earbuds are one problem, but I think that's just an inherent design flaw with any earbuds.  Another inherent problem is that the device is so tiny that the screen can hold very little information.  Again, not a big deal and a worthwhile tradeoff. I had no problem loading music onto the player, but it has an irritating habit of playing the songs back in alphabetical order.  I discovered almost by accident how to get them back in the original order of the CD (by going through the Organize Data menu), but this is a silly waste of time.  I have been trying to use the shuffle player, but for some reason it only takes songs from four of the twelve or so folders on the player.     All in all, I think this player is great value.  It blows me away to think that this tiny thing that weighs a few ounces holds more music than the 10-disc CD player in my car.  A credit to modern technology!

<Content>What a piece of junk! After four hours of messing with this thing and at least that many system recoveries, mine is repackaged and ready for return. The "simple" drag and drop loading of this turd has locked my computer up more times than I care to recount. The one time I was able to get more than 20 songs onto the thing without having to CTRL + ALT + DEL and start over from scratch, the player itself locked up! I consider myself to be fairly computer literate, but this thing made me feel like a complete and total idiot. I'm so disgusted right now, I'm not even going to waste my time with Creative Labs' customer support (which, by the way, is only open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday). Save yourself the time, trouble and headache and buy something else -- anything else. Aaaaaarrrrrgh!

<Content>I've only had the Nano Plus for about 2 months but I really like it.  It is my first MP3 player and I've found it pretty easy to become accustomed to.  Software is user-friendly and its relatively simple to load it up with songs.  I love how incredibly small it is.  At the same time, it's incredibly delicate and I'm afraid I will crush it if I'm not careful.  The only other thing that I dislike so far is that the idea of playlists doesn't seem to exist.  However, I think its great value for your money.  By the way, the FM tuner works internationally as well!

<Content>No suprises here, I expected the best audio and I got it. I got this to assist in recording those old vinyls and it works super. I record a side to my Nano then go to the computer and split up the tracks with my audio editor. Eliminate the table rumble and it makes a super recording. I must agree that the earphones have got to go. I went to Radio Shack and bought a set of 20.00 ear buds that are a lot more comfortable and fit nicely in my ear, the two together are superb. I also travel extensivly so I made folders and it is easier to access than an IPOD and very small so I just drop it in my pocket and away I go. I use either Adobe Audition or a less expensive Gold Wave to edit my audio.

<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This was my first MP3 player purchase. I was confused at first (maybe because I'm new to the MP3 player scene?) but after playing around with the device for a bit, I got the hang of it. Like another reviewer, I replaced the Creative earphones with Sony MDR-EX71 earplug phones. The Creative ones were HUGE and very uncomfortable.

<Title>Dell Laptop users BEWARE
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I previously owned a MuVo Tx Fm 512MB and simply loved it. Since I wanted more space and was intrigued with the ability to record directly from my mini disc I purchased a Zen Nano Plus. After several hours of trying different things to make it work I am sending it back in exchange for a MuVo Tx Fm 1GB. After downloading songs with WMP 10 the Zen would play a few bars and completely shut off. If you want more description and details of what is happening, here is the link to the Creative Labs forum. [...] At least I am not the only one experiencing problems. And yes, I have tried all the so called fixes. But really, shouldn't this just work out of the box without trying to tweak it?  My MuVo does. So far, Amazon has been superb in helping me return the merchandise and getting the correct device that works with my setup. Thanks

<Title>Buyer beware
<Date>Thu Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It sounds like these are great--if they work. I ordered one, based on positive reviews here and research other places. The installs went smoothly and everything was hunky dory until I put in the battery and tried to turn it on. The LCD was dead and dark.  Checked battery placement, then put in a new battery. Still dead. Checked with Creative Support. They agreed the sucker was defective. I figured, hey, a fluke bit of bad luck. No big deal. Amazon was *great* about the return: it was easy, fast and they immediately shipped me a new one.  Which had exactly the same problem: once again, the LCD was dead, on another new model straight out of the box. Back to Creative Support (we were pals by this time) who conceded that, yep, the replacement was defective too.  I was willing to write off one dud as happenstance.  Two right in a row?  No way.  By all means, buy from Amazon, just don't buy Zen Nano Plus unless you're willing to risk the hassles with support calls to even turn the wretched thing on.  A serious--and suprising--dud.

<Title>Like a cheap toy!
<Date>Sat Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player after reading the positive reviews here. I have owned 8 mp3 players. This is the worst I have owned.  1. The looking: cheap cheap cheap toy. 1-10, if ipod nano is 9, zen nano is 5. 2. Control: Ipod is 10, zen nano is 5. I personally have ipod video.  3. Sound quality: never expect too much from this cheap player. Just ok sound quality. 4. FM Radio: This feature does make zen nano sounds like over ipod nano. But I have to say the FM radio sound quality is very poor, at least in my opinion. ( I'm a little bit high maintainance. ) 5. Voice recording: as the other features, just like a toy. 6. In-line decoding: I can't find any reason to use this feature. If you don't care about the sound quality, then you may like to use this feature.  Conclusion: After I used it for one day, I have no hesitate to return it. It does have many features, however, every feature would get a VERY LOW score!

<Title>Great Player
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Who needs a custom engraved mini mp3 player (shuffle).  This player costs less, has a digital display, allows songs to be easily copied on and off (hard drive interface), has a built in microphone recorder, and has a built in fm radio.  Also comes in black, an awesome color.  The AAA battery makes this great for trips where a usb port is not readily available.  Also makes a great groomsmen gift.  On the negative side, the unit only supports mp3 and wma, be prepared to convert some of your songs from AAC to play them.  I've seen rumors that the device eventually starts to skip, but I have not had any problems yet.

<Content>the player is great for its physical size and weight, capacity, and ease of use.  i miss the hold buttons of my old sony MD and CD players, however, cuz i've burned thru every single battery i've put into the player by mistakenly turning it on without realizing.  the button does have a delayed "on" built in, and it has to be pressed for a few seconds before it turns on, but those few seconds happen every once in a while in my pocket.  this is only annoying cuz the battery life is pretty good with this player and i feel like im wasting the batteries.

<Title>So far so good- and it comes with goodies they don't tell you about.
<Date>Sat Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I only got this 3 months ago so I can't speak to its longevity. I was looking for something simple that I could use on the treadmill and this has worked great. I also cannot speak to how many songs it can hold- I have less than 150 on there and I know the write up says it holds a lot more than that. The dial on the side takes some getting used to. But it sounds good, I found it easy to put the music in there (I'm not exactly a genius when it comes to these things) and it's small and easy to have around. Also, mine came with a belt clip and an armstrap- it didn't say that in the description. So no real complaints- I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a simple mp3 player.

<Title>good product for the price
<Date>Sun Nov 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ordered this after doing a little research.  I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player that would give me a couple of hours of music while riding my motorcycle.  The size lets if fit perfectly inside my jacket and the sound quality is excellent for such a small device. I find it difficult to negotiate the wheel and buttons due to their small size, and the ear buds that accompany the player don't seem to fit my ears for some reason.  Otherwise, not a bad item for the price.

<Title>Excellent tiny MP3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like that the unit uses a real battery size, rechargeables are nice in some devices, but in a MP3 player you really want a "normal" battery so you can put another one in anytime. Also, the player has very good sound quality and good volume.  I also like the easy loading of MP3 files using standard hard drive style of copying files through USB, instead of having to use some lame proprietary software that doesn't run on the next generation of operating system and you get stuck listening to the same thing for the rest of your life :) The only thing that would make it better is a 2GB or 4GB version, but 1GB is still VERY usable.

<Title>Very Pleased Purchaser
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use the player primarily to listen to audio books and the FM radio.  I find the quality excellent.  My only complaint is that the instructions are extremely lacking.  I am a novice user and need more information than is contained in the operation directions.  I don't know what many of the little signs are and how to use them and the directions are rather useless for someone who is not real experienced with MP3 players.  However, I like the player very much- it downloads fast, forward/reverses quickly.  I wish that it had a display showing the time remaining to the end of a book.

<Content>I purchased this for using while working out.  It does exactly what I needed.  I do not use the radio function.  The battery life is very long.  The only complaint I have is the earbuds sometimes fall out of my ears while running, but this has occurred with other earbuds, so I think it may be my ear shape.  I would recommend this player to anyone looking for a workout player or one for their kids, as the software is very user friendly as well.

<Title>First take on Zen Nano Plus 1 Gig MP3 player 
<Date>Sun Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I currently use mp3s mainly on my boom box at work that plays cds and mp3 cds. It is nice to throw on a  8 hour mp3 cd and have it play what I want to hear all day without commercials. I use real player to record my CDs into my computer and Nero to burn them as MP3 cds. The CDs I use are about 702 megs of memory and at 192 KPS this works out to a little over 8 hours of music. 128kps would be about 12 hours. The nano plus has about 300 megs more memory than the 702 megs on my CD so it should be about 11 to 12 hours of music at 192 kps and 16 or so at 128 kps.  I ordered the Nano from Amazon last weekend and got it in the mail yesterday (friday) and am just getting into it. It seems about half as complicated as I was expecting.  I had no trouble installing the software that came with the the Zen Nano, but this is not needed to load mp3s into the Nano. I put a DVD in my computer drive that is loaded with 50 hours of music in various album files and "dragged and dropped" or "copied and pasted" 10 folder albums from the DVD into the Nano. The Nano is recognized by my computer as a flash drive and works just as easy as a flash drive. To get the album folders to play in the order I wanted, I affexed 01, 02 etc to the folders, otherwise it plays these alphabetically.  After loading the music this morning, I went for my morning walk with the Nano. This was mainly why I bought it. It works great. The scroller takes some getting used to and is a little tricky to use, but I already figured out how to adjust the equalizer with the scroller. The nano comes with preset equalizer settings such as Rock or Classical. It also has a 5 band customizable equalizer and that is what I adjusted this morning.  I have read some reviews that state it is not loud enough and this has not been my impression. The volume meter goes from 1 to over 20 (I have not maxed the volume, at 20 I would soon ruin my hearing from the loud volume). I believe the problem may have been with the recording level when the mp3 file was converted, not with the Nano. I can hear the nano fine at it's very lowest setting of 1! I am currently listening to Bad Company's burning sky at 3 and can hear the bass and drums, guitars, etc loudly!. But I have noticed the volume changes with each CD that I burned to MP3 because of the recording level. Some sound fine at 1, others at 3 or 4. In all cases, level 6 and above is very loud and really rocks.  I have a Sony walkman CD player that plays MP3s and the ear buds that came with it are more or less comparable to what came with the nano. I have never popped for an expensive set of ear buds, so I do not know what I am missing, that being said, the ear buds that came with the nano seem to be fine. I will be ordering another set of ear buds just to satisfy my curiosity.  Some of the reviews on other commercially available ear buds describe them as "in the ear" and cancelling out other sounds. If you go for walks, are outdoors, etc. when using the nano, being able to hear other sounds besides the nano may be a good idea. I would like the hear the oncoming car before it runs me over.  I have an fm transmitter that I use with my sony cd walkman in my car and used the transmitter today with the nano and it worked about the same as the walkman as far as sound goes.  So far, I am very pleased with the Nano. It seems to be rugged and very well designed. I still have not tried all the features and may submitt a subsequent review.

<Date>Tue Mar 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Save yourself some headaches and DO NOT PURCHASE the Creative Zen Nano Plus.  It was trouble right out of the box.  I consider myself to be pretty tech savy (I work in IT).  And I've owned 4 other mp3 players. I also made the mistake of disregarding the other negative reviews of this product.  This device would randomly turn itself off and lock up. I tried everything available on the Creative support site.  Nothing fixed the problem.  Do yourself a favor and save another 50 bucks and buy yourself an iPod Nano.

<Title>Info on two common problems
<Date>Wed Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I think I have solutions to two of the common problems reported in the reviews about this device.  First, several people reported receiving devices that were dead-on-delivery.  I initially thought I had one of these, too.  The battery supplied didn't seem to work; a replacement battery had the same non-effect.  Then, I accidentally found how to turn the thing on.  The problem is that the diagram on p.1 one of the manual describes button #1 as Play/Pause.  It doesn't mention that it's also the power on button.  Most devices I use have a separate power on button.  Even while investigating it as a likely power on button, I simply pressed and released it.  You actually need to press and hold it down for a bit before the device turns on.  Second problem.  The device is described as USB 2.0.  It does not mention that it is *NOT* backwards compatible with USB 1.0 ports.  That's surprising because I have several other USB 2.0 devices that work just fine with my USB 1.0 port.  A bit slower, but they still work.  The Nano Plus just flat out does not work with a USB 1.0 port, whereas it works just fine with the USB 2.0 port on my newer computer at the office.  [Guess I'll just have to be downloading podcasts at work ;-]  I rated it a 3 because this web site insists on a rating, but I don't yet have enough experience with it to rate it.

<Title>3/31/06- Dead on arrival; 7/2/06-Happier EPILOGUE
<Date>Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Update - July 2, 2006  I received a replacement player from Amazon, which worked (and continues to work).  I am generally satisfiied with it, and would rate it 4 STARS were if it not for my bad experience with the first one.    The manufacturer's battery life claims are much too optimisitic, but this is true of nearly all battery operated products from all manufacturers.  Expect to run around 10 hours on a battery, not the 18 claimed by Creative.   Now that I have been using this item for several months, I am beginning to suspect that my original problem with the unit unexpectedly shutting down ( a problem many others have experienced) is software related.  Although the user can "drag and drop" files to the player  using the operating system, this method of transfer does not carry certain pieces of "digital rights management"  data (ie., copyright information) with it. If the player fails to see this information, it will shut down.  The software Creative bundles with the unit will transfer everything needed to run all files, but this is not made very clear by Creative.  I finally figured this out because I have been an active computer user for over 20 years and an attorney for over 30.  I don't know what Creative expects a "normal" user to do!  ORIGINAL REVIEW OF 3/3/06 I purchased this item on the strength of favorable reviews I read here in this space.  Unfortunately, the player arrived in unworkable condition. The player would play a few seconds and then shut down. I called Creative technical support, which was well aware of the issue. it directed me to a file in its knowledge base and a firmware upgrade that was supposed to solve the problem. I installed the upgrade, but it did not cure the problem.   I called Creative again. It offered to give me an RMA but stated that it would decide, after looking at the player, whether to repair or replace it. Because I purchased the player for a trip I am taking  in early April (with lots of anticipated downtime), this wasn't fast enough turnaround.  Amazon, bless its heart, is doing a more rapid exchange.

<Content>I had read that the Zen Nano Plus was comparable to the IPod Shufle, though I had not tried either product first.  The Nano is great!  I like being able to use it as a flash drive as well as music / audio book player.  I don't use the radio much but I'm glad it's an option.  Battery life is good, it retains it's position when it turns off and offers a lot of flexibility in navigation, though the screen and font size are a little small.  Still, it's indispensible to me now!

<Title>Short lived, then died.
<Date>Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player was sold under the name MuVo-N200 and then they changed the name to Zen Nano Plus. Probably to pick up on the Nano craze. It looks great. Small. and worked out of the package for a couple months. Then it died. Would not turn on any more. Contacted Creative and got the "download the latest driver, etc". This doesn't fix the problem. Sent it back(painfull). They send another. Works for 2 months. Dies. Couldn't bring myself to go through the gut renching customer service thing again. Then reconsidered and started the process. Got a third player. Worked for 2 months then died. This process has taken a couple years off my life. Their customer service repeatedly says, "this never happens, we have had no complaints from other customers". Then I read all these similar bad experiences. Who wants to buy a product from a company that is unreliable and will not admit its faults. Let me know if you find an mp3 manufacture with some better reliablity.

<Title>My heart is broken.
<Date>Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was very excited about this product when I first got it.  I read great reviews both here on this website and others.  It was very easy to install, I had no problems turning it on, as others have had.  I also didn't really have a problem putting the music on it.    The problem came when I tried to listen to the music after downloading.  It would play for a few seconds and then shut off.  I contacted Creative support, they sent me to a site to download new firmware (which was the same version I already had).  This didn't help.  The manual does not describe this problem, nor does the Creative website - that I could find.  I consider myself to be pretty computer literate.  Just show me the Help file on my problem and I'll figure it out.  This time, however, there were no answers.    After struggling with this problem without any change, I wrapped it up and returned it.  Many people on this website seem very happy with their Nanos, while others have had the same problem as I did.  It really does have alot of great features, but I wonder if one of the Creative factories that makes the Nanos is producing sub-quality.  I am very sad.

<Title>Great for Music, OK for Audiobooks
<Date>Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this MP3 player to replace my Rio Sport S35S. I was interested in using it to play music and also audiobooks downloaded from our library (using the "NetLibrary" service).  I had a couple of problems with this player that almost made me want to return it. (Files not playing in the right order, and unable to use "Safely Remove Hardware" from Windows XP). But those problems were resolved by the firmware update.  After that, it seemed like a good enough player to keep. Here's the pros and cons:  Pros: - Battery: it uses a standard AAA battery. - File transfer: unprotected files can be transferred via drag&drop in Windows. Protected files should be transferred with the included software. - File management: files can be organized into folders and subfolders (files are played alphabetically by file name). - Buttons: the buttons are fairly easy to use without looking. - Resume: when turned off and then on again, the player resumes where it was left off. (good for audiobooks) - Fast forward: when fast forwarding, it goes faster and faster the longer the button is held down. (good for audiobooks) - Belt clip: the player comes with a holder that has a belt clip on the back. It's pretty nice and I use this most of the time. The holder is formed in a way that allows access to all the controls (including the USB port). The only reason one would have to remove the player from the holder is to change the battery.  Cons: - Resume: while the player remembers where it was if the unit is turned off and then on again, it does not remember where it was if one skips to another track and then back again. This is really bad for listening to long audiobooks. (For example, if you are 3 hours into an audiobook, and then skip to another track to listen to a song, and then back to the audiobook... you'd have to fast forward through 3 hours to get back to where you were.) This should really be fixed. The default operation should be if one presses the "pause" button, then skips to another track and back again, it should resume where it left off. - No playlist capability on the player. - Rewind: the rewind function stops when the beginning of a song is reached, it does not continue into the end of the previous song. (bad for audiobooks) - Song Time Display: apparently cannot display the time remaining in a track. (bad for audiobooks... I already have a feeling for how long I've been listening... I usually need to know how much time is left before the track is done.). - Slight gap between tracks: I noticed this when listening to something that was supposed to be continuous from one track to the next. Instead of being continuous, there was a fraction of a second of silence between the two tracks.  Notice that most of the "cons" listed above could conceivably be fixed with a firmware update. So this shows that the hardware is very good. Just some fairly easy improvements in the firmware would make this an even better player.  Overall, it's a great player for music and an OK player for audiobooks. It could be a great player for audiobooks, if they made some simple improvements.

<Title>waste money, not worth it 
<Date>Thu Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this recorder for school and my music rehearsal.  I am very disappointed with this product.  (1) First of all, the TINY TINY clip of  the battery cover broke after one month I bought, so now I have to use tape to hold the battery cover.  (2) you basically have to put the device up to the person's mouth to be able to record the voice clearly.  I sit 4 or 5 feet away from my professor in the class room and it came out sooooo low, and unclear. So I gave up recording for the lecture (3) I also use this to record my music rehearsal.  Music recording came out like a broken speaker playing harsh music  For the price (70 to 80 dollars street price) I will add 20 more to buy something else more reliable and better.   It is just so not worthy the money to buy a poorly made 1 GB mp3 player. so what..

<Title>If you Don't want to shell out the money for an iPod, you can't go wrong here!
<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Nano Plus is a great little DAP.  It'll play just about any MP3 you throw at it, has a built in FM receiver, allows easy drag and drop from your own ripped material AND includes software to synch up with your licenses material, takes it easy on batteries and thus your wallet, and is pretty small.  Because it's a flash player, it also works as a "large" thumb drive for transporting documents, etc.  I use mine to take my audio books on the go as well as all my pod casts, digital music, etc.  The only down sides are as follows:  1.  The voice recorder is hit or miss.  Sometimes the recordings are great for when you're taking notes, recording a seminar or meeting, or reminding yourself to do something.  Other times the recordings are pretty much useless.  2.  The included headphones are place holders.  Get new ones as soon as you can.  I recommend SkullCandy "Smokin' buds."  3.  The storage capacity.  It's a flash memory player.  1 Gig will hold several full Audio books and lots of music, but it's not 20,000 songs and the player isn't expandable like some flash players are now.  Overall it's a great little DAP with a small form factor, great battery life, standard storage for a Flash player, and a few little nags.

<Title>Love it...
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my Creative Zen Nano Plus since December of 2005, and I still love it. I got new earphones for it ages ago because the ones it came with were to big for my ear but other than that, it's dandy. Oh, and it is also scratched, but you can't tell unless it is in sunlight or very bright lighting, so that isn't a very big problem. I have dropped it MANY times and yet it is still up to full speed. I am very impressed with this mp3 player.

<Title>Reliable, easy to use and many features
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Nano Plus with 1 gig memory has proven to be an excellent MP3 Player.  I did what most people suggested and turned off the backlight and replaced the bud earphones.  Without the light the single AAA battery lasts an amazingly long time--at least 20 hours.  The Creative software is simply and makes it easy to load and manage the files from your computer.  I found the simple controls on the Zen fairly easy to learn and use.  The unit's small size, that fact that is has both a microphone and radio receiver makes it an excellent all-purpose portable electronic device.  I did a lot of research comparing MP3 players before buying the Zen and so far it has met or exceeded the high ratings it has received.

About 5-6 hours. - FM. - seen as a mass storage device in windows and can be mounted in Linux. So drag and drop without software. - voice recorder (saved as .wav)  Cons: ---- - Can eat through a GB really quick - Wish that it came with a built-in rechargeable battery that could be charged using the usb data cable.

<Title>Perfect for the first timer
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Zen Nano is a great bargain for the price.  Battery life and ease of use will please any first time buyer.  However, the radio receiver leaves alot to be desired.  I was lucky to get two clear stations, and because it doesn't allow you to switch from stereo to mono, you have to listen to it go back and forth as the signal fades.  Also, the sound quality wasn't as good as others I've had.  Still a good player for the price, and you can't beat the compact size.

<Title>Firmware defect! 25 scale volume system is AWFUL!!
<Date>Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its confirmed that every player with the 1.11.01 firmware is DEFECTIVE an MOST nano plus players use this defective firmware.  The problem is that even at the lowest volume setting of 1 it plays WAY too loud! Going from 0 to 1 is like turning the player on and off. Its ridiculous! The volume just does NOT go any lower and due to this it makes the player USELESS in quiet areas.  How could they have released the player like this? Its unreal.  When the first nano plus players came out they used the great 40 scale volume system which worked GREAT. Now with this firmware and the 25 scale volume system its AWFUL.  Oh ya the "FM recording" records at a very low bit rate and in WAV format. This produces awful record quality and makes this feature 100% usless. No joke.

<Title>Zen Nano Plus Plastic Junk
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player is a nightmare to setup. The software included is less than user friendly and to date mine has still not set up after a complete removal and re-boot and re-install. It is not recognized by my system and will only go as far as New Hardware Device Detected. Opening up My Computer it does not show up as a removable storage device (as Creative says it will) and I've had it with this piece of [...] The included booklet tells you next to nothing and the website is even less informative. Save yourself some money and a lot of headaches and buy ANYTHING ELSE. I thought I could save myself some money by buying something other than an Apple Ipod but now I'm having serious second thoughts. If you plan on having a good small portable MP3 player don't waste a dollar on this one because it simply doesn't work. Read through on the web to see just a few of the headaches by simply going to Google and typing in Trouble Installing Zen Nano Plus. You'll see that even there firmware upgrade doesn't work either. Whatever you do pass over this item as it is majorly faulty and even the manufacturer doesn't know what the problem is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Nice little gadget, with a few quirks.
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this mp3 player because it had all the features I was looking for (including an FM tuner) and could be had for a little more than half the price of an iPod Nano. It works well, looks cool, and I am pretty satisfied with just a few exceptions. The first being the occasional shut down errors that result from playing certain files. I've only encountered about 7 out of the 300 songs I've loaded onto the player but it's still an annoyance. The other is the volume levels which really need a lower setting for listening in quiet spots. Overall I really like this item and would recommend it to others looking for a lower priced player.

<Title>Put songs in the order you like.
<Date>Thu May 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>One of the big reasons not mentioned to purchase this product is the software allows you to put the songs in the order you like. It is not sophistocated but it works. My two Rio products do not allow this. Who wants to hear music in alphabetical order? Well, not me. I want to order them the way I like. My only complaint is my Nano seems to hold only about 110 songs (regardless of length) and uses half of the 1 gb memory. I can splice any number of songs together to make one long song so as not to violate this 110 limit as long as the memory is available. Maybe I do not know how to set it up. Anyway, 110 songs is more than I'll ever need at the gym.

<Content>I've had Rios, Ipods, MPIOs, Cowons, you name it, but I like my Zen Nano plus the best! And hey, didn't Creative use the Nano name for an mp3 player first? Hmmm.  I've had mine two years (it's really a Muvo N200) and never had a problem.  That's WAY more than I can say for all my other mp3 players.  The only problem is the battery door broke.  It sounds good, has great interface, easy downloading, reads audible books, is super light and durable, and comes with a nice silicone case!  I just bought another one with twice the space for half what my 512mb cost me! What a deal!

<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the Nano Plus because of the size and FM tuner, as well as its simple operation.  I also liked the color selection.  However, it does not come with a neck strap, which I find very useful for running/exercising.  I don't like to put it in my short's key pocket (but it does fit) and I find that the arm band causes the headphones cord to get in the way.  I found that the strap for Canon Elph Cameras works great.  Look for it under "Canon Metal Neck Strap 1 for All Elph Cameras", it is inexpensive.

<Title>Super Sound in a Small Package
<Date>Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned my NanoPlus 1GB for about 3 weeks.   I have enjoyed the player with a few glitches along the way, making this a 4 star instead of a 5 star product.  The box comes with the player, a silicone carrying jacket with belt clip, an arm band and earbuds.  Also included is a (very)short USB 2.0 cable, software, and a brief user's guide.  The earbuds have very nice sound quality, but were a bit big for my ears, so I used a smaller pair of Sony's.   That allows me to play a bit lower volume due to the Sony's better efficency (or maybe smaller drivers?).   Either way, the battery last a bit longer with the Sony earbuds.      Size.  It's VERY small and light.  It uses a AAA battery and that will last about 18 hours, plus or minus depending on how loud you play your music.  I use a recharagable 850mAh NiMh AAA, it lasts about 12 hours or more.  The tab that holds on the battery cover is a bit weak -- there are some reports on the Web that say the tab can break-off easily.  It appears that you can get a replacement from Creative for free or almost free.     The function of the player is simple.  There are 3 buttons and a jog switch.  Play/Pause/Off/On is on one button.  The other 2 buttons are for volume up or down (+ or -).  The jog switch does everything else (move you through menus, etc.)   It is springloaded and moves right or left and also pushes in to select a function.   It took about 10 seconds to figure out the menus.     The NanoPlus comes with a nice FM Tuner.  It can auto scan and save the stations.  This seems to work fine.  Reception has been good, with a bit of static now and again.      The EQ is effective and allows for a custom setting beyond the preset stuff.    What I found dissapointing and a bit of a problem that took an email to Creative to fix was the file system in the NanoPlus.   My 1GB player initially wouldn't allow me to load over 525mb into the player for some reason.  That reason turned out to be the file directory structure.   The system has a limitation to the total length of the folder directory.  So if you put all your music (With long ID Tags) into the player's top folder, you end up filling the directory with Track title info, and the player will error out and not load to fill the avilable memory.  It seems Creative assumes we are all going to transfer albums onto our players, so there would be subdirectories with artist or album titles.     Also annoying is that the directory uses the track number (if available) to order the music.  This is great when tracks are  broken into albums, they will play in order.   But individual songs will be ordered based on their track number, not how you load it or otherwise. This is bad when you want a general mix of music and don't want all track number 1's being played first.   There is a suffle option which will re-arrange the music, but it's random.  The software that comes with the player is not that great.  It works and will let you establish file folders on the player easily, which will help with the above problems.   The NanoPlus is compatible with MusicMatch Jukebox, so that's another option to avoid the lame Creative jukebox in general. The Creative software didn't recognize many of my mp3's ID Tags, and just assigned them unknown for each category.  Anything with full tags seems to work fine, but many that work in MusicMatch don't in the Creative Software.     The firmware is flashable, and I have aready updated my player to the latest firmware.  It took about 5 minutes to download, and flash the NanoPlus's ROM.   This is a nice feature, allowing any addressed bugs to be fixed without much hassle.     Overall, I love the player.   It's better than the Apple Shuffle, and [...] less!  I do wish the PC software was better.  USB 2.0 is super fast and transfers take very little time (I spend more time looking for what I want to transfer than waiting for them to move).  Well worth the money.

<Title>Faulty
<Date>Fri Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ye, it's true it has a lot of nice features, but here go the cons:  - It's flimsy - depends on silicone skin to feel rugged  - It was designed with left-handed people in mind: We right-handed have to change the LCD orientation and then hold the player in an awkward position. If you're left handed then it will feel quite natural.  - No mp3 recording for mic or radio... Only WAV at 16KHz for radio (CD is 44KHz), which leaves all high frequencies (the "tweeters") out of the recording, and an even lower quality for mic recording. In fact, mic recording is so tinny that it's not usable.  - Volume level 1 is still too loud with some albums (such as Puffy's) when using noise-supression earbuds (For example, the ones made by Koss).  - No quick way to lock it: You have to open the menu and look for the option.  - It died after just three days of purchase: The battery was very low, and I hit the "pause button". Instead of pausing, it turned off. After that, I tried every single AAA battery I had, with the same result: It turns on, shows the Creative and the Zen Nano Plus logos, and then turns off. I'm glad that I bought it from a local store. They're giving me a replacement unit later this day.

<Content>The headaches in trying to install the software were simply not worth it. I ended up at Creative's website and found that it was not just me - apparently compatibility was a common problem. After wasting several hours trying different drivers and other suggested fixes, I gave up and sent the Zen back. I replaced it with an IRiver that was much simpler for a casual user. The IRiver certainly has its limitations as it seems to be entirely dependent on Windows, but it works great.

<Content>The Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus 1 Gb had the best reviews of all. So many features in such a little package! This is exactly what I was looking for  Positive features: Small, compact, backlighted display, convenient controls, smart software interface was a snap loading the MP3 player using Win95SE, offers smart compression to choose best formats when saving to player. Sound quality is fantastic. No mixing necessary. Great FM. I ran the 'auto-scan' feature for FM stations, it found every one in my area. Comes with armband which web package contents did not list. Nice surprise that saved $20. Negative features: Manual has only 10 pages and leaves you without a paddle. If you can find the CD manual it is better or you can download manual from web. Left-right rocker switch also selects when pressed and you often do the wrong thing. Ear buds troublesome to keep in ears and you need to buy better ones at first opportunity.. I couldn't be happier with mine.

<Content>Despite Amazon's description, the package contents listing, and Creative's own website description, there is no neck strap in the package of the Zen Nano Plus.  Creative support states that "A neck strap is not provided with this product".  You can, however, purchase one from them for $10.  This is a pretty shady move on Creative's part, and I am a little wary of purchasing another product from them because of this.  If you do not need a neck strap, this will not be an issue for you, but if you want one, or just want the package to contain what it says it contains, you should look elsewhere.

<Title>The Perfect Gym/Workout MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have owned a Zen Nano Plus now for probably a year and a half.  I have a 4th generation ipod but there was no way that I was going to lug around a hard drive player to the gym.  So I did some research and picked up the Zen Nano Plus, and I must say that I love it.  I love the accessories that came with it (the line in cable, the rubber case, the armband) and the fact that it uses a single AAA battery.  When I am at the gym I simply clip the rubber case to my side (there is a belt clip in the case) and I begin my workout.  Because the player is so light I can't feel it on me.  The one con I have are the headphones that came with it.  But you can always pick up a better set elsewhere.  Right now I am enamored with the Creative Zen V Plus as my new gym music player, but the more I think about it the more I realize that the Nano Plus has everything that I would ever need for the gym.

<Title>Great little machine.
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did a lot of research and price-comparing before finally deciding on this little baby. I paid about $100 for my 1 GB Zen Nano Plus and it was well worth the money. It's tiny and easy to use, and the USB connectivity is great - I can just open it up in My Computer and do as I would with any other flash drive, AND I can use it to transfer large video or data files from one computer to another as well. I like using the music organizer program that came with it - much smoother than Windows Media Player.  I'm very pleased with being able to switch the LCD for right- and left-handedness. I don't use it quite the way it's intended - I usually do the flipping if I'm wearing it on my wrist while biking - but it's wonderful to see a company take left-handed consumers into account.  The volume control is wonderful. Even in a room with people talking I can hear the music very well with the volume on the very lowest setting.  The FM tuner is also a highlight, and was the main feature that made me go with the Zen Nano Plus instead of the standard Zen Nano, which was then twenty dollars cheaper. There are only a few FM stations I listen to, and usually just when driving, so it's nice to have an easy way to tune them in while inside or while walking. The reception is excellent!  With the backlight turned off, a single alkaline battery lasts at least 18 hours, and even with the backlight on constantly (you can change its duration), you'll get a good 14 hours out of that battery.  There's no true playlist support, but I knew that when I purchased it, and I've dealt with it. I've always been a fan of mixtapes and mix CDs, so I either rip a mix CD into its own folder, or collect tracks from my hard drive and copy them to a single folder on the player. The Media Explorer program that comes with it has a function where you pick the order you want a particular folder to play in, and it renames them by appending numbers to the start of the filenames. And the renaming can be automatically undone within the program at any time. So that's LIKE playlist support.  It's true that the earphones aren't the best, but I saw the same complaint in almost every review of every MP3 player I considered buying, so don't bypass the Zen Nano Plus just for that.  I sometimes have a problem with the player shutting down when I try to scroll within a track. I'm not sure why. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, the machine powers down with the same effect as though the battery had gone out - resuming at the point where you last turned it on, instead of the way it normally resumes (where you, or it, last turned it off).  My only regrets are that I didn't wait till the price dropped a little more, and maybe that I should've picked a different color.

<Content>I bought this as a gift to my husband for Father's day. I spent over an hour setting up the software and loading music onto it. Within an hour of use it just stopped working on almost every song. It would play for 3-15 seconds and then just shut down. After calling customer service and waiting on hold for 20 minutes, they told me it was a firmware issue and I needed to go to their site and follow the directions on fixing it. No, I don't think so... I immediately returned the product to Walmart and bought the Philips Gogear from Costco for $80...with Costco's lifetime warranty I figured I couldn't go wrong. It was easy to set up and load music onto and my husband has been enjoying it ever since. BEWARE OF CREATIVE!

<Title>Good player with fatal flaw
<Date>Fri Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Many people who've bought this player have had problems with it shutting off randomly. In some cases it doesn't happen until you put in a new battery. It's clearly a software problem, though, but the latest firmware upgrade doesn't fix it. Creative doesn't seem to want to acknowledge the problem, either.  Bad move, Creative.

<Title>I couldn't imagine a better mp3 player... ideal for musicians/engineers

<Content>Here's the deal guys & gals: I can't find anything wrong with this thing:  the thing is cheap, light, comes with all the accessories you need, requires no external software for Windows or MAC and has higher sound quality than most Apple players like I-pod.    Any problems I read in other people's reviews were uninformed and incorrect.  I purchased this player from Amazon.com for only like $60 with free shipping, about a month ago, and I use it with $9 Sony headphones with ear-clips that I bought at Best Buy, because I prefer those to normal ear buds, like the ones it comes with.  CONS: The only downside is that if you want to carry around more than 1GB of music and/or files at one time, you should get a bigger creative labs player.  This is no problem for me because I am a professional songwriter and singer, and I'm always changing out the music I listen to.  I can find no other downside... I guess another potential downside is that if you want to use Apple's .aac/mp4 format you have to first burn them on to audio CD's and convert them to .mp3 or .wma files.  (Note: this problem exists with EVERY legal mp3 player on the market)   PROS: POWER--You don't have to charge it...Uses a AAA battery and lasts about a month with heavy, daily use.  When you are hooked up to a computer the USB powers to save your battery.  Plus, it has plenty of options like backlight, power-save, and contrast settings to further the life of the battery  EASE OF USE/SHARING FILES: Look, all you do is hook it up with the provided USB2 cable and you import/export files like an external drive or folder.  You can share music with your friends, or even use it as a flash drive for school or work.  It creates menus (or you might call them 'playlists') according to the folders that you create on the thing.  I always name mine '[artist] - [album (year)]'.  BUILT IN ENCODING UP TO 160 KPS:  and this works extremely well (contrary to ignorant reviews I've read) if you set the levels correctly out of your source.  I have been using it to rip mp3's of VINYL right out of the headphone jack of my home stereo tuner and they sound @#$% GREAT!  It even comes with the line in cable you need to do this.  FM RADIO, VOICE RECORDING, ETC:  all these other features work great.  The radio gets great reception and you can even rip mp3's off the radio (although you should realize that these will be significantly lower quality than if you rip from the line in jack).  SOUND QUALITY: Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but this thing operates at 20Hz to 20kHz which is the approximate maximum hearing threshold of the human ears... I-pod and other players are actually lower quality than this, I believe.  It also runs at 44.1k which means you get no sound degradation if you rip mp3s at 256k from a CD.  Need I say more... buy some of these before the price goes up or they take them off the market.  jb

<Title>Great MP3 Player

<Content>Real good MP3 player. It was smaller than I imagined. Also, there is no need for format conversion. It supports WMA in addition to MP3. The display looks good. Lastly, it isnt overpriced like IPODs are.

<Content>Awesome mp3 play, radio, and voice recorder.......easy to use and feature packed. Go anywhere size and included accessories are very nice, price is excellent compared to other brands. Only negative is battery life is reduced at higher volume to around 14 hours and not 18 as listed by Creative. This is no big deal, just purchase rechargable AAA NiMH at 900MaH and rock on upto 20+ hours.
