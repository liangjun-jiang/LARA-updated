<Title>Great, but wait.
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod mini is the perfect portable music player for anybody without an enormous music library.  My 1300 song library fits on the iPod mini's 4GB storage.  It is truly small, slightly bigger than my (small) cell phone. This is great, but don't buy it yet.  Announced Feb. 23, the iPod mini will be released with new colors, a full color screen and 5 or 6 GB's of storage.  ALL FOR THE SAME PRICE!!  I am a PC guy, but Apple has perfectly designed the iPod mini.  So wait a few weeks, then buy a new iPod mini.

<Title>Recommended, but With a Few Caveats.
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Apple launched its aggressive marketing campaign for the iPod, I reacted with a degree of resistance. Why bother getting an iPod? I own hundreds of CDs, and the disc player I already have is fine as it is. But once I got my hands on the mini, it instantly changed the way I listen to music. The iPod mini is a nice way to listen to/store your favorite tunes, and it deserves both praise and criticism.   THE PROS?   It's easy to install. All you have to do is recharge your iPod mini, connect it to your computer, transfer your music library on your hard drive to iTunes (which you will need to install either from the website or the enclosed CD), and you're ready to play your iPod. It's that simple. If a dolt like me can operate this thing, so can you.   Store up to 1,000 tunes. But that figure assumes that the average song you load is 4 minutes long. Because I like to listen to a lot of extended dance remixes that are 6 minutes or longer, I really have only 700 tunes max on my iPod. Still, that's a lot of music to carry.   Easy to carry and you'll look cool. The iPod mini is my new buddy at the gym, where almost everybody has one. With the right accessories (sold separately), you can clip it to your pants, wear it with an arm wrist, or carry it in the palm of your hand while running.   THE CONS?   Flimsy headphones. The iPod mini has decent sound quality, but you wouldn't know it by using the headphones, which deliver a thin and hollow sound. Not only that, but one of the speakers has already blown out after only a week's worth of use. Apple should be ashamed of themselves for manufacturing such weak headphones.   8 hour battery life? I don't think so! Battery life is such a controversial issue with the iPod, because so many people have claimed that it's much less than 8 hours. If you don't use the click wheel and keep the volume at a low level, then I'm sure you may get 8 hours if you're lucky. But I like to turn up the bass on mine, use the equalizer, and set the volume relatively high - all of which gave me a battery life of only 3 hours. So, the more features you use on your iPod mini, the less likely you'll get anything close to 8 hours. (Note: the new iPod minis now have a battery life of up to 18 hours, which is more than double that of the one I currently have)  THE BOTTOM LINE:   All in all, I like and recommend the iPod mini to anyone with a fairly large CD collection and an up-to-date computer. But it comes with its flaws so consumers should be advised before jumping in. And depending on how often you listen to music, you way want to skip this and get the 20GB, the new 30GB iPod photo or even the 40GB for just a few dollars more. Overall, it gets my green light.

<Title>Just got my 6 GB mini ... Awesome !
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wow!  Got the e-mail from Apple (Since I own the a 10 GB 1st Gen. and a 40 GB 4th) on Tuesday about the release of the new players, ordered it, and had it today, Thursday! 2 days!    Anyway, I ordered the green and I have to say it's a much richer green than the previous 4 gb.  Looks awesome and, as usual with the other ipods I have, the setup and installation was a breeze.  Sound quality excellent!  Ease of use excellent! Just excellent period!  I own, and have tried players from other manufactuers like iRiver, RCA, and most recently, Creative.  All of them have their own set of problems and nothing comes close to the ipod.  The iRiver I own has inferior sound quality, the RCA Lyra locks up frequently, and I don't even want to get started on the Zen Micro.  It froze up so many times I returned it to Amazon within 2 days.  I thought it would be an ipod competitor since it came with an FM radio and a removeable battery.  But, oh man, what a piece of junk!  I'm just hoping Apple will one day put an FM tuner in their ipods. I think if they do, everyone else can just close shop.  I could care less about a removeable battery because there are always new players coming out so frequently, I usually purchase the latest one.  The only small beef I have, which almost made me give it 4 stars, is that they took away something that used to shipped with the previous ipods.  A "wall outlet" charging cord.  The only accessories that ship with this new mini are: a USB cord that goes from the player to a USB port, headphones, a carrying case/clip, and the documentation/CD.  That's it.  No charging dock or wall plug.  The only way you can charge this player, with what ships, is to connect it to a USB port on your computer. On the Apple website, the wall "power adapter" is $29.00.  Personally, I think they should just scrap the crappy headphones that most mp3 players ship with, and include the power adapter.  This new 6 gb is just another fine example why Apple has over 90% of the portable player market.  I just can't wait to see what they come up with next!

<Title>Apple Deserve a GOLD for their Mini-Silver iPod! A Great Buy
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't know a great deal about everything, however I've been a huge fan of every iPod model since my very first purchase. I kept notes from that first purchase and every upgrade purchase I've made since then. After finally getting my Apple 4GB iPod Mini Silver M9160LL/A, I decided I would take the time to pass on my thoughts in the form of a review on Amazon.com.  I didn't ever think I would become a member of this sort of "technology cult", however Apple has just blown my mind away with their ability to consistently improve quality and impress me with style and functionality. Apple really pushed the envelope with their design and choice of color schemes.  Perfect? Not perfect, but pretty close considering I've only had a few problems with it-all of which can be taken care of with a sort of "Re-Boot"-all you need to remember is to hold down the SELECT and MENU buttons for just under 10 seconds. It seems to take care of any small issues I've had. I'll bet that most people don't put their machines through the sort of consumer testing that I do. But if you ever DO run into any problems, you can "Re-Boot" or go to the Apple website and locate your particular situation and they've convered all basis with great responses. If for any reason at all you can't locate your problem ,or if a "fix" doesn't work, simply email Apple and you'll likely have an educated response within just a few hours or less.  You will be extremely impressed with the quality of sound you'll hear on your iPod Mini. You will also notice an increase in volume as well. A salesman told me that I could expect a difference in sound but Apple wasn't really advertising each facet of this great device. He also informed me that this model will not likely have problems jumping around or skipping-improvements were definitely made and I can't imagine what any future models will have to offer!  Remember to enjoy your iPod and to not worry about anything going wrong. It's likely that you'll never run into a problem. Be certain to follow the instructions and charge for 4 hours. The rest is all about enjoying great music and being able to depend on awesome sound quality and volume improvements.  I hope this review helped and I'll be sure to keep in touch with any future developments along the iPod line. It's hard to believe all of this coming from a PURE-PC Person. That was before I discovered Apple and especially the iPods!! The truth is that I've been converted! Thanks APPLE!  Enjoy!   Pete Cannice from Scottsdale, Arizona Email: Horsepete@aol.com

<Title>Good Things Come in Small Packages
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had long wished for my own Mp3 player, and my wish was granted last summer. As soon as I saw the iPod mini, I knew that that was the one I wanted. I got my iPod and spent many hours listening to my tunes and buying songs off the iTunes Music Store. However, my happy and perfect time with my iPod mini did not last long when I was pummelled by one of my friends while I had my iPod in my pocket in a tarmac parking lot. My precious iPod was flung to the ground and got stepped on by accident and now has about ten scratches on it (thankfully on the back). I had read in a review of the iPod mini that it was scratch-proof "even if it was placed face-down on a rough surface;" I have now cleanly disproven this statement.  Besides that, the iPod is the ultimate pocket companion for the road. I took my iPod with me on vacation and helped me get through the long hours on the plane. The "Music" section sorts songs by artist, album, genre, composer, and audiobook. My favorite part of the iPod mini is the On-the-Go playlist feature, that allows you to create your own playlist, well, on the go, so you can play your favorite songs continuously without looking for them, and then clearing it again the next minute. The Click Wheel is totally functional and a lot better than the touch wheel and buttons on the old models of the iPods.  Overall, the iPod mini is fun, innovative, and the ultimate Mp3 player!

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've listened to several different mp3 players, including the Dell Jukebox. The Jukebox sound cannot compete with the iPod minis. The colors are fun, and you can customize your equalizer settings to get the sound you want. It holds a lot more songs that it seems and has games to play while waiting in Restaurants. (seriously)
