<Title>Excellent Alternative to the Nano
<Date>Thu Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really didn't want to get a Nano so I looked for alternatives.  I was about to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LYUZIW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-7836268-2233234">Creative Zen V Plus</a> but then I got this as a gift.  I didn't even know this player existed since it really isn't marketed well by Samsung.  Overall I am very happy with it.  The battery life is amazing and the controls are easy to use once you get used to them.  I had no problems transferring songs using Windows Media player.  I think the one drawback I can think of is that there isn't much accessories for it.  I was able to find a case eventually.

<Title>that is a good player ! 
<Date>Sun Jun 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the Samsung Y5 is a pretty good product for those who just want to  listen to music. The photo display is just a gadget. The player is MTP, it is usefull when  you  are using linux like me. the playlist are easy to create with amarok or winamp.  very good player for its autonomy and its sound quality, the navigation  is also  pretty good. More expensive than  a sensa or an Ipod but better too.  with my shure E2C or my Sen HD215 it is nice ;)

<Title>Great, tiny mp3 player.
<Date>Fri Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned only one MP3 player before: an iRiver H10 20GB.  It was huge compared to this tiny player.  I was truly surprised at the physical size of this Samsung YP-Z5.  It's so tiny.  Mine is a refurb.  I can't stand using Windows Media Player to transfer music to any MP3 player, so I tried to get the player to work in USB mode (also known as UMS mode) as a regular storage device.  No luck.  My player shipped with version 1.08 of the firmware.  I visited Samsung's site and downloaded the 2.47 version of the firmware and installed it.  Installation was clunky and I wasn't sure if anything was happening once I chose "upgrade" on the YP-Z5.  The upgrade took quite a while (5 minutes at least) and it never turned itself back on after it completed the firmware upgrade.  So I turned it on myself, it appeared to lock up at the bootup Samsung logo screen, but after a while it finally loaded.  It no longer loads slowly...must have been a one-time thing after the firmware update.  The firmware update allows you to use the YP-Z5 in UMS mode now.  You just need to go to Settings--->System Info--->Toggle "UMS only" to "On."  Now it will connect as a storage device on your computer...store whatever you want to on it!  So far so good.  I just wish it had a microphone to record voice memos and the like.  All that aside, it's a great little player.  Cheap, small, easy to use.  I recommend.

<Title>Almost iPod challenger and killer
<Date>Wed Aug 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I needed a replacement after going through 2 third gen ipod 20gb and a fourth gen (non color) 20gb it was time for a new mp3 player. I never liked iPods, all the iPods i got were given to me (some broken and had to have parts replaced) and they weren't really durable and had short battery life (even with battery upgrade). I did a lot of researching, looking at Samsung models and Scandisk models and Creative models. Price range was under $200 dollars. Now I remembered this mp3 player when it first came out and the features on it were good to me. And i looked at other samsung mp3 players and this one had the best set of features that i wanted (i could've wanted a recorder and fm receiver but oh well) and it looked decent.  So I get this in the mail (don't order on friday... it takes forever, i missed my chance to get the 90 day warranty, you have to register in 10 days, well i didn't have internet when it came so i couldn't register and didn't know it was 10 days until the next day)  Windows Media Player locked up the first and second time I tried to sync with it. Later realizing I had all these playlists, I cleared them and copied what I wanted. (it automatically syncs all playlist, i think this is a bit inconvient and i had to delete all of my playlist for that reason)  that was my first only issue. I updated the firmware and that really gave the samsung the features i didn't know i wanted. For example, the new firmware you can create your on EQ on the mp3 player, which is convienient and a hassle, like ipod you can create playlist on the go but you can't highlight albums or artist, but single songs at a time. the playlist don't save (at least i haven't figured out how yet).  a cool feature on it is when you click on a song and it has different artists in that album and you go back to the main menu (say to change EQ or something) well when you go back through you can either go through artists and it'll be highlighted or you can go back to the album. ipods it's the same place. it's convieent when you have the same artist and you want to listen to more of it rather then continue in that perticular album.mixtape.  battery life is good, it's only died on me once and i didn't charge it  for 3 days and over used it on a hike so it was understandable it died. i did need to look at the time (didn't have any other means to see time) but all it would say is low battery (no split second main menu) so that kind of sucks.  overall features, compared to a nano, it's good, it's missing stuff like games and calender and what not, i don't think there is an alarm. but it has custom eq and unique go back to song, and has really really good battery life. the headphones that came with it are so much better then ipod nano headphones though i'm buying a pair of dj headphones to hear all the bass.   windows media player sucks, it's very glitchy and really restrictive. i haven't figured out how to delete songs and i mistakenly put two copies of the same album. the file formats is okie, though you have no options on uncompressed files. on top of that for some reason it needs to convert mp3 songs again. i don't know why. m4a doesn't work of course, nor does it convert.   windows media player is probably the bottleneck of this product.  oh you can also run it in UMA (i think that's what it's called) which means u can use it as a flash drive and it shows up as a drive, rather then mp3 player. i haven't copied songs this way, but if i can i'm going to try my mac os on it.  oh it's windows only but if it works on coping songs this way and being able to put it in it's library, we have something that competes ipods.  that's what mp3 player compaines should do. something that works on both mac os and windows.  Product features 4/5 Battery life 10/5 more then 35 hrs on mine looks 4/5 sound quality 4.5/5 transfer music 2/5

<Title>Junk product
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these to take back to the UK after my holiday in the USA, arrived back in the UK - powered the machine up - dead as a dodo. Complained to Samsung UK, they were not interested as I had lost the international warranty card. They offered to repair it at my expense or I could send it back to Amazon, this latter option was not viable as I would have had to pay customs duty when the repaired or replacement item arrived in the UK so in effect I have a lightweight door-stop suitable for a doll's house or a door wedge. I will never buy another Samsung product as the quality control and factory checking on my sample was apparently non-existent.

<Title>Oh, I love this baby
<Date>Tue Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>... especially when it's on special offer for 150$. OK, it's not the newest generation, and it's only 4Gb. But firmware is pretty updated (and easy to get into the critter). With newest firmware, it has almost every feature you'd want, and the interface is smooth. Touch buttons may not be a click-wheel, but they work well enough - never bother me. Sound quality is good, and yes it has a custom EQ and on-the-go playist (if you install the newest firmware). As one of the few players, this one has dedicated volume buttons - nice if you suddenly just need the level up or down. Battery lasts well (again w. the new firmware) and charges quick. And then this player is a real gem - nice metal feel to it, and it's really well finished. I even like the fact that you can SEE the screws it's assembled with (if you ever want to take it apart - no funny clips and gluing as w certain others. Overall: Great player that does all the essential extremely well. Buy it.

<Title>Good product, got many minor issues
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player works very well with good sound quality and an attractive finish,  but that nice finish scratches very easily. VERY durable, I have dropped it multiple times into hard floors from waist height and it still works just fine. The touch pad does take some getting used to, but once you are its a definite iPod killer(though anything that doesn't require iTunes is really). There are dozens of hidden features that I happen to stumble upon by shear chance every month or so. The zooming in on pictures is nice, but the scrolling around doesn't work very well. Feels comfortable in your hand, has a nice bright screen with vivid colors, sleek design, good volume control placement. Wish the battery was anywhere near advertised (lasts maybe 10 hours). A bit pricey for what you get, but I bought it when it was over $200. Reset button is also very effective in case of a glitch and doesn't even reset your clock or settings.

<Title>Amazon & Samsung YP-Z5 a match made in heaven
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Amazon dose it again fast next day delivery and wonderful safe packaging ! this small unit is top notch your looking for an MP3 player rugged with easy music file interface with windows XP this is the one ! No need for after market ear phones right away these sound GREAT! & they fit nicely in my ears. I'd buy the carrying case before new ear buds for a start. the picture quality is O.K & the color is just fine. but I bought this for the MP3 aspect first not the picture quality. like I said the sound is EXCELLENT better than any CD player. I went for a jog and ran 4 miles instead of my usual 2 cause the music was so good and never once skipped I'm in LOVE! Amazon and Samsung YP-Z5 a match made in heaven

<Title>Bad Unit??
<Date>Tue Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall the unit is pretty good, though sound and ergonomics are nothing incredible.  I am not a big fan of the touchpad scroll but the volume bar on the side is good.  The unit I bought has a battery problem and I only get about 3 hours of play instead of 30.  The battery seems to go down between uses and goes quickly while playing. Between the battery problems and the touchpad that is too hard to use I am returning this for a Sansa player.

<Title>after a lot of comparing...
<Date>Wed Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I owned a Iriver H10 5GB which died 13 months after I purchased it. The player was problematic at best when it did work.  Very poor customer support etc, so I wanted to do a lot of research before I spent $200+ dollars on a player.  FYI if you plan on running purchase a MP3 player that uses flash memory, any Hard drive based model does not take shock well. I eventually got down to the Samsung 4GB and San disk 4/6 Gb models.  I decided to purchase the Samsung and have been very pleased. I was used to windows media player and have mostly WMA files and some WMA-10 (copy protected files).  It was seemless to transition to Samsung.  I used playlists already on my computer and added about 2 GB of songs and was up and running in 20 minutes max.  Player charged fully in 1.5 hours and the playback is excellent.  I have never submitted a review before but since it was hard to find many opinions online I wanted to share mine. The only downside is that you do have to plug into a computer to charge but this is not a big issue for me. I do not travel often and I have a laptop I can use if need be.

<Title>It gets one demerit for the equalizer
<Date>Thu Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really want this player but it doesn't have a fully customizable equalizer like some of Samsung's previous models do.  Its a shame really, because I like the player in other ways.  Some others have hoped there would be a firmware update to add this features but its been almost a year and several updates and still no improvement on the equalizer.    If you dont mind this one flaw, dont let this stop you from getting this player.

<Title>Beware of Samsung Customer Web of mockery and deceit!!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing broke after 2 months. The real nightmare is the Samsung support. I had to send it in twice for repairs and twice it came back DOA. To add more stress, Samsung Service did not perform as change of address, despite a dedicated call I made to them for this purpose only. They sent it back the second time to the old address. I own several Samsung products (HDTV, DVD PLAYERS), which have turned out to be mediocre in quality and performance. I will never buy Samsung again.From now on, any electronics I buy will be bought locally and with extended warranties.

<Title>Nice all-rounder, great battery life
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I originally went shopping for a nano, and was convinced in-store to give the Z5 4Gb a go instead. The main benefits I've like are the loooooong battery life, easy PC connection via the USB cord and being able to play MP3 files natively, without having to convert to Apple's music format. So file transfer is fast and simple, and the player is very compatible "out of the box" without having to add on iTunes or any kind of proprietory software.  The Z5 connects directly to Windows Media Player, so I can set up sync lists. The interface this way is a little cumbersome though, and the sync can be a little tedious for deleting files -- and you need to have good tags in your MP3 files to have albums sorted correctly (although I doubt that is a negative against the player -- it's only reading the available data!). But you can access the player's files without Windows Media Player, directly from Windows Explorer, so that's an added bonus.  The navigation can be slightly over-sensitive at times, it's easy to scroll past an item in the window, but doesn't take long to get used to. The player switches off the screen pretty quickly, which helps prolong battery life. And I can easily scroll through my songs whilst another song is playing, easy to setup the next song to play if I'm looking through all 600-plus songs on the player. Easy too to hook up an FM transmitter to the headphone jack to play songs through the car radio.  It also has a picture viewer but I don't see the point of it: it's not video and the screen isn't that big to enjoy too much picture viewing. But then again, I don't think any small screen size devices really lend themselves to extended or frequent picture viewing. I'm sure others have their own opinion, so if a picture viewer is appealing, there's one here.  Overall, it's a bit bulkier than the nano, but still small overall and doesn't feel at all flimsy, so likely to avoid scratches and should last well in the long term. Recharging is simple via USB. Not the range of expensive add-on products as iPod, but that's not why I bought the player: it has been a reliable MP3 music player and I'd happily recommend it to friends.  I'm nearly tempted to only give it 4 stars because of the navigation being a bit sensitive, but I don't think it warrants a full star downgrade. Probably 4.5 stars, but happy to say 5 in this case.  The only reason I'd get rid of the player is for a video based player (ideally with SD card slot to store camera pics) of about 80Gb or more -- but that's really a different category of need -- this is great for music!

<Title>Bad Customer Service, faulty product
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The one I received as a gift never worked.  I sent it in for repairs twice, and twice it was returned with the same problem.  Customer service promised to contact me with some sort of resolution.  Nope.  When I called back a week later, nothing had been done to get me an exchange or a refund.  Apparently, my case wasn't even forwarded yet to the department who could authorize any decision.  I'm still waiting.  Do yourself a favor and check out the better business bureau's report on Samsung Electronics, Ridgefield Park, NJ BEFORE buying an MP3 player from them.  The vast majority of complaints are either unresolved or not responded to.

<Title>long battery life and durable but...
<Date>Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought it because it had the 2 features I found important-long battery life and durable for use out hiking/camping etc. The general view has been that the controls take some getting used to-I agree and wish I could have tried it before buying it. Also, I had an easier time putting music on my moms cheapo $30 MP3 player then I did with this one. Sound quality is good, havent used it enough yet to say much else. My biggest issue is not the product itself but the company. Samsung reps are RUDE. I called to inquire about a car adapter (unlike IPODs there are no "YP-Z5" accessiories) and was told that if I didnt have a cd player in my car I was out of luck. When I asked if there wasnt ANY adapter I could use since I dont have a cd player-the rep interupted me saying "listen lady" and "most new cars today have cd players" he ended up hanging up on me. In all, I am soured by the experience and will never order a Samsung product again.
