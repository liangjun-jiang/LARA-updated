<Content>The quality of this player is second only to the iPod. The sound quality and picture quality are good to excellent depending on the quality of your sound and pics from the begining. Pictures are another story. On my wifes iPod pictures come up almost instantly, with the Meizu player pictures take a long time to pull up and this is a major drawback. I hope they develop a firmware update that will correct this issue. This is why I give it 4 stars only. As for the capacity I have more that 500 songs on mine with about 12 videos and tons of pictures and I still have another 4 Gigs to go! The built-in radio is a nice touch too.  
<Overall>4
