<Product Name>Sony NW-S705F Noise-Canceling Walkman MP3 Player (Black)
<Title>Decent MP3 player, with its own limitations

<Content>This is my first dedicated MP3 player, though I own several devices that can play MP3s.  Pros:  1. The sound quality is very good, (though the bass is enhanced to a significant degree, which can be decreased) 2. The player has a good quality feel to it 3. Battery life is excellent 4. Built in noice cancellation system is somewhat helpful 5. FM radio is good. 6. headphones are comfortable to wear, and is above average quality.  Cons: 1. Does not work with Mac OS. This is a problem for me. 2. The same goes the the headphones from this unit You cannot usethe headphones with other MP3 players 3. To transfer songs, have to use sonicstage software, which I prefer not to use.   I took one star each out for its non-compatability with mac OS, and this model's unique headphone jack, and headphone.  The way I see it,  I paid $50 for this, and at that price, I consider it a good buy (not very good, or excellent) for my use as an FM radio, with noice cancellation features, and excellent battery life.

<Title>Great little player for the price I payed.

<Content>I also purchased this player for $50, and at that price, I have no complaints.    Yes Sonicstage is bloated, but once you get used to it you'll quit your whining.  The Noise cancellation (passive/active) is good, and the earphones sound great once you find the right EQ settings. Battery life is also wonderful.  I do want to correct the other review: You CAN use any other headphones you want with the player.  You CAN'T use the players headphones with any other device however.  The player's bundled headphone has an extra notch on it that will only fit into this player's proprietary headphone jack, but you can use any other headphone on this player, the jack does not prevent that.  I've tried many different headphones on this player just to test the sound compared to the bundled phones.  At $200, you have to decide whether the battery life, size, and active noise cancellation is worth it for you over comparable players.  At the price I payed it's a wonderful flash based player I'd reccommend to anyone, even over the nano.
