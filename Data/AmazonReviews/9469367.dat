<Title>simple but useful
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have a long commute and now use this solely for Audiobooks and it is perfect for such a use.  When I first bought it I intended it to be used for my morning jogs but I decided that I wanted something that held more so I wouldn't have to constantly update it according to how I felt that morning.  However, that is pure laziness as it takes seconds to update.  The battery life is also more than sufficient.  I don't know about other 256 MB MP3 players but this one seems great to me

<Title>A great starter/responsibility tester
<Date>Fri Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player was everything that it said it was. My daughter wanted an expensive MP3 player but I wanted to see if she could keep from loosing it. She hasn't lost it yet. I really like the fact that this comes with the FM radio... they all should. I say starter in my title because with the limited memory it does not hold many songs. Another benifit to the FM radio..

<Title>Not too impressed...
<Date>Sat Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this unit for almost a year, and there are things I like about it and things I don't like...  Pros:  -good sound for the small size -good price -easy to use -I like the clip; I can prop it up on my desk.  Cons: -battery life is nowhere near 15 hrs -when I do change the battery, it resets and I have to skip around to find the song I was listening to. -putting it on shuffle or skipping through uses up the battery more.  I am planning on getting a SanDisk with a larger capacity; I am hoping it will work better for me.

<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this unit when it was so much more pricey.  I used it for  a little while and then the usb connection was broken or without making contact.  I sent the unit in for repairs and it came back fixed but to it was broken again a few weeks after.   Worthless piece of equipmment.

<Content>Ipod be damned. Does the necessaries with no fuss. A bit tricky for my fat fingers, but I would never buy the Nano or Ipod over this. Yes, the volume is a tad low, and the included earbuds are weak. Durable, well designed software, good battery life, good FM tuner.

<Title>MuVo TX 256 MP3 player - broken usb connector
<Date>Sun Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I saw another review with a broken usb connector problem. It happened to my MuVo too. The connector is not really broken but is cleanly separated from the player (and attaches firmly to the battery unit). My MuVo player is now completely useless. The CL "Award winnging customer service" web site has no address or phone number to call for repair. Needless to say, CR loses me as a customer.

<Title>For Beginners
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this about 2 years ago, when it was first released and very expensive. It is still the only MP3 player I have ever owned and does the job. Compared to newer MP3 players this is a `toy', with limited functionality, memory, and lack of video, pictures, etc. It is extremely basic. The biggest problem is with battery life - it is horrible!! Absolutely horrible battery life. It uses 1 AAA and it eats through batteries like crazy. That has been the biggest downfall. The software it's bundled with is ok, but not very intuitive; I still have a hard time figuring out how to transfer music easily. The player is extremely compact and the headphones are ok - nothing fancy. I've used the voice recorder a lot and also the FM radio, and both offer good reception. The on/off dial is a button that you have to hold down and it takes quite a while to start up/shut down. You can scroll through songs, fast forward, rewind, and the songs seem to be played alphabetically by song title (unless I just haven't figured how to change that). This isn't a player for people who love music, because it doesn't hold too many songs - between 60 and 120. I've outgrown this, and technology has surpassed what this player is capable of; this is a bare-bones player that doesn't hold much and doesn't do much. Great for a run in the park, but the battery probably won't even last that long. Unlike others, this has never broken on me or malfunctioned. There are much better options available now in MP3 players, so look around for something better.

<Title>Total Piece of Crap
<Date>Mon Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this player for a little over a year and have hardly used it.  It has never worked correctly.  When trying to switch tracks, it automatically shuts off on me.  Now, it won't even turn on!  Unfortunatly, I did not register the product or keep any of the original paperwork, so the company won't do a thing about it.  If you have this player, do not get rid of the paperwork!

<Title>Muvo looked to be a great deal until.....
<Date>Thu Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was a great little MP3 player. Great sound, my wife loves the portability in the gym, but after 7 months of normal wear, the display stopped working. Worse yet, I call Creative and they tell me it's not under warranty anymore. They said the warranty was for 90 days!  Huh? The rep at Creative said they'd give me a "discount" and only charge me $45 to fix it. I asked for him to please talk with his manager about this problem. He said he'd call me back today, but I'm still waiting.   Beware ... Creative products look great, they sound great, but clearly they not only don't hold up well, but also don't have the type of support you expect to have from Creative. Sad.

<Title>Love it - Can't put it down
<Date>Sat Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative MuVo is a 256MB Flash Drive that can be used to store music or data. All normal disk operations such as cut, copy, paste, delete, rename and also drag & drop can be used with folders or files. When you plug the MuVo into your computer USB, it will recognize and configure the MuVo and then lists on the directory tree as "Removable Disk (x)" with x being the next drive letter.  In addition to music, you can use the MuVo as a Secure Data Key. To do this, I am using a program called "Password 2000" which I have installed on the MuVo that uses about 625K of space. When used as a Secure Data Key, a double-layer of protection is provided. Two conditions must exist before protected information can be accessed. (1) The owner of the MuVo must plug it into the USB jack and (2) the correct password for Password 2000 must be entered. This is very handy since the MuVo's portability allows your encrypted passwords to be used anywhere, on any computer. Once unplugged, your data is off the computer and safely back into your pocket.  The MuVo lives up to it's reputation as outlined by other reviews on this web site so, I won't duplicate that information.   On the down side, I found the Earbuds to be difficult to use as they kept falling out. Also, they don't quite match the audio quality of the Radio Shack (Koss) "Pro 25" headphones I'm using.  For it's size, weight, portability, and sound quality, I highly recommend this excellent product. Be sure to shop around for the best price. I've recently seen this product at a local chain store for about 33% less than the typical price.

<Title>Great Product
<Date>Tue Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The Creative MuVo 256MB Player is a great all-in-one product.  I got it after losing my Otis player.  I listen to a lot of audio books from Audible.com and there is a firmware plug-in from Audible to support this product for their download manager.   After experimenting for a few minutes everything works fine.  I have experimented with all the features and they work fine.  To have in one small lightweight package a flash memory drive, radio, audio book player, mp3 player, and voice recorder/FM radio recorder is very useful.

<Title>First CREATIVE experience
<Date>Wed Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>My life is full of first-time experiences.  As a oblivious infant, I experienced my first time walking. As a 5-year-old, I experienced my first time how to read, and speak cohesively.  As a adolescent, I experienced my unbalanced emotions that I couldn't understand when I'm around girls.  And now, as a modern electronic-enthusiast,  I experienced my first time purchasing an mp3 player...or in this case, FLASH mp3 player.  ~REVIEW~  Let me get right down to this:  I LOVE this device.  Any newbie who's under the same shoes I am, looking for good mp3 player at its core, should place this player on their electronics checklist.  This review probably isn`t going to be THAT informative, because I don't know got-dang much about the selection of mp3 players.  I took me quite a while to find the best player on the market with the green I little have on my wallet, and I believe this CREATIVE product is the right choice to make; right on the features, and right on retail.  The "CREATIVE MuVo TX FM" player is cool, because like what it says on the box, it's not only a mp3 player:  it's a mp3/FM radio/microphone hybrid!  The player is small, it can place well into the palm of an adult's hand.  The screen is small too, but the buttons are big, and the text on the screen are quite readable, so the size is not that big of a deal.  Plus, it shows how much juice the AAA battery got left.  Like every music player affair, it has a standard play/pause, and volume button; the play/pause button also acts as a power button, but it's one of those power buttons where you press and hold it for a few seconds in order to turn off.  The scrolling gray thingy on the black width side of the player controls the rewind and fast-forward of the song whenever it`s pushed either left or right, which also skips tracks the same way, and pressing it can activate the selection the screen highlights or go to the main screen.  On the mp3 side,...well, it plays mp3 songs obviously, and it plays well, and sounds clear and flawless (it also plays WMAs).  Since I bought the MuVo TX FM with 256 Megs (approximately, meaning between 240 to 250),  it can plays up to 4 hours of songs with 128 kbps.  This player also has its own Equalizer, which is basically a bunch of bars moving vertically so the adjusted sound placement of the songs can be just right for the listener.  It contains its own sets of EQs: rock, jazz, classical, or if you're a EQ pro, you can customized your own EQ to personalize.  I can pull the black piece out of the white area of the MuVo, and use it as a separate USB hard drive, which was the greatest thing about it, because it's the easiest way to drag in any files (NOT JUST MP3) from the computer and put it in the device shown as a separate drive without out all that yes-or-no legal-disclaimer nonsense.  And I couldn't believe how fast the transmission is from computer to device; it took me almost a minute to put in all 25 4-minute songs.  The MuVo package does include a CD program, and with it I can convert my CDs into mp3s; there are other programs that can do that, but I don't mind this one.    One thing must be notified:  Licensed music files CAN'T be transmitted through point-A-to-B dragging, so you must transmit these types of files through a computer media program.  On the FM side, albeit without AM to back up, it sounds just as fluid as an mp3.  I can save a  preset to the radio stations, using the in-device menu, and up to 32 presets can I automatically go to any of my favorite rock/rap/whatever station.  The reception is good; it's not great, though.  Sometimes I have to wave my hands around like an airplane director with diarrhea just to hear the local college jazz station.  Otherwise, the FM radio is a wonderful alternate if I don't feel like listen to my personal tracks.  You go to school, and you were snoozing while your algebra teacher is discussing about the Pythagorean theorem, this device is effective as a microphone.  I went through the same situation, and this device works wonders as a listening stand-in.  And up to 16 hours can I record any kind of situation I want to hear again, or forgot to hear the first time.  Just a reminder, this takes up the same amount of Megs as the mp3s, so record it wisely...or not.  I made so much positive facts, the MuVo seems perfect, right?  Sadly, not true.  When it comes to putting the music files in the MuVo, I can't sort the tracks of my choosing, because the tracks are always listed alphabetically.  For that,  it became a time-consuming process to rename the whole files on the computer so the MuVo can list them the way I wanted, and that's tiresome.  The play/pause button has a tendency to get a slow response when I press it, and like everyone who reviewed this product, the uncomfortable headphone included in this device can make a person spend 30 extra bucks on a new one.  THE FINAL WORD:  Value.  If a media player has a ton of features AND it cost less than $150, almost nobody would ever stop saying "wow!", and with MuVo, I still have the habit of keep saying that.  Okay, it's not an Ipod, a Rio, or a Sony network walkman, and what I say is no different from every other positive reviewer for this item, but another positive review is just another example of why this is such a good buy and a good alternate for those who just wants to listen to music, no matter how much it can hold.  Don't distant yourself on this one.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>USB 2.0, light weight, awesome sound, FM radio, long battery life, quality ear buds, and it took a total of 7 minutes for me to be up and running with this thing. I cant stress enough how easy it is to load it up with music. The software is great, it rips CD's, organizes music, compresses files, you name it. No cords no funky wires, just plug it in and the transfer is so fast. I personally dont needmy entire music collection with me, this holds just the right amount of music for my train commute and my jogs at night. This player is awesome.

<Title>Size Matters
<Date>Tue Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>We all know size matters, and as tiny as the MuVo is, it's one of my sexiest gadgets. I've owned larger lighters.   This is my first mp3 player, so look elsewhere for comparison based reviews. As a first time owner, I am absolutely delighted. The sound quality is as crisp as a CD. The controls are simple and intuitive. It's tiny enough to fit into the smallest fashionable purse, but also comes with an easy-to-use removable belt clip and exercise arm band. What more could I want?   I bought the MuVo to go with Audible.com. At 256 megs, it will hold 2-3 medium length novels or one huge unabridged one. I could've bought a MP3 jukebox, but in comparison, even the iPod mini is HUGE. I don't need every song I've ever heard with me all the time. I'd rather throw on a playlist and a book and have a wonderfully tiny little device.  The software is so simple I never needed to open the manual. Plug and play, baby! The MuVo is also a USB flash drive, so no cords are needed. Just slide it into your USB port and you're all set. Loading files is simple and intuitive. If you already have audible.com, loading audible books is just as easy (IMPORTANT NOTE: This is only compatible with audible files at a 2 or 3 resolution. Higher or lower and they won't be recognized by the player.)   The biggest shock was the FM player. I owned a Radio Your Way for awhile and couldn't hear the songs over the static. My tiny little MuVo picks up even the faintest NPR stations with incredible clarity.   The included headphones are a bit uncomfortable, but headphones are cheap and easy to come by. I can't begrudge them that. Other reviews complain about low battery life. I get about 8 hours on my rechargables, which I find pretty reasonable since it's powered by a single AAA.   If you're looking for a small, inexpensive mp3 player/FM reciever, with great sound quality, you can't go wrong with the MuVo.   ***addendum:  The Samsung Yepp is, in fact a tiny bit smaller. For people out there who want to rub it in, the MuVo is the sexy thong of the MP3 world while the Yepp is closer to a g-string. Less is what you see and less is what you get - the Yepp is NOT Audible ready and does not offer any Audible support. In addition, the Yepp does not come with either a belt clip or an armband (MuVo gives you both) so make sure your clothes have plenty of pockets. The MuVo is still the tiniest MP3 player in it's class, but there is a less classy competitor out there if you're looking for sheer Geek Chick Size Coolness.  The size difference is pretty minimal. MuVo: 1.4 x 2.9 x 0.6 versus Yepp: 0.94 x 0.94 x 2.2. It's really more a question of whether you prefer your MP3 player flat (the MuVo) or cubical (the Yepp.)

<Title>File System Error Fix
<Date>Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>In general, I love this little machine.  It has all the right features.  It's small, but packed with goodies such as a FM tuner, a voice recorder, a 256 MB USB storage device with an integrated USB plug (no wires), and the sound quality is great.  A few small complaints.  First when the clear plastic belt clip holder is on, it's really hard to remove the MP3 player from the battery housing.  I guess it's not supposed to be removed with the belt clip on, but I'd like to be able to do that.  I ended up cutting a chunk off the clear plastic so I can unplug it easier.  Second, the headphones are poor.  The ear buds don't fit well and the sound quality is poor.  The wire has an asymmetric joint so the wire to one ear is longer than the wire to the other ear.  Ditch the headphones and buy a good one.  Third, I had the unfortunate experience of having the dreaded "File System Error" show up on the screen.  Don't know how I got it, but when it happens, you can't turn the beast on.  It just flashes the error message and turns itself off.  I can plug it into the PC just fine and it will work as a USB storage device.  Just won't work outside of the PC.  Formatting it didn't help.  Calling Creative tech support didn't help.  They told me to return it for an exchange.  I did a web search and found some people with similar problems.  They were all told to return it to Creative or to return it to the store for an exchange.  By an incredible stroke of luck, I stumbled on a way to fix this nagged problem.  I formatted it again (using windows explorer), but this time, I specified FAT file format instead of FAT32.  Voila!  It turns on and seems to be working just fine now.  So those of you who see the "File System Error" message, try that first.  You may also try to put a Label on it.  Perhaps that helps too.  Overall, I still love this little music machine and would recommend it to anyone.
