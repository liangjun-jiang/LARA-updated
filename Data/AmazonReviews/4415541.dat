<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>A Zune is worth a thousand pictures!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great item, bought my wife the ipod she wanted, and I got this same time. Both are great, do not let anybody tell you otherwise<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>. If you can get this for less money, than why get the ipod? (plus the screen is great, a definate plus over the ipod)I had considered the itouch since I was looking for best bang for the buck with the best screen. I am so glad I did not get the itouch! A friend has the itouch, and it is great until you realize that you are constantly looking at it through you finger prints (that sucks).I will update if necessary.

<Title>much better than an ipod
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son bought one and when his brother's ipod broke, he wanted a Zune instead.  It has an FM radio, you can easily transfer any music, great features, and the price was much less than an ipod.  We will never buy apple products again as they are too proprietary.  Our whole family will be buying one.  You can also search around and find better deals on the Zune.  Amazon had the black one for $50 cheaper than the others.  GREAT PRODUCT

I was hoping to move the music, pictures and videos from my computer using the Zune as an external drive. I find it very cumbersome!!!

<Title>First time MP3 buyer
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Buying a hard drive MP3 player was the correct choice for me,this was the first generation Zune 30 Gigabite player and I was able to download all the updates to go with it. I already have about 85 cd's converted on my Zune, and soon my whole collection will be portable. .That still only uses one third of the available memory.The 3'' screen is the best for pictures and I plan on downloading a movie or two also. I like it that the album covers are displayed and it is very easy to use and navigate the players  menu too. This Zune has an FM radio, another feature I wanted. Most stores are just starting to carry Zune accesories, but they are easilly to buy online, with a large assortment to choose from.  Most importantly I only paid $159.95 on Amazon.com and with free shipping and no sales tax the internet is the best way to buy n ew MP3 players. The enclosed ear buds and need to be replaced right away, I purchased a pair of Sony's Right away and later a set of V-moda in ear canel type that I really like. The case is flimsy and I am looking for a plastic box to use as a case. I deffinately reccomend the Zune....

We have found the synching gets trashed when synchin while using the computer online so he does it when the computer is not in use.  It takes some time.  He is very happy with it.

<Title>Zune 30 - Great product, Great price.
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my Zune at a great price, and never thought I would use it as much as I do. If you have a MediaCenter PC - This is a MUST HAVE! You can record TV shows, and movies, convert them to Windows media files, and take them with you. If you get the home dock and connect it to your TV, you can watch your shows right on the TV. It holds more music than I even know. Check out the aftermarket programs designed for it and you can really do some cool stuff. The screen on the 30 is big enough to actually enjoy watching. The new software adds features it did not initially come with, like podcast support, and full menu control with the remote. Seems very well built, and the accessories are top notch quality. Like the Ipod, all the accessories are pricey for the original Microsoft stuff, and I suggest you stick with original made accessories. Others I tried did not fit it quite right, I have a friend who got a cable from an online store that damaged his, buyer beware. If you have an XBox360, this connects and you can watch all the photos, videos and music right thru it very easily. The wireless sync is GREAT! I just need my Zune anywhere in the area of my wireless router, push sync on the Zune menu, it opens up the program on my PC and updates by itself. I don't need another sync cable for my computer.  I like it better than my Ipod, mostly for the wireless abilities, and the battery life. It also does NOT scratch like my Ipod, and the newer ones have a real glass screen to avoid the problem. All in all I'm quite impressed with it.

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Light, Compact, Heavy duty.When you turn the Zune sideways while you watch music videos or movies its like a widescreen movie. It's amazing! It's similar to the Ipod but with a way bigger screen for almost the exact same price or less. Another family member has the Ipod nano and for the same price I got 30gb. The size is a bit thicker but that doesn't bother me. I've synced movies on from dvds and they look great. So if your looking for a new mp3 player put the Zune on your List.:)

<Title>Hard-to-find item found - Before Xmas!!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My girlfriend loves red, so when she "hinted" at mp3 players (by looking at those "fruity" ones), I knew what to get her. I have owned every brand of mp3 player under the sun, and I can say the Zune is the best bang for the buck - especially with the new software upgrade. I didn't think I'd be able to find an affordable 30GB red Zune in early December but Amazon not only had one (and I mean 1 in stock!) but their fast, free delivery got it to me in enough time to wrap it and get it under the tree. She was blown away, I scored major points :) and life is good! Thanks Amazon!

<Title>Can't live without it! Threw the iPod away!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I couldn't wait for the Zune!  My father bought one and he loved it!   He's purchased quite a few cheapy mp3 players thinking he really wouldn't use it.  Well I think he'd agree that he can't live without it.  He's ALWAYS got his with him.  I don't think he listens to the radio anymore!  So he bought me one.  I loaded it up and I rarely listen to the radio anymore either.  It's so easy to use.  I am a bit disappointed with the latest version of the software, but the Zune people are working very  hard daily to vamp it up! If you join the Zune network they actually answer the forum questions and let you know what's going on.  It just keeps getting better and better.  So I bought this one for my daughter.  We are three generation of Zunies!  And each of us feel the same way, if the house caught on fire, (I was going to say we'd run in to save our Zune first, but on second thought) we wouldn't have to run in to save our Zune's because we'd have them on us!  Sound quality is awesome, the amount of music you can fit on the Zune is perfect.  30G is more than you think!  I can't think of a negative to say!  Join [...] to stay informed!!

<Title>the only choice for people who don't like Apple products
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This music player is great, after installing the software it automatically pulled my entire music library from Windows Media Player onto the Zune in a matter of minutes.  The graphics and colorful menus make it easy to use, and the product easily woks with other Microsoft products.  Everyone I show this to at school tells me they wish they'd known about the Zune when they bought their Ipod.  If you prefer Windows Media Player, this is defiantly the better choice.  However it is a little bulky and lacks the all the cool touch sensitive features that you'd find on an Ipod.

The only thing I don't like about the 30GB is the size.  It is bigger than my 80GB.  But none the less the screen size is so much better than ipods.  And I can tell you that at the store I work at we have never had a return on a zune nore have we sent one off to get fixed.  ipods come back all the time.  This product gets an A+

<Title>Zune horrible user interface - No way to add music by folder, Software is bad, too
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I finally got the doodie-brown Zune that I ordered from Amazon on Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving). Got a GREAT deal on it, but was unable to have it shipped until December 31.  Yah! I get it, open it, load software, configure, attempt to load my massive  music collection. However, at this point I notice that the memory hog Zune software leaves a lot to be desired.  The only way to add music to the Zune it by selecting it from a list that displays cute little album covers. There is not a browse folder option, as ALL WINDOWS machines and even the iPod have... let me repeat, there is no way to go browse for a certain file to add to the Zune, you must painstakingly go through an entire collection of little pictures to add music. Really, Microsoft, did nobody think to add a Browse by.. folder view option that is SOOOOO prevalent in ALL Microsoft software, up until this point?  I have an iPod, too... I really thought that iTunes was the worst software ever, until I got the Zune.

Through the Zune software while syncing, a few of my CDs listed several multiple tracks (`Frankie Goes to Hollywood' goes a long way).  For a first MP3 player, the Zune is a good product.  30 GB will take awhile to fill.

<Title>4 stars!.....? I think?....
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, when I ordered my zune from here I was overly anxious to get it. When I finally got it, it was deffinately what I expected (atleast for 2 days). I could put my music on it and watch videos with relative ease. The videos were A LOT less pain to put on than the ipod (because you have to BUY your own converter for the ipod) and I also liked the way that the albums displayed their album art. The video playback was very clear on the screen. Of course the one thing that threw me off was the upload and converting the videos. Instead of telling you the percentage of all the videos that have been converted, it only told you the percentage of one at a time. This threw me off cause the video would get to 100% and then reset to 0% so I thought it was broken. It wasn't, but it was slightly confusing. So all in all I liked the player a lot at first. But then like the 3rd morning that I had it I went to turn it on, and the screen wouldn't work! It just displayed a black screen with pixalated gray on one side. (Not a good sign) So I call up the service center and right away they are convicting me of dropping it (this didn't set well with me). But unfortunately/fortunately I had already dealt with their customer service before (Xbox 360 RROD?) so I just kept cool and said that I needed to get it sent back to be fixed. So they sent me a box and I sent it in, and haven't gotten it back yet. It has been probably 1 week now, but it sounds like it will be A LOT longer than that. I'm sorry but they should just take your credit card info and send you a new one and have you send the broken one back. And if you don't send the broken one back, charge you for another one. You shouldn't have to wait weeks for your product that you spend good money for. As far as the product goes I'd say it probably deserves a 4 stars. But as far as customer service 0 stars. Terrible.

<Title>Player Good...Zune software BAD!
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I think my review will mirror most out there: from a hardware perspective the Zune is a great player...even better than the iPod in my opinion as it has a radio and better video.  However, the applause ends there..the Zune software is horrible. It makes duplicate copies of songs on the player, sync's stuff you tell it not to, and adds incorrect album art, artist and album info to roughly 30% of the songs on player.  The software alone is reason to look elsewhere.   These are remedial issues that Microsoft should've fixed before bringing the product to market.

<Title>Great and more Great
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First let me say that the menu system on the Zune is far. I mean FAR superior to any other MP3 Player (i-pod included). Only 4 stars because a click wheel would make the 30 GB Zune hands down the best device out there. Screen is bright and huge. Great battery life. The Zune software is awesome. The only cons I have are: No click wheel, The player itself is too big, video takes a long time to upload and not a lot of accessories. A great player for the price but, If you want to spend a little more the 80GB Zune is the best player out there.

<Title>Great Product but needs better support from Microsoft
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love the Zune physically - large screen, large hardrive, easy to read menu and easy functionality.  But the Zune Marketplace is so BAD!  compared to iTunes it is a joke!  they don't offer audiobooks nor movies/tv shows for download.  and since they don't honor DRM it is hard to find downloads.  Microsoft needs to either step up to the plate and develop the marketplace or just release it as a standard MP3 player.

<Content>So far so good.  My wife is enjoying her new toy.  I think the bulk of our CD collection if not the entire collection has been ripped ans synced up to her Zune. I will post if I run into any technical problems with the product. The price I paid for this amount of storage vs. buying the name "IP_D" was well worth the money and cheaper too!

<Title>It exceeded my expectations
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It was an incredibly deal on Zune player at last holiday season, so I decided to give it a try, so clicked to order. I was very interested in what software giant can offer in own player collecting all the best from players offered by already established companies on this market as Creative Lab, and Apple. My Zune 30 was delivered prior Christmas and was waiting under the tree until the clock chimed 12.  As a theater begins from a coat check as DAP begins from a packaging. Every company considers packaging really seriously and tries making it most attractive and innovating. I remember packaging of my first 3g iPod when I really had no clue how to open it.  After removing two sticky clips I slid top of box very easily and got an access to the content of packaging.  Zune took center part, headphones took left part  and an interface cable was in right section of the inner box.  Another section accessible from top contained a pouch, manuals, and software.  Comparing packaging of Zune, Zen , and iPod I'd give 1st place to Zune and  the last to Zen.  Although Zen has most technical information on the box, not so many retailers have actual device in stock reachable by consumers, so the information doesn't reach consumer until he/she really purchased it. First what I did was comparing sizes of iPod and Zune. Obviously Zune is slightly bigger, however it fits comfortable in hands and pockets. A plastic case seems fingerprints free and probably scratch resistant as well.  Screen is huge. Controls look Ok. Play and back buttons are a bit small, but easy to press anyway. You can notice that navigation dial of Zune is also smaller. General problem is that you can miss actual button, for example press center button instead of arrows.   I tried a pouch, it fitted very perfectly. I remember a very loose pouch of Zen, when I could fit two Zens in it, and as result my Zen slid down and has been fallen on a granite floor. Part of its case was broken, luckily it continued working well. However Zune's pouch isn't suede one, as iPod has.  Now I was ready to charge and try it. I connected it to USB port, however it didn't start charging until I turned on computer, although USB was powered all time. An interface cable has protective caps on both ends, similar to iPod's interface cable, however it wasn't fitted so perfectly, I had problems to disconnect it from Zune's end. I hoped to see Zune in Explorer as a standard MTP device after connection, however Vista didn't show Zune anywhere. I remember I could copy music to Zen instantly after a connection ( Zen is MTP device as well). Ok, I decided to play with Zune interface a bit. It came pre-filled with some music, videos and pictures. User interface appeared quite intuitive, screen is big and I was impressed. I tried FM tuner, reception was clear and easy to tune on different stations. I was only wondering when DAP will start incorporate HD tuners? I tried to figure if I can records radio, however it seems not possible. So now it was time to fill it with my own music now. Since it didn't work out of the box, I pulled CD with software and started installation. First step of the installation was obtaining an update. So if you start using Zune in fields, then no way to make it working without an Internet connection. The actual update installed  first Zune management program and then begun updating Zune firmware. I heard that Microsoft issued 2nd generation of Zune, which is generally just a firmware update for 30gb version of the device. An updating firmware took some time, it seems similar to iPod procedure, a new firmware image gets first loaded on a hard drive of a device, and then it gets flashed. UI of Zune looked quite different after the updating firmware. Text of menu items became even bigger; color palette was changed from brownish colors to dark gay ones. New items appeared in Settings menu, and total music navigation got change offering multiple choices switching from artists to albums view and versa. I'll tell about navigation ability of Zune later.    Zune management desktop software  As I already mentioned, you can't use WMP or just Explorer for Zune management. It is certainly drawback, which is dictated by a simple monopoly rule - "We're confident and do know how to do better, if you do not like something, then tell us and we will correct it, do not correct it on your own". Anyway, Zune software is quite innovative. It inherits some principles from iTunes providing 3 panes Artist-Album-Song view.   The  UI is completely custom, and it mimics a tabbed access to different functionality of the program. You need some time to get used before taking all advantages of new UI. I'm still learning it. Some things are quite not intuitive, or require too much extra clicking, for example you can't correct artist/album/song/year in one place. I haven't found how to change genre and year at all.  Zune software uses concept of synchronization a local library with a device. You can beef content library without a device and mark items for future synchronization. A special place is reserved for library, however items being already on a disk can remind in an original location. Zune software recognizes three communication areas as Zune, CD/DVD drive and community input box.   A killing feature of Zune was an introduction of a socializing feature in opinion of Microsoft. You can see a clear notice of it on Zune's box.  I really do not see much benefits of that, it is probably because of age, tastes and so on. At least social feature should look something different, can be much more clear how to use and how to get benefits from it. As I mentioned, Zune management software has context sensitive UI, so when you are in device mode, you can configure Zune wireless network making it connected to your home WiFi. WEP is supported and the program is able to discover available networks and generally easy to use. However finally the Zune wireless capabilities are completely useless. I tell below why. Ripping ability of Zune software quite good, you can choose several format of ripping, including Microsoft lossless, and MP3. MP3 ripping is quite fast, mostly real time of speed of CD copying, Ripping quality supported up to 320Kbps. However Zune uses less comprehensive DB than CDDB, so many my CDs especially European made weren't recognized.   So let's conclude on Zune management software:   Pros  Innovative UI Easy navigate and find Most of available compressed and lossless audio formats are supported WMV, AAC, MP3 Cons  No software alternatives Not flexible in change or retrieve all song information Connected to not so comprehensive variant of CD DB Limited support of video formats (WMV only) No support open format as FLAC or OGG Zune firmware  General UI  As I mentioned, Zune UI looked differently after firmware update. Again, UI is completely custom and innovative. Menu items are just oversized text with wide using sparkling video effects for highlighting and selection. Microsoft chosen an opposite color schema to Apple's one, so all texts are white on dark or black background. However everything is readable quite well. Navigation is very intuitive. Microsoft was in a difficult situation since a touch dial ring, and a slide bar were taken by other vendors. However a classic arrow managed scrolling and navigation work quite well.  I was even impressed that Zune supports national alphabets in the scrolling directory.  Generally arrow controls provide a very revolutionary two-dimensional navigation, so I can easily manage album or artist selection from the same view. Actually selection a category as artist, song, or genre converts items of it in a scroll vertically list and selection any item from the list converts previous navigation to horizontal with a vertical scrolling of a new selection. Play now screen shows oversized album art, play progress and song, artist, album info. For some reason the screen doesn't have track/song number in the list. Long song, album, or artist name isn't scrolled and just fades out. However it is auto scrolled when selected in a list. White color of play progress doesn't look good when album art has white background. Another problem is that screen is readable when backlit is on. It is very annoying, since you need to press the center button to read the screen.  Sound and video quality  Sound quality is really good. It is a bit different than iPod. I'd say that Zune has a little dip in mid range. Zune is also less loud. My major claims were that Zune doesn't support volume or equalization control per song or album bases. regarding video, I can't tell much, because I do not have videos in WMV format. Certainly big, and bright screen is good for viewing videos, but lacking in supporting different formats limits using Zune for this purpose.     Wireless  I still do not understand why this feature is in Zune. I didn't try it for Zune to Zune communication, however it is useless for sync purpose. It is easy to setup wireless to be connected to home WiFi, however Zune drops connection unless song really short. I did all recommendations from Microsoft site, but nothing helped. Actually one of the recommendation to have Zune powered. It means you need some wire anyway. What really would be nice, if Zune provides a  kind of simplistic browser allowing to look for files in music directories when some specific service is setup. I'd develop such feature gladly, I hope Microsoft listens me. Another disadvantage is if you have radio on, then it shorts battery life substantially.   Conclusion  Pros  Big screen, easy readable, good contrast and colors Nice UI FM Tuner Two-dimensional navigation    Cons  No clock No smart lists No statistics Short battery life Lousy wireless  No recording No disk mode No song position in a list and list size No scroll names in play now Progress bar invisible on certain album arts No volume normalization No per son/album equalizer Screen invisible without backlit    Recommendation   I'd recommend Zune to persons who listen music occasionally and own a relatively small songs collection. Zune is perfect for children though. However Zune is useless for serious music enthusiasts. All my recommendation based on price under $100.

<Title>Better than IPOD
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had both, first i dont have to worry about the converting music into the Itunes, second, when I'm at the gym I can tune into the gym's FM freqeuncy and listen to the TV while working out. The Sync on the zune is faster than the IPOD. The shortfall is Marketplace doesnt have as much, but anything in the itunes can also be put on your zune. So i just pawn off my girlfriend's Itunes libary, hehehe, dont tell her.

<Title>Good gadget
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This digital player have a lot of things great. Is very easy to use, after half hour you know how it work, the package is pretty small, just come with USB cable, headphones (I never used it)and CD, in my case this CD doesn't work at all, I use Win XP in spanish, so I have to go to Zune web and download the latest version of the software, the good thing is in the same process my zune update his firmware.  The new firmware look better than older one, also activate the ability of connect my zune with the computer by the wireles network on my home, so, say good bye to the cables on the desktop.  Following with the Zune, the screen is just fantastic, the construcci�n is pretty, with a material like a glass, but,must be better if protect the unit with a silicone case, I bought an acrilic one but in time it look very old and, I dude it will resist a fall.  You have to know the Zune come almost alone, if you want enjoy it more, you have to buy the silicone case, the wall charger and the cables for put it on your audio receiver or TV.

<Content>I bought a Zune for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it!  My other daughter, who has had her Zune for a while was experiencing difficulties (she's had it almost a year) and Microsoft is repairing it with no hassle through Customer Service under the warranty. I own a Zune myself, and find it a great way to take movies, pictures and music with me on business trips, without having to rely on a laptop for entertainment. They are well built products and very user friendly.

<Title>Get an Ipod
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I used my Zune for 9 months, then, downloaded the software "upgrade".  Not only did the "upgrade" screw up my computer and other music software, the music on the Zune suddenly deleted when the Zune was not even connected to the computer.  My Zune is now a very expensive paperweight.  After attempting to get assistance from Zune Help (these are people who know less about the product than I) and realizing that they would never be able to offer anything of any relevance that I hadn't already tried, I bought a new Imac, a new Ipod, and exported my music to an external hard drive, then uploaded all to Itunes on my new computer.  This solved my Zune problem.

<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My bf's zune worked right away and mine had a few issues with software. We have the same computers and same zunes! It's pretty freaky. My zune itself was fine and came in great shape. My computer had some kind of issue with the driver ( Error 10 ). Vista has some problem with giving permissions. If you have this issue, I'd check out support at Zune official site. Chose community support first with the forums. I found my answer there and will hang out there and see what else they suggest. Right now my zune is up and running and I've got lots of cute little backgrounds in my picture reserves. I also watched some videos and listen to music and the headphones are very decent with sound quality!! I never got it to wirelessly sync, but my laptop had a problem as well so I'm sure it's something to do with upgrading to vista.   Also it's outer casing is much more scratch resistant than an ipod. My ipods all turned out looking 5 years old within one week. I'd protect yours as much as possible. So far the zune is really good about this and it looks really great so far! The radio function is also great. The stations are very clear and some have information on what station it is + what song they are playing! Very awsome!  Well that's all I have to say so far! I'm enjoying zune. Satisfied with the style, the looks, the play, the purchase!

<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had my Zune for a few months when my computer and the Zune software suddenly stopped recognizing my Zune. After deleting the Zune software and reloading it my computer recognizes the zune, but the software still doesn't. I have done everything that the Zune trouble shooting guide suggests, and to no avail. The internet is full of discussion boards about the same problem. Many times the people in the discussion board note that the Zune hotline could not fix their problem either. I never had any problems with my ipod. I have decided that the money I put into the Zune was a waste.
