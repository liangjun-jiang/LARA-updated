<Title>What a joke...
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  I had the av 700 for two weeks but gave up and returned it. The software is 2 years behind and the screen resolution is a joke. My cell phone has a better screen.    I tried everything I could to make this product work but it just came down to the fact that Archos went cheap on the screen! Your eyes will hurt after just 15 minutes of viewing.   Maybe Archos will get it right next time.

<Title>Just Incredible!
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've just received my AV 700 and had a chance to put it through its paces.  I prepared some of my videos, and downloaded them, with some music and photos.  Video playback is just beautiful.    I've read the other reviews, and I have had NONE of the problems described in any of them.  After changing the AV700 to a "hard disk" from its default ID, I was able to successfully connect it to my WinXP PC.  I had to try a couple of different USB ports, for some strange reason, but I don't consider that a problem  I get fine sound, excellent picture quality, good all around responsiveness, and am please with the unit.  It has excellent construction quality.    I've ordered a second battery, but I figure that's just common sense.    Archos has done their homework, and they have a first rate product.  UPDATE:  If anything, I feel even more upbeat about the AV 700 than I did when I first wrote the review.  For example, attention to detail: The relevant buttons on the remote are identical to those on the unit (plus of course the buttons to control other devices, TV, etc.).    I'm 65, and intuitive familiarity with all these new gadgets doesn't come easily, but it surely has for the AV 700.  Also, I note that "Gadget Guy," Matthew Wy, who wrote a very downbeat review, has written 4 reviews, all of them on Archos products, and strangely enough, all 4 identical.  I mean verbatim!  Except for one missing sentence in one of the reviews.  Food for thought!

<Title>More versatile than I thought
<Date>Fri Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first bought this device as a gift for my soon to be wife. I intended to put movies and music on it for her to enjoy while traveling.  Putting music on it was easy, movies were a slight problem, but there were surprises that redeemed the unit.  The best thing about the device was the USB connection.  I can hook it up to my Windows or Mac computer and the computer sees the AV700 as a disk drive.  So moving files, mp3 and AVI's, is as easy as drag and drop.  Once the music was on the AV700, it categorized it by artist, album, etc, just like an iPod.  Movies were a bit tricky.  The AV700 would not play my Dvix files, but converting them to Xvid worked.  I tried several video converter programs, some free and a couple for pay, to find a program that would convert DVD's or AVI's to Xvid and do it well.  When I say well, I mean that the video was sharp and not jumpy and the sound synchronized correctly.  The best converter I found was AVS Video Converter 4.    One surprise was the ability to download your digital pictures to the AV700 for safekeeping.  This made the device great for long travel trips when our digital camera fills up.  We can move the pictures to the AV700 and keep on shooting.  The other surprise was the sheer size of the drive made it also usable as a backup device for my 30gig laptop.  All in all, it's great.

<Title>better product on the market (Zen M)
<Date>Fri Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>the video quality is fair,lots of pixals, the sound quality is very good. The downfall of this product is its software no way to convert video files, I had to purchase 3rd party software $60 plus dollars. Archos 700 does not sync with windows media player 10 unless you use harddrive mode which does not convert files correctly.  I paid way to much for this product wish I had not of purchased it.  I just recently purchased Creative labs Zen M, for half the price and WOW what a product, Killer video and Audio, built in radio with radio recorder, and guess what it comes with its own software.  I put 285 songs 185 photos and 16 full length movies in about 1 hour. The archos 700 has taken weeks to convert and configure video's  Final Results: Don't buy the Archos 700 over priced and not ready for the market.  Do buy the Creative Labs Zen M, Wow Wow and Wow what a great product.

<Title>I love it!
<Date>Wed Mar 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love the Archos for many reasons, first it's easy to use. Who ever designed it had common sense. ALso you can edit parts out of shows that you don't want, you can place a book mark where you stop watching a show so you can go right back to the same place when you turn it back on. You can title the show, create different folders to organize your recordings. You can load pictures from your camera very easily, you can create a slide show and view them on the 7 inch screen. The sound from the speakers isn't the best but when you use head phones it sounds better than a movie theater. I reccommend getting the 100 GB hard drive because better more space than not enough, it claims it holds 250 movies but that must be at the lowest resolution. I record one down from the highest resolution because that is about as low of quality that I want to watch and when you do that you use a lot more drive space. It aLso has great battery life. I am very happy with the Archos AV 700, it hasn't given me any problems, no glitches or freeze ups. I did however go to the Archos website and download the most recent firmware update as soon as I got it. I do not regret buying it for one minute, a little pricey but if you have the money, go for it!

<Content>Will do in the market for portable DVD players. Less bulky and smaller in size, with no need to carry a DVD or CD case. Will pay for itself in recorded video that does not have to be purchased. Playback quality is good for both audio and video. Great storage capacity for a broad set of videos, audio and pictures. Product is a real sleeper, not carried in many of the large electronics stores.....probably cause it would cut into the sale of media. Try it, you will like it!

<Title>This device is NOT for people that have to have their hand held, to be spoon fed daily, or does not read instruction manuals.
<Date>Sun Apr 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Archos AV 700 100GB Mobile Digital Video Recorder is THE sleeper gadget of the last two years! After two months of use after buying this item I have come to the conclusion that 95% of the so called "Cons" relating to this device are due to people NOT reading the instruction manual, or watching the instructional videos on the Archos AV 700 itself. The other 5% is from people who complain about everything that is not 100% perfect.       As far as putting your music on your Archos goes...nothing is easier. Syncing music is a snap with the Archos AV 700. Windows will know everything to do about a second after you plug the Archos AV 700 into the USB port on your computer. Contrary to popular belief the Archos AV 700 IS compatible with iTunes. You have to plug the Archos AV 700 into an Apple computer however. If you have iTunes on a windows machine I don't think it will work, but I am working on finding a way to do it. It sorts all your music just like it was on Windows media player and displays Album art work too, if available for your song. The best part of the Archos AV 700 is the music quality..... awesome!!! I used the same earbuds on my lap top to listen to music as I did with my Archos and I am hearing sounds and instruments I've never heard in some of my songs before. Archos's music quality has always been the best out there. Storing your pictures is just as easy as moving music over. I have always wanted an Archos device ever since a co-worker showed me one of there older Mp3 players that had a 60GB Hard drive in it when Apple was still at 5GB and 10GB.The sound quality and ease of use was there then and it is here now in their products.      The problems for most people come with copying DVDs and other movie formats to your AV 700. I transfered my first movie   right after I gave the unit it's first battery charge. (which you must do, it is good for the life of your battery) It took me about a half hour to hook up the TV Pod, but most of that time was spent pulling my 350lb. T.V. out from the wall to hook up the cords. The best part about the T.V. pod is after you hook it up you can leave it there for as long as you want without a problem.       The video quality problem is solved by recording with an S-video cable, (I know there isn't one included in the box, but at the price you're paying for the AV 700 a 30.00 S-video cable shouldn't break you. If it does then you shouldn't be buying this item), setting the bitrate at a high level between 1500 kp/s to 2500kp/s (I recomend 2500)helps a lot, and looking on the back of your DVD you are transfering and looking to see what format the movie is displayed in (4:3 16:9 etc...) and setting the Archos to match. Those settings are found on the programing screen which comes up after you click on the Videocorder icon. It also displays when the AV 700 is connected to the TV pod with the TV on. You just scroll down using the  directional pad on the right side of the device, and use the L R on the directional pad to change the values on the settings.       I don't recommend movies that take place mostly in the dark like Underworld, episodes of the X Files, Batman, etc... because the dark parts don't do well on a small LCD screen even if it is 7" big. That is the only downside I have found. You won't get as many movies stored by increasing the bitrate, but I have 6GB of music stored plus 10 full DVD movies stored at full bitrate, and I still have 80+ GB of memory left. The battery life is great even with movies playing. The complaints I have seen about it running hot are as far as I have seen unfounded. Any device from laptops to portable CD players will run a little warm or hot if it's AC adapter is plugged in while it is being used. I have found that my Archos gets a little warm but not hot. The key is to set the LCD screen to shut off after a few seconds when transfering movies, or when the screen isn't being used like when playing music. The Archos will shut the screen off during music play to save energy and screen life, but it depends on what your screen shut off setting is at. That will keep it running mildly warm. You must have the device plugged in however, when transfering movies, or syncing music.       I have had no problems with the issues I have heard about dealing with things like: LCD screen freezing up, The "poor" video quality, which can be adjusted, The so-called un-user friendly buttons and interface are complaints from people who can't hook up their own entertainment systems, or have to have Best Buy install their spyware or anti-virus software because they can't do it themselves. This is a device for early adopters of new technology, People who mess with the settings on their computers/cell phones/DVD players to better fit their likes and dislikes, can hook up their own DVD/DVR/VCR/change their own oil/swap out an old hard drive or memory for new ones. If you want your choices made for you.....buy something else cheaper and more boring. If you want something that does what it says and  will casue everyone to say "what's that"? "Where did you get that?!" then get the Archos AV 700 100GB! It is the Ferrari/Aston Martin/Lambo/Audi of the digital world. Creative/Rio/SanDisk/ are the Chevy/Ford/Dodge/Kia of the digital world.       The big question everyone asks themselves these days seems to be "Is it better than the iPod"? Yes and No Why? Well it is better due to the fact that instead of downloading Battlestar Gallactica through iTunes I can transfer my first season  set on DVD to a device that has a seven inch screen on it to view the hot number 10 and Starbuck!, It has a 100GB hard drive!!!, the music quality is better than iPod!        It isn't better due to the fact iPod has a lot of TV shows  and videos you can download from iTunes, the amount of accessories doesn't compare at all, the iPod does fit in your pocket.        I am planning on getting a 60GB iPod video later this year for the TV downloads and use with working out. My Archos is great but with a seven inch screen it makes it hard to run/jog with :)                       It comes down to what you need. The Archos AV 700 ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have a working brain you will love it!

<Title>Doesn't Suck
<Date>Thu May 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Keeping the kids entertained on long trips has always been a challenge. A close second has been keeping me sane on long flights. A portable DVD player was the best remedy until Archos came along. I recently bought one and give it a qualified "mission accomplished," the reservations still being small enough to rate it 5 stars. The thoughtful review by Viewer tells you most of the story, but I have my two cents to add.  First, I admire Archos for the quality of construction. The unit has a nice sold feel, and is well assembled. Face it, if you are parting with 5 Franklins, you should expect something solid. They do that nicely.   The AV700 has the largest display of any similar unit; it should be the standard for portable players - my two children would fight over who got to hold the iPod to watch a movie, and got myopic staring at postage-stamp sized images. That being said, a brighter display should be built into the device, and off-angle viewing could be better (it is only fair on the AV700 - but it is better side-to-side that up-down). If not bright enough for the poolside, it is fine for an airplane or the back seat of the car.  There is a thoughtful range of options. Archos has anticipated that one might want to play media on a stereo or TV (like in a hotel room), and has included the necessary cables. Software options are equally well worked out, and only took me a few minutes to learn (I am not a rocket scientist). Scheduling a recording is pretty easy, and managing a playlist is pretty straightforward, and made easier if you do it from your computer. The browser is really a file management system, necessarily clumsy by the lack of a touch screen or mouse - still much more than tolerable. A cordless remote is a nice thought, anticipating that you might want to navigate the device without getting up from the couch.  The sound quality is good, not surprisingly, comparable to other players. The picture quality is good as well, brightness aside. Don't expect a DivX to hold up to a DVD if you connect your Archos to your 50" plasma TV. That is reallyexpecting too much. That being said, there is some art to ripping and converting movies to DivX. All copies are not created equal, and some compromise must be made between file size and image quality. I am a Mac guy, and  with a little playing around found a good pathway to convert a file to mpg4 then to DivX, with a resulting image that is more than acceptable. The first step will take about 40 minutes, as will the second. If you are smarter than I am, I would bet that you could find a way to do the process in one step. Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention that the legality of ripping a commercial DVD is still in question, so I am not recommending that you do it, or admitting that I do it myself. Truthfully, though, you still have to rip a DVD of family movies to MP4, and convert the codec to DivX before you can watch it on your Archos.   As others have pointed out, a USB cable can connect the device to your computer, and whether you use Windows or Mac, management is much easier. Windows guys will find acceptable software built into the machine, but the Mac guys will find that OSX supports all the necessary functions. By the way, make sure you dismount the AV700 before you pull the cable.   Most of you who are thinking about buying a unit know that it comes in two sizes. This may be a personal preference, but I recommend buying the 100gb unit over the smaller one - a few extra bucks is worth it, realizing that before you know it you will be pushing the 70gb cieling. Finally, I'd give serious thought to buying a spare battery or two. As others have noted, battery life is less than advertised.   When I got my device I was a little disappointed that it didn't play mpg4's straignt, and wished it would play AAC (Apple iPod) files. That really isn't a complaint, however. Of proprietary formats, DivX and mpg are pretty much standard, and I can't really blame Archos for leaning on them.   All in all, I am very, very happy with my AV700. I am almost as addicted to movies as I am to books, so I am glad that Archos is feeding my habit. I give this unit 5 stars, realizing that it is 95% of what I wished for in a video iPod.

<Title>Great video player for travel
<Date>Tue Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had my AV700 for about three weeks and started by loading several episodes of Mister Rogers' for my daughter to be able to watch during long drives while we vacationed across the Cascade mountain range.    The interface is mostly textual so it is touch and go whether a four year old can use the device unassisted, but passing it from back seat to the front my wife or I could queue up a new episode when she wanted one.   My video source is a mix of HDTV and standard definition programs recorded using BeyondTV on a WinXP-MCE box.  I did not like the video conversion software included with the device due to errors in the MPEG handling and limited filter support.    Standard definition 4:3 doesn't fill the player's screen so some tweaking of crop settings and scaling is needed to get an image that offers the best compromise of size, distortion, and image area.  Currently I use VirtualDub-MPEG2 for batch conversion of 4:3 recorded standard definition TV source material.  We also used the player to watch one movie and two Masterpiece Theater adaptations.  Pulling the movie off of DVD was a pain and the final result had sound levels too low to hear easily with the built in speakers and the limited volume range of the device.  TV source materials with their compressed dynamic range were more than loud enough however.    Moving 16:9 HDTV to the device wasn't something that I figured out how to do until returning home as there are almost no tools that support HDTV transport streams.  For batch encoding HDTV I am currently using mencoder from the command-line driven with a bit of glue code written in Perl, but it is still a challenge to determine which of the video and audio channels in the transport stream holds the content that I really wanted to convert (with the result of a missed guess giving me badly distorted 4:3 480i instead of 16:9 1080i, or worse the wrong program entirely.)  The manufacturer seems to expect people to record video directly into the device but manually queueing programs and waiting an hour to transfer one program to the device frankly has no appeal to me.  Getting digital video directly off of my PVR is the only use that has appeal and it still suffers from bleeding edge usability issues, but will work with perseverence.

<Content>I bought one of the (relatively) newest mp3 players on the market several years ago. It was a Jukebox Studio 20 from Archos. I wrote to them as I was experiencing some problems with charging the batteries and told them I used an Apple computer. They gave me a return authorization, I shipped it in, they charged me a fee for the fix, shipped it back. I wrote back saying I couldn't get the unit to work with an Apple and they simply replied that Apple's OS wasn't supported. I wrote back saying that I had specifically told them I used a Mac but never got a reply again... Maybe I should have reported them with the Better Business Bureau. You can save yourself a headache (and being robbed) by simply not buying any Archos products.

<Title>Archos AV700 -  Great all in one enterntainment center HDD
<Date>Mon Jul 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Right out of the box it looks like something from the set of the movie 2001.  Pick it up - it feels solid and unbreakable ... though I wouldn't try to drop it on purpose - the 7" screen is not recessed into the case - and covers almost the entire face of the player.  Both are features I happen to love about it!  The MP3 player allows you the normal set of music management functions - including sorting and playing by genre, artist, album, year, title ... etc.  However, rather than make you click a button to see the album art - If the image is embedded in the id3 tag, the Archos displays it as the song is played. -kewl-  Video works well - with almost any codec thrown at it.  Pull some free stuff down from the internet - and jump on a plane.  You'll be entertained for hours with the bright clear screen.   Screen resolution is just ok to me, though my co-workers really thought the color reproduction was rich and bright.  It could stand for an upgrade in pixels though in the next gen of this device.  In addition, the Archos can display photo's one at a time, or you can set it to do a slideshow - and just prop the device back on your desk using the built-in stand - and using it as a photo frame at work :)  I bought the 100 gig version.  There is also an available 40 gig version to be had.  As a technician, this comes in handy.  The device is recognized by any XP computer as an external usb mass storage device - and can be used to carry any type of file - even those it does not natively support for display. - so if you have a need to move a large amount of data from one pc to another - you couldn't ask for a more efficient means ... all with battery power, so no need to plug-in the juice( at least for a few hours before needed to be charged up again )  This Archos model also has a usb host port - which allows you to connect other slave usb devices up to it - and copy data to/from them.  Such as an external USB disk - or other mp3 player.  Just connect it using the included cable - and the Archos immediately recognizes it as an external disk ready to manage.  There's more ( scheduler, audio recorder ... ) but I'm running late.  If I can edit this review when I get back, I will - but this covers most of what I've been feeling since I bought the device.  PS - if you're wondering just how big this thing is ... I think it's the perfect size for use as a belt buckle on one of Elvis Pressley's concert Jumpsuits.  ; )

<Title>Beautiful Unit; Unsuccessful Integration
<Date>Wed Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I REALLY wanted to keep this unit.  The AV700 is a class act.  I liked everything about the unit itself--build quality was excellent, as was the screen.  The interface was a little klunky (compared to an iPod, for example), but was not a significant factor.  However, I returned it.  Why? In short, I could not get the AV700 to work with my TV system.  First of all, and most importantly, the supplied cables are very short--I think they're 3 feet long, if that.  Even though all my components are in a cabinet, the cables weren't long enough.  And, because they are special cables, I couldn't just go to Radio Shack and buy longer ones.  I think this is quite "short-sighted" (excuse the pun).  The cables should be at least 6 feet long for almost any current television equipment installation.  So, the AV700 was pretty much dead in the water for me, just based on the cable length (I also have to include the dock cable in the indictment.  I think it's less than a foot long and protrudes from one side and inflexible so as to severely limit installment options.) Second, the instructions were quite general and, for a video novice like me, inadequate.  There were no more comprehensive instructions on the Archos website either.  I've been around computers for many years, but haven't done much in the way of multimedia setup.  I looked at my installation and tried to follow the instructions as best as I could, but I never got video to the AV700.  I am sure that a video-savvy person wouldn't have experienced this.  However, I would caution a potential buyer who doesn't have such experience to expect difficulty with installation. So, quite reluctantly, I returned the unit.  I really wanted it to work.  Archos could remedy the situation with longer cables and better instructions--either in print or on the website.  Until then, I would advise caution before purchasing the AV700.

<Title>ARCHOS AV 700 - 100g
<Date>Fri Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before I purchased the Archos AV 700 - 100g - I took it upon myself to read the reviews and was completely turned off from buying this system due to the fact that there were so many negative reviews. Thankfully, there was one individual, in his review about it, was very positive and also made recommendations how to use this system and also recommended an S-video cable.  I decided I wanted to purchase it after reading his review because he seemed so positive and I really wanted this system badly since my bus rides are so long and I was tired of traveling with my little laptop (which I used to watch my DVDs on the bus) which weighs 3.5 lbs, but still feels heavy after a long day compared to this AV 700.  I must say that he was right about everything he said and without an S-Video cable, you cannot properly execute the realtime copying process.  My husband connected it to our system (which made it so much easier to operate because our system is very up-to-date and which enables you to work directly through that system so you can watch other programs while it is recording your DVDs, and it has all the setups in the back, and color coded - also our system luckily had included an S-Video cable which saved us $40).  Once connected, it was all uphill for me.  I just read the instructions on how to operate this system once and never had to read it again - it is very user-friendly.  I have copied all my DVDs and able to review them while riding the Bus to and from work which takes me up to 2 hrs sometimes due to traffic.  The battery lasts probably 3 hrs or so.  My only downside is that they mentioned approximately 250 movies, but I believe they are referring to soap operas which are much shorter, but Archos also did mention that it depends on the lenghth of the movie which might make quite a difference on storage capacity.  I have (real time) copied 50 movies and they were all 124 minutes up and including 4 hr movies, so it is safe to say 50 long movies tops. I do not use my Archos for my music storage since I own an Ipod (which I need because I cannot jog or exercise with the Archos), so that aspect doesn't concern me - but I have listened to their prerecorded music and it sounded fantastic.  A week after I purchased the Archos, we took a trip to NC and GA and my grandson used it to watch movies (I didn't have a car charger for it then) and after seeing the performance of the battery say 3 hrs or so since the movies are long, I wish Archos had sold spare batteries to take along with me on long drives so I could be charging one while using the other, then I would be able to get more viewing time.  After the trip, I purchased a car charger for the next long drive.  I must say I love this system and I am glad that there was at least one or two positive individuals that knows their stuff enough to say the right things and give a few helpful hints. Also the price is great - I waited for that. One recommendation, after you have watched a movie and it is not so great or you don't care to see it again, delete it to make space for more interesting movies and therefore you will always have additional storage space.

<Date>Mon Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Great Products!!!  I did a lot of research on which one I wanted and I have to say the AV500 is better if you are looking at picture quality.  They both do the same thing, except the 700 has games.  If you want more than one person to watch go with the 700 but for personal use get the 500.  I ordered both to try them out and then returned the 700, I thank Amazon for making it so easy.

<Content>its a neat product, looks good, has a big screen, is sexily slim and light.   But since its a mobile product, i.e something you take with you on a long drive or on a flight, its battery life of only 4 hours is a limitation. And i assume that like a laptop, battery life reduces with age. makes it a bigger problem.  If i am on an international flight thats 10hrs, i cant charge it up any where midflight.   Battery life is a concern. should improve, or offer an extra battery as complimentary.

<Title>I love my Archos AV 700
<Date>Sat Sep 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the Archos AV 700, but with the 40GB drive a few months ago.     I travel quite abit, including overseas, and wanted something to occupy my time.    This unit is fantastic, but not for those that do not like to read instruction manuals.   When I first received the box the instruction manual was quite overwhelming at first.   However, it is actually a very easy unit to use.  Benefits - 1) When you travel in economy class like I do, then limited space makes it very uncomfortable to open up my laptop to watch movies.    The Archos, however, makes it very easy to watch movies in a very confined space. 2) having the ability to transfer shows from my TIVO is great.  I record HBO movies and my favortie TV shows, then transfer them easily to my Archos.   However, realize that the transfer of shows happens at real time.  I.e. a 30 minute show will take 30 minutes to transfer.   You have to let the show/movie play, in order for the Archos to record it.    It is quite an easy process to tape and usually I do it when I am working on chores in my house or getting ready to go to bed. 3) While I do not have the advantage of the new 100GB hard drive, even 40GB is plenty of storage for lots of movies and TV shows in the supported video formats.   4) No DVD's to carry around 5) Excellent and comfortable screen size.... very good for extended viewing.   I sure would hate having to watch multiple shows and movies on a tiny IPOD video.  Again, initially this unit will appear to be very complicated, however, once you start using it (and read the instruction manual) it is actually quite easy.     I find the battery life quite good, about 5 hours.   What I have observed with the battery life is that it varies based on the shows that you are watching.   If you are watching a show that does not require fast forwarding (i.e. shows that you transfer from your TIVO or recorded straight from TV) to bypass the commercials, the battery life is around 5 hours.   However, it does drop to about 4 hours if you have to continiously fast forward through shows.      Anyway, I love this thing....so does my son, and everyone who has played with it - "I want one" will be heard often.   Also, be prepared for attention on the airplane.

<Title>Customer Service - Unhelpful
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I own an older model and have experienced battery issues. When the unit was on the market and battery concerns were mentioned and Archos said that they would replace the battery if the need arose. Well, I need a new battery and guess what they said. They suggested that I throw away my 20 gig/mp3 player/video player because they no longer support the unit because my model is not current! I can't beleive that something I bought for hundreds of dollars 2 years ago that needs a battery should be tossed.   They said if I found a battery that I would still need to find someone handy with solder. When I inquired about the specs of the battery they said they didn't have any of that info.   Not to mention that the battery is dead dead and the unit will not turn on even when plugged in. I can't access any of my files.   What a crock. I think I will buy something from someone who cares next time. Buyer beware.

I found none...until One day my archos's battery died completely...I even tried another spare power cable then...it just never came back on...so I sent in my player to archos support not too long ago...and hopefully they've fixed all the problems with it...   Other than the battery problem...the player was the best electronical deveice I owned...I had over 100 videos on there and 3 thousand songs...it pretty much consumed my life...

<Title>Perfectly fits my needs
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this a couple of months ago and love it. It is well made and the attention to detail that went into everything from the products design to the little things such as giving you batteries for the included remote control really sum up the feel of the product. It is well done. The video compression on the fly for recording off a VCR works great. The ability to pop in movies that one rips off a DVD and then recompress and play works well.   It holds my music, my videos. It's a super fast hard drive.  I purchased it after seeing a friend who had another archos product with a smaller screen. This one is perfect. The screen is just the right size.  Thanks Archos! And good purchasing.  Tips:  -If your on Windows, get the newest copy of VirtualDub and the DivX codec to really make your movies fly. You can use it to recompress DVDs and captured video (if you have the time)  -If your on a Mac, get Handbrake  -If your going to be displaying video on a TV that your capturing, tweak the contrast and saturation levels as well as the audio levels while viewing the "TV out" of the Archos, that way you know what your getting!  Enjoy!

<Title>Don't try to watch on a big screen!
<Date>Sat Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got rid of this after a few months of recording DVDs. I had hoped to replace my DVD with this digital storage, just like I did my CDs. But the resolution on the Archos is so poor (even when you set it to record on its highest resolution, which eats up considerably more storage space)that it broke down into pixels on my 27 inch LCD TV. It works great if all you intend to do is watch it on the Archos player or a tiny TV screen. I guess I should have expected this since the Archos only record thru analog. I also found the recording process very tedious. It is a simple matter of hooking it up to the DVD player and recording, but you have to wait through the 2 plus hour DVD to turn the unit off. You can set it to turn off automatically after a set amount of time, but that dead space at the end of the DVD recording while the machine waits to turn off also eats up your storage space. Overall, a great idea whose time has yet to come for replacing my DVD collection.

<Title>Quite complaining ...
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When reading these reviews, be careful.  There are a lot of people out there complaing that this device wasn't able to replace an entire DVD collection, or that the video isn't high enough quality to play on a TV.  Quit your complaining!  This device is to be used to store and play video ON THE DEVICE.    The product description never states that you can use this device to replace your DVD library, or that you'll be able to hook it up in a movie theater and watch a movie on a 30x50-foot screen.    This device was made to do what it says ... to store and play back movies ON THE DEVICE.  Now, for the actual product.  Yes, you can record video directly on the device.  Granted, if you hook this thing up to a VHS player, or even a DVD player, you are actually encoding analog-quality material.  Yes, I will repeat myself, even if you hook up a DVD player, it will not be digital quality.  If you want true digital quality, encode your DVD with your computer, and transfer the file to the Archos!  You'll get better quality video and audio without sacraficing hard drive space.  If you plan on hooking this thing up to a 31" television, expect loss of video quality!  It's a no brainer!  Same thing happens if you take a small .gif file off the internet and try to print an 11x14 out of it.  It get's pixelated.  If you're looking for a good, solid and reliable device to replace your clunky "portable" DVD player, then this is the device for you.  Granted, you have to encode your collection and load it on to the device before leaving home, but that's the price you pay for the convenience of not having to lug around your DVD library.    Is the interface as thought out as an iPod?  Definitely not.  But let's face it, Archos is NOT Apple.  Apple does what it does very well.  That's why the iPod is so popular.    Look, the bottom line is, this device does what it says it does.  It stores video, music and photos, and plays them back.  If your looking for something solely to replace your DVD library, buy an AppleTV.  If your looking for something that plays music, then buy an iPod.  If you want something to store photos, buy a friggin photo album.  If you want to schedule and record TV, buy a DVD recorder or a Tivo.  This device does three main things (Movies, pictures, music), and it does so pretty decently.  Don't buy this if your expectations are too high.  If you are buying this in hopes to replace your iPod, tablet DVD player, digital picture frame, Tivo, microwave oven, 50" plasma TV, sister-in-law, etc., then you're setting yourself up for a huge disappointment.  Buy this device, toss on it a few movies, songs and family pictures, and take that vacation you've always wanted.  At least this way you'll have some entertainment to pass the time during your trip.

<Content>If you are thinking on having this state of the art unit, DON'T:  JUST BUY IT!!! I got one today, overnight delivery. It was not on Amazon.com, and I still don't know how this other serious company got it, but it did arrive. It's so NEAT, so detailed, so usefull. I feel stupid having invested on my PSP just to play movies. That piece of machine is fantastic. Big screen (almost the size of the unit itself.. it was about time); Say goodbye to your Ipods, unless they invest MUCH MUCH better on movies. Say goodbye to everytghing that this unit can replace. It's 100 Gigabytes, it can work as a hard drive. The best is to record from tv, video, dvd, satelite, etc.; Than you can watch on very flexible formats (almost flexible) on the big screen (well, HUGE for a portable device); And  you can just link a simple cable and watch in dvd quality on any tv. It's changing my life. I will have free weekends, being able to travel outside my home and still watch and not cumulate all my recorded series. I LOVE THIS UNIT AND I THANK ARCHOS for his fantastic well treatment on details on this one. It's also very beautifull. No, I don't work to Archos and I plays full price for having it before anybody else (well, not too much, about 40 dollars more than in Amazon, my preferred provider of gadgets. Sami Paskin [...]

<Title>Love my AV700
<Date>Sun Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my AV700 two days ago.  I've already transferred ~25G of video to it, effortlessly!    I travel a lot and have been completely enamored of my Panasonic LV95 DVD player with its 9 inch screen.  The Archos has a 7" screen, and the resolution is a little lower, but the idea that I can ditch the DVDs and just carry this tiny little toy with me does it for me!  I was so excited to receive this -- I pre-ordered it weeks ago.  The only drawback is that an extra battery would be handy for those long flights (and I already ordered one), since there is not yet an airline adaptor available. Also, an extra power adaptor is handy too.  Both these things are available from Archos -- just not on Amazon yet.

<Title>A hands-on review.
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the chance to play with the AV 700 100GB unit for about three weeks now. Here is my overview.  The good:  - The biggest display on a PMP of its kind out there. It's almost as large as the unit! - Can record in real time from DVD, VCR, Camcorder, Cable/Sat and other video devices with RCA (composite) or S-Video outputs. Much faster than DVD rippers I've tried. - Allows for limited editing (cropping) of recorded movies. Lets say you want to cut out commercials or the end credits of the DVD you just recorded- you can do this very easily. - Allows for selection of both video resolution (from 500 - 2500 kbits/s), format (4:3, 5:3, 16:9, 2.35:1) and audio frequency (32 or 44KHz) for recording. - Can time record (through a very nice scheduler) - you can use it almost like a TiVo! - Can organize movies by name and under various directories (or categories.) - Has an audio recorder to allow music (or whatever audio) from an external device with selectable frequency (24 -48 KHz). This is higher than your standard CD quality. - Has a photo viewer. - Can be setup as a USB disk drive or a Windows Mobile Media device (it claims to work only under WinXP with service pack 1 or higher - I've been unable to get this to work as of yet.) - USB 2.0 protocol. It's so fast I can actually play recorded movies from the device on my laptop in real time! - 100 GB Drive! Can't get much better than this. - Comes with a remote control, docking station (well, kind of) and all the cables for connection to your PC, camera, TV, DVD, VCR, etc. The remote is universal and allows you to select your device (i.e. cable box, TV, etc.) - Very easy to upgrade the firmware. I recommend doing this if you have an older version. - Removable battery. - And many other nice features.  The not so good:  - Display resolution and quality could have been a lot better. - Battery doesn't last nearly as long as it is claimed on the spec. sheet. - The recorded movies are not "near" DVD quality when played on a TV. This is a bit misleading. - The unit runs hot - extremely hot when plugged into the power supply. - The stand is a nice thought but not very stable or functional. - The most un-intuitive user interface I've ever used! The firmware upgrade made this a bit more tolerable. - Built-in speakers are very poor in quality. But it sounds good with high quality headphones. - Can't play protected movies (Macrovision) on TV. Only on the device. I guess I can understand adhering to the copyright laws. - Will only play AVI formatted videos encoded in XviD or DivX MPEG-4 codec. But it comes with a PC based MPEG-1 translator which uses VitualDub as its conversion engine. I've tried this and it worked well.  - Won't work with the AAC (Apple) audio format. My iPod is not getting retired any time soon but, if you use Windows Media format (wma), WAV or MP3 for your music, then you're good to go. - Archos' VERY unfriendly customer service.  The nice to haves:  - Even with a 100GB drive, it could still use a SD or CompactFlash socket (for PC-less transfer of data, if nothing else.) But I was able to connect a USB thumb drive with the aid of an included adapter and transferred files back and forth. - A "display only mode" for connecting a PS2 or XBOX on the road with full screen view. Maybe on a future release of the firmware? - You can play games on the AV700? What games?  I had to replace the unit I originally bought. It suffered from very annoying vertical scrolling lines that I could not get rid of with the built-in "LCD Stability" function or otherwise. This is when I had the displeasure of dealing with the Archos' unfriendly (and I must say rude) technical service rep. Without asking me any questions specific to my problem, she proceeded to tell me that the unit must have been dropped. To add insult to injury, she told me it would cost me $150 for an out-of-warranty repair and that was the end of it! But she suggested I go back to the store that I purchased the unit and see if they would replace it. I'm happy to say the store did replace my unit graciously and my second unit does not have the same problem. Also, I think there maybe an electrical ground problem with the unit but, I have to investigate this a bit further.  Overall, the AV700 is a nice concept and a great device but, it is in its infancy. I've been able to record DVDs with relative ease where it was a major task before. Now I can stop spending hours ripping DVDs to play on my iPaq! Next, I'm converting all my old home videos from VHS and then transferring them on to DVDs. In my opinion, the AV 700 is much more than just a replacement for a personal DVD or music player. I think Archos should continue to improve on the features and the overall quality of this product which promises to be one of the great personal media devices out there.

<Content>I own the Archos AV400 and owned the model before it, so I expected the Archos AV700 to be a step up. It's a step backwards. It records, then during playback distorts the image. It looks foggy and grainy with lines. When I called Archos, I was told that there are no settings to adjust to improve the image. Needless to say I returned it 4 hours after buying it.  Archos should not be in such a rush to be pioneers (7" screen) that they release products before they are perfected.

<Title>Digtal Media Heaven
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing is digital entertainment bliss. The av700 does have a few draw backs however. Most of which have already been mentioned in previous reviews so I'll keep them brief.   The most annoying thing for me has been how the av700 automatically splits video files that reach a capacity of 2GB when recording video. I'd prefer to have each recording consolidated into one file.  Poor speaker quality and the inability to read word and pdf files is also annoying. It's claim to record "dvd" quality video is definitely a stretch. I have to admit though, it's close.  I've had the experience of dealing with Archos customer service 3 times so far. So far (fingers crossed), they've been fine for me. They even called me out of the blue to let me know they were upgrading both of my batteries with no prior complaint on my end. That was a nice surprise.  If you're like me, the reason the av700 is so attractive is for the idea of having a digitial media library. The av700 has limitations here. 100 GB is a nice sized hard drive. However, if you have a collection of say 300 or more dvd's. Your hard drive will be full in no time. Luckily, the av700 makes it possible to connect an external hard drive. Also, the av700 respects Macrovision so if you want to record (with av700) and playback (most) Hollywood movies through your TV, good luck.  I've found a few aftermarket products to be extremely useful in assisting me to help make my av700 a dream digital library.  1. Netflix 2. Sima CT-200 GO DVD (Macrovision Scrambler) 3. Lacie - Brick Desk Top 500GB  There a few limitations, but for the most part, the AV700 steps up every aspect of portable digital media.
