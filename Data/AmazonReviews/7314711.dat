<Title>fun features, but not reliable
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I loved the write-up on this  item...especially compared to the ipod Shuffle (which I have). But there are so many times I can't get the darn thing to start!  My ipod always starts and runs for a long time.  The battery on this one doesn't last very long at all.  Maybe I got a lemon?...not sure.

<Title>Mine was defective.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Even though my Sansa Clip ended up being defective (worked fine for a few days, then wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple hours and then it just stopped working completely after only a couple weeks), I'm still giving it 4 stars.  I'm just baffled by the sound that this puppy puts out.  "Awesome" is the only way to put it!  Pros: 1.  Compact size 2.  AWESOME sound 3.  I love having the radio option 4.  Holds a lot of songs 5.  The price is great 6.  I love the whole look/design of it. 7.  Easy to operate  Cons: 1.  The earphones (I should note that the previous review calling them "Earbuds" could be misleading, they are not actually Earbud brand, just the "generic" ones you get with pretty much everything)  2.  The rechargeable battery cannot be replaced so, down the road, once it dies, it's done. 3.  USB charging... I'm not a fan of this idea in general 4.  Instructions included only covered the very basics.  Would have liked the actual manual that you can find on SanDisk's site. 5.  The clip isn't strong enough to use during vigorous exercise without it falling off.  I end up just putting it in my pocket, if I have one.  Despite the cons, I love this thing!  Here's to hoping that my replacement won't turn out to be defective as well.

<Title>Good Little MP3
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a good MP3 for the cost. The size and the clip make it super convenient, especially when I exercise at the gym. It holds about 20 to 25 albums worth of music and the sound is decent. The only issue I have with it is the size of the scroll pad. If I want to fast forward through parts of a podcast, the button is small and tends to slip so I end up attempting a few times. Overall, it's very nifty!

<Title>Once I got it going, prefer it to Shuffle
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had a hard time getting my PC to recognize and install this device as it came out of the box. Found a forum, figured out how to force into a mode so I could do a firmware update and got it going. I really like it now! I have a 2nd gen iPod shuffle as well...I like this one better. Easier to update (now) and the little display is very handy.

<Content>I bought this MP3 for myself so that I could listen to books while I work out.  It is excellent.  Just clip it onto your clothes or place in your pocket.  Also it is easy to use.  I loved it so much I bought one for my partner for her birthday. She loves it!

<Title>Tiny but mighty
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this little MP3 player. It is compact and easy to use and the sound is great.  Downside the battery cannot be replaced so when it dies you have to purchase a new player. The clip is fragile plastic and I expect it will not last very long but the player is so light it can actually dangle from the earbuds.

<Title>A great start on a promising product
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Sansa Clip 2Gb unit is a very good alternative to the popular iPod devices.  It is particularly good for joggers due to it's small size and the securing clip feature.  I actually have two units, one is 1Gb and the other 2Gb.  They integrate nicely with the Windows (XP or Vista) environment.  The sound quality is excellent when used with good quality ear buds or high-quality earphones (I have tested both).  The downside is the ear buds provided with the unit are not the best quality, but better quality ear buds are readily available at low cost.  The "quick start" quide provided with the unit has minimal information, and does not clearly point out that a full user manual is available at the manufacturer's Web site.  I discovered this later independently.  One positive here is that once you access that web site and install the microcode update software, the rest then becomes automatic and simple (but the enclosed documentation when you first get the unit is not very clear about this).  My main requests for improvement would include improving the original quick start documentation to make sure the user understands that the best way to proceed is to go to the company web site first.  My second request would be to provide this package size with much higher memory size, I would say at least 8Gb.  I love the small size of the unit since I play only music, not videos, which I think are not worthy of watching on a small screen.  By next year I think we can hope memory costs will be low enough to make this happen.

<Title>Ipod shuffle killer
<Date>Tue Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love my 2 year old 5th generation ipod (video) but it's kind of big and heavy and expensive to use at work or when exercising. So i've been in the market for something small, cheap and light. I considered an ipod shuffle, but then i read about this thing. A quick comparison: Shuffle has 1 gig storage, no screen, has a clip, is available in pastel colors, is very tiny and light and currently costs 80 USD. This model sansa clip has 2 gig storage, a bright color-on-black screen, a clip, is available in bold colors, is slightly larger and heavier and currently costs 60 USD. I like apple but you can't deny the bargain this Sansa thing represents. As for the Sansa itself: I think the sound is very nice once you get rid of the pack-in headphones (are those things EVER with any mp3 player you buy). The color is a snazzy metallic red with blue light-up highlights. It seems pretty sturdy (but would probably be destroyed instantly if you stepped on it). It holds a charge for more than 10 hours even with constant browsing.  Goes very loud. I just drag and drop files into it with windows 2000. One Con is the non-removable battery but at 60 bucks this thing is almost in the realm of being disposable. By the time the battery stops doing it's thing, something better will be available at this price. Or something comperable for much less. Overall I highly recommend it.

<Title>The Sansa Clip,A good looking & even a better sounding MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you're looking for a great sounding & nice looking MP3 player at a good price, this is the one you should buy, and the" OLED" screen is great & easy to see. The clip makes it easy to put any were, I use mine in the car with a cassette adapter & I clip it to my sun visor & it plays all day, the only draw back is the ear buds that come with the player, so you mite want to buy a better pair on down the road.

<Title>I just love my Sansa Clip!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When my 4-yr-old Ipod Mini's battery died, I found it would cost me big bucks to have it replaced. I looked around Amazon for reviews of cheaper MP3 players.  OK, I have to admit that I liked the red color and cute mini-Ipod look of the Sansa Clip. But the reviews were good, and the cost significantly less than just replacing the battery of the defunct Ipod. So... I bit and ordered.  I have been using it daily for going on 2 months now, and think it was a great buy. It set up and interfaces easily with Windows Media Player. It is small and lightweight and tucks easily into a pocket, or clips to a collar, lapel, etc. I've dropped it a time or two, with no effect, so appears to be pretty sturdy. The 2 GB is less than my Ipod, but I just synch often to change things around. I have to anyway to keep up with podcasts. The sound is great, with plenty of volume. The battery charge lasts for a looooong time.  The only thing I miss is that with the Sansa Clip you cannot back up incrementally within a track, as you can with an Ipod (albeit not that easily sometimes). So if that is a must, you'll want to try something else. But that has not been a big problem at all, not worth paying an additional $100-$150 for.  Oh yeah, it is even cuter than it looks in the picture, with a very easily readable, crisp color display that is super-easy to navigate.

<Title>Sansa clip, cute and stylish.
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XQRAI6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-7335390-7913463">SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Red)</a>  Since this is my first mp3 player, I have nothing to compare it to.  So far I have one problem, and that is the unit won't hold a charge only for a short period. I read this complaint in the review section before I purchased it, but I figured the but buyer just got a defective unit. I was on song 12 and all of sudden, the player just cut off and message came up battery low. I don't know if this is a defect, or will I have to charge this player every other hour. I don't think so. Also, headphones are sort of bulky and a little large for my ears, but they can be replaced. Since the player really sound good, looks great, and have a bunch of neat feature, I'm going to return it and get another one and see how the replacement work.  Other than the charge not holding, it's really a nice little player with great sound.  Personally, if the battery life improves, I would definitely recommend keep it.
