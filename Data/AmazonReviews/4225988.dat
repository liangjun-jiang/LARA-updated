<Title>A top MP3 player for the money

<Content>I use the Organix for music record/play as well as for data transfer/storage and a voice recorder. The radio features are incredible: station search is very important to me as I travel a lot and need to locate the strongest station in each location. Also 16 presets are just as important to me at home (although I use just 9 at present).  Once at home, connected to the PC, I found that Windows XP manipulates the files quite easily. I transfer files to and from the PC without any difficulty.  The music library is very effective. It's easy to locate a song by artist/album (if you care to take the trouble of putting it in). I find the equalizer settings to be very useful - I use the `classical' and `jazz' settings most of the time. Just as important is the Sennheiser headset that came with the unit. Its quality is superb. Being a classical music fan I find it a great contribution. I don't have much use for the 2 headphone jacks but my children think it's cool.  The rechargeable battery provides over 22 hours of play on a single charge (it is claimed to provide 25 but I haven't tried that yet) and charging it via the USB port is quite simple.  I found the manual quite helpful. On one occasion I needed additional information so I contacted the company US office (Trekstor is a German company) and found them just as helpful.

<Title>I've been overall pleased with this player

<Content>I'm overall happy with this MP3 player - it has all the features I wan't.  Before this I had a creative labs Zen Nano which I've replaced multiple times 'till it was out of waranty.  I like the TrekStori.Beat Organix FM because it recharges, has a playlist feature, a bigger brighter display, and most importantly seems to be more rugged.  I'm rough on my players and it still works after 6 weeks.  The (minor) drawbacks: it takes reading the manual to figure out the interface; lot's of info on the main display which is difficult to read (other than the title and artist information which is readable).

<Title>Would be good if it lasted more than 3 weeks

<Content>Well when I first received this product, it was just fine, it worked properly and was easy enough to use. After about a week, I noticed that the display had stopped using certain letters of the alphabet. While this was somewhat annoying, (listening to the Velvet   nder round and such) the unit still worked fine. Over the next two weeks more letters began disappearing and then the unit just died. It came back briefly when I hit the reset button, but that was only a temporary fix. I returned it and purchased a Sandisk Sansa 8gb player and it has been problem free.
