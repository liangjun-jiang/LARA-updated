<Title>New Sony MS-11:  sleek but restrictive
<Date>Sat Jun 01 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Purchased Sony's new MS-11 but returned it the same day (and purchased Samsung YP700).  Despite it's steep price...it is indeed great looking, functional but has one large flaw -- Sony's music management system is too restrictive (explained below).<p>Before I purchased the MS-11, its product specs read 'plays back in ATRAC and supports MP3'.  This means that if you have MP3 songs that you have converted or downloaded free from the internet onto your computer, you cannot merely 'copy' them onto the Sony MagicGate memory stick ("MS"), but rather must convert the MP3 song file into Sony's ATRAC format.  Once converted, Sony's music management system tracks how many instances of a song has been 'checked' out of your computer (that you connect the MP3 player to) and limits the number of times you can 'checkout' a song.  Also, Sony recommends that 'checked out' songs are then 'checked back in' (as opposed to merely deleting the song from MS if you no longer want it) -- what a hassle! <p>Bottom line is that Sony (as a music company) wants to (over) protect music intellectual property which means a hindrance to users.  <p>I would recommend other brands, such as Samsung YP700 (which is 128MB built-in and you can add 128MB memory chip), as opposed to Sony MS-11 which has no built-in memory but does come with 128MB MS.  The Samsung looks great, works great (blue LCD lighting with remote control) and is cheaper at [lower price] -- and importantly, you can simply copy/delete downloaded MP3 files onto the player without dealing with a 'check-in/check-out' music filing system.

<Title>All you would expect from Sony and then some
<Date>Sat Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I have always bought Sony electronics because they are the best made and most reliable. Unfortunatley I bought a Rio MP3 player before I upgraded to the Sony MS11. First the sound quality is so good you would think you are listening to a CD. The jukebox software that is included makes transfering songs from the net or a CD to the walkman a breeze. It weighs nothing so it is very easy for me to go to the gym and not worry about it getting in the way. You won't be disappointed with this product ( except when you see the price ).

<Title>Top notch technology from Sony
<Date>Sun Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Slick and extremely compact, this MP3 player has everything you need and nothing you don't.<br>Song transfers are fast via USB, quite easy to perform with OpenMG. Personnally i don't really mind the copyright issue.<p>This awesome piece of technology sits in the palm of your hand and is extremely user friendly, battery life is an incredible 10 hours! and 128 MB is enough for about 35 songs at 132 kbps.<p>Bottow line; <br>Sony technology at it's best. Two thumbs up!

<Content>The Sony digital Walkman MP-3 player is terrific.  The only thing that is needed is some type of carrier so that you can run or jog with it, and not have to carry it in your hand.  It is a thousand times better than a portable CD player or cassette player.

<Title>Pretty Good
<Date>Thu Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>If your looking to buy this music player then a here are a few things you need to know.<p>1. transfer times are a little bit slow.  cause you have to convert your mp3 into atrac an then it transfers.  the transfer from your computer is fast but the converson is not.<p>2. i had problems with the software, i called sony to get it corrected but the phone rep couldnt help and told me that someone higher would call the next day, but no one did, instead i got an email asking me what the problem was ( i didnt like that cause it take more time to do it through email)  my problem was that the software open mg caused an error and terminated in win xp.  I figured that my ms outlook was messing it up and delete outlook and every since open mg has worked fine.<p>3. the whole check in/ check out system [stinks].  Im fine with the whole check out thing but the fact that i have to check the song back in to avoid not being able to check the song out next time is absurd (actually you have 4 check outs with out check in before it does that).  i know the system is to prevent ppl from sharing songs but why would it matter if you check it in or not cause you cannot put the song on another computer anyways. for one it wont let you, two its in atrac. for me after i dont want a song on it i jsut delete it, and i recently read taht you need to check it in so im a bit peaved.<p>4.small things i dont like is that the battery indicator is inconsistent. its not a big deal or anything but i jsut never know when my batter is almost dead.  what happens is that after you charge the bat. and put it in the indicator quickly drops to 3 bars (4 being full) then after and hour or 2, it drops to 1 bar then lasts for a while on one bar.  it may not even matter to you but its sorta does for me.  <p>so the decision you have to make is is the look worth the hassle?, is the price worth the hassle?, and is sony worth the hassle?<p>i know ive said alot of problems ive had with it but i still like the player it is incredibly small and looks great.  It is light and does the job that i bought it for.  overall i am happy with my nw-ms11, but then again i got it as a birthday present and didnt shell out [price] for it.

<Title>Great, but with one or two prblems
<Date>Thu Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This product is easy to use and sounds really good. It's the best on short flights or excercising, but the battery doesnt always charge when left in the charger overnight. There is no light on the charger to tell if it charging... Sometimes I will leave it in the charger all night and in the morning 50/50 chance its charged.... Also the fact I have to use Sony's software to load songs on id kind of a pain as it isnt that well thought out...

<Title>The Betamax of MP3 players has rubbish software
<Date>Mon Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>The software that accompanies this device lets it down...  <p>* The tracks you save are stored in a hidden database on your PC so you cannot treat them as you would normal files.<br>* If you ever decide to use a different brand of player you will not be able to move your songs from the database.<br>* If you try and import a second CD the software assumes the new cd has the same number of tracks as the previous one, this means you have to restart the software regularly.<br>* The software is generally slow to respond to button clicks which makes it feel clumsy.<p>The player itself is great but suffers from the following problems...<p>* Files cannot be copied directly to the player using file manager.<br>* You cannot play MP3s only ATRAC files, which you havn't heard of because nobody else uses them.<p>If you don't mind the prospect of rebuilding your 'ATRAC' collection when you decide to buy real MP3 player or you want to remain loyal to sony for the rest of your life then buy this player.

<Title>Depends on what you're looking for..
<Date>Fri Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>This is a fantastic product -- but it's not for everyone.  <p>If you're a big MP3 fan and have hundreds (or thousands) of MP3s, then this may not be for you.  While Sony says that you can play WMA and MP3 files on this 'Walkman', you really have to convert it to ATRAC format using their software, first.  If you don't mind converting to ATRAC from MP3 (the quality is similar, if not better), then this will work -- but chances are you probably don't want to go through that process.<p>However, if you're looking for a small, sleek, portable player that you can load several of your CDs to: this is the product for you.  Pop a CD into your computer, tell the softeare to convert it, and then just choose what songs you want on the Walkman.<p>The sound quality is great, and the physical product is top of the line.  The software could use a little work, but for the most part is solid (I wouldn't want to run it on an outdated computer, though).

<Content>People should boycot this product because Sony is trying to impose its digital rights management on all of the users.  The device requires proprietary software that includes features to limit transferability of music.  Cut this short by buying a different MP3 player.

<Title>Sony-- still a good product
<Date>Sun Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this MP3 player after having owned three others.  Since I do a lot of outdoor activity, I wanted something easy to use, didn't eat up a million batteries, and was small.  Sony fit the bill.  I was initially concerned about the price, but it is true, you get what you pay for. No regrets here. My son now takes it and puts his music on it.  I need to get another on for him.  My only complaint is that it is difficult sometimes to tell when the battery is getting low-- so now I just charge it every night.<br>I would recommend this to any serious MP3 user.

<Title>Great Product except for the batteries
<Date>Sat Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This has been a great mp3 player.  My only complaint is that the batteries die in about 2 days whether you use it or not.  This happens because if you throw it in you bag the button that turns it on is easily bumped (even in the case) and you end up with a dead battery.  Other than that it is a good product.

<Title>excellent
<Date>Sat Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This player is excellent, it is very small, and the sound quality is very good. Transferring songs is so simple and the battery life is suprisingly good as well, and because it comes with a charger and the battery is easily removed its easy. If you are looking for a player that will hold hundreds of songs this is not for you. With the 128 card i can get a maximum of 40 songs on the player. While this is dissapointing, the quality and the size make up for this inconvience.

<Content>I just got this baby today from Amazon Marget Place.  I fall in love with it right away.  The player is very small, very light,  really stylist, and sound great.  OpenMG Jukebox Software is very simple to manage.  Took me about 5 mins to learn how to import and transfer files.  Only drawback is the padded carrying case.  It seem to protect the player but you need to take player out to operate.  I think it would be nice if it has armband or belt clip.

<Title>Sleek gadget with a few lowdowns
<Date>Wed Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Sony's NW-MS11 is a very, very nice looking mp3 player. Actually, this device plays music in ATRAC format. Don't panic, in case you've never heard about ATRAC, it's just a different format for music compression, just like mp3. As a result, you have to convert all your music into ATRAC before being able to play it on the device. This task is EASILY done with software that's included with the mp3 player, so do not worry about it; it's a piece of cake.<p>In terms of quality, the NW-MS11 has the best I've ever heard on an mp3 player. Combined with high quality headphones/earphones, you're in heaven. The device also comes with a pair of earphones, which I'd rate a 3 in a 1-5 scale, in terms of quality. It'll do though, but if you have the cash, get yourself some better quality earphones or headphones.<p>When I bought this product, it came with a 128 MB memory stick, meaning that you could only place up to 128 MB of music. There is no time restriction in case you were wondering - as long as it doesn't take up the whole 128 MB, you could put in 500000 minutes of music on this thing. I recently discovered that Sony has released a 256 MB version of the memory stick, so if you plan to store a lot of music on the device, you better get that; I'm going to order it as soon as I can. But let's face it, 256 MB is just not enough memory for some of you people. Sony offers MD (mini-disk) players for prices even lower then the NW-MS11, which can hold MUCH more memory while keeping the same quality of music. You might want to consider getting that if you are planning on putting a lot of music on your walkman.<p>So you might ask, &quot;Why buy this when I can get the mini-disk players for the same price?&quot;. Well, I can easily answer that. The size of this device is just incredible. It's about 2 inches tall and half an inch wide. It has a nice LCD screen that is easily readable. Buttons are easily controlled. The rechargable battery which comes with the set, along with a battery recharger, can play about 3-5 hours of music. I recommend getting 2 so that when one runs out, you can recharge that one, and use the other one. Just remember to recharge the batteries BEFORE using it for the first time; if you fail to do so, it can ruin the battery. <p>This product is very high quality. If you're just planning on using it for morning jogs, and aren't planning on putting a whole lot of music on it (the 128 MB version can maybe hold 2-3 CD's worth of HIGH quality music depending on how many tracks used), then this is the device for you.

<Title>A Great MP3 Player But Not Everyone
<Date>Thu Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>First let me get this out of the way... if your not a Sony freak, you won't like this product. Sony employs its proprietary techonology in all of its products so unless you have other Sony products, your gonna find memory sticks expensive and the whole process annoying.<p>I have a Sony Vaio computer with memory stick reader as well as a Sony digital camera so when looking for an MP3 player, Sony seemed like the logical choice because they worked with memory sticks too. However, you MUST use Magicgate memory sticks with the player. Magicgate memory sticks will work with other Sony products but regular memory sticks will not work with the player.<p>The Magicgate memory sticks as well as the Sony Software is designed to protect copyrights. Sony is a music company also so they must balance their priorities. <p>The software is a bit cumbersome and almost unusable on slower computers but works will on newer models. You cannot simply copy the music from your folders to the memory stick... you must use the software's Check In-Check Out ability. That's cause the songs are read by the player as ATRAC3 files (Sony creation!).<p>There... I've given you all the problems you might face. I find this to be a great player, for me. I know some people will disagree. It's small, plays extremely well, i liked the headphones, and battery life is decent.

<Title>Startled at all the good reviews.
<Date>Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I am truely shocked at the good reviews for this product.  The things that are good are that it is a good petit size, excellent for someone like me who does not wanna hawl a bunch of cds around and a bulky cd player especially if you are gonna go to the gym and work out or what have you.  In its most compact format it holds about 50 songs depending on the lengths of songs and using its smallest format.  Othen than that everything else sucks.  The battery is a piece of crap.  It is a unique size which is not available in stores, so once it goes no matter what you are doing you cannot replace it with another, you have to wait until you get home to recharge it again.  Since I had it I have returned to to Sony 2 times mostly casue the battery does not work right.  It clearly says in the book to charge it 7 hours which i do and after a while it starts to decrease in energy.  It has been a bad experience sending out the product to sony and waiting for them to return it and what have you.  It has an indicator to tell you the life of the battery, mine always is blinking meaning it is low even though i just charged it.  ALso it NEVER indicates the battery is full and if it does it last one song.  I mean I spend 300 bucks i expect a product that works right.  Not this crap.  I mean i am always  having issues with the battery BOTH the ones i have.  Casue i bought an extra one on the side per Sonys request.... whatever.  If you wanna hear the first song it is ok, but lets say you wanna hear song number 49 on your player well as you search through all the songs clicking to number 49 there goes the battery and shuts off.  It is rediculous at least if you could pop a double a battery in there it wold be ok but you can not do that.  So trust me the size is great but not practical, especially for this money.

<Content>I love Sony..I even loved this Sony,,,unfortunately all the stories are true. I only gave it one star beacuse it is small and fairly well designed. For $270.00 you should get something more than software hassles because of all this protection b/s, something that works with ME when it is advertsied to work with ME, and a battery and charger that actaully works. The hassles with the software and the battery are all true. This is a lot of money, I am shocked Sony just basically leaves it to the user to resolve or live with the problems. [&quot;buy an extra battery&quot;..after waiting on hold for an hour...'cause mine doesn't work correctly????..what a load of baloney!!!!!!]. Here is the topper..buy a song off Real's site after downloading Real which supports this unit because Sony's software is so bad it never works correctly and has little functionality [same Sony camera-same problem...hmmmmm]then find out that the format they sell you the song in is not supported by the player in spite of the fact that they support this specific player with their software....the double helix ram balonay format is not supported by the player. The inconsideration and lack of customer comittment is unblievable to me. I am done with Sony [Get a Canon or Nikon camera and an Ipod...and I am done with Real]

<Title>A bit fragile for everyday use, joggers/gymers should pass.
<Date>Sun Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Well I want to say Sony has some good points for this device and then Sony has some action items they need to work on. First off price is a concern (I think Sony is asking too much) for me becasue MP3s and multi format devices can be really cheap, so why would Sony charge more? Is it worth it? Well I suppose all the features, support, and life of the device would tell you that. JOGGERS/GYM/ACTIVE ONES - I found this device to have a below average build and durability. The reason I say this is because I take pretty good care not to be too hard, but you know you have to recharge the battery and swap cards. Well the battery door plastic clasp broke which holds the battery in the device. This happend 3 months out of warranty, Sony wanted $59.95 for repair (not with parts). So you could maybe buy another player for that cost. Mind you I was not throwing this around, dropping it, I was pretty careful, so this just came from everyday wear and tear. I use tape now to keep the battery door closed which doesn't always work and makes the player stop working. Yes I admit you see Sony and think OH I feel safe with their quality, support, etc. but I shall warn you that this device is not very durable. Yes you are getting a slew of features and formats, but be sure you realize you need to factor you are risking this breaking after a few months use I would say.

<Content>I recieved this MP3 player as a gift 2 years ago. Over the last two years I have used this almost daily for training runs and numerous half marathons. While I do love this proiduct, ever electronic device has its quirks. From day one I had problems with the recharger. As you can imaging after 2 years of use there is also some wear and tear. I have used it so much that the battery closure no longer closes tight enough to run the player. I can overcome this by keeping it closed with a rubber band. I would purchase this player again, infact I may buy another one to replace the one I have worn out.
