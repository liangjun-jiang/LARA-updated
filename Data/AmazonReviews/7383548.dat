<Content>The Toshiba Gigabeat 10GB is an excellent value.  It took a while to get used to the navigation system, but I now find it easy to use.  Accessories are not as easy to find as for some other brands, but I have managed to acquire the important basics such as a car charger and travel charger. I am overall very satisfied with the purchase and would again choose it over other options.

<Content>I love this mp3 player because it's a great value.  It costs much less than an Ipod, and I think it works very well.  Using it takes a little getting used to, but no more than other products.

<Content>This player has been basiclly pretty good for me. If you plan to download off of CD's it's apiece of cake, but downloading off the net is difficult and dissapointing. This is not all the fault of the player, but partly why ipod has had more success. The photo viewer is nice, but it takes photos off the computer with out asking and I have yet to be able to figure out how to delete them. All in all the player is good bang for the buck.
