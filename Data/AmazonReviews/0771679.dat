<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am pleased with my purchase.  I listen mainly to XM music so it doesn't matter that its not live.  I plug it in at night to recharge and record and I take it to work in the morning and play it through the radio there with and fm transmitter.  I can get all the latest music downloaded.  The charge is great and the memory is great.  Its very easy to use.

<Title>Great For XM kinda Okay for MP3
<Date>Tue Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When i first got this device it was okay with it i liked that it can record XM which i find really awesome. But if you are a Subscription music fan (napster,Yahoo places like that) then here is the down side to this product. If this product supported subscription based music it would of gotten all 5 stars but it got a 4 but overall Sound Quality is great menues are great battery life is awesome memory is awesome but the MP3 with subscription music *point fingers down* not good. Hopes that Samsung will release a Firmware update to support Subscription music cause i don't wanna wait for a song that i want to listen to play on XM so that i can record it so 4 Stars!

<Content>This portable XM radio/25 hours of saved music, etc. is great.  I listen to 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's music during the day.  My husband listens to his baseball games at night.  If you also get the car kit, you can use it in your car.  [...]  It is worth it! [...]

<Title>Annoying automatic cutoff pause between every XM song in playback!
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player has what to me is a fatal flaw: when playing back recorded XM content, the player creates an automatic couple of seconds of silence between every song. This break is even more annoying because it seems to not be an inserted space (a couple of seconds of dead air if you will) added between tracks, but rather is done ON TOP of the recording. In other words, the last few notes of every single song and the first few notes of the next song get cut off always. This is more jarring than you would imagine, especially since like most radio stations, XM's songs play back-to-back (ie: the next song is played on the station as the previous song fades away). This is the normal continuous music mix we expect from normal radio listening but the player adds a very noticeable break that cuts off the songs on both ends. This is actually even worse a problem during spoken moments like the station IDs or announcements. In other words, instead of hearing "This is Fred on 44", the player will instead play "is is Fred on fo" cutting off the message. Another example is instead of playing the well-known jingle "American Top 40 with Casey Kasem", you only hear "rican Top 40 with Casey K". It is just ridiculous and ruins the entire listening experience. There seems to be no way around this flaw either. It might be less of a problem for listeners of classical or other programming that normally has silence in between each song, but for those who listen to pop or rock or dance radio, this is really terrible, as bad as if a DJ totally messes up the transition between songs on the dancefloor- what we like to call a "trainwreck" of music.

<Title>Review of Nexus 25 XM Ready Radio
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an excellent product and provides perfect receiption. HOWEVER - I did not learn until I received the product that it required the receiver be placed in a south-facing window in order to pick up the satellite's signal.  There is a 25 foot cord provided to reach into another room but that could be very inconveneint.

<Content>It's okay, but I didn't like having to record songs for playback. I really wanted to be mobile and still have the live radio.

<Title>Good value for the money
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>A lot of people don't realize that this really does work as a stand-alone MP3 player.  I have never had XM radio, and don't yet plan on paying for it, but I have the memory completely filled up with all my favorite songs and use it all the time.  Very easy to figure out how to work all the options (I have yet to be able to figure out how to use my husband's ipod). One note - if you're not using it for XM radio don't bother with the installation disk.  I have never used it - I just plug it into my computer through the USB where it becomes a new hard drive.  Then I just copy and paste my songs to it's assigned hard drive letter.  Tell the computer to safely remove that number, disconnect and your on your way. Now, I said good value for the money - I didn't pay anything for this, but i would say it is easily worth the equivalent 12 hour MP3 player.

<Title>Inexpensive and works.
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This receiver was dirt cheap for my 3rd xm radio, mounted it on my motorcyle using ram mounts. Worked flawlessly on my last trip of 1800 miles. I have a Delphi and Pioneer so I find the needed passport module a little odd in that it creates xtra bulk when mounting in vehicles. One reviewer wrote that the nexus cuts off songs you have recorded, leaving space between songs, this is very true and somewhat annoying! But for the money I can live with it. Car kits are expensive so shop e-bay for deals!!

<Title>One thing to know before you buy......
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You must have a window that faces south in order to receive a signal. I live in an apartment that has windows only facing north and east and I can not get a signal and therefore this product is worthless to me. So check to make sure you have access to a south window or somewhere to mount the antenna to face south that also is not blocked by trees or tall structures.  Good Luck!

<Title>I'm really happy with this thing
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like it! This is my second XM radio. Thought I would share some thoughts about this gizmo. First became aware of this particular radio several weeks ago - saw an ad for one in the local newspaper (one of the big name department stores after-Christmas sales). Price was what initially caught my eye (about the same as what I paid here at Amazon). Almost didn't buy this as from what I read about it seemed to say that you had to sign up with Napster and XM. Turns out you don't have to sign up with Napster.  Highlights of my initial experiences so far:  What was in the `box': radio + battery, earbuds, dock/cradle unit, power transformer, XM antenna, remote control, soft plastic carrying case/holster, RCA audio cable, USB cable, and Instructions / software CD (Napster)  First thing I noticed was that the antenna / power transformer was the same as my existing XM radio (roady xt), so I quickly disconnected my one radio's cradle and hooked up this new one. Popped the battery into the radio and was good to go.  Setting up a second account on the XM site was a matter of a couple mouse clicks and in ten minutes the radio was active (course that cost another $100 or so).  Figuring out how to use the radio was a snap. Menu system is very intuitive. The remote for this unit is almost the exact copy of the one for my other radio - the old remote even worked with this new unit.  Now for what this gizmo does. Well for one it lets you listen to XM radio (duh), but it also lets you record XM radio. Think of this device as an audio VCR. When listening to the radio - you can record the song you are currently listening to simply by pressing the record button on the remote - the unit records just the one song and records the title / artist information too. You can also record the whole channel as well if you want - and each song recorded during that session is a separate item - each with it own title that you can scroll though. And like a VCR, you can set the unit to come on at a certain time / date and record a program / channel.  You can also load your own audio files (MP3s) - either via the Napster software or directly. Like a lot of MP3 players, when you hook the unit up to your computer via the USB cable - it appears as a drive. Just be aware that the unit comes with the memory partitioned into two separate areas - one for the XM content and one for music files (MP3s). The unit I bought was the 25 which has a total of 512MB of memory - out of the box this is split 50/50 with 256MB (half) available for MP3s, the other half holds about 12.5 hours of recorded XM content. You can reconfigure the percentages, and even make it 100% XM (for 25 hours of space for recorded content).  Disconnecting the player from the base disconnects it from the XM antenna - so you don't get to access `live' XM radio - just the stuff that you recorded and whatever MP3 files you have loaded. The player has its own rechargeable battery and I used mine today at work all day long and the battery indicator only dropped a little bit. Player charges while in the base.  All in all, I'm really happy with this thing.

<Title>Great little mp3/xm receiver/recorder for the money!
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he's been thrilled with it so far!  He'd asked for an mp3 player and I wanted to get him a good one, but when I started researching and discovered that he could have both an XM radio receiver for his car and an mp3 player, I was sold. NOTE: You  have to buy the car kit separately -- I got one through Amazon for $50.  I  was just about ready to purchase the Pioneer version, which was running about $180, when I found this one on sale for $40!  As noted in other reviews, recording from XM has some minor irritations, such as sometimes  getting the last few seconds of a previous song/interview before the thing you want to record and sometimes the last seconds of your song/interview get cut off, but hubby says the fact that you can start recording something up to 45 seconds after it starts and get the whole thing makes up for it.  Works great as an XM receiver and the FM modulator works well, too.  Remote buttons sometimes don't work and it has the annoying habit of turning on when you drop it in its cradle, but my husband has been happy with it overall.  Great 3-in-1 device for the price!
