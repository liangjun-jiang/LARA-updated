<Title>Not bad for the price
<Date>Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Coby for my husband for his birthday. He was using a CD player on his way to work and now he just uses the Coby. The instructions aren't the best but he has found his way around it and enjoys it quite a bit. He says the sound quality is good too! The only thing is that the batteries don't last too long. Other than that it is great for the price. I am thinking of purchasing one for myself too! It is so compact he just puts it in his coat pocket and forgets about it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a non-complicated mp3 player. It just serves its purpose which is to play your favorite songs on it.

<Title>A Great MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very happy with the decision I made in purchasing this product.  I was a little worried about it because it was a pretty cheap price and a brand I am not familiar with, but after recieving and using the MP3 player I am very happy I made the decision to purchase it.  It is very easy to use and the fact that you can download music onto it as well as it having a radio built it makes me happy.

<Content>it does not work. I spent 20 maybe 30 hours and no luck. the guy from costumer service had no idea either. If you pay $5 for this mp3 that is $5 too much.  The worst thing I've ever got

<Title>Perfect throw around mp3 player
<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would never want to spend $200+ on an mp3 player I'd just use for working out and get sweat all over. I used to have another version of this mp3 player that held less songs, but I wanted to hold a bit more on it. At most, it can hold around 160 songs and the sound quality is quite good. If you just need a low cost and high quality mp3 player that can handle being jossled around, this would be a good investment.

<Title>Horrible experience with this product and the Coby company
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently bought 4 of these mp3 players. I had bought one and thought it was pretty neat, so I bought three more (one for my wife and two as gifts). Within a couple of weeks, however, each one had started to malfunction in different ways. I was quite upset, so I returned them to Coby and requested a refund. The Coby company refused a refund, never sent any replacements, and the elusive person who was the only one who could authorize a refund was conveniently always "in a meeting" when I called. I am now out more than $120 dollars with no explanation or apology from the Coby company, much less a working mp3 player.  I would highly recommend NOT buying this product!!

<Title>Waste of money for me unfortunately
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just bought a COBY MP3 Player a few days ago. I had music on it, it played well and 3 days later it stopped working. The Battery was on right, I never dropped it and It was very well taken care of. Now all it does is flash. I tried to plug it into the USB to see if it would start to no avail. I am starting to think COBY is selling refurbished products on low priced ones. I don't think I'll waste my time buying another COBY Digital Audio Player MP3

<Content>So far, I love my COBY MP3 Player.  It doesn't hold as many song as it says that it can, but I have approximately 70 songs on mine right now.  It has a lot of neat features with it as well.  Highly recommend for the cheap price that it cost.

<Title>Can only fit 1/4 the amount of music as it says it can!
<Date>Tue Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I like it - it's simple and easy to use - but the memory is actually only 230,000 kilobyes, not 1 gigabyte as advertised. I can't imagine that the software that runs it takes up 75% of the available memory so basically this is false advertising. I'm going to take mine back and get one that can actually fit the amount of information it says it can.

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great mp3 player, very easy to use and even easier to load data and  or music tanks to the USB build in connection this will help because you don't have to worry about the connection cable, the headphones will help you to not to lose it, the only disadvantage is the way you have to search the music, song by song even more when you have more that 100 songs. But nonetheless is a great item. Got one for my self and one as gift.

<Title>Small yet functional
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my player through a promotion.  I already had an MP3 player in my Motorola phone, so I let this player sit for some time.  Then I saw how many songs it held and switched players.  Right now I have over 120 songs and still have room for a few more.    This player is quite easy to set up; no software is involved.  I plug it into a USB port with the included extender cable.  My computer picks it up as an external drive.  I can then go into it and delete or "drag and drop" songs.  I like the fact that it can read WMA's and not just MP3's and it's not picky about the bitrate.  Sometimes I let Windows Media Player syncronize with my favorite songs.  The reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 are: 1)The way it organizes music into folders (by artist, then album, then song - all of these folders have to be opened to delete a song) and 2)It takes a little while to learn the two controls.  But other than those everything has been great.  The sound is good and it requires only one battery.

<Title>Very Cool MP3
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This Coby mp3 has radio, 1G of space, and can plug in as a flash drive.  It looks great, and works great, and you can scroll to different songs, read them before playing (unlike the ipods where there is no screen to see the names of the songs before you play them) - there are lots of colors on the screen, and watch out for the counterfit players - look very much alike, but no FM on them - they are being marketed under the same name and title as the real Coby on Amazon, by some seller that's charging cheaper.

<Title>Good for the money
<Date>Tue Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the size and shape of this little player.  I was a little disappointed with the navigation - no play lists, difficult to order songs, and when it restarts, it starts over at song 1.  I do have almost 200 songs loaded on this little gadget!  The earphones were not comfortable, and were too short to wear and be able to put the player in a pocket, and while you should be able to hang it around your neck, that was just uncomfortable for me. -It may work well for someone else.  I think the battery lasts FOREVER!  I've listened for more than 6 hours on my battery, and still going strong.  With my new earphones, the sound is good.  It is REALLY easy to move songs over from your computer, truly just plug it in.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with this little player.

<Title>Coby MP-C888 1GB mp3 player  Don't expect much.
<Date>Sat Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this mp3 player in January 2007 at first it was a headache to understand the controls, then when you get the hang of the controls on the player it eats battery like crazy and just when you have decided to purchase rechargeable batteries it dies.   It only lasted roughly 3 mths.    I have migrated to the Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB player that comes with a rechargeable battery and that's going good so far.

<Title>Coby MP-C888
<Date>Fri Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product is good with some drawbacks.  Given the number of songs the device can hold (240 or so) and the primitive user interface, the only rational way to use it is in shuffle mode.  However, when the player is turned on it restarts at song 1 and plays them in the same order as before.  So instead of listening to all 240 songs over a few days you listen to the same few hours worth.  I don't know if they have access to a good random seed, but using one would make all the difference.  I don't get a day's worth of listening out of a battery.  On the plus side you don't need a cable to plug it into your computer.  So, you don't have to worry about losing the cable.

<Content>I purchased this for my 10 year old neice for her birthday.  I liked that it was small and relatively inexpensive for a sometimes forgetful little girl.  She seems to really like it.  I haven't heard any complaints.  My sister claims that it is easy to use and the instructions were easy to figure out.  Nice little gizmo.

<Title>Awesome Product
<Date>Thu Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a awesome product! I am running Windows XP and all I had to do to load my songs to my player was plug my player into my usb. That's it. It is so easy to use and so easy to load songs. If you have one of the newer radios that plays mp3s and has a usb port on the front, then plug in your player and your ready to go. No cables to run, no chargers to connect. I am very pleased with my Coby mp3 player.
