<Title>Rocks as ipod & web browser (insight from an iPod junkie)
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's really only two reasons to buy this iPod over the others.  Simply said it is the touch display and the ability to surf the web.  I purchased my iPod touch the first day it was available.  I have had it for about a week and here's my review:  As an iPod: Just as good as the 5.5 generation iPod.  Effortlessly imported all my music. Excellent music quality and plays all day long.  You just need to shut down the visual display to preserve battery consumption.  Note: The games do not work on this one.  Also, as others have noted, controlling volume is awkward if the screen is dark.  As a web browser: Simply awesome!  I could take this on vacation for reading my email (It is much better than my cell phone). I was able to log into all of my web-based email apps and send and receive messages.  Using the keyboard is not hard at all.  If you rotate the display before you enter text, a bigger keyboard shows up on the bottom.  NOTE: There is no feature to save your login information like Apple's regular Safari.  This means you need to retype your name and password into many services over and over again each time you launch (Apple, let's fix this on the next upgrade).    Summary: Fully exceeded expectations.   A few things that are not obvious:  - There is no manual and you need to figure out how to navigate as you go.  I found a manual on Apple's site. - The YouTube performance is spotty depending on how many folks are demanding a video - Battery power will get sucked dry fast if you surf web or watch videos

<Title>Almost Great
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit primarily because after owning a 5th Gen iPod (80) I found myself using the video function about 90% of the time.  The Touch is certainly a great video unit.  Yet, why Apple gave us a unit with so many shortcomings is distressing.  Why is it missing email, why no Google maps, why no direct entry to calendar? Also, why no ability to enter notes?  My biggest disappointment is why do I have to buy a new cable ($49) to view movies on a television.  Other than that all the other functions work great, Safari is much better than my Palm TX for web surfing and iTunes works well.  I just hope that in Time Apple allows 3rd party apps or fills in the missing pieces.

<Title>Maxed out
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To be honest I was dissapointed when it was announced that the iPod Touch would be introduced in 8 and 16GB versions but decided to get a 16GB version any way. In real standards this is what I have on so far. 13 playlists (17 albums) - 249 songs, 23 television shows (20@22 mins, 3@43 mins), 7 full length feature movies, 3 documentaries, and 616 photos. Granted it is not my entire library but it is fairly substantial, enough for some long plane trips. Although I look forward to future renditions with more memory and features, and I will have to maintain it more often than my 4G iPod, I am very happy with my Touch. The technology put in the Touch and the iPhone stands alone. If I didn't like my phone carrier and plan I have currently I would have considered the iPhone, but the Touch suits me just fine.

<Title>A great product with room for improvement
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, I would like to point out that I am typing this review with my iPod touch. With that in mind, would like to start off by talking briefly abou what is supposed to be the touches main function, playing music.   The music player is to say the least breathtaking. Cover flow works quicky and is extremely user friendly. Overall, the music player works better than any other iPod I have owned. Specifically, the touch has better sound quality than any other iPod so music downloaded at 256kbps sounds gorgeous. The different organizations of music is increadibly tidy making it a joy to use.   The next feature, internet, is well done for such a small device, but there is still room for improvement. I have gotten used to using my thouch's Internet features such as typing and resizing pages to better read them. One thing I have had a problem with though is that sometimes safari crashes on me if more than one window is open. Also, several websites require more plugins than the touch has resulting in unloaded items. Overall though, I found that this is perhaps the best mobile internet program on the market. All in all I am extremely pleasedwith this program and its performance especially because of its international settings which allow me to type emails, using the email website like gmail.    The wifi chip, I have noticed, picks up a weak signal and it sometimes beomes necessary to move my fingers around the antenae piece on the touch. After doing this, the signal seems to regain all its strength. In comparison to other PDA's, the touch definitely has the best wifi chip and works quite fast.   It is upsetting that Apple desired not to include the feature to add calandar events and i rally believe that they will create an update to be able to do so. It is also rather unfortunate that it only comes in 16gb as its highest capacity player. But because it is a flash player i can understand its rather high price. Also being a flash player allows it to have better battery life and allows it to be as thin as it is. The last ral disappointment for me was that the backside is that plastic used on the old iPods. This makes it a scratch magnet,  but suprisingly only on the backside the screen is amazingly dare I say bulletproof and has resisted scratches and a significant amount of pressure, significant enough that it would cause other iPods screens to crack.  The last major features are the itunes music store on the touch and the ability to watch movies. I was not blown away by being able to only purchase songs on my ipod but on the whole it is a nice feature to have. The ability to watch movies is not new to Apple, but the screen on the touch is lovely and watching movies on it is not hard on my eyes lolike the previous iPod 5th generation.I do not have the negative black problem with my screen and for those who did, many were fixed by the latest iPod update.   The esthetics on the touch are infallable and its structure feels sturdy and well build. The battery life is like no other iPod I have ever owned and the screen is gorgeous. In the end the touch is definitely a product worth buying and though not a great value has the best features I have seen in any iPod so far including the newest batch of them.

<Title>A cool ipod
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you don't worry about the price and smaller capacity this is the ipod to get. It is a great product a marvel. It is very thin and sports a huge screen. Most of the features it derives from the iphone and most of us know what the features are. The features like auto rotate cover flow work pretty well. The wireless works fine and I downloaded a full album from itunes.

<Title>BEST iPOD EVER!
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is by far the best iPod I have ever used.  The user interface is amazing, with the accelerometer to change the orientation of the screen.  Video and coverflow are amazingly clear and smooth.  As for Safari, at the risk of repeating myself AMAZING!  I don't know how they designed a full web browser (except flash, yet...) into the iPod Touch.  The zooming and everything is very easy to use.  Also, WiFi isn't slow like in other wireless electronic devices.  Not T1, but adequate.  Most of all what surprises me about this product is that is very intuitive.  I didn't even read the manual and I already know how to use everything on the iPod.  A continuation of Apple's ability to make easy to use electronics.  My only hesitation was the size.  But, 16 GB is enough for most (not all of you with 100,000 songs on your 80 GB iPod video or whatever, but most).  I have about 10 GB of songs, and the rest I'm reserving for videos and photos.  Enough for a couple movies and a good amount of pictures.  Just manually select which videos you want on your iPod in iTunes.  Also, as of yet, the only case available from Apple are the iPod socks (too overpriced and not effective enough for me).  Though some third party sellers, including Amazon have put out their own cases.  Overall, best iPod ever.  Once you buy yours, you'll see what  I mean.  Happy Buying!

<Title>Amazing Product
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just received this product about 1/2 hr ago. I have played with this product at the local Apple store. So far, playing Ipod Touch everything seems magical from fast responsive touch screen to its cover flow features. I believe this is the greatest product created by Apple so far. There may be some improvements necessary as many of the reviews have suggested but i am completely satisfied with this product and its price. Many people think that it costs as much as a laptop, but sometimes these people forget that it is 1/36th of the size of a regular laptop. There are many corporations out with deep pockets, why cant they make this kind of innovative product? it needs passion to make a product like Apple Ipod Touch, which Apple has.  I recommend and support this product.

<Title>Now we've got a serious iPod which is so easy to use.
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a beautiful looking device and now (as of January 2008) I can add iCal appointments on the fly and sync them with my Mac. This makes the iPod Touch almost a PDA. Safari has a few issues because there are several important plug-ins missing which may restrict access to some websites. The iPhone is currently affected by this too.   I bought one of these for my mother and she adores having it to view the photos of me and my dog (we live 4,000 miles apart), the videos of us together, and of course the music and movies she loves. It helps her to feel connected to me in addition to our 'phone calls. My mum is a technophobe, yet she can use the touch screen interface easily.  At 16Gb, the Touch had adequate memory, however add several hundred songs and a few 1GB movies burned with the help of Handbrake, and you discover you may need a little more memory unless you want to remove the movies every once in a while.   Expect Apple to release an iPod Touch and revised iPhone with more memory in the latter half of 2008!

<Title>ipod touch is NOT a PDA -- DON'T EVEN THINK IT
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>See other user review titled "Lack of iCal Editing makes the Touch A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT, September 30, 2007"  It's a nice iPod and Internet browser but it stops there.  You can't add calendar appointments from the iPod and there is no notes or tasks function at all.  WHAT USE IS THAT??  If you don't have admin rights on your computer, like me and my work computer, you can't install iTunes and therefore you cannot sync your Outlook calendar or contacts without going through the labor intensive process of exporting your Outlook PST files to another computer.  It also does not sync sub-folders for shared calendars (i.e. your exported PST files) or SharePoint calendars so you have to copy-paste it into the main folder.  I am very angry that this was not just an oversight, it was Apple's conscious decision to NOT include the ability to add calendar appointments -- this capability is in the iPhone but not the iPod touch.  Just keep your PDA and MP3 player and you'll be better off.

<Title>A little satellite computer terminal! IF you can get wifi hookup.
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I LOVE IT!!! (With a few caveats)  I bought the Touch the minute they added the mail, maps, and weather widgets and bumped the memory up to 16 gig. I had been dying to get an iPhone BUT: I have Verizon, and I have too long on my contract to justify changing my whole family's plans just for a gadget, PLUS: I have a 20 gig iPod, and I didn't thing 8 gig was going to be enough (even though 20 is really more than I need). Still, I really need roaming access to email for my business (and Verizon makes that VERY hard with Mac), so I was delighted to be able to rationalize this purchase with the advent of the mail app on the Touch! (I'm a LITTLE bugged that I didn't wait a month and get the 32 gig. Oh, well.)  It's been ALMOST everything I wanted it to be: I LOVE the touchscreen, I can listen to my books and music, plus WATCH lots of video podcasts (which I don't get to at home, because I'm using the screen to do other stuff when I'm stitting at my desk). I love the contacts interface, and I use the photos a lot more than I thought I would (my last iPod didn't have video...I know, antique.)   The main problem seems to be that it's kind of hard to get wifi service. I imagine soon there will be free wifi spanning the globe, but right now I have problems hooking up more often than not. This makes it hard to use the email, which was my main motivation for buying, and also the maps app often either can't locate me (a big advertising feature for the product), or doesn't work at all.   I'm sure these problems will be relieved when wifi is more prevalent, but for now I find I'm having to go to Starbucks most of the time when I want to check my email.   I'm happy I have it, but it could be better with better wifi service.

<Title>Apple's iPod Touch Pre-Updates - Great Player, Nicer Price! Test Drive it Today!!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JNYWBG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple iPod touch 16 GB without Software Updates</a>  Apple's 16GB iPod Touch was the largest you could buy before the 32GB version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012JNQYK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple iPod touch 32 GB</a> was released in January 2008.  This mobile device has a great combination of quality, and features, though its capacity falls just short of the ideal size for a true media player.  The awesome video, sleek thin body and web capability are enough to make this unit worth considering despite a high price and some missing features.  Pros  + Buy it without software update to save a few dollars + 16GB of storage is a decent size for plenty of music and a few TV shows or a movie + Great design with a sleek thin body!!! + Beautiful 320x480 pixel wide-screen provides pleasing video viewing + Turn to the side to view video using the full wide screen width + Orientation detection changes view to landscape mode automatically when turning iPod! + Brighter screen with great contrast and crisp sharp images + Wireless access via 802.11 b/g compliant antenna (hopefully `n' will come soon) + Wireless searching and video on mode can be disabled to extend battery life + Great interface for Safari web browsing with easy WiFi hotspot setup + Headphone jack compatible with standard phones, unlike iPhone + Supports both NTSC and PAL video out + Works with some legacy iPod accessories (except standard A/V cable and some docks) + Diminishing price tag in terms of $ per GB of space + Unlike iPod classic, all flash memory means less failures and breakage + Flash memory also awesome for running / working out, though I use my nano for that  ;-) + Coverflow actually works nicely on the Touch, much better than on the iPod nano + Slightly better sound quality than 2nd generation iPods + So far seems to have lower error rate than other iPods + Apple reputation is highly deserved + Plenty of free video and audio teaser content available on iTunes  + Easy access to iTunes right from your device over your local wireless internet! + Apple SDK being made available which means more apps are on the way!  Cons  - Unlike the 32GB model, not enough capacity to make it a replacement for your disk-based player  - Have to pay extra for new apps including stocks, maps, email, notes and weather - Touch design is almost too minimal without hold button or easy volume adjustment - Very difficult to adjust or use without looking at it; some earbuds include controls that help - Screen requires "real touch," bad for those of us in cold weather cities  - Data port seems more cramped than other models and difficult to seat on many dock ports - The headphone jack is strangely placed right next to the data port; ok for landscape mode, awkward in portrait mode - Not backwards compatible with legacy docks and cables; Universal dock now required for video out - Battery life still shorter than other iPods due to WiFi and video power needs - No expandability or SD card slot like Sansa View or Creative Zen - iTunes software with limited native formats (MP3, MPEG4, AAC) and high overhead - Some poor interface designs, such as volume control only available when upright - PDA functions such as calendar syncing and contact management still need work - Playlist and music groupings are lacking and need many improvements - Still lacking some features such as built-in FM radio & voice recorder - Missing Zune features such as the ability to share songs with other iPod Touch units  - No Bluetooth for peripherals and accessories - No wireless synching or wireless access to iTunes WLAN libraries - No WiFi viewing of live iTunes PodCasts - Still no local viewing of PDF or other common document formats - No mode to use as disk storage?!?! - Roughly 2GB of space taken up with iPod software alone!!!! - STRANGE Apple business practices - ie, charging for software features included with the iPhone???? - While the cost is slowly coming down, still quite expensive in total $ terms  Looks and Design  Aesthetics and design have always been Apple's greatest strengths, along with Steve Jobs' marketing savvy.  The iPod Touch is solid but light.  It has a longer body than either the latest iPod nano <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a> or the iPod Classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLKIHA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple 80 GB iPod classic (Black)</a>.  Yet it's slightly shorter than the iPhone.  It's nice and thin, though not as thin as the new Nano.    The big 320x480 pixel wide-screen is simply gorgeous, and the instant landscape mode combined with high quality video resolution makes this the first truly beautiful mobile video player.  The old Creative Vision W <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHBZHC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Creative Zen Vision W 60 GB Widescreen Multimedia Player (Black)</a> had a lovely display, but was MUCH thicker.  The Touch blows everything else away in terms of looks and design.  The metal back common to most iPods still attracts fingerprints, but you will be too busy staring at the screen to notice them.  The screen too attracts smudges.  I've heard it's almost impossible to scratch it, but I still bought screen and body protectors before I ever touched it.  Apple did away with the hold button and the click-wheel.  While I really love the touch interface, it's impossible to change tracks or volume without looking at the player, an awkward trait.  Get a nice pair of headphones with integrated controls and you won't notice the omission as much.    Sound and Video  Sound quality is slightly improved from previous models.  The included headphones are the same as other models.  I actually think the included phones are fine in terms of sound, but not so much in terms of comfort.  Upgrade your phones only after doing a lot of research.  For the Touch, having phones with volume control and additional buttons is a huge plus.  This guy really showcases video, but the sound is still very good and improving with the last few models.  I expect this trend to continue.  To really enjoy video, you will probably want to pay up for the larger and more expensive 32GB model. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012JNQYK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple iPod touch 32 GB</a>  Most video encoding is done at very high bitrates, which has the added benefit of better sound.   Use the highest quality bit-rate you can stand if sound quality is your primary desire.  As for me, I have been through frequent hardware upgrades to add more disk space and finally try to collect all my music and videos in one place.  Features  The features in the iPod Touch were in development for 3-4 years.  I was one of those who read the rumor mills daily waiting for all those features to come out in one bang.  Well they didn't.    The first Touch seemed to artificially remove some features already available in the iPhone, which was very disappointing.  Now Apple has offered some of those original features in a "software update" that costs $20 more.  This policy is not a good one.  That's why if you can live without those extra apps it's worth it to purchase this model without the update.     The device's battery life is still shorter than one would want, but longer than the iPhone and more than adequate for an average day's usage.  Users will notice their battery indicator going down, but probably won't get cut off before they get home.  Apple's software is still a weakness with very limited direct control over your device library and few file options.  No external disk function, no native WMA support?  With key features disabled, such as use as an external hard drive, it makes you wonder.  Hopefully some of these features will be added back into this device with time.    Coverflow works MUCH better than on the iPod nano and actually helps when scrolling through your videos.  Press your  selection and the cover flips over to show you which tracks are available.  It's still buggy and there are some UI features that are lacking.  Elapsed time and track length aren't shown for podcasts, and volume adjustment only shows up in portrait mode for some reason.  Hopefully some of these features will be added in a FREE patch. 	 The Safari web browser is THE killer feature of the Touch.  Finger-based scrolling is very intuitive and you will be navigating with ease in no time.  I'm less happy with the virtual keyboard and I can't wait for an alternative to appear.  I have to use it very seldom, so I can live with it.  The video out signal options are a nice addition and can be set to either NTSC or PAL.  This is great for those who travel or have some foreign hardware, like me.  ;-)    The 802.11b/g built-in WiFi antenna connects to most hotspots, though I hope wireless n will be included in the next version.  The antenna works well, though with a seemingly limited range.  You can turn off wireless scanning to save battery life.   It would have been awesome to have Bluetooth for wireless headphones or other accessories.  Some of those Zune-like features would also help, such as wireless syncing, music sharing or access to WiFi playlist libraries or live podcasts.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>  Even basic staples like a built-in FM radio tuner, voice recorder and an expansion slot are also missing.    Both the Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a>, which is much thicker, and the Sansa View <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)</a>, which is taller, have some of those added components built in.  Newer Archos players has many of those players plus much greater format support <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W0Q2PU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Archos 705 Wi-Fi Portable Media Player (160 GB)</a>.  Yet none of those players have the level of wireless internet capability that sets this unit apart.  Even fans of competing players will agree that the iPod Touch more than makes up for missing features by utilizing the features it does have VERY VERY WELL.     Conclusion  Overall this device is an HUGE improvement.  Apple's sleek design impresses once more.  With time, hopefully the kinks and omissions will be worked out.  If you can afford it, definitely consider getting the larger 32GB model. Either way, the good far outweighs the bad.   Enjoy!!!!

<Title>Amazing product, just not worth money
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>even though the price for a ps3 has dropped to 400, it still isn't worth the money your paying for it. I mean at $350, the xbox 360 is just a better deal. I mean once you factor in the extra cost of the wireless connector, hddvd player and xbox live charges(ps3 online is free) it may cost well over 600 dollars compared to the 400 but you should completely ignore the extra 250 dollars because you don't neccesarilly have to pay for it right away. For this reason alone i'd suggest not buying the iphone. or the ipod touch for that matter. Now that microsoft has lost the hddvd war, xbox's sales are sure to go up since people always want to support the underdog. You therefore shouldn't buy ANY apple products since microsoft s clearly better and you wouldn't want to send the wrong message. Besides, Steve Jobbs' last name is just plain annoying. If that's not a great reason not to buy an ipod, i don't know what is.

The only draw is the storage - although a 32 Gig iTouch has been released or is scheduled to go on sale in February 2008. There are some glitches - time and date reset when you sync with iTunes.

First time use, iTune told me that I can upgrade to 1.1.3. Good, I selected to upgrade. After a while, however, iTune told me that some error happens, upgrade failed. During the upgrade, I can actually use the ipod, touch it... But after this, because it is not activated yet, so I can't use it anymore. I have to reconnect it to my pc and recover it. But after a while, it fails again. I tried a couple of time, all fail, on my pc and laptop. I start to search for solution. It is kind of frustrated. Finally, I am lucky enough to recover and upgrade it. But this is really not a good user experience. (this reason is because the upgrade software is too big, if you chose to update onthefly and your network speed is not fast enough - mine is 4M cable-, you may end up with this trouble).  2. Safari It is nice although do not support some websites. The really trouble is that when opening multiple websites, the ones on the background usually just are reloaded from the beginning when switching to them. Too less memory???  3. Video player Not really robust. Exit quit often. Also happens for Youtube.

<Title>BEST IPOD --- MUST MULTIMEDIA DEVICE
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought a phone in December and I just didn't like it to manage my music and my email so I bought the IPOD TOUCH.  I practically use it every chance I get to check email, check my stocks, weather, keep track of appointments and everything else.  If you buy it, go ahead and jailbreak it (do a google search).  I was afraid to do it at first but it is almost impossible to break the IPOD TOUCH.  Once you jailbreak it, you have so many programs to choose from, like games, ebooks, notes, etc.  I've used this device more than anyphone I've had.  Best of all, I don't have to pay fees or data plans.  WIFI catches more access points than my laptop.  Video on this device is great.....if you like youtube, you are going to love this.  I love this thing....get it ASAP.  The only negative is that it doesn't have speakers or bluetooth but you can get an adapter for that.  Make sure you get a case since it scratches easily.  I plugged it in to my car stereo and I got rid of all my CDs.....This device is great!!

IT's great.  But I will NOT buy an iPhone until it's 3G - at least.  And guess what: in Europe, Asia and Australasia its 3.5 or even 4G (HSDPA)!

<Title>Bad Apple!
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The newest generation of Apple's ipod Classic has been a bunch of trouble! The first one had a never functioning back light (hard drive problem- no hope there) the second one stopped working after two weeks of no apparent problems. Combined with the, I'm not kidding, hour wait to get through to technical help and the seriously rude phone help (not all, just one really "bad apple") and the whole experience has been disappointing to say the least. Apple store at the Grove in LA played our knight in shinning armor with an easy exchange for a new one. The first two were engraved for Christmas, we gave up on that and went to the source. Much easier than the phone hassle.Let's hope that three's a charm!

<Content>It's Great! Lets say that if you don't have a lap top or home computer and all you need is email, full internet, music player, videos, note pad, calender, maps and so much more. It fits in your pocket. I would suggest the rubber case cover and the clear film to protect the screen. Protect it right away. No problems and I have it 1 month. I find that when I need to go and check out something on the net its much faster then starting the computer up to check the tv guide or google something. I would tell tell you I have had pda's and they cannot compare. The big "m" has a lot to watch out for. Go APPLE GO!  Happy User!!!!!!

<Title>iPod Touch: An engineering wonder
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been using iTouch (16 Gb) for about a week.  I would say this is one of the best portable devices ever built. Its design, its hardware built, its software and GUI design. When you combine all of the best into one unit,  you have an engineering wonder. I think even Edison would be proud of this product.  Now here are my impressions on iTouch's major functions:  Safari:   To me, this is one of the best features.  I have tried Web browser on some other portable devices: PDA, smartphone, an they felt like toys, meaning not fully functioning due to limited size and poor navigation and zoom in-out abilities.  iTouch's Safari changed all that. The combination of high resolution screen and amazingly convenient multi-touch zoom-in and out ability make web browsing a truly pleasant experience.  If you can load full-blown web page, you don't want to use those targeted wireless only pages.  Wikipedia is one of my favorite sites, so now to be able to visit this site from anywhere with the iTouch,  you have an encyclopedia in your pocket. Pretty amazing! Finding Wifi server around is also very easy.    Photo:   Photos displayed on the iTouch has a stunning clarity. Again, touch ability made it so easy to scan from photo to photo, another common function just made 10 times better than other portable devices.   Video:   For displaying video, change from 2.5" to 3.5" is a big improvement, although previous 2.5" was already very good.  Youtube video showing on iTouch is a perfect fit.  Let's face it, the resolution of Youtube video won't make an impressive  display on your HiDef TV, but it does on iTouch.  Music:  Of course, this is the most basic function of any iPod.  iTouch's music function is better than previous iPods, in my mind, and sound quality is also amazing.     Memory size:  16 Gb for me is quite enough. All my music would fit into 8 -10 GB, 1000 photos occupy around 1 GB ( average 1 meg per photo),  and that leave me around 4-5 GB for some videos which I would switch more often.   Now here is some wish list for possible future updates, most of them can be added with new software firmware, some of them might need to wait for hardware update:  1.	Google Map: iPhone have this function, why leave iTouch out?  2.	Music volume control button: If I want to change music volume while surfing web, I need to  go back to music function and change  volume by using touch screen.  This one need hardware change.  Like many others,  I bought iTouch instead of iPhone because I currently locked up with another cell phone company.  Otherwise, I might have bought iPhone. By saying this, iTouch does have advantages of smaller size-much thinner than iPhone,  and more memory (8Gb vs.  16 GB)  Overall, this is an amazing device, which indeed make your life more fun!

<Title>worst ipod ever
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>i got the ipod touch a few days ago, i realy wanted to like it, but i didnt.  first off all, all it is, is an ipod with out a click wheel but a touch pad plus 150$. sure, the internet brower is decent but thats about as far as it gets, it all goes downhill from there. ya, cover flow is fun for the first 30 minutes, but its just like scroling through the regular albums list plus pictures, and it takes longer to find the album you want.  next is the video and audio quality, the is probably the most dissapointing part of this ipod. the video quality is noticably worse than the iphone's, especialy in the blacks. and the audio is also sub-par, however if you are still convinced that the included iBuds sound awsome (i feel sorry for you) you will not notice the difference.  the touch also has almost no PDA capability, having the calander and the calculator is as far as it goes, which u will not use anyway.  Bottom line... the touch is for suckers who like pretty flowing cover art and who like to show off their cool looking now ipod. DONT buy this ipod. just do what i did and go into a non-apple hibernation (aka buy a zune) until they pull themselves together.   *apple fans may now commence the flaming*

<Title>Dont buy one just yet
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was excited to buy this new iPod, especially since my old 4th generation one was running out of steam.  I hurried to the store to get one, and to my surprise, they were still available.  But beware of being the first on the block to buy the newest gadget.  The iPod Touch is fraught with bugs, especially if you like to use the Smart Playlist option.  For some reason, the Touch is not smart enough to register when a song has been played and how many times.  Smart Playlists based on number of times a song is heard or when it was heard is not usable.  I took it to the Apple store and was simply told it is a software problem and to just look for a software update from Apple.  Great.  Without the use of playlists, my iPod is now a $400 paper weight.    Also, more importantly, the iPod sometimes spontaneously stops playing songs.  This happens when I'm just listening and not doing anything and sometimes when I'm scrolling through my albums.  And on more than one occasion, the operating system just crashes.  I have had to reset the iPod more than a dozen times in just 2 weeks to fix these problems.  Apparently, being quick to market was more important to Apple than releasing a product that works.  I wished I had waited until February to buy one.

<Title>wait for improved version
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Prior to buying the Touch i used the Nano for music and my PSP for games, photos, and movies.  When the touch came out i was excited.  What a disappointment!! Photos and video are not even close to the PSP.  If you enlarge a picture on the touch it will show noise.  On the PSP i can enlarge any photo and still get clear pictures.  I suspect it is because the touch "optimizes" the photos.  It also cannot read PDF files and you cannot set your appointments manually (what a waste). This is really no more than a bigger music IPOD. I suspect the only people who will like this are fanboys of apple or have never seen or used a PSP. Overall this is a real ripoff for $400.00.  I will stick with my PSP until apple can compare in the video and photo dept.

<Title>Unusable While Driving
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have two issues with this product.    1.  You have to look directly at the screen to do anything with it (unlike my old 5G iPod which I can manipulate while keeping my eye on the road).    2.  If you listen to audio books or podcasts it is nice to be able to fast forward and rewind.  The slider bar on the iPod touch is too small to use effectively.  I try to move backward 60 seconds, and I end up moving 5 minutes (or the beginning of the track).  It drives you insane.. I have just stopped using it and gone back to the old iPod.    Nice video player, great web browser.

<Title>Fanstastic ipod ... awesome wi-fi
<Date>Mon Oct 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really enjoy this ipod touch!  I'm one of the few who hadn't bought an ipod (or any other mp3 player) but did digitize my entire music library.  I'm glad I waited.  Although I'm sure I'd have enjoyed past models, this one is really something else!  My favorite features: 1) The user interface and menues are extremely well thought out.  Everything is so intuitive that you will be navigating through every corner in no time.  It's just so nice to look at.  2) I LOVE the wi-fi.  I actually find it so simple to preview and buy songs on the iTunes wi-fi store, that I probably won't be using the PC for that anymore.  I'm amazed at how quickly the pages and songs load.  3) The safari browser is so easy to use.  And You Tube was incredibly simple and fast!  Admittedly, I'm not looking for much of the PDA-type functionality in my ipod - I'll continue to use my cell phone or blackberry for those things.  But I differ with the opinions that the touch is just a nice ipod.  One, it's in a league of it's own with it's interface, but the wi-fi takes the ipod to the next level.  The widescreen and accelerometer make video and picture viewing much nicer too.  For me, the additional features are worth the extra $, and I definitely favor the flash players over the larger hardrive players.  I'd suggest go trying an ipod touch out ... but beware ... chances are you'll be taking one home (if there are any left in stock).

<Title>Impressive...Yes, Overpriced...Yes, Worth it...Depends
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Being an early adopter of this shiny new iPod comes with drawbacks.  All of us who went out and bought this new device surely understood this.  If not, those 1-star fools deserved what they got.  I bought my touch two weeks ago, before the official release date because I was absolutely amazed by what it offered.  I bought it knowing full well of all the crippling that Apple stupidly implemented.  I do not agree with what Apple has done to "differentiate" the touch from the iphone.  However, for me, the purchase made sense because as far as a PMP (personal media player), no other device rivals the touch.  Reasons why the touch works for me: 1. Brilliant screen (darker than iphone screen...yes, but still beautiful)  2. The touch interface is better than any clunky button interface  3. No signing my life away to AT&T or $$$/hack to SIM off to another carrier.  I'll keep my devices separate for the time-being.    4. I'm cool paying premium for a quality device that I use every day, especially since I know it serves my purposes perfectly (podcasts, music, video podcasts, TV episodes, occasional movie, quickie photo album).  5. Lastly...the icing on the cake is the web browser/wifi capability.  The browser rendering is fantastic and is actually quite usable.    My complaints/hopes for improvement are the same as other folks:  1. Apple needs to provide a decent remote for this thing so it is actually usable in a car or on a jog.  I know, I know...there are a few 3rd party remotes out there, but the choices are few.  I have yet to find a simple inexpensive wire remote that will just plug into the touch.    2. Flash and Java of course.  3. Uncripple this thing!  Makes no consumer-sense to not have simple notes, a real calendar, email client, & maps client.  So if you want the best PMP available and don't mind paying more for a quality device, then go get yourself an iPod Touch.  I know I did and absolutely love it!  Jeremy

<Title>iTouch - very fun - almost, but not quite perfect.
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The first determination you make is - is the video playback and touchscreen worth $400?  I say yes.  Video playback was excellent - I rip DVD's via Handbrake to MP4 then import into iTunes -  playback on the iTouch is impressive.  Colors and blacks are excellent.  In addition, I purchased a few TV shows on iTunes, which played back with no problem.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't notice a difference between the iTouch and the other iPods I have (4GB nano, 8GB nano, 80 GB video) when it came to playing back music.  The music sounded just as good on the iTouch as the other iPods.  I have ripped my CD collection at Apple Lossless and I am using Shure e3c earphones.  Touchscreen - the touchscreen is a gadget lovers dream - I can spend hours flipping through album covers - zooming in on photos, web pages - it is just fun.  I don't miss the click wheel at all.  Surfing the web - surfing the web is somewhat of a mediocre experience - yes its a small device, etc etc... but I found the response a little slow - I have 802.11g at my house, so I expected a little quicker response - some web pages were quick, but others took several seconds to load - web pages with low graphics were easy to navigate (NY Times) - while others with lots of graphics (ESPN) the iTouch seemed to have a problem with - especially when it came to zooming in to see a link in a title bar - however, as mentioned, zooming in and navigating on low graphics pages was very easy.  Overall, surfing the web was still a fun experience.  Syncing - the iTouch synced with my Mac mini with no problem - calendar,  and contacts were all there - so were the pictures or movies I chose.  Why only 4 stars?  I am disappointed that I can't add calendar events to my iTouch - I am also disappointed that it doesn't have bluetooth.  I currently have a 'technology' loop - MS Outlook at work syncs via BlackBerry to my Nokia 9300 (phone), which synchs via bluetooth to my Mac Mini - I update one device and all the others sync with the new piece of information (contacts, calendar, mail) - it is disappointing that the iTouch has to remain at the end of that 'chain'.  In addition, why can I not put notes in my iTouch?  There is a keyboard built in - it just seems like notes could have been in there.  One last gripe - why only 16GB?  A movie is just under 2GB - that is only 8 movies - whats up with that?  I have 350GB of music and video - why limit this device to 16GB?  Not sure who's idea that was...  In summary, it is a fun piece of electronic equipment.  If you have the $400, buy it!

<Title>Here comes the future
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I show people my iPod Touch, they are, every one of them, genuinely amazed. They marvel at the touch interface, at the nice screen, at the thinness, but especially at the internet, YouTube and the iTunes store. I guess this is because we all know about music and video on iPods and wi-fi is something new. I'd heard that browsing the internet on this thing was pretty good, but when I used it (and it took about ten seconds to get onto my home network) I really was blown away. In fact, I sat and played with it for so long my eyes went funny! It's that good. Touching the internet is so great that it seems a pain to have to use a mouse on a desktop computer. It seems natural to use my iPT by default in the house for those little moments when I just need to check something. Works great in the garden too, especially since the screen is easily viewed in bright sunshine.  You can find plenty of game sites with java games that work perfectly with the touch interface. YouTube and the iTunes store work absolutely seamlessly and YouTube videos look so much better than they do on my desktop Mac. So, the wi-fi is big news for me and transforms this into something way beyond any other iPod. And it can only get better. The next big thing is the touch interface. It is a thing of beauty and a huge pleasure to use. I doubt you will need to ever look at the instruction manual, it's that intuitive. There are many stunning little details like the inspired 'magnifying glass' that lets you position the cursor in a text field. Some things you have to discover for yourself, like tapping the top of the screen to return to the top of a web page. If you don't think the interface is stunning, you need to go take appreciation classes in the wonders of the modern age. There's plenty more to like. It works great as an iPod, of course, and a video iPod, especially if you're into podcasts and video podcasts like I am. I guess you can watch longer videos, but good as the screen is, 3.5 inches isn't really enough for comfort when watching an entire movie. It's also the world's most beautiful calculator, syncs with calendars and stuff, lets you add new contacts, has a nice bunch of alarms and timers with a great 'wheel of fortune' interface. It also has lots of POTENTIAL. The great thing about a touch screen interface is that you can change it and add to it. Or at least Apple can. There seems to be so much scope for adding new stuff to this device that it can only be a matter of time before new things start happening on your iPod Touch. So, it's an amazing device, pretty much as amazing as everybody says it is. For me, it totally lived up to the hype. And it works perfectly. Apple could do some things to make it even better, sure, but it would be churlish to criticize what really is a groundbreaking device for a few insignificant issues. The problem for everyone is that nothing less than something this good will be good enough from now on.

<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I picked this up from a guy at work who bought it for his car to watch videos on, but it didn't work due to Apple changing the video output on this and the 6G ipod classics (yay for me).  It is amazing! The performance of the Safari web browser keeps up with the one on my computer, the video playback is flawless, and of course listening to music works just fine as well.  Paid the $20 for the January upgrade pack last night to try out the Mail and Maps applications. I live in Ireland and the maps location literally zeroed in on my apartment. Amazing that it can be done just by knowing my router!   The touch joins my 2 Nanos, Sandisk Sansa, and my Sony Walkman phone, and I think it's going to replace them all except the phone. Once they bring the iPhone over here, i'll have the perfect combo of all devices!

<Title>Uses the nightmare "Cover Flow" interface
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I'm amazed that Apple touts the "Cover Flow" interface, when the implementation is so terribly botched. If you've done anything even remotely serious with album art in iTunes, "Cover Flow" will drive you insane. Quite simply, it shows the wrong images for songs. No matter what image you have assigned to song X, the image displayed in "Cover Flow" is the first image assigned to the first song on the album where song X appears. This is worse than useless! Fortunately older iPods can still be found that don't use this interface. Apple -- either allow us to assign an image to each album (independent of the image(s) assigned to the songs on the album) or display in the "Cover Flow" interface the correct artwork as assigned to the songs themselves.

<Title>AWESOME DEVICE AND IT IS THE FUTURE OF THINGS TO COME......
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Note: I would have almost certainly purchased the iphone over the touch, but I live in an area that is not serviced by AT&T. As a result, no iPhone for me. Consolation prize - the touch.  This device is truly amazing.  1) Size and WT - unbelievable! I am a long time palm, windows mobile, smartphone, iPod user, and this is truly the first device that I can put in any pocket (pants, shirt, jacket) and it is comfortable to the point that I don't know it is even there.  2) Multimedia Capabilities - out of control. The best picture I have ever seen on a device of this nature. It is actually enjoyable to watch a movie on this thing. Although time consuming, it is easy to use handbrake to get any dvd I want onto my iPod Touch. Along with making movies enjoyable, the beautiful screen combined with the multitouch make viewing pictures equally as enjoyable. The music - it is an iPod, enough said.  3) PMI - I have two macs and all of my personal management information is iCal, Mac Mail, Mac Address and a .Mac account, etc...When I had a palm or WM device I always needed some 3rd party software to make them communicate with my Macs. Now the iTouch syncs all of this data perfectly and the address book and cal on the Touch have a great GUI combined with multitouch to make it easy and a pleasure to use.  4) Internet - by far, and I mean by far, the best Mobile Internet Browser and Mail program out there! I never thought I would use mail or a web browser on a mobile device until I used this device.  5) Maps - awesome, especially with the new ability locate your position. Only shortcoming is that you should be able to save maps that you create so that they can be used and referenced when a wifi connection is not available. Maybe this can be done and I am not aware of it, but if not it is a slight shortcoming. When you have an iphone you are almost always connected, either by cellular radio or wifi, so not as big of a deal. However, with the Touch you are not always near a wifi hot spot/access. It would be nice to make a couple of maps for reference and download/save them to your device and then when you are in the car, away from a wifi connection, you could access/view the saved maps and data just as it would be if you were online in real time.  6) Other - the clock, calculator, stocks, weather - ok, not bad but nothing special - again, similar to the comments above, with stocks and weather it would be nice to store the most recent data so that it can be accessed off line.  7) Multitouch - awesome, I forgot the name of the company they bought who pioneered this technology. At any rate, what a great acquisition it really helps to turn a great device into an amazing device. Makes web, mail, pictures, and many other things much more enjoyable.  Overview - Spectacular, microsoft could only dream of this, and they should have had something like this in mind when they started their Origami project. The device is amazing as is and its potential as PDA/mini computer is great. It could be the first full fledge mini computer/PDA and be the first its kind to allow people to leave there laptops at home (selectively of course - depends on the needs of the trip, but in the past the idea of leaving the laptop at home and replaced by a pda for any type of trip was unheard of). This device is no longer an iPod and has the potential to be the best PDA ever created.  WHAT IS MISSING AND NEEDED TO MAKE AN AMAZING DEVICE NEAR PERFECT!  1) GET that SDK package out and bring 3rd party native applications to the device.... Short List:      isolo skyscape medical software splash id dataviz office (bring both ms office and pages, numbers, keynote to the iphone/touch) multifunctional calculator and convertor epocrates/drug reference games: good texas hold em, backgammon, yahtzee, chess, etc..  That is my short list of stuff that I use often on palm/wm and would love to have on my Touch as it matures in to the best PDA ever made.  2) Bluetooth: it would be nice to have  bluetooth so that the touch could use wireless headphones. Wireless syncing would be nice. Communicate with other devices, such as a car radio where you could stream music, etc...The iphone has bluetooth and a cellular radio inside of it and is not that much bigger so it can't be a size/space issue.  3) NOTES Program - they have something called notes but the damn thing doesn't sync with NOTES in Leopard Mail and it should. Without syncing it is 10% useful, with syncing it would be 95% useful.  4) Larger memory capacities  - it is clear that the iphone and touch will never see a hard drive, nor should they. The SSD/Flash memory saves on space (and the size of the device is perfect - reaches a nice balance), battery power, and is more stable. Unfortunately, it is expensive and slightly limiting at this time. The multimedia capabilities of this device demand more memory and this will even be more important as 3rd party software blossoms. The 32GB touch is a great step forward (although pricey).  5) Cut/Paste/Copy/highlighting capabilities - need to be added. The magnifying and moving the curser thing is great and can stay but really need these other editing functions.  6) Minor cosmetic thing - it would be nice to be able to replace the background on the home pages with whatever picture one wants instead of a black screen. Analogous to desktop wall paper on computer. The device has something called wallpaper but it doesn't work like this.  7) As battery technology improves hopefully better batteries - last longer, less heat, and smaller.

<Content>The iPod Touch is incredible. There are two down-sides to it; 1) It makes me want to have an Iphone even more (wishing we had service around here) and 2) It would be nice if it was open to having companies such as Intuit (for pocket Quicken) or other such apps on the iPod. That would be sweet.

<Title> Wi-Fi Handheld + an iPod
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>There are a lot of reviews here that go into great detail about what is great or missing from this product. For me the best feature is the OS. This is a lot more than a dedicated music/video player. The iPod touch will grow as new software becomes available. (That said add $20 to the price for the software update.)  Future third party software will add tons of apps, games and who knows what else to the Touch. For now the revised calender and Gmail features are well worth the upgrade.   Yes I think there is room for improvement with the hardware. I expect version 2 will have more processing power, memory (32 meg model now available) and better battery life. This is not a phone, so I don't expect a speaker or camera.  I would like to see blue tooth added at some point for wireless sync and earphones. I am a bit frustrated by the lack of a replaceable battery in touch and other Apple products (iPods, iPhone and now the Air).  My guess is this trend will continue. I'm hoping by the time the battery conks out I will be ready to upgrade to a much better product.  I'm sure Apple marketing would object to The iPod touch being referred to as a "PDA", but it is probably a better description. This is a really great hand-held that is being marketed as an iPod plus Wi-Fi apps. As more software becomes available, I think the opposite will be true.

<Title>A top notch MP3 Player.
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first Ipod and I am very impressed.  The packaging was simple and easy to open.  Everything was neatly packed in the box and the instructions were simple.  The device is small, light and simple to use.  It took me only a few mintues to learn how to use all the features.  The WI-FI setup was simple.  Surfing using the browser and YouTube is easy and fun.  I moved my music from ITunes (I used ITunes before I had an IPod) without any troubles.  I also updated the software for the IPod through the ITunes without any issues.   I have 2 complaints regarding the touch.  The first one is that the stand it came with is a piece of garbage.  The other is that the chrome finish on the back of it is easily scrathced.  It sliped out of my hand and fell an inch or two and it scuffed up the finish.  It looks like I will need to get a case for it and there are not a whole lot of those out yet. All in all, this is a top notch product and I reccomend it to anyone.

<Title>Excellent gadget, needs some improvements
<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had the ipod touch since 1 week. I have been waiting for it since 2 years because I knew one day Apple would release a widescreen player.  Likes: - design, very cool, have to use it to believe it. Leaves others far far behind - mac os based, potential for great enhancements by firmware upgrades - Has Wi-Fi, www.apple.com/webapps can be used for using some web applications like sudoku. Although I think in future, apple will release native games for it for 9.99 each  Not Likes: - value for money is not there. At 399 bucks, they give you crappy headphones, cheap quality shameful attempt of plastic dock, cheap plastic stand, no electric charger, supplied usb cable is short, no case. You have to be prepared to shell out 50 to 150 bucks on good headphones if you want better quality music from same device, have to buy a good dock or electric charger, a case etc. Can be very expensive in total cost. - cannot search for songs by typing in name of song, artist etc... But I think this they will add in future update or maybe I have missed this feature so far - space is less. But can't blame apple. I am sure at this time next year for 399 they will have a 32gb player with force sensitive touch etc.. that is nature of technology. If you keep waiting you will never buy anything - does not come with any games, useful applications like even simple notepad  Watchouts: - 16gb is not available completely as some space is taken away by OS and installed apps, you will have like 14.8gb or 15gb available - the wallpapers it comes with, those even though you set, you wont see them because that wallpaper is applicable only when device is locked and you double click the home button

<Title>Great Gadget
<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is another technological marvel from Apple. I was quite impressed with the packed features and quality of the design of the iPod touch. On top of the great sound quality, what impressed me most is the quality of the video display. It provides sharp and vivid color with better than expected resolution. The internet browser is a fully functional one with Java enabled which allows us to browse most of the web sites. It also formats the web pages nicely and we could easily zoom in the contents by "pinching" on the screen. The interface to YouTube was also nicely designed and it downloads the contents rather quickly. It also allows you to get to the most viewed, featured, and search/bookmark your favorite ones.  Here are some of the minor issues :  - there aren't a lot of accessories available (yet). The iPod touch is actually smaller in size than the iPhone so the iPhone accessories including protective cases won't fit nicely.  - the keypad is pretty small and would need some "training" to get used to it. It does, however, highlight the key that iPod sensed so that you would know if you pressed the correct key before releasing your finger.  - the slide bar for the video playing is not very sensitive which makes it difficult to navigate through different sessions of the movies. This could be a problem if you are watching some long movies and wanted to get to a particular scene. The fast forward feature works well but you don't have much control on the forwarding speed.  - you cannot delete pictures through the iPod and it has to be removed through the iTunes interface. However, you could delete videos through iPod touch.  - there are no games available (yet)  All-in-all, this is one nice gadget that you would be impressed and enjoy.

<Title>Slick and entertaining, but know what you are getting...
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a fabulous piece of technology and integrates very smoothly with my Imac and Itunes.  Others have already covered many Pros/Cons but there are a few things that are worth considering before purchasing.  1. PRICE--Others have "complained" about the price.  This IS NOT food, water or shelter; it is a discretionary purchase.  It represents excellent value IMHO in comparison to other similar devices.  2. INTERNET--The wireless internet is surprisingly functional once you are used to some of the quirks and limitations.  For example, you can currently only watch video from internet sites supported by Quicktime.  Some sites (like AOL) don't seem to load very efficiently and navigating sites with crowded page content can be trying.  3. USEFULNESS--This is NOT a PDA though it can serve as one in a limited capacity with some creative thinking.  For example you can create "notes" in Ical or you can (assuming a wireless conection is available) send yourself an e-mail if you need to type something in so you remember it.  If you NEED a PDA, get the Iphone instead.  4. ITOUCH vs IPHONE--I opted for this because I don't need a PDA and my current cell plan fits my needs.  Remember the IPHONE is a touch device and I'm guessing most people don't wash their hands every time prior to use.  Now you are putting those germs right up to your ear.  Think about using an IPHONE after shaking hands with "Joe" who doesn't wash his hands after...well, you get the idea.   5. SIZE--It's thin, but not small.  If you primarily listen to music, stick with the Nano.  Once it is in sleep mode you can't change settings without activating it.  I use my Nano for walks and I can adjust it right in my pocket (volume especially).  So far, I love it--I'll post an update if things change!!

<Title>iPod touch: Is it worth it?
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first iPod was a 3G 10gb. At the time nobody really knew what an iPod was or what it did (to tell you the truth, i really didn't know what it was either but I wanted one). Wow, this was the coolest thing I had ever had. It held my whole music collection in my hands and I could basically take it anywhere. Apple has done it again.  Now, 5 years later, I just bought my iPod touch. I had been waiting for Apple to release a new iPod for over a year because my 3G had finally gave out. To say the least I was quite disappointed with the line-up when I saw them in September. I wanted a cool device to hold everything. My music collection has grown considerably since I got my last iPod (about 6gb to 45+gb). I was excited to hear about the touch but my hopes were lost when I found out how much space it had and the classic had not changed at all except in looks. 16gb is not enough if you listen to music all the time. I have different moods and each requires a different kind of music and, if you want to watch videos also, your space will fill quick.  You may be wondering why I still ran out and got one. Now, I believe, the only reason I have one is because Apple says its supposed to be "cool" which it is cool but thats about it. This is a device that should be able to do much more that just play music. Sure safari is cool but it is no desktop internet browser and half the time will not work on secured networks. Same with itunes store and You tube. I have mild security on my home wifi and Youtube and itunes will not connect but safari will at dreadful speeds.  So basically its just a 16gb iPod with a cool looking screen (which, I should say, is really nice to look at but do you really need it?). Apple could make this into a killer PDA but won't. Who knows why, I think they just do not want people hacking their technology and copying it by not offering a SDK (software developer kit).  I will keep the iPod touch a little longer to see if my opinion changes and if it doesn't, I am going to take it back, save $150, and get a classic with a whopping 80gb of space on the cheap one! I listen to music for music, and, although I give into hype like this, music is music when the novelty of the device is gone.  If you want something someone tells you is "cool", go ahead and spend $400 on this and be happy. For me, I just want to listen to music and have all of my music with me. I have a laptop for everything else.

<Title>SDK kit confirmed
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>http://www.apple.com/hotnews/ says:  Third Party Applications on the iPhone  Let me just say it: We want native third party applications on the iPhone, and we plan to have an SDK in developers' hands in February. We are excited about creating a vibrant third party developer community around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of new applications for our users. With our revolutionary multi-touch interface, powerful hardware and advanced software architecture, we believe we have created the best mobile platform ever for developers.  It will take until February to release an SDK because we're trying to do two diametrically opposed things at once--provide an advanced and open platform to developers while at the same time protect iPhone users from viruses, malware, privacy attacks, etc. This is no easy task. Some claim that viruses and malware are not a problem on mobile phones--this is simply not true. There have been serious viruses on other mobile phones already, including some that silently spread from phone to phone over the cell network. As our phones become more powerful, these malicious programs will become more dangerous. And since the iPhone is the most advanced phone ever, it will be a highly visible target.  Some companies are already taking action. Nokia, for example, is not allowing any applications to be loaded onto some of their newest phones unless they have a digital signature that can be traced back to a known developer. While this makes such a phone less than "totally open," we believe it is a step in the right direction. We are working on an advanced system which will offer developers broad access to natively program the iPhone's amazing software platform while at the same time protecting users from malicious programs.  We think a few months of patience now will be rewarded by many years of great third party applications running on safe and reliable iPhones.  Steve  P.S.: The SDK will also allow developers to create applications for iPod touch. [Oct 17, 2007]

<Title>Fun Gadget....but not much different
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have purchased the Nano, 30gb Video and shuffle in the past 15 months.  I received the Ipod Touch for Christmas this year as it was on my list!  What I like about it is the functionality of the controls, size of screen and the wifi.  Overall I really like it however, the wifi isn't really that great because unless you have wifi where you are it doesn't really matter.  When I am at my house it is fine but I could just be on my computer.  If the price was better I wouldn't hesitate to buy it but for $399 you could get a IPod with larger space.  The screen is great but I have had to remove some of my music off what would be on my Ipod Video.  I have 5 movies and 2000 songs on it but can't include any pictures as I am pretty much tapped out on space.  If you really want the larger screen which I think is worth it go for it.  But at the end of the day you could buy an Archos and a larger (space wise) ipod instead.

<Content>If you dont have an iPhone already and not willing to switch to AT&T to use it, I would say this is as good as it gets for a "iPhone" minus the phone function.  I returned mine because it was too pricey for my use of its function.  Dont get me wrong, because this is a cool toy to have and to show off to your friends.  But I didnt want to carry iTouch and my cell phone in my pocket.  If you dont have any type of iPod, this could be one for you.

<Title>Amazing, piece of technology 
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Ok first off. I hate the itunes program that you have to use to sync music to this product. The itunes store is amazing and addictive tho. Its selection and ability to purchase music and videos makes it my digital store of choice. On the itouch, Its very easy to use, touch is sensitive, but not too sensitive. Apple set it just right. The wi-fi inside is amazingly strong and can pick up a damn good signal. The wi-fi also has an alert, which will notify you of signals and ask if you want to connect to them. I love it. Music plays well, but i think it'd play better if i could customize the EQ. Which i found to be a major downfall in the product. But the settings they provide are pretty good, but still a custom would be fantastic. The video's on the youtube feature, are hi-def and look brillant. Havent actually put any videos on it as of now tho. 16GB's is a ton with the AAC conversion itunes applies to your music library. This is the best media player ever. Even if the program to use it sucks a lot.

<Title>Nice features and intuitive; quite impressive
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought one of these recently after using a friend's, and I'm still amazed by this device.  Besides being able to play music & video, this device is almost a hand-held computer.  It has built-in wireless networking capabilities, which allows web browsing and web-enabled applications.  These are some of the things I think are innovative and useful about the iPod Touch: - Multi-touch touch screen interface: Provides an intuitive interface, allowing you to scroll applications by moving your finger across the screen, activate buttons by tapping them, etc.  Its use of gestures are pretty cool; for example, you can zoom in on web pages by moving 2 of your fingers apart on the screen, and you can zoom out of web pages with a "pinching" motion with 2 fingers.  The concept of gestures are used in some other applications for other functionality. - On-screen virtual keyboard: This actually works better than I thought it would.  When you need to type, you click on the input, and the keyboard appears.  The virtual buttons are big enough to get used to fairly easily, although they are small enough that sometimes it can be easy to push the wrong button.  The virtual keyboard works fairly well though, and a bonus of being virtual is that you can switch to a foreign language easily.  These useful applications come with the iPod Touch: - Apple's Safari web browser: A fairly functional version of their web browser, although it lacks Java and Flash support.    - YouTube: Lets you browse, search, and watch videos on YouTube (something not supported by the built-in web browser due to flash restrictions) - Calendar - Calculator Also, the following applications were added via Apple's January 2008 update (built into new iPods, but costs $19.99 otherwise): - Mail: A basic but functional email application with support for Yahoo, Gmail, .Mac, AOL, and standard POP/SMTP email (unfortunately, Hotmail is not supported, but you can still access Hotmail via the web) - Google Maps: A special application just for Google Maps - Weather: Displays weather reports for specified locations - Stocks: Displays stock information - Notes: Lets you keep notes Granted, the only reason why you need special internet-enabled applications is because the web browser doesn't handle Java and Flash very well; however, it's nice to have a small device that you can install applications on.  The user interface is fairly easy to use, too.  A built-in accelerometer allows the iPod Touch to determine whether you're holding it vertically or horizontally.  Applications that respond to this (such as the web browser) can automatically rotate the view to match the orientation.  I am impressed with the user interface - I think this is an area where the iPod Touch shines.  Since the multi-touch interface is fairly new, it can take some getting used to, but you can get used to it fairly quickly.  It is rather intuitive for some things.  I also like the aesthetics: It uses OS X, so everything has a nice appearance.  The screen is crisp and clear.  I've read that the screen's surface is glass, and it seems fairly scratch-resistant.  The wireless networking seems to work fairly well.  It supports 802.11b/g (up to 54mbit) and supports password-protected networks.  The 16GB capacity accommodates my 13GB of music, although it would always be nice to have more storage for videos and such.  One thing that's nice about the storage is that it's solid-state, making the iPod Touch ideal for exercising.  As far as application support, Apple does restrict how you install applications and where you can get them.  Based on my observation with their January 2008 update pack, costing $19.99 (but worth it in my opinion), you can't just go out and download software and install it like you would on a desktop computer.  Apple's business model seems to be that new applications are meant to be purchased from Apple.  On a related note, there is an online community centered around hacking the iPod Touch (known as "jailbreaking" in the community).  Hacking the iPod Touch is not for the faint of heart - you need to be patient and follow the instructions very carefully - but hacking the device allows you to easily download and install 3rd-party applications, including ones  that are normally available only for the iPhone, as well as other applications created by other people.  This opens the door to making the iPod Touch a truly versatile device, allowing new applications to be installed easily.  Also, jailbreaking is a relatively safe process and won't damage the iPod.  If needed, you can restore it back to factory settings using iTunes.  I should probably list what I think are some of the downsides to the iPod Touch: - The battery & storage is not user-serviceable.  If the battery wears out (as all batteries eventually do), or if the storage goes bad, you'll need to send the iPod to Apple to get it fixed.  But this is true for most iPods. - You need to use iTunes to manage the media on the device.  It would be nice to be able to just copy the files to the iPod as if it were another hard drive, as some other music players allow, so that you don't have to rely on any specific software or operating system to use the iPod. - Unless you decide to hack it, Apple restricts what software you can use and where you can buy it.  It's a closed system; however, Apple plans to release a developer kit in February 2008, which should hopefully officially open the door to making the iPod Touch a little more open.  Overall, the iPod Touch is a nice gadget.  It's especially handy if you travel a lot and are often near wireless hotspots.  I am impressed.

<Title>Slick, but definitely generation 1
<Date>Fri Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The iPod Touch has great showoff value, and some operations are definitely easier than with the scroll wheel.  However, Apple needs to make some interface improvements. If you're listening to a podcast and need to move a minute or two forward/back, it's almost impossible with the touchscreen navigation -- precision is impossible.  It also doesn't seem as sensitive to control touches during music playback as it should be, making usage in a car problematic as it doesn't register your control presses every time.  However, it is a great-sounding music player, iTunes is a mature application, and the glitz factor is there. Apple's going to allow third-party apps officially soon, at which point this will seem much more worth the somewhat inflated cost compared to other players.

<Title>Excellent product, although apple's execution could be better.
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What is there not to like about a large touch-screen (with multitouch) PMP?  Well lets start with the positives.... the sound quality is great, the interface's simplicity is great, the fact that the device runs a variant of os-x is great, and we have wi-fi and the iTunes store to boot.  So why did i give the device only 4-stars?  Well, apple locked iPod touch down like the iPhone.  This prevents you from installing 3rd party applications, of which the device is more than capable of running from a hardware perspective.  This was a huge oversight on apple's part, although with the announcement that apple is releasing an SDK for touch/iPhone apps in february may make this a moot point (then again maybe not).  i now use my touch every day for listening to tunes, podcasts, watching the videos and surfing the net, so i would say i definitely got my money's worth.  also, the fact that it has 16GB of flash is great as very few other flash-based devices on the market have that much storage yet.

<Title>A great addition to my life
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had resisted the MP3 player world until now. As it happened, I started a new job that got me out of the car and onto the bus. Unfortunately, I can not read on a bus, so what to do with all that time? Along came the iPod touch and as soon as I learned I can sync my Outlook calendar onto it I was sold!  Thus far I have only used it to listen to podcasts, which it does wonderfully, and read my calendar, which also works great. I also find the screen extremely readable, a rare complement from someone with aging eyes that have trouble with the microscopic displays on many other devices.  My one complaint thus far is with the wireless connectivity. Thus far I have been unsuccessful at connecting to my home wireless network, secured with WEP, and my work network, which apparently requires loading of key certificates and thus does not allow iPhones or iPod touches. I did get connected at a local hotel, but wasn't willing to pay the T-Mobile premium for their wireless service.  Bottom line: Highly recommended.

<Title>Superior audio quality!
<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>What surprised me most was how much better the audio is compared to my first generation iPod Nano. Background instruments and subtle flourishes came alive in alternative & pop songs, even when played through my $50 Sennheiser on-ear headphones. I knew Sarah McLachlin has a good voice, but the Touch gave it that wow factor I had forgotten about.   I'd give it 4 stars today, but by February when Apple officially opens up it up to 3rd party apps, it will be truly awesome. Sure, it doesn't yet support Adobe Flash or WMV video in its Safari browser, but I bet those are in the works.

<Date>Sat Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sorry I will have to make this short. Ipod touch is not the mp3 player you want to have for listening to music. I just wish apple could spend lot more time on sound quality than wasting their time on fancy looks or extra features. They forgot the little machines are supposed to bring music!  Ipod touch was such a dissapointment. I could not even start on how bad (or say mediocre) the sound was when I try to compare it with other mp3 players. It just wear me out soon after listenning to a couple of songs.   If you are paying money for your favorite music, try Sony A810 or Iaudio series. You will see what i am talking about.

<Title>Revolutionary Music/Video/Internet Device
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, not sure what the gentleman named Sun is talking about. I had archos , iriver and now and itouch and the itouch sound quality tops all three. Helps to buy quality headphones and use lossless audio. Apple earphones only suffice till you audition and buy new better quality ones.   I always swore apple off, with there rules for copying music, proprietary audio,video formats and software. To me it was a nicer looking device that just restricted too many of my freedoms compared to other brands.   Then came the Itouch. WOW. Its HALF the size of my motorola razor phone which i thought was thin. This is with a silicone case protecting it. Its mostly all screen and when you view in widescreen its a personnal movie theater. The picture is exellent on it. Really depends on the qaulity of the source. Now apple only allows quicktime and mpeg-4 videos which of course is same reason why i never bought there stuff. But there is exellent freeware you can find that is so simple to use and converts the video files for you which is GREAT. I go to sleep while it converts, wake up , sync while im in the shower and then I have awesome movies for my train commute. Movie theater quality too if converted in highest ouput. The touching control of this unit is fun and SLEEK to say the least. It does take some getting used to and adjusting in small increments can be tedious and takes practice.   As a web device its also very nice. Bookmarks sites easily do you dont have to retype. It works great off wi-fi and picks up signal easily. Still more funcitonal as a conveinance internet option since speed, screen , processing power and keyboard can never compete with real PC. But you cant expect it to anyways. Typing is not bad either , even with my big fingers. Still gotta luv the web on this thing, screen and options to vieew sites are great.  Now to there phone support. I call apple to ask how I can put music concerts that I downloaded onto my pc into itunes. She looked at her notes and said "unless its a store bought cd or itunes bought music, sorry I can't help you . This is not in my scope of support for your apple itouch". I SAY SHAME ON YOU APPLE AND YOUR LIMITED SCOPE OF HELP! ACT LIKE REAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT PEOPLE INSTEAD OF ROBOTS AND PEOPLE WILL BECOME LIFELONG CUSTOMERS.  But to be fair to apple this is a SUPERIOR PRODUCT and to be honest even with all the choices on the market , I couldnt picture anything coming remotely close to the form factor , function, and features of the itouch. Battery is great unless your using for video but still adequate. The biggest knock on it is probably that you cant adjust the volume or mute the audio unless you go into the menu. My advice to solve this problem in best way I can think of. If you need to cut the sound off quickly, just pull the headphone cord out of itouch and unit pauses as well. Also luv the flash memory, this is a portable product and eventually any hard drive that gets knocked around town is going to break.     Great product but only 4 stars b/c apples service as they said themselves is LIMITED!

If I had to say anything negative its that it doesn't have much storage space and if you are watching videos, the battery goes down quickly.  But the rest of the features make up for that inconvenience.  As far as getting the iPod Touch when I needed it, I contacted every store and every website I could think of (including Apple) and none could deliver in less than 2 weeks.  I got it from Amazon in 3 days!

<Title>iPod Touch a Must Have
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JNYWBG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple 16 GB iPod touch</a> The iPod Touch is hands down the best improvement to the iPod since it was introduced.  It easily fits in all the other iPod adjuncts that I have (speakers/iPod Home) and comes with the adapter to hold in in anything you already have if it does not fit outright.  Movies play well and the organization of songs/playlists is excellent.  If you like the regular iPods, you will quickly appreciate the great changes in the iPod Touch.  The only thing I wish was different would be a separate key for Podcasts instead of being on the Music button, but that is so minor an issue, it makes no difference to all the other improvements.  The WiFi connection is a no brainer to use as well.  The iPod Touch is hands down the greatest thing for iPods since they came out.  And, 16GB is plenty of space.  I have all my music(I have over 9GB)and currently have 4 full length Movies on it, and I still have lots of memory left for Podcasts.  16GB works very well.

<Title>Stylish product to look at and use
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very stylish product to both look at and use. As you might expect the sound quality is excellent. The touchscreen is a nice size (a big improvement over the screen size of the iPod Classic) and easy to use. The quality of the displayed images is very good and the screen brightness is excellent. The wireless facility enabling connection to the internet, iTunes and YouTube has worked very well. The touchscreen virtual keyboard takes a little getting used too but after a little practice it is no problem. The biggest weakness of the iPod Touch is that its version of iTunes can not directly down load podcasts. The iPod Touch comes with a clear removable protective film on the touchscreen. On our iPod Touch this had a blister in it which distorted the image on the screen. We peeled off the film but have found it very difficult to reapply without any blisters. The back of the iPod Touch looks like it would be easy to scratch so we have used it in a leather case since day one.

The sound is great using Sony MDR-J10 sport headphones.  Sounds even better using my Sennheiser HD-595 headphones to listen as I try to fall asleep.  The iPod Touch timer "sleep"  function is greatly appreciated.  Really need a protective case for this iPod as its polished case back is very easy to scratch.

<Title>Few-Cha is NOwwwww!!!
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Let me start by saying that I've been an iPod holdout for YEARS. I've tried every wacked-out alternative; some good (Zune 30 GB, Rio Carbon), some not so good (Iomega HipZip? Mini-CD players?) Oof.   I had heard a lot of horror stories about how restrictive the loading process is on an iPod (I've always opted for drag-and-drop functionality), how bloated iTunes is... and specifically, how owners of current models find themselves boned, as Apple generates updated models, failing to support the old ones.    So, it was with a wild burst of extravagant impulsiveness that I plopped down the $400 necessary to appropriate a 16GB iPod Touch. Part of me was hopped up on the idea of the touch screen, the browser, the web apps, and when I heard about the "third-party development kit" that was due for Feb. release, I was doubly enticed. I guess that the real decider was that, up until the iTouch, I never had a "cr�me de la cr�me" player; the "Cadillac", if you will.   Simply put, the iPod Touch is the coolest bit of tech I've ever seen or used. I just love it. The software is beautifully designed. Everything flows like honey. From the cover flow, to the video, to the browsing.... silk. The physical design is sublime. Thin, glossy and monolithic. It would take a jackhammer to scratch the screen. The sound is loud and crisp. Some people describe hearing noise when the volume is jacked up, but I just don't notice it. It sounds louder and cleaner than my 30 GB Zune, which gets very high marks for clarity. Now, with the $20 upgrade from iTunes, I've got the Email, WebClips... (those are the two that I care about) .... It's even more of a marvel. I've had PDA's and "smartphones".... They all seem, in retrospect, like clumsy tinker toys compared to the iTouch.   Some whine that the storage is inferior for its price point.... I suppose that's true, but it does so much more... it's so versatile and innovative, that the argument is really moot. There are plenty of options for people who want more storage. I like that it's a solid state device (no HD). I've got 1300 tracks, 1 movie and a season of "Blackjack" on there. That's plenty for me. The bottom line is that I can't stop PLAYING with it! It's just FUN.   Recommended to anyone who loves a cutting-edge gadget.

<Title>Amazing Design
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My previous iPod, a 5th generation 60 gig video iPod has now getting a lot of use in my car (I can connect it directly to the car's sound system) and I was getting tired of constantly taking it in and out. On top of that, I've been consistently frustrated with functions like calendars and contacts on my cell phone (because it is just too small), so I thought I'd waltz into an Apple store to find another iPod I could use for everyday stuff (other than driving). At first, I looked at the latest iterations of iPods with video and, at the last minute, decided to take a look at the iTouch - I did this primarily because my iPod video has been rather cranky (it has a mechanical hard drive which has acted up). As I had no intention of getting an iPhone (I hate ATT), I really didn't think there were other options, such as the iTouch that were available. I've got to admit, that from the moment I started playing with one, I was absolutely amazed at the user interface and the ease with which it is used. So. . .I ended up getting one.   A few days after I bought it, Apple announced their "upgrade" for $20 - that, of course, was a really stupid move on their part and I was disgusted. As I had just bought the iTouch a few days earlier, I called the Apple store and whined. After a bit of a fuss, they refunded me $20 (plus tax) which I then applied to the new upgrade. Since then, I've been in love with this device. Without question, it's one of the best designed, most user friendly devices I've ever used - I've really never read the instructions (something which I did have to do with my other iPods).  I find the touch screen to be exceptionally intuitive and the interface to be extremely user friendly. One can only wish that other hardware/software developers would take so much care in designing new products.   I've only got a few minor gripes (so far) - 1) The "keyboard" that appears on the screen is a bit too small for my fingers (although I'm getting more adept at using it), 2) The Safari (wireless) browser REALLY needs to add Flash to their interface, and 3) I've got the 16 gig version - granted, that's a HUGE amount of space (think of how much memory that really is) but I can't fit everything I want on it. Okay, so we've become memory hogs. That problem; however, isn't critical as I simply only put my most favorite music and video on (heck, that's about ten solid days worth of music, if not more).   As far as video is concerned, the iTouch has a beautiful display - it's so sharp and very easy to view. I've also found that it is cheaper (sometimes much, much cheaper) to buy MP3's from Amazon than to go through iTunes. I've also been extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.  All in all, the iTouch is a fabulous device - it's thinner than my iPod video (because the iTouch is solid-state - no hard drive) and fits very nicely in my pockets, even with a case.

<Title>Wonderful iPod
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This iPod is practically perfect.  It is incredibly thin and easily fits in your pocket with no problems.  Cover flow looks better on this iPod than any other iPod out there.  The same is true for videos and pictures as well.  Obviously the coolest feature of this particular iPod is its ability to connect to the internet via Wi-Fi.  It's handy if you, like me, just want to quickly check something on the internet and don't want to bother getting on the computer.  I could go on and on about how great this product is but I won't.  You can read someone elses review for all that information.  A few things I would like to see on the next iPod touch is the following:  The ability to add/change events in iCal.  As far as I know the only way you can add/change events in iCal is to do it on your mac and the sync it to the iPod.  Kinda dumb to me since things come up all the time throughout the day and it would be nice to add them without using the computer.  It would be nice to have a camera on the iPod.  That way you wouldn't have to sync the images from you computer to the iPod.  Outside of that Apple has created a nearly perfect iPod.  Someway they will out do themselves in the future and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.

<Title>iPod Touch is Amazing
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased a 16GB iPod Touch after resigning myself to the fact I could not justify getting an iPhone.  My blackberry 8830 is supplied and paid for through my job.  Why sign on for a two year cell contract?  The interface and hardware are a revolutionary realization of modern micro electronics and design.  This product is truly next generation and makes all other music players look clumsy and dated (I mean you, Zune!).  The interface is simple, clean, quick, and has fantastic attention to detail.  With WiFi, the unit has internet and iTunes ability at home or around WiFi hotspots.  The web browser is remarkably functional, and music and video look and sound terrific.    The form factor is light and elegant.  16GB is just enough to satisfy a fairly serious music fan, and reserve room for some video content.  When flash memory allows a practical 64GB version of this device, look out.  It could become a fully capable computer when docked with a keyboard and display.  Like most new models of anything, price is premium at the moment.  I believe it's well worth it.  The iPod Touch comes without a carrying case.  I bought an invisible shield ([...]) for this, and I would highly recommend it.  It's a thin, clear plastic film that protects the front and back of the device from scratches.  Undoubtedly the iPhone will continue to be at the forefront for Apple, but the iPod touch will be a worthy consolation for enthusiasts who can't justify a 2 year commitment to AT&T.  There are few chances to use the future of personal electronics today.  This is one.  No gadget geek should go without one.

But, after 2 iPod Touches with similar problems--stopping/resetting at random times--I have given up on this shiny toy.  I could never get it to connect to my secured WiFi network.  The only WiFi I ever got connected to was while in the Apple store. I was unimpressed by the meager 16 Gb of storage, Apple shoulda gone with a hard drive.  I'm a long-time IT professional and have never had the kinds of troubles with any other device as I did with this one.  This is my 4th iPod.  I have numerous other WiFi-connected devices (laptops, PDAs, smartphones).  Sad.

<Title>Visually stunning, idiot proof design
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 16GB iTouch and have to say that it is one of my best ever purchases. It is undeniably stunning but it also has a very simple design philosophy. Excluding the obvious on/off button, the iTouch operates on the basis of a single 'Home' button and an infinitely variable touch screen interface. As for simple, if you want to listen to music, touch the music icon, if you want movies then touch the movie icon and so on. You can filter how you browse your music by playlist, album, song, artist, genre... actually you sort it pretty much the same as you do on iTunes. So that can't be a bad thing.   And then there is coverflow. Stunning just about gets there as a description. Flick through album covers like you'd flick through your CD collection. See an album you wanna listen to, just touch it. Flick down through the album and pick a song or just hit shuffle to listen to the whole thing in random order. Its slim, tidy and light all of which means very portable. It can store almost 4,000 regular songs which is more than you can listen to before you need to recharge the battery (in about 20hrs continuous play of music) so the obsession with having a 160GB hard drive is just plain nuts in my view. The battery on Movie play last for about 5hrs but thats gonna be 2Movies so that'll fit on the iTouch no problem.  Couple of draw backs though- there is no external volume control so turning that up or down blindly in your pocket is practically impossible.  The ear phones that it comes with are average at best, the standard ipod design but without the really clear sounds of the higher end headphones. Don't get me wrong, the earphones do the job but there is definitely better out there without having to break the bank. The screen and backing do smudge a lot but thats a by product of using your fingers to navigate (nothing a good polish with the sleeve of your jumper couldn't fix).  It definitely gets my endorsment and is well worth the money.

<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bough the iPod touch 16GB from Amazon a month ago, and I can summarize the review with "Wow!" It's an unbelievable device, that seems to come from the future. It's almost perfect.  Pros: - razor-thin - touch screen make you never look back to the ancient physical buttons navigation - unbelievably fast software - unbelievably eye-candy software - CoverFlow is amazing - unbelievably functional software - it's very natural to use it. You can learn all you need to know in less than a minute.  Cons: - a little bit too heavy for its thickness. But it has a lot of metal and glass, so it's not actually surprising. - 16 GB is not enough for me. I have to pick what I put on it. I cannot simply throw all my media library on it.

The only way to get the fixed Safari Browser is to buy the $20 upgrade! What a crock! Stay Away! It's only the beginning! First the iPhone now the Touch. Really makes you feel good after a $400 purchase. Stay Away!

<Title>Apple has UPDATED the software....
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>You need to know this.  Apple has updated the software, and made a VERY GOOD product OUTSTANDING.  Apple has improved with new Mail, Weather, stocks, notes, and Google Maps software.  These were previously only available on the iPhone.  Now you get a much better approximation of the iPhone without the phone than you did before.  With this model, you get twice the memory of the iPhone as well.  I have been using this model for months now, and I have had the software update for 5 days, and it is the bomb-diggitty.  This is a better, more usable iPod than the iPhone, a better video player than the iPod Classic due to screen size.  The only reason that I would think about waiting to buy if I was close to buying, would be to see if they release a model with more memory.  16GB is great, but 32MB would be all I ever need.  Understand, I CAN manage with 16 very well, though.  It will hold enough music to play songs continously 24hrs a day for over 2 weeks without repeating a song.  That's a lot of songs, folks!

<Content>I bought this against my daughter's wishes because it is only 16 gb.  Well, guess what?  This 'ol fart is glad he did!  I have loaded every album Jimmy Buffett ever made plus all my other favorite music and still have over 9 gb left.  But what sets this apart from previous iPods is the intuitive manner it uses to navigate the menus and the beautiful screen.  The only thing I don't like is the inability to delete soundtrack artists from the artist list.  This is the list I use the most and it is getting quite cluttered.  Previous iPods have this capability so hopefully an update will solve this problem.

<Title>This iPod is wonderful! My friends and I can't stop talking about it!
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>***I HAVE THE JANUARY SOFTWARE UPGRADE***  First of all, the fingerprints that get on this iPod are impossible to prevent. It doesn't make sense why people complain about this because no amount of innovation by Apple will prevent oil from our fingers getting all over their products. Granted, they could put a thin layer of glass over the chrome on the back to help prevent scratching...  Also, there are two things that Apple can fix right now, and one thing they can add to iPod touch 2G: for now, they should enable disk mode for iPod touch and they should modify Google Maps so it can display widescreen; for 2G, they should add a camera. The superb integration of the user's photos in iPod touch begs for a camera to create even more, especially with Mail. Being able to email pictures makes me really want to take pictures of things I see and email them to friends/family. However, if the iPod touch was released BEFORE iPhone I probably wouldn't have the camera complaint, so I didn't subtract from its ratings because of it.  Now, for why I gave this iPod touch five stars:  The ease of use is unparalleled, even by other iPods. Using this iPod has reminded me that, although it's brilliant, the Click Wheel is MUCH slower than a multi-touch screen. I have like three hundred songs in my music library, but sifting through them is faster on my touch than even on my computer. All I do is touch the letter of the relevant name (i.e. if I'm in Artists, the first letter of the artist's last name; Songs, the first letter of the song title, etc.). Even if I accidentally press an adjacent letter (O instead of P), a quick flick of my finger takes me right to the proper category.  Additionally, the keyboard is superb. It can even turn "Esoecually" back into "Especially," which is VERY helpful for typing quickly. The best thing to do is to type quickly, ignoring what corrections it suggests but approving them anyway. After you're done, take 30 seconds to scan the text for mistakes, because sometimes it'll suggest the wrong word. You'll find that doing this takes half the time of correcting mistakes manually. However, typing long amounts of text strains your fingers, so if you're going to type more than a couple of paragraphs, pull out your laptop. Again, NO amount of innovation can fix this, so I didn't subtract from its total.  The design of iPod touch is gorgeous. I love the simple look of the front, the shiny chrome on the back, and the overall Star Trek look of it. When I show this to people, they often say that they won't be surprised if we've got fully functional tricorders in ten years - LOL!  The user interface is brilliant. The only complaint I have is that Cover Flow isn't practical. I only ever use it to show off the touch screen and the accelerometer. As for the rest of it, Apple has done it again. They've managed to reduce screen clutter to a minimum, yet still maintain ease of use and simplicity. For instance, in Mail, there are five buttons: (1) this button checks and downloads new mail, (2) this button calls up a list of folders into which you can move the selected message, (3) this button deletes the message (quite beautifully too - the trash can opens up and the message minimizes into it like apps in Mac OS X minimize to the Dock), (4) this button calls up a menu with the options "Reply," "Reply All," "Forward," and "Cancel," (5) this button is to write a new message. Also, in the Weather app,  it contains a simple list of the current temperature and sky conditions, plus the forecasted highs and lows plus weather for the next week. There's lots more, but just take my word for it that you'll be stunned...  Finally, one of my favorite features is the lock feature. It makes it so that you have to type a four-digit password to use the iPod every time you turn it on. This might sound like a hassle, but it takes less than five seconds. I like it so much because teachers like to take kids' iPods away and I think they play with them, so the lock feature prevents my teachers from messing with the thing. :-)  Overall, iPod touch is another revolutionary product from Apple, even if it does have three faults - nothing is perfect (well, except God). You should buy it if you receive email often, like Internet access, don't like the tiny iPod classic and nano screens for watching video, and if you love ease of use and the ability to show off. I shuddered at the price at first, but trust me, it's worth it for this wonderful device and it's worth the extra $100 to double the memory. I've got a modest music/video collection, and I've already topped 8GB of memory usage on my iPod touch. You like HAVE to get the 16 GB version. All in all, a device more than worthy of your money.

<Content>It's an Ipod Touch.  This is the best portable personal entertainment device to date.  If you've decided to buy one now, definitely go with the 16 GB.  More flash memory or preferably an sd card slot in future models would be even more useful and appreciated.  Battery life isn't as good as advertised but not nearly as bad as reported by some other sources either.  You'll need to get one of the cases right away if you don't want scratches on the back.  Third party apps make it even better.  Kudos to Amazon, $40 off, no tax and free overnight shipping got it here before Xmas.

With the purchase of a separate adapter, you can play music on your car radio.  The wireless looks great.  Video looks good.  I would recommend purchasing a protective sleeve that has the place to store headphones and cord on the back (I purchased that at Amazon as well).  Bottom line, I love it.

<Title>save your money and buy something else
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Apple iPod Touch has not been a particularly successful product for Apple for good reason.  The "iPhone without the phone" lacks important features that are on the iPhone: several of the applications, a camera, a physical volume control, and speakers.  The latest software update fixes the first of these (lack of applications), but the other deficiencies remain.  Another important issue is poor price/performance compared to other products, including other Apple products.  If your main interest is having a media player, the Apple 160GB iPod Classic delivers 20 times as much media storage as the 8GB iPod Touch, and 10 times as much media storage as the 16GB iPod Touch, for a price in between the two.  Equally damning is if your main interest is having a portable Internet access device.  The Nokia N800 delivers a far better Internet access experience, including a screen with twice the number of pixels but not much larger, for considerably less money than the 8GB iPod Touch.  What's more, the Nokia N800 has full Bluetooth, so you can use a Bluetooth keyboard and tether it to a Bluetooth cell phone (any company's Bluetooth cell phone, so you can use Verizon's fast EV-DO network instead of the S-L-O-W AT&T EDGE network).  Enough about the better alternatives.  Let's talk about iPod Touch itself.  When taking it out of the box for the first time, you observe all the typical Apple design obsession.  Even the throwaway packaging is impeccably designed.  But, like all luxuries, this comes out in the price you pay.  The first thing that you discover is that you have to tether it to a computer running iTunes before you can use it for the first time.  So much with playing the Internet access on the way back from the store.  Fortunately, I had been warned, and had a Macintosh Mini standing by at home for this purpose.  I picked a Mac as the iTunes platform, in the theory that this would be the best combination that would put iPod Touch in its best light.  This turned out to be a huge mistake.  Upon running iTunes, I remembered why I tried it once and never again.  On both Macintosh and Windows I found it to be quite poorly designed; it makes Windows Media Player look good by comparison (talk about damning criticism)!  I actually had uninstalled it on Windows, despite Apple's continual pleas for me to reinstall it each time I needed to update Quicktime on Windows.  As soon as the iPod Touch was tethered to the Mac, iTunes started and began the registration dialog.  That was a good sign.  I presently finished the registration, created an iTunes account since I knew that I would want to get the upgrade with the applications, and was confronted with the offer to install the upgrade.  All going smoothly so far.  I say yes, install the upgrade, and for the next several minutes it is busily downloading.  Presently, it starts the upgrade and that's where things go badly, horribly, wrong:  The iPod "Jusenkyou" could not be updated.  An unknown error occurred (1602).  Now iTunes no longer sees the iPod.  This does not sound good.  The iPod Touch is now displaying an image of the docking cable which I soon learn is its way of saying that it is in "restore mode".  "Restore mode", in turn, seems to be what Apple calls the firmware loader.  I try disconnecting the cable from the iPod and reconnecing it.  Sure enough, iTunes tells me that it sees an iPod in "restore mode" and wants to know if I want to restore it.  I don't worry about the warning that it will erase what's there since this is a new out-of-box iPod that hasn't had any media put on it yet.  Unfortunately, iTunes gives no comfort, as it promptly comes back with:  The iPod "iPod" could not be restored.  An unknown error occurred (2001).  A quick Google search for this error shows that some iPhone users have had the same problem when upgrading their operating system.  I try repeating the restore attempt, and after a dozen or so times I conclude that it's time to call Apple.  Apple's automated system gives me no help, and eventually I ask to be transferred to a representative.  After explaining the problem, he asks me to deinstall and reinstall both iTunes and Quicktime on my Mac.  I do so, and still no luck.  At this point, the Apple representative tells me that this problem is something that can only be fixed by a service technician, and that since I just bought it I should take it back to the store for a new one.  Oh joy.  It's 25 miles each way.  I do so, and now am home with the replacement iPod.  I go through the same dialog.  This time, I install some media on it before the software upgrade; perhaps software upgrade doesn't work well on brand-new machines.  The exact same "unknown error (1602)" on install, followed by "unknown error (2001)" on restore, happens!  It's now too late to make another 50 mile round-trip to the store.  In other circumstances, I would be livid.  This is a lot of money to spend for something that bricks within minutes of purchase!  Note, by the way, that I did nothing to this iPod; I didn't jailbreak it, tweak any settings, or in any way do anything that could possibly be my fault.  I just said yes when iTunes offered to install the new, recommended upgrade!  I decide that rather than make another 50 mile round-trip, I will go to the Apple store near my office during the week and make a loud stink at their repair counter.  But before I do that, I decide to try one last thing.  As noted above, I do have a Windows machine here that had iTunes on it once upon a time.  So, I finally say yes to the Apple nag and let it put iTunes on my Windows machine.  Since my Windows machine has a Japanese OS, Windows iTunes assumes that it wants to talk to me in Japanese.  Normally this would not be a problem, but this particular matter requires English.  Fortunately, buried in Preferences is a language setting.  I change it to English and nothing happens.  OK, try quitting iTunes and restarting.  OK, now it is talking in English.  So I tether iPod to the Windows machine, and after a few device driver auto-installs Windows iTunes tells me that it sees an iPod that is in restore mode and it needs to download the software for it.  OK, I let it do that.  Wow, it's something like 160MB.  Talk about software bloat.  Presently Windows gets the file and goes to install it.  I am rewarded with:  The iPod "iPod" could not be restored.  An unknown error occurred (-50).  OK, so the Apple guy was right.  When it's in this state, it's a brick.  That's two of them that Apple's software update has brick.  Uh...wait a minute...what is Windows doing here?  On the Mac, the iPod vanished from iTunes and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to make iTunes see it again.  iTunes on Windows is something something...different.  It's telling me to do a restore.  Instead of me telling it to try again, it wants to try again.  OK, Windows; have at it!  Now iTunes on Windows is telling me that it's not authorized, but if I want to authorize it I should go to this menu and select the authorize button.  I do so, and it starts trying to install the software on the iPod again...  ...and miracle of miracles, it succeeds!!!  That's right, Windows can update an iPod Touch but Macintosh can not!  At this point, I'm in roll-on-the-floor-laughing mode.  I wasted a 50 mile trip and a few hours of my time, but I now have a great war story that I can needle Apple fanboys (and some Apple employees I know) for years to come.  I shall thoroughly enjoy doing so.  Hmm.  It's installed this iPod Touch in Japanese as well.  In other circumstances, I wouldn't mind; I have no problem reading Japanese.  But this test requires an English environment.  Fortunately, I find the necessary settings to fix that.  Next, it's time to start loading media.  Unfortunately, about half of the audio files I have on SD card on my Nokia N800 are Windows Media files.  iTunes refuses to deal with those, even though other media players do.  But I still have over a gig of MP3 files, and I put it to ripping some other CDs.  There's also a few gig worth of photos.  This all works uneventfully and presently it is all on iPod Touch.  As far as being a media player goes, iPod Touch works as smoothly as any other iPod.  Too bad it is so expensive and has such small capacity compared to other iPods.  Alright.  Let's put it through its paces as an Internet access device.  That was the whole purpose of this exercise.  I didn't need a media player; rather I wanted to determine if iPod Touch and iPhone really are suitable as Internet tablets.  It connected to my network at home without much difficulty, once I found its MAC address and put it in my access point's filters.  Memo to Apple: *always* print the MAC address of a device on the device.  Don't make people go hunting for it.  But now comes the real test: Starbucks!  Apple and Starbucks have this big relationship going on.  It's time to test that experience.  I already have a one-year T-Mobile Wi-Fi account, courtesy of my having purchased a pair of OLPCs last month.  I've used it a few times with my Nokia N800.  So I ought to be good to go.  Not quite.  I spent half an hour trying to get logged into the Starbucks Wi-Fi network.  At least 20 minutes of that was expended in figuring out that it was automatically capitalizing the first character of my password, and that was at least one of my problems.  I fix that setting.  In the course of all of this I apparently do get logged in, but there's no positive feedback to that effect.  The on-screen keyboard is a royal pain.  My wife is watching this sympathetically and asks, "isn't there a stylus to make it easier?"  I have to tell her that not only isn't there a stylus, but a stylus won't work -- you MUST use fingers.  I'm told that you get used to it after a while.  And it's true that the default on screen keyboard on the Nokia N800 sucks.  But clever people have made uim available on the N800; it's completely open source and there's a huge body of free software for it.  As I expected, the low resolution on iPod Touch is a problem.  iPod Touch's screen is about 3.5" diagonal.  Nokia N800's screen is about 4" diagonal and has twice as many pixels.  Text in web pages on the N800 is easily readable; on iPod you have to zoom in to read it.  Similarly, viewing photos on iPod is quite unsatisfactory compared to N800 (of course, N800 is unsatisfactory for photo viewing compared to a laptop or desktop).  Pixel counts matter!!!!  Turning to what is good on iPod...  The kinetic scrolling is nice.  It's small, thin, and cute; and comes in a charming package suitable for a Gold-Plated Lily-Draped Offering to Her Majesty The Queen.  The media playing, including song selection, works smoothly and quickly, which is more than you can say for media players on other devices.  There is little doubt why iPod rules the media player market.  By all means, if you want a media player, buy an iPod.  Just don't buy this iPod; it's far too expensive for the tiny bit of storage you get compared to the 160GB iPod Classic.  This product falls short, far short, as an Internet tablet.  Leaving aside the tiny screen resolution and being forced to use a touch-based on-screen keyboard (Nokia N800 has one too, but nobody uses it and instead used the stylus or Bluetooth), the closed nature of iPod Touch and iPhone keeps you from installing and using the vast library of free open-source software developed on the Internet in the past 37 years.  Most UNIX software (even large packages like Alpine) will run on the Nokia N800, unmodified, with just a recompilation in the N800's SDK (Scratchbox-based).  It was an exercise in frustration to get logged in on a public WiFi network that requires web-based login, and once I did the so-called "real Internet" that Apple brags about came up short.  The tiny resolution screen simple can not render readable web pages, even when held horizontal; it is necessary to zoom in to read the text.  Now, doubtless the fanboys are going to scream "but it's much smaller than the Nokia"...yes, but too small.  Actually, even with the form factor of iPod Touch they should have been able to get much higher resolution.  N800 has 800x480; iPod Touch has 480x320 which is less than half.  Yet N800 has only 1/2 inch greater screen diagonal.  My guess is that Apple got a good deal on older technology LCD screens that are obsolete in East Asia.  Note as well that Nokia has a newer model, N810, which is a slider with a chiklet keyboard; physically its size is between iPod Touch and N800 but it still has the same higher-resolution screen as N800.  This review is about iPod Touch, not iPhone; but I'll note that the smart phone vendors aren't particularly worried about iPhone.  iPhone is a toy for consumers and fanboys; it is not an enterprise product.  The bottom line is that this is an expensive toy aimed at fanboys.  Whatever it is that you might use it for, there's some other product that does a better job for less money.  In particular, as a media player, there are other Apple products that do a much better job for less money.

<Title>Better as a PDA than an iPod
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are looking for an iPod for watching movies or listening to music, go with the classic or the nano.  This product, although part of the iPod line, is not optimal.  It has relatively small capacity, larger size, and no way to control it outside of the touch screen.  It is also expensive compared to the other options.  On the other hand, if you are like me and wanted a decent PDA without getting the iPhone, this is the way to go.  As a mac user, all we have to use is Palm or use a 3rd party software program for Windows Mobile based PDAs.  Palm has not done a significant update to their product line in years.  With the new firmware, you can add calendar events, browse the internet, listen to music, lookup contacts, etc.  All with the touch of your finger.  So as a PDA - 5 stars.  As a music player, about 3.  In total, its about a 4.

<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I already owned various apple ipod products but still wanted to get my hands on the new itouch. In the beginning, I was very hesistant because of the price $399 and also the size 16GB but in the end I have learned to love this new toy of mine.  Setup and Sync was a breeze. The design is very slick and touch screen very innovative. Playing videos was very crisp and clear quality. Settings and WiFi setup was very easy. Safari browsing was a little straining on the eyes. YouTube videos was fun though.   What I would like to see from Steve Jobs early next year is minimum 30GB itouch along with Radio. I really don't see how the new Zune models will pose any competition here.    After one week of having this, I realized that if I had no other Apple ipod products, the itouch would have been the greatest player i had ever own. But in the end, its the touch screen and bigger screen size that I found exciting.  If you have never own a mp3 media player, this is the one to get since nothing out there even comes close.

<Title>Good work from Apple, but still rooms for impove
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got it month ago, and love it. Spent hrs and hrs with it, and quite fun.  The reason for four star is that the quality of the LCD screen is not as expected. I did some online research. My ipod has serial number of 1A74XXXXX, which means the lcd should not experiencing the widely discussed issue of ``dark negative'' a month ago. However, when playing the video in some dark scene, I have to head on the screen. Any small horizontal tilting down (title up is ok) will lead to the obvious``negative'' effect.   I am personally ok with the issue since I rarely watch video, and most of my pictures have bright background. I also compare the LCD screen with my PSP with some online testing picture (for contract, saturation etc.) the difference is obvious and my PSP screen performs way better. Also the color tone of the PSP also more vivid in some video play back. For example when play back the ``Ratatouille (2007)'' (ripped dvd) the rat chief in PSP colored gray with lots of blue (same color when play with my dvd on tv). while in ipod touch the color is pure gray.  Just hope Apple will notice the issue, and make it better in the future version.

<Content>The iPod touch is superb. I'm demoing it to everyone I know or work with and everyone is amazed. Everyone (ages between 10 to 80) wants one and uses it after 60 seconds of training. My simple advice is: "go and buy one".   Is nice, and everything it does, it does well. Music, Videos, Photos and web surfing are great.  I commute daily and use it to see movies in the metro, to hear music, and also to surf the web when in a hotspot. All ok.  Advice: use it with iPod-prone rings, I've scratched it a little and stopped using rings altogether.  Missing things: I would want to be able to add new apps/games, to be able to have some photos in better definition than "only one" (and good), to have an independent volume between music and videos, and to be able to zoom into videos (only available in photos, at the moment).

<Title>best ipod made to date
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this ipod was a great improvement over my 20GB photo ipod. the internet feature is great and i dont notice any of the problems with the screen that others have mentioned. as well as people calling hte album flow useless, i think its great, its an interesting way to browse your albums and its all i use now. as well as the clock feature is very convienient (my ipod doubles as a watch) so its easy to check to time with it. realy the only thing i dont like about it is how much they took out to make sure they still sell iphones. it would have been a nice to be able to hve an email program on it but its not too bad, as well as takeing out the feature to add events in the calender makes it kidna worthless.  to sum it all up this ipod is great for people who want a PDA minus the phone and lives up to its ipod name with the music and video section. well worth the money. but if you want more storage then the larger ipod classic is waht you should get.

<Content>A very cool gadget for gifting. Slightly on the expensive side, but it's worth it. With its WI-FI internet availability, you can carry it everywhere and check your email/browse for your needs (since WI-FI is available in most of the places now. "You tube" is another big asset.

<Title>WHAT?
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Why the heck are so many people drooling over this thing? Seriously! Luckily I don't own one but my close friend of four years does and trust me, I've toyed with it for long periods at a time making a serious attempt at finding out why someone would cash out !!$400!! for a sixteen gig "touchscreen iPod! Is that why people want this? Because when you touch it, it goes to a different page? The new nano has each and every single feature this player has, except for the internet which itself cost a monthly bill, and the nano is $200's less! PLEASED! I am not biased but DO NOT WASTE YOUR EXTREMELY HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS! If you want a nice and sturdy touch screen device, get the iPhone which is SO MUCH more worth your money. TAKE MY ADVICE! GET A 3RD GENERATION IPOD NANO and a SONY PSP! That way you get all the feature this mere sixteen gig device has and it would COST EVEN LESS! Or better yet, get yourself a 160 gig classic which is 50 dollars less.
