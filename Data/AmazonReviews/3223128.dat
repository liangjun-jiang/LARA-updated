<Title>Excellent player
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had this player for almost 1 month. I've tried all the functions except recording and here are my impressions.  Positive Points: - Superb, and I really mean it, superb screen. I've compared it against friends with Ipod (too small screen) and creative Zen Vision (not so sharp and bright) - Very good sound for this kind of device - Enough space for all my music (50Gb), and also to carry plenty of movies and store my photos. - Easy to use interface for basic functions. - Very easy to transfer music and videos using Windows Media Player - Easy connection to TV to view movies stored in the unit with excellent quality (of course depending of the compression used for the movie itself). Note that the docking station IS NOT required to connect it to the TV to watch movies(another reviewer wrongly complained about this) - Absolute value for money  Not so positive points: - Access to advanced functions (secondary menu) not very intuitive. - The auto setting for screen size does not work very weel. It will always expand the picture to fill the viewing area this results in losing part of the picture with movies in wide-screen format. It can be solved by selecting "original format" but it is irritating, given that most of the movies today are in WS format. - it has a "bookmark" function that can be used with any file to mark important points. Generally this is would be a great feature to go back to wherever you stopped playing, however since no name can be given to the bookmark, it is impossible to go back to it unless you remember the exact file you were listening to, and to go back to it you'll have to scroll through all files in the list. Imagine you set the bookmark and stop, lets say , on file number 250 of a list containing several hundred.. then you go and watch a movie or whatever (there's a resume function but only goes back to the item currently played, the movie in this case) and try after that to go back to the mp3 you were listening to... good luck. - When charging the unit there's no indicator to show how much has already been charged.  Overall I'm extremely pleased with this device.

<Title>Good Device 
<Date>Wed Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Update  The new firmware update solved all the previously mentioned problems , Since then , the device is great , I'm increasing my rate to excellent after more than a year of use     Really a very handy Device ,Great in play back all kind of Riped movies ,Especially after using the PC translator on the included CD. In my opinion the DVR is the Future ,But of course Archos still need  to do some work on it, I get a lot of Error messages during recording witch resulted in losing many chances to record things I want ,I contacted the Customer Support and they told me to run the window Scan disk & Defrag . The Defrag takes a round 3 hours on the 100GB model if you are using 50% of the HD capacity. I just had one right now & while I wright this review the AV500 is connected to the PC & Norton Scan disk is running on it & this is another 2 hours . Matter of Fact Every time I get the Error Message from the recording module the HD Defrag & Scan disk solves it , I got it more 4 times till now , It's really annoying. The MP3 is Fantastic Especially the Super Bass Slider , You can get a Real Great sound but not with the included Headphone , Get the Koss KTXPRO1 Titanium Portable Headphones with Volume Control .  Final Conclusion This is a Great Device But with an Error that takes 5 hours of HD maintenance , BUT it works Every time ( Till Now).

<Title>The perfect media player
<Date>Thu Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I finally decided to get an MP3 player because I was getting tired of searching for and loading CDs in my car's changer.  I wanted as much storage capacity as possible so I could keep my entire music library in my car, which is the only place I listen to music.    My research led me to the 60 GB Ipod and then I found the Archos.  Not only does it have more space (100 GB), but a bigger screen (but it is also bigger and heavier than the Ipod.)  However, now I could use the Archos to store my daughter's videos for trips and ditch the heavy DVD player and discs.  Plus it has a built in speaker, which is necessary since my daughter refuses to use earphones.    Transfering files from Windows XP is easy.  Video transfer is as simple as plugging the Archos into a DVD player and recording as the DVD is played.  A more complicated approach is to rip the DVD on a PC and recode using MPEG-4.  For car/travel the Archos is great.  For those who need a player while jogging/biking, something smaller without all the video functions might be a better choice.

<Title>Why I like my AV500, also why I don't love it
<Date>Thu Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Like many of you I spent a good deal of time to deciding on which portal media device would best suit my needs. Ultimately I decided on the Archos, primarily because it was repeatedly said that it's, "Probably the best option for those who could afford it."  Why I like the AV500: One of the best features of this device is that it allows other mass storage devices to be connected to it. What this means is that I can connect my external USB 2.0 hard drive to the AV500 and it will let me copy or even play directly from the extenal HD. This allows you to use regular hard drives effectively boosting the allowed capacity - also allowing multiple drives holding different kinds of data (for instance, I have a ton of TV series and movies on an 80 gig external HD). This USB option also allows me to conect my SD card reader to my AV500 and copy to and from my SD cards. I can do this anywhere, and where I use my Dell AXIM to watch movies and listen to music, I can change out my 1GB SD in my car or at work.  The capacity is fantastic even on it's own (I needed something that would hold my collection of over 40gigs of MP3s).  The viewing angles this device supports are fanatastic. When I was showing it to people they didn't have to all cluster together into one massive hydra to see the screen. It supports mass storage mode - thus becoming an external USB HD.  Why I don't love my AV500: The hard key controls are difficult at best, especialy when you're used to a PDA's touch screen Often when I'm moving or copying I wish I could just press the button (and sometimes I forget I can't).   The buttons - yes, this deserves a second mention. They feel shoddy and breakable. They also are not recessed making them easily pressed, especially when attempting to close the carrying case.  The carrying case - I guess you can say it's better than nothing at all, but that's not a compliment. You can't close the case with the headphone jack in - other owners might disagree with this, and I have been able to close it with them in, however, a quarter of the time I was able to squeeze it shut I ended up pressing a button (the cover lays on the buttons as they, again, aren't recessed). Closing the case in general (headphones in or not) you tend to press a button accedentally. The case could best be explainned as a "keep from scratching when it's in your bag" solution. I would have liked to see something with a latch where you can wear the AV500 on your hip or what not - mostly for walking or transport. As an update: the lid to the case can flip over and, using the same button/latch that keeps it shut, instead allow it to act as a stand.   It's lack of mutlitasking support is extremely annoying! It baffle's common sense trying to figure out why this option was left out. I'd love to be able to browse through my pictures while listenning - or put on a nice slide show. You can browse the HD structure, but attempting to interact with the folders or files at all (for instance, renaming) will result in the music being stopped.  I expected it to display a picture (perhaps one named "folder.jpg") in the same folder as the music is being played. It does display an embedded image from the MP3 if the file contains one - this is the future of MP3, but still, support for the past and not requireing me to go back over all my albums and re-encode them with an image would have been nice.  It's not a portable option. It's bulky and heavy; it's button's... yeah, I mentioned this twice already; tt's screen is very easily smudged - It's not an iPod! I don't mean this as a bad thing, but I bought it to compete with the iPod, instead of a Portable Media Player, I got a Portable Media Center - if it had wireless B or G support I would marry it! But I would not take it to the gym and I would not even attempt to run with it. If you could see it more as a hub or base of operations for your media experience, you'd be better off.  Summary: It's not as portable as the other devices thus you'd likely need some other device (with mass storage mode support) to get the full PMP experience, and use the AV500 as a base of operations transfering music back and forth. It's price is very reasonable for what it does. I don't use it's DVR features so I can't comment on this aspect. It's interface is dodgy (though the iconic display is nice) - why no touch screen? I'd have paid the extra for this option.  If you don't need this for when your on the go or at the gym, grab it and enjoy!

<Title>Great Product, PlaysForSure functionality not there
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product after doing alot of research, and have been very pleased with the performance.  It actually works as a Napster to Go compatible product, so transfer of playlists, etc is very easy.  I've found that the easiest way to copy movies is to use my DVD player, and that works well.  I've got about 100 songs, 250 photos (at 5mp resolution), and 7 full-length movies and still have 70GB of memory available.  Battery life has been okay, the included earphones need improvement, it's a good idea to buy the extra power/charging cord for travel.  I travel to Hong Kong regularly, and the movies on the airlines are unsatisfactory, so I'm looking forward to enjoying this on my 14 hour flight!!

<Title>Beware Of This Company
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Though I am not prone to writing these kinds of things I thought I'd better after my recent experience with Archos.  This company, hands down has the worst costumer service I've ever had to deal with.  You be the judge.  I bought a Gmini 200 last Feburary.  It worked ok but froze up alot.  Then in Oct. it wouldn't charge any more.  After a few calls and e-mails I get an RMA and send it back.  One month later a replacement arrives.  Two months later the hard drive on this one goes.  I loose everything.  A few more phone calls to their costumer service and I get another RMA and send it back.  For the next month I must have called at least 10 times about the player.  Each time I'm on hold for a minimum of 45 minutes.  When I do get through I get all kinds of confusion about my player.  A couple of times they have no record of receiving the player.  They loose me in their system.  They tell me three times that they are sending a new one and will e-mail me.  They don't and it never arrives.  Finally, fed up I request a supervisor.  He's sympathetic, apologizes and says for my troubles he will send me an upgrade to the Gmini 400.  Weeks go by and yet I call but no player.  I'm told they are on back order.  Finally nearly two months since sending it back the second time my new player arrives.  And oh, by the way it's not the upgraded player I was told they were sending.  So for the year thay I owned the Gmini 200 I've had it in my possession for nine months.  Since the warranty has now expired I asked if they would extend it.  They said sure, no problem, we'll send you an e-mail confirming.  Well that's been two weeks ago and I've given up any hope.    Sometimes a product is only as good as it's costumer service.  I've learned my lesson with Archos and only hope people will read and consider this if thinking about spending their hard earned money on such incompetence.

<Title>Love it - after a couple months solid use
<Date>Fri Apr 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I expect a lot out of a high tech toy -- and this thing grabbed me right out of the box. I waited a couple months before reviewing - to be sure there weren't any hidden issues.  For many long plane flights I wanted to bring   selected TV shows from my Media Center PC DVR. This syncs without a hitch using Windows Media Player 10 (the only hitch, perhaps, is that you have to find the folder where Media Center stores video and drag and drop files from there -- quite easy). The file compression for the device is handled automatically. Video quality is superb - just the right size for personal viewing.  Way easier than hauling out the laptop on a plane or anywhere else.  I found it easy to record whole DVDs to it as well - they also get automattically compressed, but with excellent image and audio on playback.   An unexpected bonus for me is the built mics for stereo audio recording.  The quality is great and I find I'm using that feature quite a bit.   It looks and feels solid and I've had nothing but good luck with mine so far.

<Title>Get a Pocket Dish! For the inner geek in you!
<Date>Sat Apr 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is very feature rich product but also very buggy. It is not as easy as an iPod to use, but I still like it better. If you use Dish Network, then I would recommend going for a pocket-dish version of Archos AV500 (30GB). Check it out at pocketdish.com. You can easily move the programs from the DVR to device. I prefer this because  it gives easy access to good quality content. I have to re-start my Dish Network before connecting my device; I found that to be a pain.

<Title>Archos AV 500 pros and cons versus iPod/iTunes
<Date>Fri May 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overview: The device feels very well manufactured and looks fantastic (web pictures just do not do it justice).  Perspective: I have been waiting for the rumored video iPod to be released (the one with the large display), but my patients ran out.  We are an iPod and iTunes family - my wife and daughter both have iPods.    Pros: 1. The display is awesome - very clear, sharp and bright.  To test the display, I brought the device with me to my daughter's soccer game and watched a movie...I was surprised that the glare from the sun did not wash out the display. 2. I still use iTunes to buy and listen to music on my PC; however, I use Media Player 10 to synch everything to my Archos.  I simply set Media Player up to monitor my iTunes directory.  Synch can be set up to happen automatically and I was surprised how easy to use it was (this isn't and Archos issue, but a selling point none the less).  Once songs are transferred, Archos uses the data in the song files to automatically organize them by artist, album, genre, year, etc...  One item to note for iTunes users: I do not store the songs I buy from iTunes in their proprietary format (I use MP3), which makes the synch to Archos much easier. 3. Pictures and the little movies made with digital cameras come across seamlessly. 4. Movies stored on the Archos can be watched on TV by using the included adapters.  I was very surprised at the high quality of the movies when viewed on the TV.  A 600 MB movie played with TV quality results.  The movies have a DVD quality when viewed on the Archos directly.  Cons: 1. User interface: The user interface is not very intuitive to perform some pretty basic tasks, like moving files.  This is not a big deal as you get use to it, but it is a bad design.  This did not impact my review score. 2. Play lists have to be rebuilt on the device - they do not sync. This again is not an issue for me, but probably will be for some users.  This did not impact my review score. 3. You cannot listen to music while you are browsing the menu.  This is irritating and did impact the review score.  Additional notes:  1.	Moving home movies over is easy, but backing up DVDs will be more difficult because of the encryption used. 2.	I have not yet tried to use the DVR capabilities, but the scheduler looks pretty straight forward.  Overall this is truly a great device, one of the best technology purchases I have made and I have no regrets about not waiting for the video iPod.

<Content>Wow... I got this item in the mail about 12 days ago and i've been checking the price since then.  It's dropped in price twice since then.  First by 20.00, then by another 30.00.  It seems like the price is dropping quickly!  Keep an eye on this, Amazon offers a price adjustment for the difference if you call customer service and request an adjustment within 30 days of your purchase date.

<Title>Excellent, but not perfect.
<Date>Thu May 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My first review was way too long, so I scrapped it and I'm starting over. I'll try to be brief because if I'm not, no one will ever read this and then what's the point?  GOOD:  * The screen is awesome. Resolution is stunning and brightness is perfect. Maybe it'll suck outdoors, but if I'm outdoors, I shouldn't be watching TV anyway. =)   * The file navigation rocks. It maintains all the same subfolder I've created over the years, and I love that. Dragging and dropping files as if it were nothing more than an external hard drive is brilliant, plain and simple.  * Build quality seems solid and strong through-out.  BAD:  * The audio quality (out the earphone jack) is acceptable at best. With headphones, an FM transmitter or a tape adapter, I don't imagine its shortcomings would be noticable. However, in a side-by-side comparison with my iPod, Dell notebook, and XBox, all playing the exact same MP3 through the exact same stereo (Pink Floyd - Sheep - 320kbps, Yamaha 7.1 receiver, Sapphire STII speakers), the Archos sounded noticably and frustratingly flatter than all the others. Thankfully I had no intentions of using this device at home, because if I did, it'd be back in the box, re-shrink-wrapped and on a shelf somewhere far, far away from me.  * While attached as a USB device, the battery doesn't recharge, even though 2.0 would support this. As if that wasn't bad enough, the LCD doesn't even turn off, so basically it's draining battery power as quickly as possible now. Ridiculous.  VERDICT:  Awesome-ness of the screen trumps all. This is a video device, after all.

<Title>GREAT!  
<Date>Sat Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>For what it is, it's a great product.  I bought the 100GB to get my money's worth.  I wanted to record tv for free and use the minicam accessory you can no longer buy.  I returned the minicam for the low resolution.  I use it for security and people's faces are somewhat blurry.  I've read some bad reviews about customer service.  I had a hard time until I went up the chain of command and contacted corporate headquarters.  I talked with a marketing director and things got taken care of quickly.  The only problem with the unit is that it is not a truly walk-around type of device.  It is very bulky after it is in a jacket pocket.  I'm going to buy the 30gb video ipod as well for its size and for the free podcasts.  After all, I just want to watch a tv show while I'm sipping coffee or waiting for a friend.  I have the Archos for whole movies and for that it is a truly pocket sized hard drive dvd player.

<Title>TRULY AWESOME!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The AV500 is one gadget that I've grown to love.  The 4" screen is just beautiful.  People may complain about the size, that it's bulkier than an iPod or a Zen M, but those players do not have a 4" screen nor do they have direct recording capabilities.  Its size is remarkably small for what it can do, and trust me, it can do alot more than most think.    I've owned a video iPod, a Zen Vision as well as a Zen Vision-M.  Those gadgets only stayed with me for a short while and were eventully sold on ebay. The AV500 surpasses all my expectations on video playback and recording capabilities.  The bottom line is, the AV500  - plays videos and displays pictures on built-in 4" LCD or an external TV (using the provided AV hook-up) - records videos directly from DVD player or cable/satelite boxes - plays MP3s - 4 1/2 houurs of video playback w/ standard battery (extended battery only available for the 100gb provides 9 hrs of video playback, but is purchased separately) - transfer and store photos directly from the camera using a cable (no need for the PC) - angle viewing is not an issue (unlike w/ the Zen Vision, where it has to be directly front view)  Yes, you shouldn't go jogging with the AV500 and I wouldn't advise jogging w/ anything that has a hard drive.  For that, I strongly suggest using a flash base player.  I own the 30gb version and I just recently bought the 100gb from Amazon.  I just wish they made more accessories for it.    If you want a video player with a great screen that also records directly, this one is for you.

<Title>Great Device Once You Figure It Out.
<Date>Fri Jun 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Archos AV500 is no joke. It truly does allow you to do everything it states. It just has a bit of a learning curve. Do not expect it to work just like your best friend's ipod. I got all my 2000+ songs on the device with no trouble at all, but the key factor (recording video) just wasnt working for me. After owning my AV500 for about 6 hours I had every intention of sending it back and giving it a terrible review on Amazon.com. I swore it was the most user unfrendly thing I'd ever used. I slept on my frustration and approched the device the next morning. I was not going to let my new toy defeat me. By that afternoon, I was watching Revenge of the Sith and Band of Brothers in perfect DVD quality. Now, almost a week later I am just simply loving my AV500. It goes everywhere with me and I've mastered it down to the littlest detail. When your looking for the best in DVR and portable entertainment, look no further than this. It works wonderfully and the screen is awesome. When looking at it from every angle, there is no glare. This makes it easy for people at your sides to enjoy videos also. The resolution is terrific and navigating thru files is simple. And the fact that you can store music on here is no tack-on. The quality you get out of the music is fantastic too. I did go out and buy some better headphones as the earbuds supplied where too big for my eyes and a bit chinsy in quality. However, the actual device is no joke. It is quality and you feel privilleged to hold it. Another thing I should point out before closing is that the battery life is awesome - 15 hours of audio, about 5 hours of video. The battery did not almost make the estimated time, it surpassed it. So that makes me really happy. I also had really great technical support when stumped on a few things. The Archos AV500 is a great, great little toy that does everything it promises. The only thing I suggest is reading the manual and contacting support because your bound to be stumped on a few things. But once you learn the basics, this thing couldn't be easier. Absolutley Wonderful. Thanks for reading.

<Title>"The absolute, very best PVP/PMP on the market as of 5/22/06, bar none!"
<Date>Sat Jun 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I love this gadget. It almost does everything. My primary reason for buying is the fact that I can backup my DVD's on the unit, w/o using a computer. When I was looking to upgrade from my Creative Nomad Zen Xtra 30 GB, I was looking at the Creative Vision M (30gb) and the Cowon A2 (30gb). I was that close to buying the Creative Vision M (never once considered the Ipod Video) until I happened upon the AV500 in Frys and compared all the features. Except for the price tag, the AV500 eclipsed the Vision M in all areas imo. I initially held off buying the AV500 because of the steep price.  I can honestly say that I am yet to experience any of the flaws that some reviewers have posted. My unit has never frozen, not once. The fact that I now don't have to lug around my huge DVD case and the fact that I can play my movies on a regular TV at work are huge pluses in my book. This little gadget in the one to have. It's funny how I used to be in awe of one of my fellow co workers RCA Lyra and the videos he had on board. Not anymore, that's for sure. This is a great product and one that I'm glad I purchased. I highly recommend this product, Monkboon....  +'s: (1) 100GB of memory (More that any computer in our house) (2) Can backup/rip personal DVD's w/o the use of a computer. (My primary reason for the purchase. (Now I don't have to lug around DVD's and cases everywhere.) (3) Can be used as a DVR to record your favorite TV shows from your Cable box, VCR or basically anything you can think of. (4) Complete ease of use. (5) Has a picture viewer.(Holds like a trillion pictures.) (6) Has a voice recorder. (I'll never use it, but it's there if I need one.) (7) Can pretty much record any type of video from many different formats. (I recorded my kids playing XBOX games just to fool around with the video settings) (8) Replaces your current MP3 player. I just transferred 5714 songs and it's barely using 8 gigs. (9) Easy to transfer files and navigate. (10) Screen is larger than most video players of this caliber. (11) Can view movies from the unit on your Television. (12) Can create and edit play lists on the fly. (13) Exceptional battery life for this type of device.  -`s: (1) Not really a -, but something that would have been nice is if there were a FM tuner. (2) Missing a hole for the AC adapter when the unit is in the closed case. (nit picky) (3) One must connect the unit to the computer to access the "real" user manual. (4) Terrible speaker, you will need headphones (I have BOSE) unless using quality external speakers. (5) Had issues syncing with WMP10 and play lists. Had to use Creative Media Player to transfer 5500 songs from my computer. The WMP10 issue is more than likely my inability to do anything worthwhile with Windows Media. So again, this may not be a con. (6) Some movies/DVD's will not play on the unit or television.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase.

<Content>I bought my AV500 in May from Amazon.  It worked well until early July when the external sound from the built in speakers went out on the unit.  I called Archos Technical Support. They told me it was a hardware problem, that I would need to send it back for repair and that they would email me an RMA with return instructions in two days. Two weeks and multiple emails and phone calls later, I still don't have an RMA with instructions on how to send the unit back for repair.  Archos keeps telling me how sorry they are for the inconvenience and that they are continuing to look into why the warehouse hasn't contacted me. Customer returns are a routine function of most businesses.  There is no justifiable reason why a customer should be kept waiting over two weeks and counting just to get instructions on how to make a return.  This is the first and last Archos product I will buy.  Customer support is a critical component in selling a complex and expensive product like the AV500.  In my opinion, Archos' customer service is essentially non-existent.  Given Archos' demonstrated lack of customer service, I am now concerned that if I ever do get the chance to send the unit back for repair, I will never see it again.  Archos could learn a few things from Amazon which has the best customer service I have ever seen. I buy a great deal from Amazon even though they are often not the lowest priced precisely because of their great customer service.    The picture and video quality of the Archos are excellent.  However, I found the dedicated A/V cables too short to easily connect to the TV.  Recording video on the AV500 is not a simple process for people who are not technologically sophisticated. The instructions for recording off the TV are not helpful unless you have the exact hardware setup described in the written and video instructions Archos provides.

<Title>Fantastic  Road Warrior Companion
<Date>Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I travel weekly via plane, and have had some sort of PDA /MP3 type device since 2000.  I started with Creative's Nomad Jukebox, 40 gig, CD PLayer sized device at about 10 oz., and for the last few years have had a Creative Zen X-tra 30 gig.  I'm a bit older, and frankly am tired of looking at a microscopic LCD screen, that you can hardly see.  Also Album Art is important to me, because frequently if I see an Album I'm interested in, I can't remember sometimes if I have it or not by looking at the song, as much as the graphic; also Titles like #1's, and Greatest Hits all start looking the same.  There's psychology for me in being able to look at the Album Cover! From what I read folks buy the Archos for video playing and recording, not primarily for MP3s; and not for carrying while jogging.  I bought it after reading all the other reviews primarily to hold my MP3 collection on a bright screen and display album art. First of all I've used it now about 3 weeks and the device is flawless!!!  I spent easily 30 hours though re-organizing my MP3 album collection, cleaning up duplicates, re-ripping CD's that software applied the wrong tags too, or put in Unknown albums.  I bought Tag and Rename online to help me do this; and in cases where it couldn't find album art, I did a google search and found jpeg covers, saved them and added them to the tags. I tried to load my newly cleaned-up collection to my Zen Xtra and found that WindowsMediaPlayer10, created duplicate libraries.  Afraid to corrupt my Archos, I transferred the library manually to the Archos putting it in HardDrive mode.  Since doing this I have grown to love HradDrive mode to manage the data on the Archos and my laptop and home PCs.  It is so easy to drag and drop and don't have to worry about synch issues.  I even talked to Archos Tech support, and the rep I talked to said he doesn't use Windows Media Player to synch, does it manual too. As one reviewer wrote the navigation buttons are not quite intuitive; but after about 2 weeks of working with the Archos, I really appreciate their set-up over any other device I've worked with.  The bookmark function is great, and the resume feature I love.  The audio quality is right up there with Creative's; and the screen is awesome.  The overall quality of the hardware is a good 4 stars, 5 stars would be something really rugged for me. The little tiny speaker that plays music is not great, but not bad to let you hear something in a pinch; like test a song, etc, or listen to a movie privately.  I use either Sennheiser headphones or Bose. When the track plays, it displays the album art, but not as you page through the music list.  But at least I can find the cover and get to know what I have. Now video.  I told you already I bought this to be a great MP3 player, not video; but anything I got with video for me was a bonus.  Well I didn't realize that as a Personal Video Recorder it will record video, right from a source.  But for me with travelling, I don't want to have to carry another device, open my laptop in a tiny airline seat, or worry about my battery dying.  Also I didn't want to take the time to record a DVD from a DVD player to play on the Archos.  For me it's easier to rip a video if I could.  I don't condone illegal sharing, but making a copy for myself, of movies that if they weren't portable, I'd never find time to watch; is legal as far as I'm concerned.  While Archos won't sell or support this, I bought an IM TOO DVD ripper package on the web, and am trialing DVDIdle's CSS and Region free.  I have successfully ripped about 4 movies, including Chronicles of Narnia.  There's some slight choppiness in the ripped movies, which are probably a techinical issue, because they are slightly choppy or hesitate a tiny bit, on my laptop ripped or the Archos, unrelated to the Archos.  But not enough to really effect playability.  Anyway the movies for me are AWESOME on the ARCHOS.  Picture quality is bright, audio is great; and action flows nice except for what I noted.  The side angle viewing is not bad.  The device performs really well; is very pleasing to work with and operate.  I'm considering buying an extended warranty in the next week.  I've had some of these warranties before for other products, and if you ever get a ding on the device, they probbably won't repair it, because they'll say you caused the damage; even when you didn't.  But for 29.99 for 2 years I think it's worth a shot.  Archos Tech support said they get calls about the devices freezing-up, but then those are the only calls they get? so how many really do? They told me to keep the unit backed-up so if I have to re-format I could. Also, as you can use the device USB Media Player or as a USB hard drive; Archos is very specific about telling you that if you have it in USB mode, you can "just" disconnect it; but if it's hard drive mode, do a safely remove hardware in windows before disconnecting.  Well because I have it plugged into the USB port, I forgot several times, and pulled it out, in hard drive mode w/o doing the safely remove.  So I taped a tiny note right on the USB plug, and was able to break the USB pull habit, and have always done the safely remove.  As I said I just love the convenience on any computer recognizing this as a HardDrive.  I've just started putting photos on it, and some personal movies, and getting all this in one small device; makes this worth it.  This is certainly an expensive item, but for weekly travel and portability, and being able to see a screen!!!, it's nice home away from home!

<Title>I like the design of the av400 alot better
<Date>Fri Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>So far the Av500 is a winner for me only in that it has more than triple the harddrive space than my Av400 has. I don't like that it's more bulkier and the button pad is not finger friendly. list.  Sometimes it shows up and sometimes I cannot find out how to bring it up.  The little speaker is so useless. It has a very tiny sound. The Av400 was just as bad but at least you could hear content clearly. On the bright side, the screen size is nice and it does support a basic wmv format along with Avi's which is an improvement over the AVI limited Av400.  So all n all, get this to store lots of content and then get a Cowon A2 too. Also stay tuned for the Av505 which supposedly will have a bigger harddrive version of 160 gb and better button/navigation interface. There's no PMP that is a slam dunk winner. They all have flaws and strengths. Enjoy!

<Title>Great for on the go. Extremely Happy!
<Date>Wed Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After reading all of the reviews.  I read the entire product manual that is available on this page before I purchased this Item.  Once I got it in the mail.  I read over the manual that was included in the box which is for the very basics.  In order to completely get the full understanding and know how to operate it you must definately read the extended manual.  It is very easy to operate once you read it.  I initially bought this to have my son's video's for road trips and I found myself putting my husbands and my favorite DVD's on here as well.  I put my mp3's by using the hard drive feature.  This is truly a great device, it really does all the things that is featured.  I didn't like the sound at first but after going in and adjusting the setting in the main menu.  I am very pleased with the sound. I love that I am able to plug this into a TV  to view the movies that I have in my media player.  I haven't had enough time to test the battery life.  I am looking forward to seeing if it will really go six hours when we go to hawaii this winter.  The main reason I love this device is for the storage on this device.  I haven't had any problems with my device and I purchased it in June.  I wanted to wait a while before writing a review because I based my purchase on the reviews.  If you have had problems return it and get another one.  Maybe it was just a bad unit.  You won't be dissapointed.  Great product!

<Title>So Far, I'm Very Satisfied
<Date>Sun Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've had the product for a month now and I haven't had any lock-up, connection or any other problems other reviewers wrote about.    I was able to connect it to my tv, vcr or dvd in minutes and start recording, no problem.  I do agree that the speaker volume is way too low.   You can adjust the video recording volume.  I would recommend setting it to the highest level before making a recording, that helps, but with cd's there's not much you can do.   Archos claims you can store up to 250 movies, but that is with the lowest resolution which I think is horrible.  With acceptable resolution, you'll get more like 100 movies. Also if you record some dvd's, they are playable on the device, but not thru your tv because of copyright protection. This is annoying.   I would also recommend not using windows to put music on it.  This is where the lock-ups occur.  I use it as a hard drive device and have had no problems.   I haven't had any dealing with customer service and I hope not to from what I've read.  I'm very careful with it, even though it does seem very sturdy and well made. I am definitely backing up important files.  It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of the low speaker volume, the carrying case is poorly designed, the lowest video resoultion is unwatchable and it doesn't accept any text file formats which archos advertising claims it did. Overall though, I think all my research paid off and I'm very happy.

<Title>Save your Money
<Date>Sun Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you are looking for a DVR that you can use with your Home AV system and take on the road, save your money and do not buy this device.  The menuing system is HORRIBLE.  Why they invented button icons instead of using standard conventions is beyond me.  There should be one SELECT button, but there are several, depending upon which menu you are in.  Just changing the sound from headphones to internal speaker is difficult.  The internal speaker is OFF when it looks like it is on, and ON when it looks like it is off.  You must also keep movie file size around 1gb or the playback will only show up to that point!  Hooking it up to a home system works, but can be tricky depending upon the number of inputs you have on your home theater system.  It is a cool device, but the drawbacks make it not worth the price.  I'm a total techie, and this device stays in a drawer because it is just too difficult to work the device.

<Content>Just like one of the previous user/buyer mentioned, it looked complicated but was really an excellent device once you get to figure out how it really works...my only problem now is how to record tv shows directly to this device and I would have given it a 5 stars then...I have to add that customer service did a good job when I needed assistance too...

<Title>Super fine 
<Date>Thu Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got one for my daughter about 10 months ago for photo storage while traveling.  It worked just great until 2 days before she had to fly to Italy.  Photo download is almost automatic if using a flash card reader and a mini-USB plug.  I ended up getting an Archos 604 wifi for her trip ( a really neat unit but everything is extra- no built-in mini-USBs, no A/V jacks, no AC charger, but a trippy touchscreen and 30GB is a LOT of room= about 1000 photos + 400 songs + 12 movies, and still less than 1/3 full), while sending the AV500 in for warranty repair. The AV500 had a squashed 100GB drive from a swollen THICK battery- stay away from these batteries. ONLY Archos can replace the hard drives- has to do with HDD/firmware serial numbers.  I just got it back after 2 weeks and the drive was replaced with a 120GB drive, but the right button worked intermittently (I opened it up and cleaned the contacts on the circuit (film) board = now OK.  DO NOT do this if you have any warranty left- send it in.  There are plenty of horror stories about warranty work quality, but they did right by me- this time!  Video quality is perfect for me- great contrast, good resolution for my dvdfa3 480x272 vob-avi converted files.  Audio playback/volume is outstanding (for me).  The one tiny speaker is a joke.I haven't tried any video camera recording, so can't say yea or nay. I like it!  It's a little bit thicker than the new Archos stuff, but you get everything in one small box!

<Title>Great portable entertainment
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We have had our 2 Archos 500's for exactly 1 year and they have been heavily used and loved in our house. Perfect for traveling, going out to restaurants - we actually get to eat our dinner because of these pocket miracles!   I have been so impressed with how durable the units are. Our kids are age 6, 4 and 2 and as you can guess these poor units have been handeled with sticky hands and dropped countless times, and the units kept on ticking. Wouldn't you know it that it would be me (the adult) who would drop and break one of the pocket dishes.  Since the unit was just shy of a year old it was still under warrenty. I called the customer service number on the Archos website and get this - A LIVE PERSON ANSWERED THE PHONE AFTER 3 RINGS! No press 1,2 or 3, just a real nice person who quickly helped me and emailed me my RA number. My unit is being repaired now, but we are still enjoying our other pocket dish when we go out to eat, in the car or plane.   If you have Dish Network it is so easy to hook up to your DVR and download onto the unit. We do not use the external speaker, but it works great with a headphone splitter so multiple people can watch and hear.   Got kids....Got a Dish Network DVR? This is the perfect traveling accessory! Amazingly super sturdy and extremely friendly customer service.  Bravo Archos!
