<Title>what I've been looking for all along...
<Date>Wed Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>With my new 60gb video ipod, I've enjoyed DLO's transpod, but have always wanted a wireless remote to use with it and the iJet is it! It has a 30 pin passthrough so with the iJet receiver plugged in you can still plug it into your charger or the transpod. And the range is apparently much better than the Griffin remote product (in a head to head test, I estimate the iJet has about 2x the range). The remote is water resistant and does volume control, skip forward and backward as well as fast forward/reverse WITHIN the song. It also will pause and has an energy saving feature when paused for a bit. And very exciting, the receiver that plugs into the ipod will work with the new two way remote that is being released soon (allowing you to see the title and artist of each song on the new remote with an LCD screen). Great product at a great price (and comes in white or black to match your ipod).

<Title>nice, but only controls headphone audio
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just purchased "iJet wireless remote with bottom dock". Overall it seems pretty nice. It is really nice to be able to pause/play my iPod from across the room, or even in a different room. This simply wasn't possible with any IR remove I tried. The RF remote is great.   One minor annoyance I have noticed is that the remote buttons seem a little unresponsive at times. It seems I have to click firmly and hold just momentarily to affect the iPod. A quick click feels like it should work, but it doesn't, at least not for me. It's fine, but it surprised me a little. I thought it wasn't working at first.   My greatest disappointment was to find out that it only controls the headphone audio levels, as opposed to the line-level outputs through the dock connector. I am surprised this is not explained anywhere on their web site (which doestn' say very much). I saw "Connect your iPod to your stereo and control it from anywhere up to 150 ft away!" and assumed it would work w/ my home iPod dock (w/ S-video out, etc.), which it does, *except* for the volume control. To their credit, they do include a stereo RCA/Phono cable (and several remote clips), but unfortunately for me the headphone signal levels don't match the available inputs on my stereo.   Overall I'm satisfied, and impressed with the combination of RF and dock pass-through aspects. For stand-alone iPod use (in a backpack or whatever) it seems like it would be really nice (it even works when the "hold" switch is enabled on the iPod). I'm a bit disappointed about the lack of line-level/dock audio control.

<Title>Very good remote for the price!
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the price, this is probably the best RF remote available for the iPod.  I found that the button operation took a little getting used to, you have to hold them for a moment. The manual explains this is to prevent accidental operation. However, once you've used the remote a bit, there's nothing to it.  The range is very good. I can use it from one side of my house to the next, maybe 100 feet through several walls.  I have a rubber sleeve on my ipod so there was too much clearance between the iPod and iJet receiver, so they wouldn't lock together securely. I thinned the sleeve down a bit and now they lock together great.  My only complaint relates to the ipod itself, and not the iJet... when you are watching videos you can't use the "skip track" button to skip to the next video, only to seek through the current track. Video playlists don't play through, and I can't just skip through videos via the remote. Not a huge deal, just a bummer. I didn't expect that to happen, but like I said, it's an iPod problem and not the iJet, so take it for what it's worth.   Overall, I'm very satisfied with the iJet. Very good remote at a great price.

<Title>Great product
<Date>Sun Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was just what I was looking for. The Griffin AirClick did not have a passthru for a power connection. This does. The RF remote works as promised and this can function in place of a more expensive dock if your choose to use it that way. A great product at a fair price.

<Title>Good product
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It works as advertised.  It is especially useful when hiking, running or walking on cold days.  I usually keep the iPod buried under layers of clothing and the remote allows me control without digging out the iPod each time I want to skip ahead or adjust the volume.

<Title>Works great
<Date>Fri Mar 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This remote works great. Now I can control the volume on my Cambridge Soundworks Playdock MP3 (which doesn't have a remote) through my Ipod. It's an RF remote so you can keep it clipped on your belt or shirt & just press the buttons and not have to aim it at your Ipod. Seems to work at a pretty good distance. The specifications say it works up to 150 feet away. I haven't tried it at that distance yet but everywhere I have tried it it works perfectly. For the price of $30 it's a bargain and one of the best accessories I've bought for my Ipod

<Title>not compatible with original nano
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the original ipod nano has has the headphone jack located on the bottom of the ipod and this is where the ijet plugs in... so when using one, you cannot use the other... i bought this to mount to the handlebars of my motorcycle and control my ipod from inside my jacket... this does not work with my 4gb ipod nano... it does work very well with my BOSE ipod dock as i can walk around my apartment and change the songs... however, even with this, the ijet will not adjust the volume... the ijet has worked flawlessly with my 3rd gen. 15gb ipod on my motorcycle... so it does what they say it does...

<Title>Do NOT buy from this company.... EVER
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought one of these to replace my broken Dynex dock remote, and it worked fine for abot a month.. and then broke, too. The bottom connector was just sheared away and pushed up inside the unit, and was rattling around. I could still use the remote, but I couldn't charge it while doing so, which was the entire reason that I bought a remote with a pass-through port. So, I figured it wasn't a problem, I'd just send it back and get a replacement. First, I discovered that the company had no written return policy anywhere (not inside the box, not on their website) and so I had to send an angry e-mail to find out what the policy was. They told me to ship it back with a copy of the invioce, and they'd replace it for me. That was six weeks ago. One week ago, I sent an e-mail (a nice one this time) asking what was up... no response came back.  In short: company is untrustworthy and makes products of questionable quality. Do not buy.   EDIT: sent a series of nasty e-mails last week off to the company, and finally got ahold of some gushing apologetic rep who said that a replacement was in the mail and I would get a tracking number by the end of the day. That was four days ago, and I (of course) have recieved no further e-mail. I also recently learned that this company, in addition to iPod remotes, makes devices which hack into entry-coded security locks and gates. Just in case you had any doubts about their trustworthiness.  EDIT #2 It has now been three months. I think it's fairly safe to say the company intentionally ripped me off. After all, what am I going to do? Sue them for $23?
