<Title>Great deal
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this product, it was 50 dollars cheaper than the equivalent iPod player.  Since it performs the exact same functions and more, I have no idea why anyone would buy an iPod over this.  Check out the new Zune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>) player, since this one is apparently already pretty old.  The WiFi feature is pretty cool, since it will keep evolving as Microsoft keeps changing the software on the device.

<Title>Great hardware, terrible software
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've owned my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QDCC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)</a> now for a little over three months.  It's a really great media player with an outstanding screen.  My only complaint about the hardware itself is the limited EQ settings.  The software...  I felt compelled to write this review after searching for possible solutions as to why the software keeps locking up/hanging/freezing for 1 to 2 minutes (and sometimes longer) whenever I delete files off of the player and occasionally at times that seem completely random to me.  The software is slow and awkward and not very intuitive - okay, it's supposed to be a media player so that means it's supposed to be cool, but where the hell is the File menu???  Come on - it's Microsoft; I would think that they would at least stick with their own stodgy but usable conventions.  I love my Zune player and use it at work, at the gym, on trips and even waiting in line at the barbershop, but the software makes me reach through my computer screen and throttle some Microsoft programmer and that's why it gets 3/5 stars instead of 5/5.

<Title>A Zune is worth a thousand pictures!
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great item, bought my wife the ipod she wanted, and I got this same time. Both are great, do not let anybody tell you otherwise<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>. If you can get this for less money, than why get the ipod? (plus the screen is great, a definate plus over the ipod)I had considered the itouch since I was looking for best bang for the buck with the best screen. I am so glad I did not get the itouch! A friend has the itouch, and it is great until you realize that you are constantly looking at it through you finger prints (that sucks).I will update if necessary.

<Title>much better than an ipod
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My son bought one and when his brother's ipod broke, he wanted a Zune instead.  It has an FM radio, you can easily transfer any music, great features, and the price was much less than an ipod.  We will never buy apple products again as they are too proprietary.  Our whole family will be buying one.  You can also search around and find better deals on the Zune.  Amazon had the black one for $50 cheaper than the others.  GREAT PRODUCT

I was hoping to move the music, pictures and videos from my computer using the Zune as an external drive. I find it very cumbersome!!!

<Title>First time MP3 buyer
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Buying a hard drive MP3 player was the correct choice for me,this was the first generation Zune 30 Gigabite player and I was able to download all the updates to go with it. I already have about 85 cd's converted on my Zune, and soon my whole collection will be portable. .That still only uses one third of the available memory.The 3'' screen is the best for pictures and I plan on downloading a movie or two also. I like it that the album covers are displayed and it is very easy to use and navigate the players  menu too. This Zune has an FM radio, another feature I wanted. Most stores are just starting to carry Zune accesories, but they are easilly to buy online, with a large assortment to choose from.  Most importantly I only paid $159.95 on Amazon.com and with free shipping and no sales tax the internet is the best way to buy n ew MP3 players. The enclosed ear buds and need to be replaced right away, I purchased a pair of Sony's Right away and later a set of V-moda in ear canel type that I really like. The case is flimsy and I am looking for a plastic box to use as a case. I deffinately reccomend the Zune....

We have found the synching gets trashed when synchin while using the computer online so he does it when the computer is not in use.  It takes some time.  He is very happy with it.

<Title>Zune 30 - Great product, Great price.
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got my Zune at a great price, and never thought I would use it as much as I do. If you have a MediaCenter PC - This is a MUST HAVE! You can record TV shows, and movies, convert them to Windows media files, and take them with you. If you get the home dock and connect it to your TV, you can watch your shows right on the TV. It holds more music than I even know. Check out the aftermarket programs designed for it and you can really do some cool stuff. The screen on the 30 is big enough to actually enjoy watching. The new software adds features it did not initially come with, like podcast support, and full menu control with the remote. Seems very well built, and the accessories are top notch quality. Like the Ipod, all the accessories are pricey for the original Microsoft stuff, and I suggest you stick with original made accessories. Others I tried did not fit it quite right, I have a friend who got a cable from an online store that damaged his, buyer beware. If you have an XBox360, this connects and you can watch all the photos, videos and music right thru it very easily. The wireless sync is GREAT! I just need my Zune anywhere in the area of my wireless router, push sync on the Zune menu, it opens up the program on my PC and updates by itself. I don't need another sync cable for my computer.  I like it better than my Ipod, mostly for the wireless abilities, and the battery life. It also does NOT scratch like my Ipod, and the newer ones have a real glass screen to avoid the problem. All in all I'm quite impressed with it.

<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Light, Compact, Heavy duty.When you turn the Zune sideways while you watch music videos or movies its like a widescreen movie. It's amazing! It's similar to the Ipod but with a way bigger screen for almost the exact same price or less. Another family member has the Ipod nano and for the same price I got 30gb. The size is a bit thicker but that doesn't bother me. I've synced movies on from dvds and they look great. So if your looking for a new mp3 player put the Zune on your List.:)

<Title>Hard-to-find item found - Before Xmas!!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My girlfriend loves red, so when she "hinted" at mp3 players (by looking at those "fruity" ones), I knew what to get her. I have owned every brand of mp3 player under the sun, and I can say the Zune is the best bang for the buck - especially with the new software upgrade. I didn't think I'd be able to find an affordable 30GB red Zune in early December but Amazon not only had one (and I mean 1 in stock!) but their fast, free delivery got it to me in enough time to wrap it and get it under the tree. She was blown away, I scored major points :) and life is good! Thanks Amazon!

<Title>Can't live without it! Threw the iPod away!
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I couldn't wait for the Zune!  My father bought one and he loved it!   He's purchased quite a few cheapy mp3 players thinking he really wouldn't use it.  Well I think he'd agree that he can't live without it.  He's ALWAYS got his with him.  I don't think he listens to the radio anymore!  So he bought me one.  I loaded it up and I rarely listen to the radio anymore either.  It's so easy to use.  I am a bit disappointed with the latest version of the software, but the Zune people are working very  hard daily to vamp it up! If you join the Zune network they actually answer the forum questions and let you know what's going on.  It just keeps getting better and better.  So I bought this one for my daughter.  We are three generation of Zunies!  And each of us feel the same way, if the house caught on fire, (I was going to say we'd run in to save our Zune first, but on second thought) we wouldn't have to run in to save our Zune's because we'd have them on us!  Sound quality is awesome, the amount of music you can fit on the Zune is perfect.  30G is more than you think!  I can't think of a negative to say!  Join [...] to stay informed!!

<Title>the only choice for people who don't like Apple products
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This music player is great, after installing the software it automatically pulled my entire music library from Windows Media Player onto the Zune in a matter of minutes.  The graphics and colorful menus make it easy to use, and the product easily woks with other Microsoft products.  Everyone I show this to at school tells me they wish they'd known about the Zune when they bought their Ipod.  If you prefer Windows Media Player, this is defiantly the better choice.  However it is a little bulky and lacks the all the cool touch sensitive features that you'd find on an Ipod.

The only thing I don't like about the 30GB is the size.  It is bigger than my 80GB.  But none the less the screen size is so much better than ipods.  And I can tell you that at the store I work at we have never had a return on a zune nore have we sent one off to get fixed.  ipods come back all the time.  This product gets an A+

<Title>Zune horrible user interface - No way to add music by folder, Software is bad, too
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I finally got the doodie-brown Zune that I ordered from Amazon on Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving). Got a GREAT deal on it, but was unable to have it shipped until December 31.  Yah! I get it, open it, load software, configure, attempt to load my massive  music collection. However, at this point I notice that the memory hog Zune software leaves a lot to be desired.  The only way to add music to the Zune it by selecting it from a list that displays cute little album covers. There is not a browse folder option, as ALL WINDOWS machines and even the iPod have... let me repeat, there is no way to go browse for a certain file to add to the Zune, you must painstakingly go through an entire collection of little pictures to add music. Really, Microsoft, did nobody think to add a Browse by.. folder view option that is SOOOOO prevalent in ALL Microsoft software, up until this point?  I have an iPod, too... I really thought that iTunes was the worst software ever, until I got the Zune.

Through the Zune software while syncing, a few of my CDs listed several multiple tracks (`Frankie Goes to Hollywood' goes a long way).  For a first MP3 player, the Zune is a good product.  30 GB will take awhile to fill.

<Title>4 stars!.....? I think?....
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Well, when I ordered my zune from here I was overly anxious to get it. When I finally got it, it was deffinately what I expected (atleast for 2 days). I could put my music on it and watch videos with relative ease. The videos were A LOT less pain to put on than the ipod (because you have to BUY your own converter for the ipod) and I also liked the way that the albums displayed their album art. The video playback was very clear on the screen. Of course the one thing that threw me off was the upload and converting the videos. Instead of telling you the percentage of all the videos that have been converted, it only told you the percentage of one at a time. This threw me off cause the video would get to 100% and then reset to 0% so I thought it was broken. It wasn't, but it was slightly confusing. So all in all I liked the player a lot at first. But then like the 3rd morning that I had it I went to turn it on, and the screen wouldn't work! It just displayed a black screen with pixalated gray on one side. (Not a good sign) So I call up the service center and right away they are convicting me of dropping it (this didn't set well with me). But unfortunately/fortunately I had already dealt with their customer service before (Xbox 360 RROD?) so I just kept cool and said that I needed to get it sent back to be fixed. So they sent me a box and I sent it in, and haven't gotten it back yet. It has been probably 1 week now, but it sounds like it will be A LOT longer than that. I'm sorry but they should just take your credit card info and send you a new one and have you send the broken one back. And if you don't send the broken one back, charge you for another one. You shouldn't have to wait weeks for your product that you spend good money for. As far as the product goes I'd say it probably deserves a 4 stars. But as far as customer service 0 stars. Terrible.

<Title>Player Good...Zune software BAD!
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I think my review will mirror most out there: from a hardware perspective the Zune is a great player...even better than the iPod in my opinion as it has a radio and better video.  However, the applause ends there..the Zune software is horrible. It makes duplicate copies of songs on the player, sync's stuff you tell it not to, and adds incorrect album art, artist and album info to roughly 30% of the songs on player.  The software alone is reason to look elsewhere.   These are remedial issues that Microsoft should've fixed before bringing the product to market.

<Title>Great and more Great
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First let me say that the menu system on the Zune is far. I mean FAR superior to any other MP3 Player (i-pod included). Only 4 stars because a click wheel would make the 30 GB Zune hands down the best device out there. Screen is bright and huge. Great battery life. The Zune software is awesome. The only cons I have are: No click wheel, The player itself is too big, video takes a long time to upload and not a lot of accessories. A great player for the price but, If you want to spend a little more the 80GB Zune is the best player out there.

<Title>Great Product but needs better support from Microsoft
<Date>Mon Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love the Zune physically - large screen, large hardrive, easy to read menu and easy functionality.  But the Zune Marketplace is so BAD!  compared to iTunes it is a joke!  they don't offer audiobooks nor movies/tv shows for download.  and since they don't honor DRM it is hard to find downloads.  Microsoft needs to either step up to the plate and develop the marketplace or just release it as a standard MP3 player.

<Content>So far so good.  My wife is enjoying her new toy.  I think the bulk of our CD collection if not the entire collection has been ripped ans synced up to her Zune. I will post if I run into any technical problems with the product. The price I paid for this amount of storage vs. buying the name "IP_D" was well worth the money and cheaper too!

<Title>It exceeded my expectations
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It was an incredibly deal on Zune player at last holiday season, so I decided to give it a try, so clicked to order. I was very interested in what software giant can offer in own player collecting all the best from players offered by already established companies on this market as Creative Lab, and Apple. My Zune 30 was delivered prior Christmas and was waiting under the tree until the clock chimed 12.  As a theater begins from a coat check as DAP begins from a packaging. Every company considers packaging really seriously and tries making it most attractive and innovating. I remember packaging of my first 3g iPod when I really had no clue how to open it.  After removing two sticky clips I slid top of box very easily and got an access to the content of packaging.  Zune took center part, headphones took left part  and an interface cable was in right section of the inner box.  Another section accessible from top contained a pouch, manuals, and software.  Comparing packaging of Zune, Zen , and iPod I'd give 1st place to Zune and  the last to Zen.  Although Zen has most technical information on the box, not so many retailers have actual device in stock reachable by consumers, so the information doesn't reach consumer until he/she really purchased it. First what I did was comparing sizes of iPod and Zune. Obviously Zune is slightly bigger, however it fits comfortable in hands and pockets. A plastic case seems fingerprints free and probably scratch resistant as well.  Screen is huge. Controls look Ok. Play and back buttons are a bit small, but easy to press anyway. You can notice that navigation dial of Zune is also smaller. General problem is that you can miss actual button, for example press center button instead of arrows.   I tried a pouch, it fitted very perfectly. I remember a very loose pouch of Zen, when I could fit two Zens in it, and as result my Zen slid down and has been fallen on a granite floor. Part of its case was broken, luckily it continued working well. However Zune's pouch isn't suede one, as iPod has.  Now I was ready to charge and try it. I connected it to USB port, however it didn't start charging until I turned on computer, although USB was powered all time. An interface cable has protective caps on both ends, similar to iPod's interface cable, however it wasn't fitted so perfectly, I had problems to disconnect it from Zune's end. I hoped to see Zune in Explorer as a standard MTP device after connection, however Vista didn't show Zune anywhere. I remember I could copy music to Zen instantly after a connection ( Zen is MTP device as well). Ok, I decided to play with Zune interface a bit. It came pre-filled with some music, videos and pictures. User interface appeared quite intuitive, screen is big and I was impressed. I tried FM tuner, reception was clear and easy to tune on different stations. I was only wondering when DAP will start incorporate HD tuners? I tried to figure if I can records radio, however it seems not possible. So now it was time to fill it with my own music now. Since it didn't work out of the box, I pulled CD with software and started installation. First step of the installation was obtaining an update. So if you start using Zune in fields, then no way to make it working without an Internet connection. The actual update installed  first Zune management program and then begun updating Zune firmware. I heard that Microsoft issued 2nd generation of Zune, which is generally just a firmware update for 30gb version of the device. An updating firmware took some time, it seems similar to iPod procedure, a new firmware image gets first loaded on a hard drive of a device, and then it gets flashed. UI of Zune looked quite different after the updating firmware. Text of menu items became even bigger; color palette was changed from brownish colors to dark gay ones. New items appeared in Settings menu, and total music navigation got change offering multiple choices switching from artists to albums view and versa. I'll tell about navigation ability of Zune later.    Zune management desktop software  As I already mentioned, you can't use WMP or just Explorer for Zune management. It is certainly drawback, which is dictated by a simple monopoly rule - "We're confident and do know how to do better, if you do not like something, then tell us and we will correct it, do not correct it on your own". Anyway, Zune software is quite innovative. It inherits some principles from iTunes providing 3 panes Artist-Album-Song view.   The  UI is completely custom, and it mimics a tabbed access to different functionality of the program. You need some time to get used before taking all advantages of new UI. I'm still learning it. Some things are quite not intuitive, or require too much extra clicking, for example you can't correct artist/album/song/year in one place. I haven't found how to change genre and year at all.  Zune software uses concept of synchronization a local library with a device. You can beef content library without a device and mark items for future synchronization. A special place is reserved for library, however items being already on a disk can remind in an original location. Zune software recognizes three communication areas as Zune, CD/DVD drive and community input box.   A killing feature of Zune was an introduction of a socializing feature in opinion of Microsoft. You can see a clear notice of it on Zune's box.  I really do not see much benefits of that, it is probably because of age, tastes and so on. At least social feature should look something different, can be much more clear how to use and how to get benefits from it. As I mentioned, Zune management software has context sensitive UI, so when you are in device mode, you can configure Zune wireless network making it connected to your home WiFi. WEP is supported and the program is able to discover available networks and generally easy to use. However finally the Zune wireless capabilities are completely useless. I tell below why. Ripping ability of Zune software quite good, you can choose several format of ripping, including Microsoft lossless, and MP3. MP3 ripping is quite fast, mostly real time of speed of CD copying, Ripping quality supported up to 320Kbps. However Zune uses less comprehensive DB than CDDB, so many my CDs especially European made weren't recognized.   So let's conclude on Zune management software:   Pros  Innovative UI Easy navigate and find Most of available compressed and lossless audio formats are supported WMV, AAC, MP3 Cons  No software alternatives Not flexible in change or retrieve all song information Connected to not so comprehensive variant of CD DB Limited support of video formats (WMV only) No support open format as FLAC or OGG Zune firmware  General UI  As I mentioned, Zune UI looked differently after firmware update. Again, UI is completely custom and innovative. Menu items are just oversized text with wide using sparkling video effects for highlighting and selection. Microsoft chosen an opposite color schema to Apple's one, so all texts are white on dark or black background. However everything is readable quite well. Navigation is very intuitive. Microsoft was in a difficult situation since a touch dial ring, and a slide bar were taken by other vendors. However a classic arrow managed scrolling and navigation work quite well.  I was even impressed that Zune supports national alphabets in the scrolling directory.  Generally arrow controls provide a very revolutionary two-dimensional navigation, so I can easily manage album or artist selection from the same view. Actually selection a category as artist, song, or genre converts items of it in a scroll vertically list and selection any item from the list converts previous navigation to horizontal with a vertical scrolling of a new selection. Play now screen shows oversized album art, play progress and song, artist, album info. For some reason the screen doesn't have track/song number in the list. Long song, album, or artist name isn't scrolled and just fades out. However it is auto scrolled when selected in a list. White color of play progress doesn't look good when album art has white background. Another problem is that screen is readable when backlit is on. It is very annoying, since you need to press the center button to read the screen.  Sound and video quality  Sound quality is really good. It is a bit different than iPod. I'd say that Zune has a little dip in mid range. Zune is also less loud. My major claims were that Zune doesn't support volume or equalization control per song or album bases. regarding video, I can't tell much, because I do not have videos in WMV format. Certainly big, and bright screen is good for viewing videos, but lacking in supporting different formats limits using Zune for this purpose.     Wireless  I still do not understand why this feature is in Zune. I didn't try it for Zune to Zune communication, however it is useless for sync purpose. It is easy to setup wireless to be connected to home WiFi, however Zune drops connection unless song really short. I did all recommendations from Microsoft site, but nothing helped. Actually one of the recommendation to have Zune powered. It means you need some wire anyway. What really would be nice, if Zune provides a  kind of simplistic browser allowing to look for files in music directories when some specific service is setup. I'd develop such feature gladly, I hope Microsoft listens me. Another disadvantage is if you have radio on, then it shorts battery life substantially.   Conclusion  Pros  Big screen, easy readable, good contrast and colors Nice UI FM Tuner Two-dimensional navigation    Cons  No clock No smart lists No statistics Short battery life Lousy wireless  No recording No disk mode No song position in a list and list size No scroll names in play now Progress bar invisible on certain album arts No volume normalization No per son/album equalizer Screen invisible without backlit    Recommendation   I'd recommend Zune to persons who listen music occasionally and own a relatively small songs collection. Zune is perfect for children though. However Zune is useless for serious music enthusiasts. All my recommendation based on price under $100.

The Sync on the zune is faster than the IPOD. The shortfall is Marketplace doesnt have as much, but anything in the itunes can also be put on your zune.

<Title>Good gadget
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This digital player have a lot of things great. Is very easy to use, after half hour you know how it work, the package is pretty small, just come with USB cable, headphones (I never used it)and CD, in my case this CD doesn't work at all, I use Win XP in spanish, so I have to go to Zune web and download the latest version of the software, the good thing is in the same process my zune update his firmware.  The new firmware look better than older one, also activate the ability of connect my zune with the computer by the wireles network on my home, so, say good bye to the cables on the desktop.  Following with the Zune, the screen is just fantastic, the construcci�n is pretty, with a material like a glass, but,must be better if protect the unit with a silicone case, I bought an acrilic one but in time it look very old and, I dude it will resist a fall.  You have to know the Zune come almost alone, if you want enjoy it more, you have to buy the silicone case, the wall charger and the cables for put it on your audio receiver or TV.

<Title>Get an Ipod
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I used my Zune for 9 months, then, downloaded the software "upgrade".  Not only did the "upgrade" screw up my computer and other music software, the music on the Zune suddenly deleted when the Zune was not even connected to the computer.  My Zune is now a very expensive paperweight.  After attempting to get assistance from Zune Help (these are people who know less about the product than I) and realizing that they would never be able to offer anything of any relevance that I hadn't already tried, I bought a new Imac, a new Ipod, and exported my music to an external hard drive, then uploaded all to Itunes on my new computer.  This solved my Zune problem.

<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My bf's zune worked right away and mine had a few issues with software. We have the same computers and same zunes! It's pretty freaky. My zune itself was fine and came in great shape. My computer had some kind of issue with the driver ( Error 10 ). Vista has some problem with giving permissions. If you have this issue, I'd check out support at Zune official site. Chose community support first with the forums. I found my answer there and will hang out there and see what else they suggest. Right now my zune is up and running and I've got lots of cute little backgrounds in my picture reserves. I also watched some videos and listen to music and the headphones are very decent with sound quality!! I never got it to wirelessly sync, but my laptop had a problem as well so I'm sure it's something to do with upgrading to vista.   Also it's outer casing is much more scratch resistant than an ipod. My ipods all turned out looking 5 years old within one week. I'd protect yours as much as possible. So far the zune is really good about this and it looks really great so far! The radio function is also great. The stations are very clear and some have information on what station it is + what song they are playing! Very awsome!  Well that's all I have to say so far! I'm enjoying zune. Satisfied with the style, the looks, the play, the purchase!

<Content>I had my Zune for a few months when my computer and the Zune software suddenly stopped recognizing my Zune. After deleting the Zune software and reloading it my computer recognizes the zune, but the software still doesn't. I have done everything that the Zune trouble shooting guide suggests, and to no avail. The internet is full of discussion boards about the same problem. Many times the people in the discussion board note that the Zune hotline could not fix their problem either. I never had any problems with my ipod. I have decided that the money I put into the Zune was a waste.

<Content>I've only had this for a few days, but I am loving it. I must say I ordered this from Amazon the day before Black Friday for $89., and if it hadn't been so cheap, I wouldn't have bought it. I have a 1GB Creative Zen Nano that I also love. The unit is very substanial. It has a solid feel. The picture is great, as is the sound. I love that they just upgraded the software to allow wireless synching. I wish it came with an AC adapter. I listen to a lot of podcasts from NPR: Wait, Wait, Car Talk, Story of the Day, as well as music. I used to have to be careful to erase the podcasts so I wouldn't run out of room. There's no worry about that now. One thing that puzzles me is why so many mp3 players, this one included, come with magnetic headphones that stick together. Yea, it looks cool, but it doesn't really have any function. and magnets and magnetic media don't mix.

<Title>Microsoft Zune- the MP3 player for tech savvy people!
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune is not going to ever kill the iPod. Not as is, certainly. But that does not mean that the Zune is a bad product. Quite to the contrary, the Zune is excellent. You just need to know your way around a computer to fully enjoy it. Microsoft is certainly not known for their user-interfaces now are they? :P  When comparing the Zune 30 to the new Nano (8 GB version) the Zune comes out on top in every area except battery life (and even that is close).  Price- The two players are about the same now, but around Thanksgiving the Zune (Brown) could be found for around 100$.  Capacity- 30G beats 8G ANY day of the week. Even if you don't need 30 gigs of space, it's nice to have the option isn't it? However, it is important to note that the Nano is flash based while the Zune has a hard drive inside. That means you shouldn't use it as a hackey sack! But I like to think humans are more intelligent than that.   Screen- The Zune has a 3 inch screen. The new Nano has a 2 inch screen. And yet they both sport the same screen resolution. Now which screen do you think it will be easier to watch movies/view images on?  Size- The Zune is bigger than the Nano, and that might be important to some people. I like the size because it suppourts that lovely screen.  Battery- The Nano lasts 6 hours longer for music playback and 1 hour longer for video playback. However, charging time is the same for both devices.   Radio- The Zune gets FM radio reception and even station/song data can be displayed on the screen if the staion suppourts it. The Nano does NOT have a radio.   Album art- Album art displays so large and pretty on the Zune screen! I love looking at my art. I can't say how it looks on the Nano because I don't actually own one.  Software- The Zune software was recently upgraded, and device firmware was too. When is the last time Apple upgraded an iPod's firmware? (iPhone does not count, that was to stop the haxx0rz). I'm talking about updating the firmware just to make the experience better for the customer. Also the Zune software is prettier than iTunes.  Earphones- The packaged earphones are pretty good, but they happen to be too big for my ears and hurt. Obviously this is a personal problem. :P  Zune D-Pad vs iPod Click wheel- I can use my Zune with gloves on! Yay! Seriously though, I prefer the D-pad to the click wheel, if only because it feels like I have more control over it.   Zune Marketplace- Purchase DRM free music using Microsoft points (or real monies if you prefer). Actually own purchased songs! Yay! iTunes music has a DRM on it, meaning you can't do what you want with it. (Like putting it on a Zune, right? Right? I kid, I kid.)  So I guess that's it! Every bit of media I have is on my Zune, and I'm only about a third full!

<Content>We have all been turned into Zune lovers..have recently purchased the Red, Black, White and Pink..loved them all. Red could be less frosted as to not look "hot pink". Love the large screen for viewing pics, download time is next to nothing. Music is easily transfered, have it set to automatically rip any cd inserted. Transfer is fast, Charge holds forever. Seems like it is huge at first, but so light and really not as big as it seems. Fits comfortably anywhere. I wore it while waiting in the long check out lines in my jacket pocket and forgot where I put it. So really not bulky or heavy at all. Nothing but good things to say so far.

<Content>I absolutely love my Zune and I haven't really found anything that wasn't good about it except that when you charge it you have to have the Zune software open on your computer (but it isn't really that tedious, just charge it overnight so it's not in your way). An average charge lasts all day and I've never once had my Zune crap out on me while I was listening to it!  But, a note to people like me who usually turn their computers on Standby at night -- your zune won't charge if your computer's on Standby.  I give this product an A+++

<Title>Zune Doom
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased a Zune 30gb a little more than a month ago, and last night, it just stopped working.  Because the store where I purchased it isn't planning to get any more in (and now I know why), I had to call Microsoft to get them to repair or replace it.  Know how long that's going to take?  It will be 13-20 days for them to ship me the box, examine the player and repair or replace it.  And that doesn't include the time it will take to ship it back to me.    Upon calling them, it became clear that their biggest concern is customer fraud: they were very insistent to tell me that they would be checking to make sure the player wasn't dropped or have any kind of water damage, and they didn't tell me much else.  What kind of customer sevice is this??  As for the actual product, well, it has bugs aplenty, and appears to have some useless features, such as the wireless sync option, which does not work.  The fact that it does not come with a user guide was also disappointing, and it was pretty much hit and miss figuring out how many of the functions work (there is an online guide, but one has to click on the Help icon to see the link for it).  The battery life was also disappointing, as the specs indicate it will have power for 12 hours.  This was not my experience, as the battery life declined steadily until the fateful night that it stopped working altogether.  Also, I found out that the battery cannot be changed by the user, that the player must be sent to Microsoft.  Although the design and screen were lovely eye-candy, the player itself isn't worth the money, in my estimation.  My Creative Labs Zen mp3 player was not only easier to use, but I could change the battery myself.    Bottom line: Bad, bad choice for an mp3 player....

<Title>Great device...
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As an adult I figured it would be smart to research the MP3 field before I asked Santa for one for Christmas.  I'm glad I did.  I love my new Zune.  The price I got here was right-on!  Shipping was timely even though Santa waited to the last few days to ask the Elves to send it.    The original earbuds are too small for my ears, but I have tried a couple of mid-level replacements and have returned them as they are no better.  I am now awaiting the Bose in-ear set.  Hopefully these will be a better fit, and I can not blame Microsoft for that as, like I said the others were similar in fit.  The only thing I can say that is negative is about the software.  I expected, as an IT professional, for the software for a Microsoft device to be real simple, functional and intuitive.  I am not impressed thus far.  I have researched this and I am not alone in my opinion.  I am expecting a major update to come soon.  I hope so as this software work like a Beta product.  This why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.

The screen is amazing and the new firmware looks great. Video and music playback looks great.

<Title>This Zune is Great!
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the 30GB Zune for my son for Christmas in Dec 2007. I was torn between the ipod and the Zune, but since my son had thousands of songs from his DVDs and MP3 collection which the ipod would not play, I went with the Zune. I was a little concerned by a number of the negative reviews about the Zune PC software.  But I was amazed.  I installed the software on both my Windows XP and my sons Windows VISTA and it was the easiest and fastest instal I have ever done. It installed flawlessly and it recognized the devise immediately, it recognized that a newer version of the Zune software was available and after checking with me it then unstalled it smothly and quickly with no intervention on my part.  It then asked me if I wanted to load MP3,JPEG, and video files from my compuer and allowed me to override or limit, then it synched up the files flawlessly and was ready to play.  The music was great and the large screen (twice the size of the ipod) looked fantastic.  Manuvering around and using the Zune was easy and fun.  If there were problems in the Zune software earlier, they appear to be fixed because everything was easy, smooth and worked great.  I highly recommend the Zune!  Apple better watch out because the new Zune clobers the ipod hands down.  I highly recommend it and I am going to get another for my other son!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>

Documentation and help section is very poorly put together.  Would have been nice for Microsoft to have made the unit work as a portable hard drive For the discounted price the Zune is a great mp3

The product was purchased at the end of November for a Christmas present once opened on Christmas and a week later would not hold a charge.  I contacted ACORR to let them know the product did not work properly and I was informed that becuase I purchased this product over 30 days ago there was nothing they would do to fix it.  I would agree if this was not purchased for a gift and would have no way to know if this worked until Christmas.  I will never purchase any product from this vendor again and feel that that they we not willing to provide any customer satisfaction.

<Title>Great Entry into the PMP market
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Microsoft's first foray into the digital music player realm is, in my experience, a great success. I got my Zune on sale, and it has since replaced my video iPod as my MP3 player of choice.  The first thing one notices about the Zune is that the screen occupies most of the space on the device's face. The 3" screen may seem like a small difference from the 2.5" screen of the video iPod, but the difference is very noticeable in practice! The software for the Zune, especially the 2.x software that Microsoft pushed down to the first-gen Zunes (giving them all the software features of the second-gen Zunes), is very tight and responsive, and looks great. While listening to music, all the information about the current track is prominently displayed, with the album art (if available) taking up the majority of the screen. One nice feature of the software is that I can enable and disable shuffle and repeat with just a few clicks while playing a track, as opposed to on the iPod, where I have to go back out to the main screen, then to Settings. The Zune is far more convenient in that regard.  The Zune supports podcasts with the 2.x update, though it still lacks audiobooks, which is a serious disadvantage to those who enjoy listening to literature. The built-in FM tuner is nice for when I'm walking the streets and feel like flipping over to NPR for a bit.  As it is, the Zune is a solid device. It's a good competitor to the iPod as-is, and well worth the money.

<Content>I love my zune. A little bulkier, but the interface is better than an Ipod. I have never really gotten used to the scroll wheel and the directional pad is great. Probably not an exercise device, but totally pocket-able.  The screen is huge and bright and I have watched several movies on plane trips without any problems, and the battery life is probably good enough for two+ movies on a single charge.  If you can find one of these for less than $100 I'd grab it. 30GB will be enough to store all of your music and the video playing is about as good as it gets for the price.

<Title> Zune and i-Pod owner
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune is great.  I bought the Zune to escape the monopolized i-Tune music source for i-Pod music.  It didn't present any problems in loading the software or the Zune with 4000+ pictures and 1200+ songs.  I recently plugged it in to charge and it synced with additional pictures and new music from Christmas without a hitch. The only message I received was do to the fact that I had hooked it into a multi USB port and that it might perform better being plugged in direct.    The directional wheel is much easier for a man's thumb to operate and the screen size enables you to see the Menu choices much easier. It's seems to have a good weight to it also feels like it's made with more quality and no need for "screen protectors".

<Title>The Zune is NOT difficult to use or install
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, so when deciding to purchase this Zune I read this review on here about how this guy couldn't get the Zune to properly sync onto his computer.  I thought maybe I would have the same problem.  Turns out I didn't, and I guess the reason was I have a brain in my head.  This isn't rocket science people.  All you have to do is take the Zune from the packaging, connect it to the USB drive with the cable given, and load the CD that came with it.  There are step by step instructions that should prompt you.  The only problem I had syncing at first was my inane ability to follow the Wizard Install program for the new hardware detection.  Once I followed those instructions, everything worked fine. Now I can use my Zune and i know exactly what I'm doing.  The buttons are better than an iPod no stupid moving your hand over a wheel crap, and it's more user friendly.  Seriously, the one thing I really hated about the iPod was the wheel you use to go forward and back.  So if you want a player that has the chance of living longer, iPod fail rate is 1 in 100 or something like that while I think Zune is 1 in 3,000 or 5,000, then pick up the Zune.  Zune has proven to be a much better music player than my iPod.

The Zune software is much faster at ripping CD's than my old Microsoft software.  I put a couple of videos on the Zune, including the LSU-ARK Football game.  It converted the MP4 to WMV format, which I wish it would not have done, but that is OK.  The unit has a nice solid feel to it.  I use it when I work out and on the plane.    Looking at the price point versus the competition you can't go wrong.

<Title>Great hardware, miserable software!
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The 30GB Zune is a great product which I was able to find at a great price (about $100 in brown--shop around).  The Zune itself is well-designed and easy to use.  I can't quite understand the choice to release it in brown, but it saved me $40 over the black model, so no complaints.  The hardware itself is simple and comparable to an iPod at a lower price.  There is also a world of accessories you can buy for the Zune, both made by Microsoft and other companies.  Microsoft has some nice, if overpriced, packages for cabling, car travel, etc.  Altec Lansing has a nice speaker system you can find for about $50 where you can drop the Zune in and play from it, using a remote control.  They have belt clips, long-life battery packs, FM transmitters, etc. The Zune comes fairly bare-bones, not even with an AC charger, so expect to pay extra for some of these accessories.  For all the variety, they can get pretty pricey.  You can check out the Zune boards to stay abreast of sales on Zunes and Zune accessories, and read about the latest products, etc.: http://www.zuneboards.com/  The main problem with the Zune, however, is not the cost of the accessories; it's the software.  It's pretty easy to use once your songs are set up, and syncing between your Zune and computer couldn't be easier (plug in a cable, start the software, and it does it for you).  However, getting the software to label your songs as you'd like and keep them that way is a nightmare. The software will not readily permit you to change the artist on an album once the album has already been burned.  It makes changing artist names on tracks and sometimes even genres or song titles horribly difficult, sometimes accepting the changes, sometimes not.  It will even make seemingly random changes, after you've spent a lot of time changing things to be just the way you'd like them to be.    If you're purchasing a 30GB Zune, chances are that you, like me, have a lot of music to put on there.  And you'd probably like to be able to easily organize and locate it.  The software will be a potentially insurmountable obstacle here.  I really like my Zune and I'm pretty savvy with computers, but I've been pounding my head against my computer screen with this software!  I will probably have to soon bite the bullet and call tech support.  I couldn't find any solutions online that helped, though I did see a LOT of posts from people who were frustrated with the software taking so much customization and being so difficult.  In truth, 80% of your music will be organized quickly and correctly with Zune's software, but the 20% remaining may be drive you mad...or toward the nearest iPod.

<Title>Great device better with upgrade
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I had to write a review ever since Microsoft came out with their latest firmware update.  I was already a huge fan of the device.  The large screen, and simple interface was my motivation for wanting this in the first place.  The firmware update made the interface even better and also provided additional stability over the earlier version.  The provided headphones are ok, but not as good as the ones that come with the accessory pack.  Definitely fork out the change for the kit or buy a nice set of headphones.  Pros - Great interface with large font for menus - Built-in FM radio is a benefit I hadn't wanted until I started to use it - Besides the FM feature, having pictures, videos, and music in one device is great - Great screen!!  Watching a movie in a bus/train/plane is very easy on the eyes, although the arm gets a little tired. Small and very sturdy feeling.  Feels like it can take a beating  Cons - I wish the wireless feature worked without any limitations.  It would be so great to be able to use it more.  I just shut it off to conserve battery since I'll never have a need for it.  The wireless sync is no easier than plugging it in via USB - The desktop software is better with the new version but still pretty sluggish if you have a large music library.  It can be frustrating at times. - The EQ settings are pretty weak and offer very little/noticeable improvement.  A custom EQ would be great.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and I've owned the 30GB model for more than a year.  It's selling for a great price, but if you have the money, you may want to opt for the 80GB model.  The interface is the same, but the controls are nicer.  The only limitation I've had with the 30GB model is the number of movies I can load up.  Since I already have a huge music/photo collection.

<Content>This was the best price on the net period, easy to use a little thick for my taste but is 30 GB so that compensates. I really like the Zune much more than the Ipod classic, i have yet to tried the new touch but at 16gb for 4 times more i dont think so. I hope MS make something with a querty keyboard and wi fi and they'll have me hooked. This has radio, video, photos and audio that at least one better than apple. The scrolling feature of the other MP4 players is the one thing is lacking you have to press up or down to move you cant use the middle botton as a scroll wheel, that probably is a 2nd gen feature.

<Title>Great deal at $99
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this from Dell for their $99 price which included shipping.  Originally this was for only the brown version, but Dell ran out and substituted a white model which was nice.  I'm running the v2.3 firmware and I have the latest version of the Zune software.  I've had no sync problems.  The software is excellent and it's easy to manage my CD collection.  I have zero complaints about this product, but I'm not sure I'd pay the $200 price people are asking.   Pros: 1. Zune Software is easy to use 2. Zune UI is easy to use 3. Music quality is good 4. Wireless sync now works 5. Seems to be well made Cons: 1. A bit bulky 2. No auto rotate feature on the videos (doesn't auto-sense like an iPod phone). 3. Supplied earbuds are not that great (iPod owners complain of the same issue).  I got this as a Christmas present.  I liked it so much, I got two.  What I like best is that this simply does what it's supposed to do.  It's simple.  It was also a bargain.  I use it with an Altec Lansing docking station and that's also very nice.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQLPZE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Altec Lansing M604 Powered Audio System for Zune</a>.

<Title>Great Value!!
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased three of these through other retailers for about $100 average. When you take a look at the Apple Competitor (ipod video) that goes for $250  you can really see why this product is getting more and more popular. The first versions really needed updates to the software which I have to say took a while to come out but now that version 2.0 is out and fully tested I really like a lot of the new features. Only think I would really like to see is a more user friendly version of the song library software, and support for flac format. Despite this I still give it 5 stars. 30 GB, Wireless, plays video good sound quality... it's a winner.

<Title>holds you hostage just like the ipod
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune itself is great. Easiest interface i have ever used, great idea to include wireless zune to zune connection. The problem is that The bulk of my music came from yahoo music jukebox. Well the zune doesnt support that one type of specific file, so i am out of luck. I have a creative zen sleek, and i plan on getting the new creative zen. DEFINITELY SENDING THE ZUNE BACK.  p.s. I cant even figure out how to get video onto the zune unless you buy it from the zune "marketplace". Whatever.

<Title>Works well, better than a Video Ipod
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I already have a 30GB apple Ipod when I received this as a gift and I am pleasently surprised at how well it works. The only advantage which the Ipod has is that it is physically smaller (although not lighter), but the user interface of the zune is significantly better with the large font much easier to read. The use of the more normal (i.e. not clickwheel) controls giving better control than the Ipod. I say this after having use an Ipod for almost four years and the zune for about 4 days. I was surprised that microsoft paid as much attention as it did when you switch between different menus. The transitions are done well, and the structure is intuitive. I had no problems in loading up the zune software with vista home premium and found it to be just as useable and easy to use as itunes with an ipod (which I run on a seperate mac.)  I am not sure what the problems other people have seen as none existed when I ran and synched my zune for the first time. I am now quite happy to give my old Ipod to my wife and use a better product.

<Title>Vista users beware! Software update does NOT work well
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Without typing up a long statement, I bought it for a christmas present this year. I was going to pre-load it with media, but I was never allowed to. Why? First, the sync cable refused to operate properly. A call to Zune's customer support line "fixed" this. They were more than willing to send out a new sync cable...which after 12 business days, still has not arrived.  So I run out and find an original zune sync cable in a store. Zune would pick up a charge, but still wouldn't sync up. So, I call customer support back and basically get the troubleshooting steps in the box.   I go to their support page, scour the message boards for solutions (seemed as if every 3rd post was a problem like mine). Nothing works. Now, luckily, I am very familiar with computers, so going into the device manager isn't nothing new. But, it had me thinking...what about a dad who just knows how to turn on and off a computer? Why is this process difficult for someone like him?   Long story short, there is a vista conflict that makes it so zunes would not properly sync up. It maybe has been fixed since my purchase of a few weeks ago, but I wouldn't assume the best.   Worst customer service experience though. I would have rated this one star, but I do like the design. Haha.

<Title>Microsoft Zune 30GB
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got a brand new Microsoft Zune for Christmas. Only got to use it about 3 times before it stopped working. My wife also bought me all kinds of accessories to go with it. So, we have a lot of money invested in it. Apparently, there is a flaw in how the carrying case is made, and it makes it seem like you need to insert the power adapter into to port upside down. The port is not made in a shape that rejects the incorrect plug in, so the result is bent prongs on the port. Microsoft will not replace. I am out about $300.

<Title>Be Patient when setting this up the first time...it's worth it!.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Some end users have experienced an "issue" with their Zune when they first try to use it....including yours truly...all I can say is...Patience, Patience, Patience...the Zune IS worth it.  Not all Zunes have an initial "issue" with the battery not charging and the screen freezing, if yours does....it is a very MINOR issue and is easily corrected as I mention below.  First, I bought the Brown 30GB for my husband as a Christmas present this year (2007) instead of an iPod for several reasons, but mainly because: it has an FM radio; was on sale (the brown was much lower priced than the other colors the day I bought it off Amazon...it's a cool chocolate brown with a green tint to the case); and because I did not want to fall into the whole iPod craze (I'm not a big fan of Appleand have been a Microsoftcustomer for over 20 years)....we are both VERY glad I went with the Zune.  Secondly, to save you the frustration of having to search the Internet for a solution to the minor, yet irritating issue with the battery, like I had...THE main thing I must recommend for a relatively smooth install...BE PATIENT...Do NOT connect your NEW Zune to your computer until after you install the Zune software FIRST (which is what Microsoft recommends). I would also suggest downloading the newest version off the Zune software/firmware site from Microsoft (version 2.3 or higher) because with the 2.3 update, Microsoft apparently corrected an issue with the battery not wanting to charge correctly and the screen freezing, which is what ours was doing when I first tried to charge it (software update:  [...] ). After I UNINSTALLED the old version and installed the update...the Zune worked perfectly and has continued to do so. Note: For some odd reason, installing the CD version and clicking the "Check for Updates" did not install the 2.3 version, so, do a complete download off the URL above.  I would also recommend that you RESIST pressing the power button when you first take it out of the box because it would have very little power and could get stuck on a screen with an exclamation point inside an illustration of a battery (which is easily fixed if it does happen because this is what happened with ours) and instead, begin charging your Zune....either from a USB 2.0 port on the BACK of your PC or with the AC adapter that comes with the travel pack. If you use the USB port, be sure to install the software first. Also, Do NOT try charging it with an external USB Hub even if the hub has its own power, which is what I initially did try; this method didn't work well enough to charge the Zune effectively. You should let your Zune fully charge for 3 hours prior to using it.  Because I did not download the software/firmware update first, (I used the supplied CD) I actually needed to let the Zune battery completely drain two or three times because the screen would get stuck, first showing an illustration of a battery with an exclamation point, then when the illustration showed a battery with a plug....I simply unplugged the Zune and left it sitting on my desk with whatever illustration was on the screen until the screen went blank (a few hours). This happened when I used the CD software that was supplied with the Zune (the CD part number 1006 X12-6319303). After I installed version 2.3 off the Zune/Microsoft site (version 2.3 - 1145), there were no more issues with the battery not charging.  If you experience any other "issues"....this site might be helpful: [...]  The FM Radio works great!...and the overall sound of the music is simply wonderful. You can adjust the sound in the Settings using the equalizer feature.  I have been using the Zune Marketplace (via the Zune software) to purchase and download songs, which has worked extremely well. I initially bought 4000 points ($[...]) which applies toward the purchase of individual songs or complete albums. Basically, the songs are 79 cents a piece...very reasonable. The Zune also comes with a mix of some pics and songs pre-installed.  In a nutshell, it is my honest opinion that the Zune is a much better value than an iPod and I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to purchase a digital media player.

<Title>Great hardware; HORRIBLE software.
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Purchased a 30gb Zune on amazon for an unbelievable price (less than $60 shipped brand new!!!) and received it early december.  Here are my thoughts after nearly a month of ownership.  The actual player is great.  I mean truly excellent.  I feel that it is very well made and has a beautiful screen.  It is also very versatile with podcast support, video support (I probably watch just as much video as I listen to music) and wifi sharing.  For those wondering, MS has stated that games are on the way!  Overall, I much, much prefer my zune over my buddies IPOD video.  The IPOD video screen is just too small for me to watch video.  I'm not an audiophile, but I think the music is pretty even sounding between the two.  Better quality earbuds help a lot in this area.  So if I love it so much, why only 4 stars???  The Zune software is truly, truly HORRIBLE.  I mean, to the point where it feels like a beta horrible.    I am not really heavy into music organization and even I think that the zune software can't organize music correctly to save its life.  It will randomly sort songs and assign album art.  It will also randomly split apart albums based on god knows what.  There is no way to easily tag music in the zune software itself.  It needs to be done with 3rd party software and maybe the zune will accept the changes.  Creating playlists is also needlessly difficult.  You cant sort playlists (that I can find anyway) so how you put them in is how you are going to hear them.  A real PITA when you are creating a TOP 40 playlist and cant sort by their position on the countdown.  You also can not sort video AT ALL.  Yes, you are going to have to scroll through your entire video collection to find what you want.  There are also people reporting massive software failure (see zune.net).  I have fortunately not experienced anything of the sort.   The good news is that software can be fixed and the zune team has promised patches to fix most of the issues reported (here's hoping).  They seem to be dedicated to getting this done right.  So would I recommend the zune?  Well yes and no.  I think that the zune is a great value at a price point of around 100 dollars.  For 150 and up, I would say wait to see if MS makes good on its promise to fix its busted software before purchase.  My first review here... hope someone found it helpful.

<Title>One of the best items I have ever recieved
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Over this past holiday season I was lucky enough to recieve a new 30GB Zune. I must say for the week and a half I have had it it has not let me down at all. It was one of the most amazing items I have to this day. The screen shows clear images and movies. It plays all of my favorite movies and clips. Getting the music, videos, and pictures on the device was very easy; the software almost did it for you. The Zune is very easy to use as well. I love my new Zune and I have run in to no problems at all. Infact my cousin is having more problems with her Ipod. Which at first I believed to be a better product until I was able to compare them through use. If I had a choice whether to get the Zune or Ipod by far I would chose the Zune.

The Zune marketplace never works... so forget an interface life that could match the iTunes. I would have appreciated a list of pains with the software before. As far as the music play and video is concerned, its pretty good. A lot bulky though. I guess they need to be a lot more aggressive in making it as popular as the pod.

<Title>love my zune
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I opted for the Zune 30 over the Zune 80 because I'm hard on my toys and I needed something that will tolerate me occaisionally dropping it or tossing it into my purse that doubles as a briefcase and general catchall.  So far, so good.  I've been learning on the fly because I refuse to read a manual and I haven't gotten stuck yet. It seems as simple as anything else I've tried - truly plug and play with the basics. I haven't gotten onto the Zune "Social", but if it's nearly as uncomplicated as the rest, it's more than worth the price. My only caution is it comes bare bones (no headphones, sync cables, etc.) so be prepared to shell out extra or seek out a bundle when purcasing. I found a sync cable that came with a car charger/wall charger which works out for my needs just fine for now.

<Title>Truly Terrible Software Design
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My expectations were fairly low, I just want an MP3 jukebox to use in my car and with my stereo receiver. So... the sofware crashed a few times on installation.  It did sync my files, but many albums/folders won't play correctly, edit correctly, and it's not because of copyright protections. I suspect I have to re-organize and dummy things down for the Zune to get to play folders properly.  Otherwise it's OK, but if you use a computer based mp3 player like WinAmp, working with Zune is like playing ping pong with the village idiot. The interface does not run smoothly on your desktop, it repeatedly hangs-ups and I'm talking about running it on XP, SR2.  I have to say it's very disappointing to see a company like MSFT put out a product that seems 3-4 years behind the curve software-wise. Yikes!

<Title>The Zune... its good.
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is cleverly conceived.  Sure, it's a LOT like the ipod, but lets be honest... what other kinds of designs are there that are easy to use and easy to control, and manipulate?  To stray too far away from a similar design would be to try to reinvent something that already works..... very well might I add.  The zune does not have a spin-your-thumb-to-scroll interface, but it does have a click-button-to-scroll and hold-down-to-go-fast option.. I enjoy that better, I can select the music I want faster and with more precision.   I enjoy that all versions of the Zune are compatible with eachother so far, and I hope that doesn't change.  The Zune sync software is incredibly easy and user-friendly, itunes is very clunky and very hard to figure out (my 400gb music collection lags my computer down hard, where the zune software loads quickly and smoothly)  The radio feature is pretty amazing.  The one downfall is the lack of licensed products for the Zune, you cant just goto the dollar general and pick up a dock like you can for the ipod, but that does ensure quality, when you do find something that connects to your zune, you know it will work for real and not just for a few hours.  I have heard of problems like the Zune randomly turning off and such, and my mom has had it happen twice, each after she listened to it for 8 hours at a time.  So it might be battery related, and It might not be.  Who knows.  I have yet to have that be an issue.  The sound quality is very good and the earbuds that come with it are pretty decent too.  I highly recommend the Zune, there are peripherals for it just like the ipod, but you just have to order them from the internet mostly; though Office-Depot does carry a Zune Dock Stereo system.

<Title>Terrible software, exceedingly fragile
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my Zune at the beginning of December. I installed and used the Zune software (which is extremely inferior to iTunes), then had to download a separate ID3 tagging program to make everything show up properly (with compilation albums, you would either have 1 album with all artists being Various Artists or 25 different albums with different artists.   The real kicker, however, is that after 2 weeks the LCD cracked. The outer casing, however, is fine. I had my iPod for a year and knocked it around numerous times without a hitch. I had the Zune for two weeks, never dropped it or anything, and now the screen's pretty much unviewable. The worst part is that it's not covered under Microsoft's warranty. Great.  Most of my friends have older MP3 players and are looking to upgrade. I'll be making sure to dissuade them from choosing the Zune.

<Title>I'm Happy with my Zune
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I decided on the Zune 30Gig unit primarily based on the very attractive price and the capability to wirelessly synch.  I bought it to replace a large CD changer on my Stero system.  So far so good; I am really happy with it.  It was easy to set up and synch with my music and digital still photo collection.     I have it interfaced with my receiver and TV using the Zune dock and remote.  This works nicely for listening to the music collection while watching slides.    There are some things that don't work as I expected.  And you have to figure them out by trial an error because the operation manual is not very detailed.  One thing I discovered is that the wireless networking is disabled when the NTSC video output option is enabled.  So you can't control the sync operation via the Zune remote because you can't see the options on the TV.  And I haven't been able to figure out how to initiate the synch operation from the PC.  You seem to have to initiate the sync from the Zune device.  It automatically connects to the wireless network, synchronizes the collection and playlists from the PC and then disconnects from the network.  It would be nice to be able to initiate a synch session from the PC.  In my opinion, Zune support software on the PC also leaves a bit to be desired.  It doesn't have all the functionality of MS Media Player; I find that strange.  In an effort to make it very simple to use (I guess), it operates differently from most other Windows applications.  But other than these minor shortcomings my experience with the Zune has been very good.

<Content>Both my sister and my dad now have matching Zune players; I am planning on purchasing one as well. I have played with both and heard their reviews of the product. What I have determined is that the hardware is incredible for the price. I was shocked at the screen quality! Unfortunately, there are some glitches with the software, however, it is manufactured by Microsoft and they are constantly updating. The social share feature is relatively worthless as you can only transfer three songs at a time which only last for three days. My opinion, though, is buy it. Microsoft is selling the hardware cheap to compete with Apple's ipod and the software is bound to improve relatively soon.

<Content>Ok.  This isn't the new Zune, it's the old one.  But for the 89 bucks price tag we paid during the pre Christmas sale, the 30G will hold all of my music and all of my pictures.  We are very happy.  The only drawback so far is the FM transmitter needed to listen to the Zune on our car stereo has terrible reviews, so we are doing without.

<Title>Stock up on Tylenol if you buy this...
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My 10 year old son got the Zune for Christmas from Santa.  I had nothing but problems from the get go.  After 7 hours and three calls to Tech Support (which were friendly and didn't keep me on hold much) the device completely locked up and I was instructed to wait 3-5 business days to get the box to send it in for repair.  Add 3-5 more for it to reach them, 10-15 for the repair to be completed, and then 3-5 for it to come back.  Throw in a couple of weekends and it's nearly a month until my son can use his defective product.  I took it back to the store where we bought it and we got an I-pod instead.  After 2 hours he was watching videos and we had installed most of his CDs.    The software was horrible.  There was no manual for use included, nor was there any documentation on line.  Very few songs were in the Zune Marketplace - you had to go to outside sources and then try to download them into the Zune software.  I couldn't even get it to work with Windows Media Player made by Microsoft.  Tech Support was unable to get it to work either - whether that was a software problem or ultimately a problem with our device I do not know.    As this was our first portable player ever, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I thought I would be safe and happy with a product that had the Microsoft name on it.  I could not have been any more disappointed.

<Title>Do not purchase a refurbished unit
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product was purchased as a christmas gift and was a real disappointment when the software that was included did not allow the unit to sync.  Sync is the process which allows media to be downloaded from the PC or laptop to the Zune unit.  I installed the software on both a desktop PC as well as a laptop PC and the result was the same in that the Zune was never detected by the PC.  Both of these PC's are running microsoft windows XP.   Bottom line is that the Zune is not useable which is an extreme disappointment especially for a child who had hoped to receive this for christmas.  Therefore, BEWARE when you purchase refurbished electronics as software is tricky and if not up to date can cause problems.  I will never purchase refurbished again.

<Content>My 16 y/o son got this for Christmas this year and absolutely loves it. It did take a while to get the software to load, but we were forewarned that may be the case, so no worries there. He loves the big screen that goes horizontal when the zune is turned. I love the fact that I was able to get him 30, count them 30 Gig for 130.00 instead of a measly 4 gig had we gone with the nano. There's no question, and NOT just for the money, the zune rocks!

<Title>ZUNE review
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Could not believe the price.  Thought I would get it AFTER christmas, but got it in 20 days of ordering.  My kids told me it was last years model, but it still has all the bells and whistles.  They love it!  I wish I had ordered more for my other kids.  TWO Zunes for less than the price of a new one today. Only one problem.  One of my daughters set her's up at home with dial-up internet.  Took a while, but no problems.  My other daughter set her's up using high speed wireless internet at college.  It WOULD NOT set up.  She came home and used the dial-up and was up and running in a few hours.  Sure dial-up took longer, but it worked.  I still need to ask the girls about the wireless capacity of their Zunes.  I hope they tried it out!

<Title>Good hardware, bad software
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently got a 30 Gb zune for Christmas and have encountered numerous situations both good and bad. The Zune itself is a nice little player, it looks great with a very easy to use system. The sound quality is good, the option to set pictures as a background is always fun, and the screen is beautiful. The only downside is microsofts annoying habit of including vital system operations in the memory, so you actually only get approximately 29.5 Gb, no big deal. All in all this looks like a great little device, but as soon as you connect to your PC (and you must) it turns devilish.  The first thing you may notice is that as soon as its plugged in, either to charge or to set music, you can't listen to it. While plugged in it is completely useless. Sure, I can overlook this feature. Then you start with the software, holy cow the software.   The Zune software will have to update itself about a zillion times before you can use it. Then when its ready to use, you must 'sync' anything you want with your Zune. Of course this process is imperfect specifically if you're trying to re-sync something for the purposes of organization. Of course the worst part is the complete inability to organize your own collection. The Zune probably takes pride in doing this for you, unfortunately pride is only one of its sins.   It can't seem to get any albums or artists right, particularly if its from any source other than zune marketplace. The result is lots of songs organized under "unknown artist" or "various artists" when you know there's only one artist and who it is. Then it will probably break up your album into 5 or 6 "unknown albums" and assign it an arbitrary cover art from some other place in the software. Finally, the coup de grace, you can't manually input album or artist information for individual songs. So, you're finally stuck with either tons of unknowns or grouping them into awkward groups that don't have anything to do with each other.  Unfortunately, this makes the clever menu system on the Zune itself completely bogged down with tons of random and incorrect information. You have to wade through the forest of menu to reach the correct "unknown album" for you particular song.  Typical microsoft: Good hardware, terrible software. Its too bad, cause I really liked the thing initially.

<Content>What a great deal on a great competitor to the over-priced iPod.  Although the product was priced for shipping after Christmas, it arrived two weeks early!! How often does that happen?!?  Microsoft is continuing to work out the remainder of the quirks with protected media, but I think that will be solved soon.

<Title>in love
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm so in love with my Zune. I got the NYLON special edition, featuring sweet decals of drawn diamonds on the exterior. I really can't get over my Zune and feel the need to let everyone know. This pink color is so nice, and the NYLON design makes it even better. The size of the screen is perfect, video clear, and it allows you to view things widescreen like the iPod Touch. Unlike the iPod, the Zune allows you to really show off the system's aesthetic beauty with gorgeous graphic design. You can select your own home screen background picture, and choose between the 78 NYLON covers given on this edition free. Not only does the NYLON edition come with free pictures, but free videos and songs. I had no problems with the software and can't get over how pleasing to the eye the graphic design is. ITunes definitely does not compare, and the Zune Marketplace is a lot better, in my opinion. Along with looking good and having great artists, the Zune Marketplace has a picture gallery, a bio, and other features of each artist. Plus, a song is only 79 cents! The only thing I don't like about the software is that there isn't a "Recently Played" or "Just Added" playlist, which iTunes has and I found useful.  I don't use the social wi-fi thing, but I don't really mind. I think the radio feature is amazing. You have access to radio and the song name and artist shows up.   To sum this all up, the NYLON Zune is one of the greatest things I've ever bought because of its aesthetic beauty, functionality, big crisp video and images, great sound, and overall coolness. I won't stop letting people know it. When I showed one of my friends my new buy, his response was "...Maybe I shouldn't have bought my new iPod.."

<Title>Nice... but
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first portable media player, before i used to play media in my iPaq, but i the experience was not too good. I just have it since a few days ago and i like it, the sound and the video are good and it have tv output and that is something i like, but there are a few things wrong with it, first installing the zune software to get it recognized with a nightmare, i spent several hours to get the firmware updated and it synchronizing to my computer, after this initial issue got solved i have not have more problems with synchronization while connected with the usb cable, but i have not been able to synchronize it wirelessly, it recognize the network but for some reason when i try the synchronization it doesn't works.  I hope in next firmware updates this get some kind better.  I am still like it, because i love to been able to listen anywhere a good part of my music collection and to watch some videos and tv shows on it.

<Content>I hated the Zune! I tried to use it for a few days and was not happy a all. It would not download songs from the Zune Martketplace.  It would not tell me how to get them to download. It only told me to go to some forum and post all of the infomation about my zune.  I was not going to do that. I just bought the stupid thing already it wasn't going to work right!  So, I have already returned the Zune and bought an Ipod instead.  MUCH EASIER!!  Very happy with the Ipod!  I did not have the patience for the Zune.  Maybe if I was more tech savvy it would not have been so bad.  I just want something I can download songs to easily and not have any problems. Not the case with the Zune.              Good Luck!

<Title>Hoping to get my money back
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received a 30 Gig Zune back in early July. It was the greatest toy I'd had in 20 years. I raved about how much fun it was. I spent weeks perfecting the music and pictures I wanted on it. I loved it. It was easy to use, easy to update and change, easy to search for music buried in my large files... And then... just in November, I happily downloaded the NEW generation Zune software and it absolutely ruined everything. I can't even imagine what Microsoft was thinking. Why would they destroy this product? The new software is a terrible, terrible, terrible train wreck. The entire Zune project department should be fired. My Zune is now a $200 piece of junk. And there are chat rooms full of people saying exactly the same thing. You can't even get technical help. The Zune won't update. The music and pictures are all wrong. The meager instructions that appear when you plug in the Zune are indecipherable and unhelpful. For example, there is an inexplicable icon to click --if you feel lucky or daring-- that says "Forget this device." That is exactly what I plan to do--forget my device. Luckily, I bought an extended warranty with it in July, and now intend to seek a full refund.

<Title>Lacking, Lacking, Lacking.  And that's the Good Part.
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'll begin by saying up front "It's not an iPod" and leave it at that.  I won't go on about how many features should have been like an iPod... it's a Zune.  Now, considering this thing fresh and without prejudice... The Device itself is good, as good as the Zen or Lyra, but the software support is absolutely hideous.    Viewed as a "system" (both hardware and software) it significantly misses the mark.  I agree with others, I *wanted* to like this thing, but can't get past the extremely limited software interface.  You *cannot edit tags*, such as adding your own artwork to each track.  The software natively rips CD's into DRM .wma files.  It adds tags to my .mp3 music - tags that could be used to identify my home computer, for what purpose?  To make MP3 collection more traceable I suppose.  Did I ask it to do that?  The documentation is sparse.  This is not because it's 'so simple to use' that you won't need documentation.  It is fairly simple to download the software, install, and start using.  It'll scan your music, pictures, and videos and want to add them to it's "music library".  Oh yeah, it'll also want to make itself the *default* music player of your mp3's.  It'll create this rather confusing and difficult to sort/navigate matrix of album cover thumbnails.  It'll download and write tags into your existing MP3 files as to how to *purchase* these very tracks from the Microsoft Marketplace.  Hum... let's see... how to buy my own music?  Wow!  Thanks Microsoft!  Overall, this thing tries to be an iPod and fails miserably.  Yes, the screen is bigger and brighter.  But No, the navigation is clunky - no scroll wheel.  The lack of MP3 Tag modifications makes sorting of anything more than a few dozen albums a complete nightmare.  Yes, the FM feature is really nice.  I'll be using it when I can't find my own music on the Zune.  Yes, having it communicate with the XBOX360 is cool.  No, it won't bluetooth or communicate with a non-Microsoft product.  Where it not for the tens of millions in research and development by Microsoft to create the 'iPod killer', I would think this product were just a bad joke.  But it is not.  An amateurish attempt - without consideration of what is happening in the world of digital music.  We spent the $180, got the Zune and the 2nd MP3 player of the house, and discover it's just not worth it.  Next time around, I'll live with the slightly smaller screen and get another iPod.

<Title>Excellent Product - Worth Every Penny
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok so apparently people are very confused about this product, and obviously do not know how to work the device (despite it being very simple to use). Don't be confused, 100 times over this product is better than the iPod, merely just in the fact that you can tell it is solidly built. Buying this product, you can feel confident in getting an excellent product at a great price.  Pros: +Good price +Yes it DOES sync wirelessly (although slow, so I just plug it in; ooooo big hassel) +VERY WELL BUILT (have owned iPods, and they are cheaply put together; the harddrives aren't protected enough and they brake too easily) +It is an MP3 player, and a darn good one at that, not exactly sure why people are thinking this was designed to solve the world's problems or something, it just plays music and videos +Video quality is absolutely amazing, the screen does look far better than the iPods +Software IS Vista compatible, and the software is very nice to use (I HATE iTunes btw) +Runs much smoother than the iPod +You're an idiot if you download anything in a format other than Mp3 anyways, so it was 100% compatible with my music library +Better price, more features, great product  Cons: -Doens't have a real scroll wheel, and it takes some getting used to; but now I actually don't even care and don't want a scroll wheel. -Would have been nice to have just used WMP -Isn't the next messiah as people expect from this little device?

<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was the absolute worst online experience. I would NEVER purchase anything from J&R Music and Computer World ever again. This seller allows you to purchase things they don't have in stock. Guess what happens? You get an email 4 days later stating that your order has been cancelled, because "Amazon" oversold their product. They offer you absolutely no compensation, except asking you to come to the store and purchasing this for regular price. Now, I have a whole bunch of Zune accessories with no Zune. I purchased these accessories after receiving an email stating my order had been processed, when in reality, it was cancelled 4 business days later. So, in total I waited a week to find out that my order had been cancelled. I suggest "J&R Music and Computer World" be reported to the Better Business Bureau for unsavory business practices. I suggest you go with another seller, they use Amazon as a scapegoat for the lack of their stock.

<Title>Love it!!!....BUT, it has some quirks
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zune (1st gen) for $85 on Amazon on Black Friday.  It took a few weeks to get it, but it was well worth the wait...especially now that I am getting comfortable using it.  It was a bumpy start because the download process was buggy and incredibly frustrating.  It actually took several attempts over two days for everything to work load properly.  Once it was finally installed, I was off and running!  I signed up for the Zune Pass and started creating playlists and downloading music.  I have also downloaded Podcasts, but have not downloaded any videos yet.    The sound quality is amazing and the picture, although a bit small, is quite sharp.  The materials that they used for the body and screen are scratch resistant, which is very nice. If they could just come up with fingerprint-proof screens, it would be perfect!  :)  Also...a clock would be nice as well!  The music selection in the Marketplace is great!  The only disappointment is that I can't find more spa-type music.  You know, the relaxing calgon-take-me-away type of music.  It's possible that it's there and I just haven't found it yet, but if it is there...is sure isn't obvious.  There are a few quirky things that I have noticed with the sync process though.  I will have items in my list online, but I find one missing from my Zune from time to time.  I sometimes need to remove it completely and then add it back in again.    The battery life is decent, but what I don't like is that the battery will last a while, but then just drop drastically all of a sudden.  Next thing you know, it's dead.  It seems a bit buggy that way.  This was truly the best $85 that I have spent in a LONG time!!!

<Content>Very good Zune 30gb media player with large screen and solid. It took me quite a while to connect it to my computer. I wish that I could have control to what I would like in my Zune. It seems to take all the pictures in when when I transfer them from my computer. I don't know how to erase them on my Zune player. I erase them in my computer, then it takes the pictures out in the player. Otherwise, the sound is excelent and the screen is clear with good colors.

<Title>ZUNE 30 GB Beware the screen cracks easily
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the heading is the story. I bought 2 and treated them gently - gave it a nice plastic case and treated it like all my other MP3 players but within one month both are being returned and I am hoping that Microsoft won't declare I was a bad Zune owner. I don't know how this scrren compares to others but as an owner of an IRiver 20 gb I can tell you this is a much more delicate player then others I owned.

<Content>I was skeptical about purchasing this because of the mixed reviews but I after getting the Zune I was very happy.  Setup on the computer was very simple and I have had this now for about a month and has been working great.  It is a little bigger than an ipod but the screen is nice for videos.  I am now a firm Zune fan for life.

<Title>Great hardware, software needs a little work
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After much harassment by my family, I broke down and bought the 30 GB Zune (early Christmas present to me).  I didn't want an iPOD (being somewhat a non-conformist), so the Zune works well  I must say, except for the software, it has been an excellent experience.  The 30GB Zune holds my entire MP3 library as well as all my ripped CDs I own (300+) and still only used up 15 of the 30 GB.  I have 5 full DVD movies (converted to WMV with 3rd party software) and still have over 5 GB of space left!  The storage is bloody awesome.  Now, on to the meat of it...  The Zune is very easy to navigate, the menu options are clear and concise.  I can access my songs by title, artist, and genre, but usually I just hit shuffle.  Video is the same, although I have found that playing video uses up markedly more battery life than music or the FM tuner.  The FM tuner is great - my stations all come in clear with little static, which is great for a device with no visible antenna.    The specs say up to 20 hours of continuous playing, although I have found this to be on the optimistic side.  Probably more like 12 - 15 hours, depending on how many videos you play, and how long you leave the backlight on.  The backlight can be adjusted to various timeframes (mine is set to 15 seconds), and it will definitely save you battery life if you set it low.  Speaking of settings, the volume goes from 0 - 20, but I rarely find it necessary to go beyond 7 or 8.    Physically, the Zune seems pretty tough, though I recommend getting a clear plastic overlay (like for a Palm) for the display screen.  The housing attracts fingerprints, but is easily wiped off.  The included ear buds are really not that great, and certainly not comfortable.  I would recommend headphones or a different pair of earbuds.  The sound is fine, but after extended wearing, it starts to hurt.   Now, the software.  The Zune would have rated 5 stars imho, but for the software.  It's slow, doesn't respond well, and doesn't find everything you ask it to - even after specifying the folders where songs, videos, and pictures are located.  To it's credit, the syncing is relatively quick (with a USB 2.0 port), and it will convert videos to it's preferred format (WMV) if it's able (which is to say, sometimes).  I'm sure also the minimalist design appeals to some artsy crowd, but overall it just makes it more of a pain to try and find stuff.  The "user manual" is a joke, being only about 5 pages long, and less than helpful, other than to get you up and running.    A long-winded review, but overall, I would definitely recommend the Zune, but tell Microsoft to get some design and functionality help with Windows, err. I mean the Zune software.  Merry Christmas!

<Title>Zune rocks! No regrets!
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been wanting a Zune vs Ipod for a while but couldn't decide between the two and the thoughts of dropping that kind of cash on myself especially at Christmas was tough. Thanks to a great after Thanksgiving sale on Amazon, my decision was made to get the Zune and I have NO REGRETS! My friends with Ipods want my Zune! The screen is bigger and clearer and I get radio too! I can easily download my own CDs and from any site easily-not just Itunes store! And the Zune marketplace is easy to use too! My Zune has a cool protective cover(and the brown makes it unique) and has been dropped a bit...the ipods are more fragile looking and get smudges and scratched too easy! The 30gb holds 7000 songs...I download all the time and haven't touched the max. I love my Zune and recommend to anyone trying to decide between the two!

<Title>More then happy!
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've seen the Zune around for a while now and for the longest time I gave it the cold shoulder. It didn't impress me, just like the Ipod. I started to take interest in the Zune when the Zune 80 was announced 80 gigs for $250 was not bad in my book, plus the controls for it reminded me of my Creative zen micro. I've been a big Creative mp3 player fan for the longest time. I was considering getting another one till I saw that the Zune 30 was going to have the same firm ware as the Zune 80 and it was on sale for $89.99 on Amazon. I could not pass up a deal like that, so I bought the brown Zune 30 gb, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IXP946/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune Home A/V Pack</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWN1LM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune Leather Case 30 GB</a>, and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M1EBGG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Car Charger Cigarette Lighter Adapter for Microsoft Zune</a> which I got all of these for under $180. Getting the Zune was probably one of the best decision I have made in my life. It's very stylish (I don't care what people say, but brown is a nice color for a mp3 player), it's really easy to use, the software isn't as bad as people say it is, and it was very cheep (at least for how much I got it for). Only problems I have with it is that I don't know many that have Zune's so the wireless social file transferring is kind of pointless to me. Another thing that annoyed me about the Zune is that it is only compatible with the Zune software and don't work for WMP's "PlayForSure" software (which I used for my Zen and worked just fine). One last thing that I had a problem was that the wireless transfer to PC was a Vista only(I got XP and I don't want to "upgrade"), not really a problem but I wanted to try it out. But the few problems aside this is a really good mp3 player and for the value I got it for, it blows other mp3 players out of the water! I would highly recommend this mp3 player to PC users.

<Title>Sweet Deal
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had some lucky timing and got the Zune 30gb for $99.  While it is a little clunkier and not quite as sexy as the 2nd gen Zune it is still a great media player.  I'm still waiting on some accessories and I have to say that I am a little disappointed by the dearth of accessories available.  The Zune branded items seem a little steep in price and third party manufacturers must not have been all that interested in stepping between MS and Apple on this turf.  I'm enjoying it, especially for the price.

<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This a pretty decent player. I have no complaints about the device itself. I do wisth there were more third party accessories, but what are you going to do? Because the Zune is the same width as an iPod classic, my iPod car cradle still holds the Zune securely.  I chose Zune because I wanted subscription music. I was a die hard iPod fan but buying frim iTunes was just as expensive as buying new releases at Best Buy every tuesday. I tried a few other players such from SanDisk and Creative, but I found that the Zune had the the most logical interface and of course it works pretty much as advertised with its own music store. Most of the music I want is available through the Zune Marketplace.  Video looks awesome. Sound quality is very good. Volume is acceptable, but there is no such thing as too loud for me.. Battery life is fair (improved after a second firmware update). Microsoft provides a firmware upgrade for the zune 30. This allows users to experience the interface and features of the second gen players. Apple doesn't make that provision for iPod owners.

<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software didn't appear to load correctly, or give the prompt to connect the device.  It's not compatable with Napster, or very few others that I can find.  I couldn't even get it to take music from Windows Media Player.  We could only get it to load a total of 4 pictures, which took forever.  The only way we could get it to take music reliably is straight from a CD.  Most of the time two different laptops wouldn't even reconize the device.  If Micosoft is try to compete with Ipod they have lost.  Basically the one we got was a piece of junk.

<Content>I am a grandmother who is not all that knowledgeable about all the new electronic gizmos on the market.  However, I purchased this digital music player to use while at the gym--specifically because it had access to an FM tuner while some of the other players do not have this feature.  I am very pleased with the quality, performance and ease of operation.  Even I can "rip" CDs and download music choices from the internet (my son would be shocked).  It is a bit heavy and I have not tried it at the gym yet as I have not found an appropriate arm band or other means to carry it.  The availability of accessories at local stores is sorely lacking.   Everything considered, I really like the Zune and enjoy listening to it while at work.  I would recommend the Zune.  I'm glad I took one more forray into the electronic age with this product.

<Content>Bought the Zune 30GB (Brown color) for $60 on Black Friday. The product was delivered within four days. Liked the packaging, very nicely done. I previously had a 30GB ipod, which I bought for 270 bucks. Zune is not an ipod when it comes to weight and looks, but it offers a good value for money. The sound quality is good, and the screen size is fantastic (more than ipod). I listen to songs frequently, so the battery drains pretty fast. One tip I would suggest to conserve battery, put the Zune in Shutdown mode when not is use (press and hold the Back button and simultaneously press down on the control pad for around 4-5 secs). The videos play well, and the pictures look great. Overall, an excellent value for money. If you could get the product for less than $150, then I would highly suggest that you buy this product.

<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The brown Zune was on sale for 89.00 at Amazon and I jumped on it and haven't been sorry in the least. It truly is worth the asking price. It's a beautiful piece, heavy enough to know you're holding something precious. The music is devine! I am listening to music I'd had on my pc or on CDs and am hearing notes I never heard before! Many sound like new music. I'm in love. love. love! My phoots are so clear and bright! This is a Chrismas present to myself and, boy, did I buy the right thing! I had an iriver 1 gig mp3 player and was happy with that, but Zune tops that by far. I am not an ipod fan and have no interest in it, but when the Zune was announced, I was ready to buy, but the cost was prohibitive, I thought. Since I purchased this one on sale, I really got a steal and am very happy. I read the review by an apparent "techie" who compared Zune unfavorably to the Ipod. I say, if you want an ipod, buy it...but the Zune results in love, love, love - of your old music, new music, your photos -everything!!!  As soon as I settle down, I'll get into the rest of the Zune. For now, I'm happy! Helen

<Content>I purchased this item on Thanksgiving Day!  Actually because the price was only $99.00.  Not really the color I wanted, but I thought for $99.00, that would be a GREAT deal!  So...the week after Thanksgiving, I get this call, saying this item was no longer available and they could get me another item for $179.00 each.  At this point I was not really happy, as I also have a business and I try very hard to keep up with my inventory!  What was I to do at this point, the price they offered was $20.00 cheaper than any store, and it was Christmas gifts for my kids!  So, instead of paying $99.00 each for a Zune, which would have only cost me $198.00 plus shipping, I had to pay $358.00 for two Zunes, but they did give free shipping.  So I paid $160.00 MORE than what I was planning!  I had also ordered the Silicone Skins to cover the BROWN zune.  The Skins came in with no problem at all, it was not until unter the skins came in, that I received a call, that the Zunes were not available!  Faster notice would have been nice!  Not sure who's fault it may have been, J & R or Microsoft?  But, things happen and it all got worked out!

<Title>Excellent hardware, clunky software
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I absolutely adore the hardware, the player itself is great.  Large, bright screen gives far higher video quality than I ever expected.  The factory headphones are fairly decent quality and when upgraded to a better pair of headphones the sound is amazing.  However, the software is beyond difficult to install.  I've spent hours on the phone with customer support because of conflicts with my Windows Media Center.  I've been using my mom's computer to store my music library and synch my Zune rather than deal with reinstalling so many of my media programs and drivers.

<Title>Satisfied with Zune
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The price and deilivery of the Zune was just as promised.  The price was cheaper than even major sale prices locally.  As for the functionality of the Zune, you cannot put music bought on iTunes on the Zune. - I understand it is a Microsoft vs Apple deal, but I have bought alot of iTunes music that is on my computer.  If I want that music on the Zune I have to buy them again.  You can share music from one Zune to another which will be nice if many people start buying them.  For right now this feature is not that useful.  The radio feature does have pretty good reception, which is nice.  Overall I like the ease of use and the $90 pricetag was GREAT -especially when compared to the 40GB iPod.

<Title>Zune falls FAR short of expectations.
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It took nearly a week of optimism and effort to discover that no matter how hard I tried, the Zune was not going to cooperate with my computer or my media. It only recognized my media files intermittently (with no rhyme or reason as to why a.mpg was recognized but practically identical b.mpg was not,) took literally DAYS to sync with my computer (and then, after 72 hours, produced an error telling me that half the files still didn't sync but couldn't tell me why) compared to the iPod's ten minute sync time for twice as much data, and the software was nowhere near as user friendly as iTunes.  The only positive things I can say are that I enjoyed the radio tuner feature, and it had a larger display than iPod (though, clearly, not the new iPod Touch) which was very pretty.  If you're considering buying a Zune, save yourself the hassle and just get an iPod. Seriously.

<Title>Great product, but only for certain uses.
<Date>Sun Dec 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, let me say I've used only Apple iPods to this point, namely the Mini and the Nano, and recently got the Nano Video (Thank you, Secret Santa!!). The Apple products have a better overall user experience, but they also have a few limitations, particularly in regards to video.  I use Media Center to record TV. As I am usually on the road, I never see much of what I record. Converting that material to a portable format used to be such a time consuming process: it took longer to complete then it took to watch.   When MS announced the 2.0 upgrade, it piqued my interest. One click MCE integration with a portable player! When Amazon put it on sale, picking up the Zune was a no-brainer (as was update to the new 2.0 software).   It worked! DVR-MS files could be easily synced to an affordable portable player. So now I've got Daily Show and Countdown to go! Further, with an A/V kit (also got that) they can be played back on a standard TV!  It's also a really good MP3 player. One huge advantage of the large 30GB hard drive is the ability to store high bit rate MP3's. With my Mini and now my Nano, the 4GB capacity had me converting my ripped 256 VBR MP3 files to 128 AAC files. Not so bad if you're listening on ear buds, but definitely noticeable if you're listening in the car.   And now it does podcast (audio and video) with aplomb. Very handy on long trips.  So, we've got portable PVR files, great sounding audio, and podcast. What's not to like?  Well, it's larger and heavier then the current generation of flash based players (Zune, iPod, as well as the others). Bit of a mixed blessing, as the larger screen is definitely more watchable, and the 30GB HD allows you to hold a lot of video, as well as  high bit rate MP3's. But it doesn't just drop in your pocket.   Further, being Hard Drive based, like my old Mini was, battery life suffers, like my old Mini.  MS didn't include Plays For Sure, so you can't take your unbox videos with you (you listening Amazon?)  Lastly, the Zune software is not the equal of iTunes. It's not bad, it's just not the fluid experience that is iTunes.   Conclusions?  If you use Media Center (or any other PVR software for that matter) and want to watch your Video on the Go, this is the best bet for the money.  If you listen to your audio in a car, an HD based player is a probably better bet than a flash based player, unless you have a short play list.  Other than that, you are probable going to be happier with a flash based player, Zune, iPod or whatever.

<Title>I like it better than an iPOD !
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used an iPOD in the past and have not really been impressed with the click wheel and menu system. My favorite up until now has really been the Creative ZEN series. I stayed away from the Zune since I heard some bad press when it was released over a year ago. Late summer of 2007 brought a new version of firmware which righted many of the wrongs reported by people using the Zune, kudos to MS.  Fast forward until black Friday, 2007...Microsoft and several retailers including Amazon were blowing out the brown Zune at under $100 to get some good market share for Microsoft...talk about your loss leader...I bit the bullet and bought a couple of them, one for my daughter and one for me.  Setting up the Zune is very easy, navigating through the menus is simple, the sound is great...my initial reaction to the Zune was that it is a great audio and video device...the addition of a Belkin battery extender and Altec Lansing Home speaker dock made it all the better of an experience.  The video is crisp and sharp on the 3" screen (only 2.5" screens in most other video players including the iPOD...yes the iTouch iPod may have a bigger screen, but not a bigger hard drive!)  So, 30GB of storage, easy interface, wireless connection, FM Radio tuner (ipod don't have that either), pictures, videos, music, podcasts and more...I am very happy with this product! (so is my daughter)

<Title>A Worthy MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I hate to make the obvious comparison...again.  But since the iPod dominates the personal media player market, every new product is designed as an iPod competitor (for better or worse.)  This is not to say that the iPod is the "best" player on the market, but it does mean that when another manufacturer markets their player, they are trying to make a customer out of someone who would most likely otherwise be buying an iPod.  So to compare advantages:  Zune -Larger screen (note: players have same resolution, 320x240) -Price (current Zune 30 price vs ~$250 for iPod classic) -Wireless Connectivity (kind of gimmicky, given 3 play restriction.  New firmware does add ability to sync Zune wirelessly, which too, adds arguable functionality) -FM radio   iPod (Classic, 80GB) -Battery Life -Size -Storage Capacity       -Availability of 3rd party accessories -Widespread consumer comfort with iTunes.  In short Zune and iPod have similar feature sets, each with a few small advantages over the other, but at the end of the day both will give the user a similar experience, providing access to a respectable library of music and or video.  The Zunes's primary advantage is one of price, the iPod's advantages being storage capacity and battery life.  The Zune 80 addresses both of these iPod advantages, offering 80GB of storage and 20+ hours of battery life, but approaching the iPod classic's price point (~$250) in doing so.  Sooo, buy the Zune 30 if you are cool with the relatively small disk size (that is you have a media collection smaller than 30GB, or you only want to take a subset of your library on the road with you.  On a more personal note...I've had my Zune 30 for 2 months now (but only now, sitting at home over Christmas break, an I bored enough to write about it.)  The Zune has performed well, offering excellent functionality.  The player itself feels solid, and the software seems robust.  It should be noted that the new software (zune 2.0 software (the "new" post-firmware-update software) can be a tad overambitious in managing how music is added to the player, but once you figure out how to work with it, all is well.)  So yeah, thats the long and short.  The reason I wrote this, however, was to disagree with another reviewer who said that the Zune 2.0 software does not work with Vista.  In my experience, Zune 2.0 works well with Vista.  I have noticed that the software is rather resource intensive, for whatever reason, so this may have something to do with the other reviewer's problem.  If you think the Zune 30 meets your requirements, give it a shot, I think you'll like it.

<Content>Oh, my gosh. I love this mp3. I bought it here because it listed for an amazing purchase price, but also because others rated it so highly.  The device functions as it should, and others ratings are very accurate. The device is not a Ipod, but it is just as good. The charge life is short (15hrs?) but you just plug it and it charges quickly. It is bigger than the Ipod- which is fine with me since I mostly use it my car anyway- and now I wont lose it.  I am glad I bought it not only for the price but also for the performance. If you are sitting there wondering if you should buy it- you should stop reading and just buy it.That's it.

<Title>Better Than Expected!
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So before my purchase, I was trying to decide between the iPod Classic, Zune, and Sandisk Sansa (8GB). I was leaning toward the Sansa, and was going to add an extra 2GB MicroSD card. When I priced out the three models and considered their respective abilities, it was difficult to not go with the Zune 30, which was priced at less than $90 at the time. This price was only available in Brown, which is fine, because that is what I would have chosen. So, I chose to buy the product that was not universally loved as some other media players seemed to be, but I couldn't beat the price.  Pros: 1. Packaging. When I first looked at the box, I was impressed. The packaging is awesome. If I were giving this to a friend or family member, I would be proud of this packaging. Very well thought out with the Zune and each accessory (cords/headphones) having their own compartment! It reminded me of opening Apple's Mac Mini awhile back. Coolness factor in Microsoft packaging - who knew that could happen? 2. Look. Yeah, it looks great. Would I think this if it were $249? Maybe not. So it falls short of my first impression of the iPod, but it looks great. The exterior does not pick up fingerprints (except the screen, but that is a given). 3. Firmware updates! I am impressed with the software navigation. The newest firmware upgrade must have fixed problems that other reviewers had. Its great! The navigation buttons are not touch like the new Zune 80 (which is an improved player by the way) but they work great and get you where you need to go. As far as I know, Apple does not provide firmware upgrades. Too bad. 4. Display/Sound quality. Yeah, the display quality is great. I have watched documentary films on the device (I'm a teacher) and it looks great. Plenty big enough for being a mobile device. Sound quality is great as well. Not an expert, but my music sounds awesome, even on the craptasic headphones (more later). 5. Wireless connectivity. This is one option the iPod classic does not offer (as well as FM tuner). You can sync the device wirelessly if the Zune software is open and you have a wireless network at home - even if it is encrypted. Its just cool and it works great (albeit a bit slow). Also Zune to Zune connectivity is cool if you know or are around people with Zunes. Very cool bonus feature.  Cons: 1. Size. Kind of big. Slightly larger than iPod classic; much larger than the Sansa. Has a larger screen than both of these though, and is not a big problem unless you don't want to strap it to your arm for jogging. 2. Headphones. They are ok, but not impressive. The earbuds are magnetic, which seems to help a bit with the tangles. The ruberized plug is the highlight. The headphones that come with the Zune 80 are much nicer and cooler. 3. The "Social" (wireless Zune to Zune) is not so helpful at the moment because not many people have Zunes. If you are in an upper middle class high school (or college I guess), you'll find plenty of students with them, but otherwise you may never be able to share music and pictures with friends on the "social" because your friends own a different device.  I have not purchased any music through the Zune marketplace, but it seems easy enough. I do subscribe to several podcasts through the Zune software and that works great. I have had no problems with the Zune software, although it appears to be a memory hog. I only open it when I need it, so no biggie.  Anyways, overall, if you can get this player new (not remanufactured) for a good price, I would recommend this player. It gets the job done, and does it surprisingly well (sorry Microsoft).

<Content>Even with the recent device software updates, the Zune has a way to go to catch up with the iPod.    I believe the PC software update has been a major step backward. iTunes is so much easier to use.  However, when it comes to price, the Zune 30 is the best value, over the new, flash memory based brethren, and similar iPods.

The only thing I don't care for is you have to load the software on your PC to get it recognized and to transfer my music to it. However it does find all the music already on my PC with no problems. My cheap little 1GB just appears as a drive that I can copy music too. With 30GB of music on board I can ride for weeks and not get bored with the music.

<Title>A few problems
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: Nice video quality, cool scrolling, fairly easy program for transferring music, great price for the space & quality.  Cons: I am not 100% sure, but so far it's like every other player in that, if a song says it's a certain album, it will list the artists by however the song is programmed to consider it. Even after modifying the files in the program they don't sync properly on the device. I don't like that a lot of my music videos didn't sync, which I assume is a compatibility issue. You can't do much, anything really, from the device itself. You have to do all your modifications in the program. I like the auto-sync but it can become a pain since you add songs to the program from folders. So you can't just put one or two songs on without putting them into a folder. Most of this is pretty much universal mp3 player problems but it's too bad they weren't addressed.

<Title>A Short Analysis on Zune
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>all in all a mediocre media player that will give more frustration than satisfaction.  you'll get by with it, but there are many shortcomings within the device and its syncing program that will probably drive you nuts. its biggest flaw, though, is its WMV-only video playback.  i've yet to find a decent program that can convert a DVD, MPEG, AVI, etc. etc., into an exceptional WMV file.  granted conversion can be done via the (zune) program, but this can take hours on end to achieve.    for almost $100 less than the powerhouse iPod, i guess you can't expect too much.  if you got the money, stick with the superior alternative.  if not, tread carefully and be aware that while a zune does its job, it doesn't do it very exceptionally.

I bought the Zune because of the storage size (30 GB) and I got it a really good price bfore Thanksgiving (less than $100).  I have a huge Cd collection but wanted to put alot of my songs in one place.  It is great and does what I want it to.  The music transfers fast from my computer to the Zune and I did not have any problems downloading the required software.  The sound is great and it is very easy to find your music once it is on the zune with the drop down menu.  Also has a FM radio which works really well and sounds great.  The video quality was great for me it looked a lot better than what I expected.  So If you can find this at a reasonable price I think it is a great player.  I found the zune store to be ok and really had no problems with it.  No real problems that I can see so far.

<Title>I like it better thant the IPOD
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the ZUNE better than the IPOD because... it has a much bigger screen, hence a useful size screen. I think the wireless sync is cool, although the peer to peer is dumb. The Zune software is great, even though I found a few kinks - but it is still better than the problems I had with ITUNES.   The pod casting and radio are enjoyable features. The wireless sync together with the pod casting allows you to choose your favorite news, politics or comedy pod casts (etc...) and wirelessly sync them each night. Because each time you plug the ZUNE in to charge (even the wall charger -sold separately), it can be set to start to sync automatically. Consequently when you wake up in the morning you are all ready to listen to your new material.   The ZUNE interface is just as simple to use as the IPOD. Unfortunately they omitted a touchpad (scroll-wheel) on the first generation ZUNE, and that can be annoying.   The earphones are decent and the sound is great.  The main drawback is that its bulkiness, but it is still great for trips or commutes and it fits into your pocket nicely.   So all in all, I think it is a great product. It is beyond me why Microsoft was unable to put out a competitively sized player with a touchpad, until the launch of the second generation. I think that really was a bad decision, they would have been able to get a good name from the start. So if you don't mind a slightly bulky (early 2000's style) player, and you want value for your buck, the ZUNE is the way to go.

<Title>a couple of huge flaws
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, let me say I like the large screen. It has a very nice resolution, and it's more customizable than the ipod. Unfortunately, the actual design of the zune looks like a cheap plastic brick when it's next to an ipod. The controls, while they work fine, are pretty unintuitive, and people who are used to ipods will start to notice just how cool the click wheel is comparing to regular buttons.  So, the actual player I would give maybe 3 stars. Moving on to the Zune marketplace, that's where the ipod really crushes the zune. The zune marketplace has a much smaller selection than itunes; it has about 3 million songs while itunes has 2 billion. Plus, the zune marketplace doesn't support playsforsure, which is stupid, and also it's only for pc, while itunes is for mac and pc.   So, the ipod is way better than this zune, BUT, there is a new zune, which has a vastly improved design that finally looks as good as the ipod, but it's pretty expensive. I haven't tried that, so I can't really review it, but I would buy the new zune if you're thinking about getting a zune at all.

<Title>The Software Is Virtually Unusable
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The hardware is fine.  I got this thing for $90 when Zune Brown was going for a song.  And now I almost think I should send it back.  $90 for a 30GB hard drive is a great deal... or so I thought.  But you really can't use it like a hard drive, and it's all down hill from there.  You have to use--you can ONLY use--the software that comes with it, which isn't merely bad.  It's evil.  I write software for a living.  I thought, "How bad can it be?"  Well, at least as far as I know, it hasn't messed up anything other than itself.  And that's about the best thing I can say for it.    Everything was going fine til yesterday, when, and you're not going to believe I was STUPID enough to do this... I plugged the Zune into my computer to charge it.  Then, last night, I went to listen to some music, and IT WAS ALL GONE!  Every single track came up as "Item is missing or cannot be played."  Every single track.    So, I searched the web.  Microsoft's knowledge base basically said, "Start over" and went on to list all the different levels of "starting over," the first and least severe of which is removing all the music from the Zune and re-synching.  So, I did that.  And I thought all was well.  NOT!  I went to put a few new CD's I'd ripped on the Zune.  I synched them up, went to play them, and again, EVERY SINGLE TRACK WAS GONE!!!  So... I started over again, except now I noticed that all those old copies out there were still taking up space on the Zune, and now it was nearly full, even though I've only got about 10MB of content.    So, now I've erased ALL the content from the Zune--the music, the pictures, the video, and I'm re-synching again.  We'll see...  If I had it to do over again, I'd pay the extra money and get the iPod.

<Title>Love the Zune but the software stinks....
<Date>Thu Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune for my husband.  He has been asking for an MP3 player for years and I finally bought him a 30GB so it could all his music.  He loves the screen, the color, the ease of use, but the software is not that great.  When he first installed it the software was messing up and it looked like something was wrong with it, it wouldn't show up clearly and it was hard to use.  He had to go on different websites and chat rooms to get help and he eventually had to reinstall it from the Zune website.  Now, it works but it is not really user friendly-he liked itunes much more.  If itunes were compatible with Zune, he would be using itunes instead.  Overall he loves the Zune and I saved about $100 buying the Zune instead of the Ipod off amazon.com!

<Title>Wow! Lovin It!
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got my Zune a couple weeks ago when it was on sale. Easily the best money I've spent on anything electronic. When Zune arrived, I first updated the firmware and loaded up all my music and some pictures. First thing I noticed was how good the sound quality was. I was hearing things I never heard in my previous mp3 player. I thought it was just because of the better ear buds but changed them out from my old mp3 player and the awesome sound quality was still there. I get approximately 11 hours from the battery just listening to music. That's with screen brightness on low, wireless off and display backlight on 30 seconds. Love the way you can change background screens. Very easy to figure out all the menus and on/off operations. Album art on the albums sub menu is an awesome idea. Very fast scrolling. When in song mode just click shuffle all and select the center button and see what the next songs coming up are. Again, awesome player! Would have been worth the original $249 price to me.

<Title>Much better than reported
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As it comes the first generation 30gb Zune is a decent and capable media player. When you upgrade the software to the latest version it really begins to shine. Microsoft did something interesting and unusual in this throw away  consumer marketplace. They updated an older technology through software to enable features found on the newest technology. I have been an iPod guy from the second generation ipod. I take one with me every day to listen to podcasts, books, and music on my 2 hours of commuting every day. When the Zune first came out I was interested, but was still in love with my Apple devices. when I finally broke down to buy the Zune, I did so with the usual reservations I have for any Microsoft product.  After a month with this device I have to say that I am happy with the whole experience. The controls take a little getting used to coming from the iPod, but are in no way bad. The menu navigation is in many ways better than the iPod. For instance, you can be listening to a song and browse through the other menus without having to back out one menu at a time like on the iPod. The wireless sync works great after you set it up, with a few exceptions. You should only enable the radio when you want to sync if it isn't in a docking station. Walking around with the wireless radio enabled will result in a quick battery drain. Instead of the 14 hours of life I routinely get from a charge, it will be more like 5. The simple solution is to disable it from the menu, when you don't need it. The sharing songs between Zunes, really isn't necessary for me right now, as I am the only person in my group of geek friends that has a Zune right now, so I can't comment on that feature. I'm told that it is better, but still not perfect. It will never be able to legally share files unrestricted as it faces the same legal issues that P2P file sharing face. In conclusion, I recommend the Zune as a capable and competent media player. The new Zune market place is a well designed and written application that makes iTunes look like a spreadsheet. When installing the software for the first time be sure to follow the directions, as this will save you time in the long run. One difference when you plug the device into your computer, is that nothing happens. With the iPod your computer will see it as another drive. Don't be alarmed when the Zune doesn't do this. This is one little drawback,as you can only use the Zune software to sync it. I use third party software with my iPods that I feel is supperior to iTunes. With the Zune, this isn't an option, but so far I like the software as is. Now with the addition of podcast/vidcast support it is really coming into it's own. Only the lack of Audible book support keeps it a little behind. I'm sure that in the future an agreement between the parties will enable this device's support with Audible. One other thing. As with any media player I always buy a silicone case with screen protector. This will absorb the shock if (when) it is dropped, and protect that lovely screen from scratches. BTW the new 80gb Zune uses a glass screen (not plastic)that is better with the scratches, but it's worth the extra protection for the low price of a case.

<Content>I am comming around to like the Zune after a somewhat long learning curve. Being used to using another MP3 Apple product required some adjustments. I do like the art that is attached to my MP3 files and old songs that are saved on my computer. Winter time static electricity really affects the Zune in a major way that I did not experience with my Ipod from Apple. At work when I do not have time to stop this is a problem. A static charge will reboot the Zune requiring I stop and search for the spot I was at in a 3 hour recorded radio show. It is almost useless during these times when it is cold and dry.

<Title>This Zune is great!!
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love my Zune, it works great. But you do need to charge it before you use it the first time. I tried to sync it right out of the box, and it wouldn't work. So I charged it up, then tried to sync, and it worked perfectly. When I later read the instructions, it does say that you need to charge it first before using it, so that was my error. I have had it now for about 3 months, and it still syncs and works fine. I like that I can organize my mp3 files anyway I want and set the software accordingly. When I tried the iTunes software, I just didn't like how it worked, it moved all my mp3's before I found the setting to tell it not to. All in all, I like the Zune better that the Ipod and the Zune software better than iTunes.

<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was lucky enough to get my Zune for less than $100 to test it out, but when I went back to get more for Christmas presents, the price jumped up to $175!  The 80GB just came out for $250, so I thought the 30GB would be a good value. I thought 30GB would be big enough for me, but I have an expansive library and have not loaded everything in yet, and am finding I will need to be more selective about what music I load. Also, I keep trying to tap the screen like my treo but soon realize I have to scroll to find what I am looking for.  Oh well, hard to teach an old dog new tricks!  I never had an ipod, but am thoroughly satisfied with my microsolft zune. I am having trouble upgrading software however to access zune marketplace, but am told I can contact technical help to receive assistance. My skeptical ipod friends are actually quite impressed. The size is a bit clunky but afterall I am used to using a treo so doesnt't bother me in the slightest.  I truly love this product!

<Title>Don't Buy
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Want a frustrating part time job with no pay? Buy a Zune.   I bought mine back in October. Plays music just fine. The nightmare is managing the music files and updates. I use a trusted software program - Media Monkey - to manage all my music files on my PC. When I did the initial setup the Zune grabbed all of the music files from Media Monkey. When I went into my Zune Library, most of the CD's were broken into 2 pieces, with some songs in one file and some in another. So I spent a lot of time in my Zune library trying to put the files back together. Some changes were accepted, some would not stick. I spent a lot of time making changes, syncing to my Zune device, and then finding new problems in the library. Then I tried to update to a new version and the updates fail with no real explanation other than to "close all programs and try again". When I went to the support site I read way to many horror stories about the update, so I guess I'm lucky it failed. And don't even think you're going to get real support for this thing. Microsoft's idea of support is user self service. They want us to read through pages and pages of user suggestions to find our fix.   So I'm not going to update, I'll work with what I have. And when my Zune dies I'll buy an iPod. And then I'll replace my PC with a Mac. Then I will be free from the crappy software from Microsoft.

<Content>I just bought my 30 Gb Zune this week.  It's an elegant little device...attractive, easy to use, fantastic graphics and a great radio tuner (my favorite local station displays the artist and song titles). Plus, it has let me rip a few protected discs that have been invisible to iTunes.  However, the software itself is ridiculously buggy...it crashed the system (an HP Pavilion), disabled Internet Explorer, Outlook Express and Windows, and rendered my USB drives inoperable.  I had to uninstall and reinstall XP and Internet Explorer.  Plus, I had to download Windows Installation Cleanup Utility to nuke it out of the system because it refused to uninstall.  Silly me, I then loaded it on the Dell laptop.  So far I've only had one Blue Screen of Death and it has "experienced an error" and shut down several times, but otherwise hasn't affected the system.  I still think it was worth the $129 (Office Depot), but I wouldn't buy it at full price.  Definitely keep up with the patches and updates!

<Title>An excellent media player, but with some deficiencies
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Features that prompted me to buy and use this player almost every day: 30 GB of storage space, a good sized viewing screen for photos, and an FM radio.  The Zune media player has now replaced two portable devices (radio, CD player), and a laptop computer on which I used to play my music files.  Retrieval of songs is logical and efficient.  It would be good to have more than a single quick list (to which songs can be added without connecting the unit to a computer).  Sound quality is excellent, but some of my mp3 files don't sound as good as when played on my laptop computer.  Photographs need to be edited (sized) for optimum viewing on the rectangular viewing screen, and are displayed in the landscape mode.  The level of saturation in my photos is often noticeably less on the Zune player than on my 2005 Toshiba Satellite laptop.  These are minor drawbacks, however.  I threw away the ear buds that were in the Zune package and always listen to music or FM radio with a set of over-the-ear headphones.  The Zune software was loaded uneventfully to a laptop computer which uses a Windows XP operating system.  However, it has taken me too long to acquire the experience necessary to operate the Zune software, and even after 12 weeks of frequent use I am still confronted by surprises and challenges.  The Help menu is of some value, but generally leaves me with more questions than answers, so most learning takes place by trial and error.  Examples of problems, some of which have eventually been solved: 1. Songs are sometimes skipped during synchronization, the process in which songs that have been linked to the Zune software library are loaded onto the Zune player. 2.  Some songs are loaded onto the player in duplicate, even though the Zune library display pane of the contents (albums or artists) does not show this. 3.  Track files which are clearly identified with a particular album in the Windows XP Explorer are occasionally not listed where they belong in the library or on the player. 4.  There are too many errors in display of album covers, and sometimes the cover displayed for a particular album in the Zune library differs from that displayed when this same album is viewed on the Zune player.  Overall, I rate the Zune media player as "excellent: A minus", and the Zune software as "needs improvement: C minus".

<Title>Solid brick that stores all of my music and photo library with plenty of space left for more
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this for about a month now and I've dropped it on cold, hard asphalt without any significant scratches. Compared to the cute and easily scratched Ipods, this one looks and feels like a little brick. If you prefer cute over function, or feminine over masculine, this isn't for you. The software is surprisingly intuitive, considering it's a Microsoft product.  The only thing I needed to learn from the manual was how to turn it on and off. The rest came naturally.  The 200+ CD collection I had was easily ripped to my computer using the Zune software-- an automatic process of just needing you to put place the CD in the tray and close.  I also put in all of my photo collections (2 to 3 thousand?), some podcasts, etc. and I stil have about 1/2 left in the HD.  I would have given this 4 but given the firesale price of $99, I had to give it another star.  The only negative I experienced was the earbud which, for me, does not fit too well but acceptable.

Had no problems loading up the software and transferring my music (big update for software though.)  I use my Zune everyday. When I go to the gym (four times a week, hour each time) and when I drive anywhere (bought a cassette adapter.) The battery life is good, charge it once a week.  If there's one thing to actually pay attention to from this review is... Don't believe the negatives people say about the Zune, most those people are probably I-pod lovers and apple people *thumbs down*   This is a great product and worth every penny, especially since its only 100$ I highly recommend!

<Title>Late start in the mp3 game but  Zune came to Play! (Hard!)
<Date>Sun Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When looking for a new mp3 player I wanted one thing that ipod didn't offer. FM stereo. Now I know you can buy an add on but, why bother? When I heard that MS was coming out with a 30gb and 80gb Zune I couldn't wait to get one. But like all new products there is always some drawbacks so I did wait to get one. After reading many of the crazy reviews here, I decided I would have to just take a chance. And I'm so glad I did. I bought a 30gb from Amazon who told me I would have it by 12/19/07. It arrived 11/22/07. I order it 11/18/07. Now that's what I call service. Thanks Amazon. But now back to the device. First off, I was very impressed by the size of the screen. It's almost 2x the size of the ipod and much brighter. The screen does resist fingerprints and scratches much better than an ipod and the unit itself seems much more durable. Downloading the software was amazing. No crashing, no freezing up just put the disc in and that was it. It basically did the set up all it's own. It automatically synced my entire WMP11 library(1417 songs) in 6mins. Then transfered all songs into the Zune library without me having to do anything. I found that to be awesome. Once I was fully charged I was ready to put it to the test. To really see if all the problem other user had did exsist. Music playback is okay. I did upgrade the earbuds w/ Sony's. Video playback Great! Bright color, good resolution and wide screen. awesome. Videos and Movies play horizontally and the click pad changes to match the device position. Pretty neat. Battery Life is pretty good. I got about 13hrs of play and that includes using the stock video playback and my synced music collection. The FM stereo is great. Very good reception and some stations display song and artist. Very cool. I haven't had a chance to use the wireless features yet, no one I know has a Zune (yet). Picture also sync easily. Just open "My Pictures" and ta da. The only drawnbacks are the limited forms of media formats it's compatible with (but I believe most media can be converted to what you need) and ipod does dominate the accessories and aftermarket departments. The Zune Market place does need some upgrading but I'm sure Bill Gates is looking into that as we speak (or type).Once I recharged my Zune I got an update and it changed things a bit. I can no longer manage Zune w/ WMP11. However all music rip to WMP11 still automatically transfer to Zune. I'm happy with my Zune and would highly recommend it. Zune might be getting a very late start in the MP3 game but it came to play and play hard. And play hard it does.

If you thank the DMV for informing you that they cannot registering your car because you forgot to check a box telling them you own a dog, then you'll love the software to get your music on your zune as well.  Expect this every other time you try to do something as outside the box and as exotic as adding podcast to your player.  Just add your podcast folder to the list of "monitored folders" under podcast and vou la there it is, every new episode downloaded will be synched each time you plug in your Zune.  That is unless the podcast your downloading do not have "podcast" as there genre id3 tag. Of 20 different NPR podcast I have, this is 13 of them.  To get these into your Zune you can put them individually into your music folder, and add them to a playlist each time a new one is downloaded, or you can download a id3 tag program and manually do it yourself for each episode every time you get a new one. The playlist option is easier but then you lose the ability to pause and return to any long podcast you might be listening too.  Be aware with this new software v.2 you will, 1. "waste" you time trying to figure out how to do things which should be seamless  2.  be severely limited in your options of how you can do things, don't expect your right mouse button to pop up a time saving menu  3. pray that they come out with version 3 soon

<Title>Zune, good for the price
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great product for the price, $100, when compared to the other products on the maket of the same specifications.  The software needs a ton of work however.  I have tested other mp3 interfaces and this one is clunky to say the least. Video is great but the conversion is slow as heck (all night to add movies).  If Microsoft dumbs the software down to a drag and drop level and removes all of the restrictive features so that you can use it to transport data, they will have a definite winner.  The FM tuner is a great touch and the controls are very easy to use on the player.  Good video quality and battery life is comparable to industry standard.  This a great player for individuals who's music to video split is 80/20.

<Title>Zune Me Till My Head Explodes!!
<Date>Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received a Pink (Limited Edition) Zune as a wedding gift from my wonderful husband who has an ungodly huge music library that he proceeded to load into my Zune. I also loaded our wedding pictures into my Zune and this is a great feature--I have a giant electronic picture frame that shows my wedding pics as a slide show along with all my other pics.  My husband loaded SEVENTEEN GIGS of music into it and also bought me a Pontiac Solstice sports car that I can plug my Zune directly into and rock on down the highway!  I love my Zune SO MUCH!! I had no problems loading the Zune-ware into my laptop and loading the music and pictures was a breeze. The clarity and color of the pictures is great, I love this feature!  I've never bothered with the wireless applications like radio or song sharing because I have TONS of my own music that I load from CDs into the Zune and I have XM satellite radio in the new car and in my Town Car.  For the record, I've never owned an iPod because I never really thought it would be something I would use and when John gave me the Zune I was skeptical about how much I would use it since I had a walkman but carrying around the cassettes then the CDs was a pain in the butt--I preferred the convenience of radio to carry around and the 6 CD changer in my Lincoln--but I am totally in love with the Zune. I load new music as I get it and with all the music I have in the Zune, there is still room for much more!  It interfaces seamlessly into my home stereos, my car stereos and with the killer headphones I bought to go with it (the ones that came with it hurt my ears--OUCH!) it's one of the best toys I've ever had.  I would recommend it to anybody!

<Content>I was in the market for a media player with video and more and saw the Zune.  It was such a deal ($99) that I could not resist.  It is fantastic.  I now have all my music, pictures, videos, TV from my Tivo, Podcasts, and videos from YouTube in one place.  I bought the car adapter as well, so I can play my favorite tunes everywhere I drive.  With TV shows from my Tivo, I can keep the kids entertained while traveling as well.  The device interface is intuitive and quick to learn, and the software interface is very easy as well.

<Title>Zune 30GB
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At the time, there were only the 30GB out, but now available in 80GB forms. Since I purchased it I have spent hours watching all of my favorite television shows and listening to music. A great alternative to I pod. The widescreen feature for videos is great for watching anything as long as you have the right format. The only downside is the software that comes with the device is not compatible with Windows Vista. So you have to do some digging to find the compatible software, and an internet connection. You should also get the AC adapter for charging the battery either while you sleep or when you're watching/listening to media items.

<Title>A steal at $99
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got the Zune for $99.  I use it on my 40 minute bus ride to work.  I watch dvd's that I have ripped.  I bought the Zune pass for music- that is VERY nice- tons of music for $15 a month, and I can stream that music through my XBOX360, which is hooked up to my home theater.    Unfortunately, I am unable to view any video podcasts on it without conversion- which is a hassle.  I think the new Zunes are able to view video podcasts without any hassle.  I got the Altec Lansing M604 speakers to go with it for my garage- and that set up works quite nicely.  The Zune 30 is a good value, holds plenty of high quality audio and video.  It may be a little bulky- you aren't gonna be able to jog with it, but it is a hard drive based player that rarely leaves my backpack, so I couldn't care less if it were a couple ounces lighter, or fractions of an inch smaller.

<Title>Terrible software makes a decent player unusable. :(
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune is a decent product, almost as good as the iPod, in fact, and cheaper usually. Unfortunately, I've owned one and have found out that the software is so buggy, so inefficient, so difficult to use and counterintuitive, I can't actually use this decent MP3 player. I've sold it, and am MUCH happier with my Creative Zen.  The software randomly deletes and syncs files for no apparent reason, skips albums, won't sync podcasts, and ONLY allows zune specific WMV's. (Try finding a lot of video files, trailers, etc in Zune format. It's difficult, at best.) I literally knew I couldn't keep wasting my time with this horrible an interface, so I sold it. 2-3/10

<Title>An absolute disaster
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this product because it seemed that the industry was moving away from CD's and toward these MP3/ipod/WMA players, and I didn't want to wake up one morning and find that all my painstakingly collected music was unplayable.  But was I ever in for a shock!  This product is nowhere NEAR ready for prime time, and is unacceptable on almost every conceivable level.  Without going into detail on any of my complaints about the device itself (it doesn't even have an on-off switch, let alone an equalizer), the most infuriating problem is the software.  You can't just load tracks from your computer and be done with it - not by a long shot.  You have to KEEP those tracks where the device found them the first time they were "synced," otherwise every one of those tracks will be deleted from the device the next time the device is connected to your computer - and you have no option about this!  Many people have posted online complaints about this bug, and Microsoft has apparently sent out a squad of cybergoons to defend the indefensible, calling users "stupid" if they want to delete those tracks from their hard drives.  (Or if they happen to accidentally erase the tracks.  Or if they want to connect the Zune device to a different computer that doesn't have those tracks.  Or if they want to keep the same tracks in a different folder and/or in a different format  Or if they want to offload the files to a DVD or other storage device.  All those are really stupid ideas, aren't they?)  That "feature" alone makes the Zune system unacceptable, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  While trying to "sync" tracks from my hard drive to the Zune device, many of the tracks were rejected.  And, in keeping with the total incompetence of the Zune software, there was no error message generated at the time telling me that the attempt to load the tracks had failed.  I only found out about it when I went to a screen that listed the tracks that had been loaded, and found that many were missing.  So then I went to still a THIRD screen (The Zune software is nearly impossible to navigate, BTW) and found a list of tracks that had been "skipped" in my attempt to load them.  I right-clicked on one of the tracks and discovered that there was an error code associated with the problem.  However the software had no idea what the error code meant and directed me to the "Zune Help" website.  What was the website's solution?  "Unfortunately, there is no specific Web Help message for this error yet."  It then directed me to a forum to see whether anyone there had a suggestion.  This forum was a real eye-opener.  I posted my problem on the forum only two days ago, and since that time there have been SEVEN PAGES of new postings, every one of them complaining of some new Zune software problem.  Furthermore, the forum apparently has space enough for only seven pages of postings - which means only two days' worth - and anything beyond that just rolls off into outer space.  And since Microsoft itself has no solution to offer, this device for which I paid $200 is essentially useless.  I should add that there is no user's manual, and that the Zune software has no help function or help file.  There is a website that calls itself a Zune user's manual, but it is as difficult to navigate as the Zune software itself - and that's saying something.  It has no systematic explanation of how to accomplish even the most basic tasks, and makes constant references to menus and links that don't exist on the current version of the software.  Stay away!  This product is as unprofessional and unacceptable as any product could possibly be.

<Title>Zune 30 - solid and feature rich!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Two of my three children have the Zune 30 (the other insists on iPOD). I played with both and considered functionality and ease of use; not only on the device, but on the user interface-sync software. The Zune came out on top.  The Zune 30 packaging is very high-tech and attractive; extremely well engineered. Everything you need is there. Nice quality ear buds, USB charge/sync cable, 1 install CD, getting started manual, and of course, the beautiful Zune itself.  The installation process could NOT be simpler; however, to have the optimal experience, your PC needs to be connected to the internet (broadband preferably). You'll first load the software from the CD (it will get latest updates from the internet, which could take a few minutes). After (I repeat AFTER) the Zune software is loaded, you connect your Zune to your PC using the provided USB cable. The device will be detected and go through an upgrade process (depending on your version of the Zune). My Zune did not come with the most recent version of the O/S (which, by the way is really cool), so it was automatically upgraded. During the Zune upgrade, there were a couple of times where I received messages that the USB device may not have been installed properly, but that self-corrects before the automatic upgrade process completes.  Just sit back and watch.  By the way, my PC was a desktop with Windows XP SP2.  The Zune software is easy to use and presents user with synchronization options. If you have your media (music, pictures, and videos organized in the window default "My" folders, the Zune software will automatically detect them. You just set the settings to automatically sync.  The sync process is fast. I have almost 3,000 MP3s and it synced (copied from PC to Zune device) in less than 10 minutes.  The Zune user interface is attractive and very easy to use. As far as buttons/controls on the Zune go, there are only three (four if you include the "hold" button on the top of the unit), which makes operation very simple. There is a "back" button (which works like a navigation button on a browser... taking you back to the previous screen), and Play/Pause button, and a menu navigation / select button (the larger circular control between the two other buttons). The navigation through the menus is easy and intuitive. I was able to use mine like a pro within a minute.  File types used by Zune: m3u, m4a, m4b, m4v, mp3, mp4, wma, wmv, zpl  The main menu items are Music, Videos, Pictures, Social, Radio, Podcasts, and Settings.  Music You can list songs by genres, albums, artists, playlists, or show all songs. When playing a song, the album art will show on the screen (if available).  You'll also see info about the current song (title, album, artist). There is a progress bar that shows time into song and time remaining in song. The circular control will allow you to navigate between songs in the playlist/album (click left or right side of control). You can also control the volume by clicking the top or bottom of the circular control. Of course, you have the option of shuffling (randomly played songs) at all levels (all songs, artist, album, genre, etc.) This is also a repeat option.  Videos  The Zune plays MPEG-4 and WMV video.  Pictures I synched My Pictures folder. It was fast. The pics look really nice. The only thing I would change is the ability to automatically detect the orientation of the picture (landscape or portrait) and adjust how it is displayed. You can play slideshow of all of your picture, a single folder, or scroll through a folder of pictures using the navigator control. You can listen to music while looking at pictures, which is cool.  Social Allows you to share media with other Zune users in close proximity. I beamed some songs to my son's zune. They appear in your InBox (and are good for three days or 3 plays). Of course, if you REALLY want to share an MP3, just give them the file using a flash drive to load on their PC and they can add to their collection. Try that with an iPOD... forget it.  Radio  Awesome radio interface with autoseek, presets. Some radio stations broadcast info about the station and currently playing song. The Zune will show this information, if available.  PodCasts - Video clips you can download from the internet  There is battery level indicator that displays on the lower right corner of the display. The battery life seems to be excellent and is recharged while connected to your PC with the USB cable.  Is there anything bad about the Zune? I'm glad I waited 24 hours before finishing the review because at first I thought that while the Zune is connected via the USB cable, you can't use it for anything other than charging or synchronization. That is only true when the Zune sync program is loaded on your PC. Simply unload the Zune program (mine is set to automatically load when I connect the Zune via USB, but that can be changed via Settings / Device / Sync Options) and you can use the Zune while charging via USB cable.  Is the Zune 30 too big?  That is personal preference. I personally like the size. It fits comfortably in my hand and it has a nice look and feel. If you're looking for something really small, look at the iPOD nano 3rd generation but say goodbye to 30 GB.

<Title>Buyers Beware!
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only good thing about the Zune is the amount of gigs for the price.  The software will prompt you to update which will mess up your music library.  You can find the fix on the forum, but it is a lot of work to fix. Many of the Zune owners including myself have had trouble with the players resetting during listening.  There is no fix yet for this.  There are many types of issues with the Zune and its all models not just this one.  I honestly wish I had bought an IPOD.  If there is no resetting fix by next year I am buying an IPOD. Sorry Zune, I wanted to like you.

<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I love it!  It may be larger than others - but I come from the generation that first had the Walkman and thought that was tiny, so this is small enough for me.  I strapped this on my arm last week and listened to my old rock n roll collection while I cleaned the garage.  Ahhhhhh - the Who!  The software was very easy to use, it practically does everything itself - you just plug it in at the right time and place.  I would recommend it for anyone.  30 gigs is a whole lot of storage.  The price was better than anything comparable.

<Title>Don't Listen to the Microsoft Haters!
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is a top quality, cutting edge product.  Don't be put off by some of the poor reviews it has received from people that clearly have an  Apple bias.  Also, if you notice, most of the bad reviews have come from customers that had the version 1 software.  When I first got my Zune I also had version 1 and it was a little buggy.  But, what is great about the Zune is that it is completely updatable.  The computer software checks for updates and it's automatically (if you choose to) updated on your Zune...and Presto! problems solved.  Don't listen to claims that the Zune "deletes your incompatible files."  That, ladies and gentlemen, is called USER ERROR.   I admit, I have been critical of Microsoft in the past for the unstability of IE and other frustrating things about Microsoft, but the Zune... now the Zune is something to be proud of.  All in all it's a great piece of equipment.  Don't be fooled!

<Content>Terrific hardware, nice big bright screen, good audio, easy to navigate controls, decent earphones.  Since MS is phasing out the 30 GB ones, look for bargains and DO NOT pay over $125 for these. Now the bad part - Zune software is basically an updated version of Windows Media Player. You need to be an experienced Windows user to get around the software easily.  Important tasks like syncing with your computer or setting up playlists isn't very intuitive.  If you want to download your favorite videos (including movies), you need to be VERY familier with video format conversions.  You can download a terrific free software for your computer to convery video to mp4 calle MediaCell Video Converter.

<Title>Not great, not terrible
<Date>Thu Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had mine for a week now.  I had no trouble setting it up initially, and the player itself has functioned perfectly so far.  It's much larger than I had expected, about the size of a deck of cards.  My only two complaints so far don't have to do with the player itself.   1.) The Zune media player on my pc is terrible.  It's slow, clunky, and more complicated than it needs to be. 2.) The headphones that come with this player are a joke.  For what you are paying for these things you'd think they could afford to toss in a decent set of earbuds.  Instead they send oversized buds with foam pads that you have to attach yourself.  Mine lasted 2 days - one randomly fell off and got lost, and the other I got sick of re-attaching.  It's a moot point anymore.  I was walking through my office at work listening, and the cord for the headphones got stuck on a doorknob.  Without even pulling hard enough to take the phones out of my ears, the cord ripped in half.  Oh well - I was gonna upgrade to better ones anyway. All in all, I consider myself lucky to not be having the problems many of the other reviewers are.  Also to be blunt, I don't think my expectations were/are as high as some of the others.  For the price of the unit, it's not bad.  Not great, but definitely not bad.

<Title>Nice Media Player for the Money
<Date>Thu Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just received my brown Zune 30 two days ago. Installed the software and connected the Zune to my PC. It upgraded to a new firmware and then loaded all my music from my itune to the Zune library and then sync to my Zune player. It took about 6 hours to sync all 2.5k of songs, 4k of photos into it. It is good to do it before you go to bed and then it will be done the next morning.  I like the player. From the package design to the finish of the player, you can tell MS has put quite some effort into it. I think for $89 that I bought last month from amazon.com was a steal! It sounded wonderful and the large LCD screen is really eye catching.  The only things I don't like is it. Even though the player is made in China, it doesn't support Chinese characters or maybe some other foreign languages. Even my $25 Sandisk MP3 player can display my Chinese songs without a problem. That's why I gave it a 4 stars.

It has a huge screen and a better control scheme than the ipod. The next thing it has over the ipod is that its way cheaper. So, don't go for ipod, the generic bullcrap that apple makes.

<Title>Pretty impressive, but the software needs tweaking
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune player itself is great.  The screen is bright and easy to read, and the interface is easy to learn.  I already had the Zune software on my computer for media sharing with my Xbox 360, so my library was set up.  I was able to get the unit to sync up within a few minutes and was using my Zune in less than an hour.  The sound quality is excellent, both through the supplied headphones and output through my car stereo.  It was extremely difficult to get the little foam covers onto the headphones and they tend to slide off in use, but they aren't necessary.  Battery life in music mode is excellent if you set the screen to turn off quickly; I have mine set for five seconds.  Since the charge is handled through USB, it's easy to find a place to hook it up.  There are inexpensive USB converters for wall outlets and car lighter ports and many home electronics items have USB ports (stereos, satellite/cable boxes, game systems, etc.) that can be used.  The WiFi share function worked flawlessly the one time I used it.  When the next-generation Zune players launched in mid-November there was a major software update.  While the computer interface was greatly improved graphically, some of the functionality and options of the old software disappeared.  The main menu font on the Zune is much larger and easier to read, but all of the other text is smaller (and harder to read while driving).  The old software allowed you to right-click a track and get to the tag editor, this function was removed.  I also find that I have to disconnect and reconnect my unit to get the sync to work, which was never a problem before.  Hopefully, these items will be fixed in a future update.  Also added was the Zune card (at zune.net), an online page that lets you share your plays with others and lets them sample (and buy) tracks available through the Zune Marketplace.  Existing Xbox Live or Windows Live accounts can be used for logging in to zune.net.  In addition, the Microsoft Points used for Xbox Live downloads are also used to purchase music through the Marketplace.  I have downloaded a couple of free tracks from the Marketplace but haven't really explored the catalog.    I would like to have more control of the unit itself.  I'd like to see more fonts available and in different sizes.  I'd also like to be able to set the equalizer levels myself; there are times when all of the presets fail in one way or another.  Finally, I'd like to see a shortcut to get to the settings menu quickly (like holding down the "back" button for a couple of seconds).  There should be a way to assign a shortcut to each direction of the controller, similar to most newer cell phones.  Overall, the Zune is definitely worth the money.  I picked mine up just before the next-gen units shipped and saved $60.  Software issues kept it from getting a five-star rating.

<Title>Zune Review
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really like this product!  This is the first MP3 player I've had and I'm 54 years old!  The music is clear, I have 200 CD's loaded and it's not even half full.  The screen is large and also very clear.  I have been able to download pictures of my grandkids and have them with me all the time. This is a great product....I can't compare it as I'm not familiar with the others, but I have been so happy with my Zune that I bought one for my husband too and he really likes his.

<Title>Excellent once Updated
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There have been many bad things said about the original Zune, and I'll easily say that they were some massive problems.  However, I am writing this review after the new firmware and software has been released, so many of the other reviews and criticisms(Such as the most helpful reviews) are somewhat out of date.  First off, with the Zune 30, do not install the software given to you in the box.  Simply forget that disk even exists, because that cheesy Windows Media Player remix that comes with it is a thing of the past.    Instead, go to Zune.net to download the new software, which is just excellent.  It has been built from scratch, easy to use, intuitive, just stunningly perfect overall.  I personally believe it way better than the iTunes software.  The only better thing iTunes has is more available items from the iTunes store.  I rate the NEW Zune software with a 10/10.  Second, the firmware you get on the Zune 30 is also a thing of the past. The new version (Which comes already loaded on the newer Zunes, but has to be downloaded for the 30) is much better.  Faster, better organization.  It has the new Zune "Social" option, for sending and receiving songs, pictures, etc.  It still wastes battery, so my suggestion would only to be when you know somebody else with a Zune is near you, or if you're in a crowded coffee shop, and simply want to check if anybody has one out of sheer curiosity.    Also, a new feature, that many people were angry the Zune didn't have, is Podcast support.  You can now subscribe from podcasts from the Zune Marketplace free, just as you'd expect, and put those on your Zune.  There's another feature that many were desperate for.  Now their wishes have come true, with the new Wireless Syncing.  You can now connect your Zune to your home network, so it can sync wirelessly with your computer.  This way, you can have it sync overnight (or whenever), and have all your latest music and podcasts updated on your Zune.  And the overall design of the NEW firmware is near perfect.  In the main Zune Menu, the text is much larger and easier to see, so the only limit as to how far away you can operate it is limited to how far you can reach.  It takes less time to load, transition graphics are better (A small, stylish flash), and looks better.  When navigating a long list of songs, a big letter still appears on the side of the screen to see what section you're in.  Another large plus is the album art while playing songs doesn't look pixelated anymore.  Now onto the hardware itself.  The Zune is bigger than the iPod.  Even the new ones are.  There's no escaping that.  Many people say the 30 isn't pocketable.  It is.  Fits just fine into your pocket, unless you happen to have extremely small pockets.    Now the looks.    The Zune has what Microsoft calls the "Doubleshot" effect.  It's got a nice rubbery feel to it, and from the doubleshot effect, it gives off a different color glow around the edges.  I own the Brown Zune (Which is way better looking in person than it is on the internet, take my word for it), which gives off a green glow around the edges.  Very nice look.  Also, a little bonus is that the casing, because it isn't iPod style chrome (Which scratches and picks up fingerprints the moment you touch it), being rubber it repels fingerprints and scratches.  If it gets any fingerprints, they simply wipe off.  The little navigational pad.  No, it isn't an apple click wheel, but I prefer it to one.  It's simply a 4 way directional pad in the shape of a circle with a button in the center (used in the same way as the center button of an iPod).  You use it to navigate menus, change pictures you're viewing, etc.  While listening to music, you press up or down to raise or lower the volume, or press left or right to fast forward/backtrack in the song.  Besides the directional pad, there is also a Play/Pause button, and a Back button. (And a hold switch on top if you want to count that.  The screen is what really makes the Zune.  3 inches diagonally, It's big.  It's beautiful.  The background can be changed to whatever picture you want.  Great resolution, great for watching videos.  Which happens to be what I'm about to talk about.  Videos and pictures are handled differently.  You turn the Zune sideways (horizontally) to watch videos in widescreen, or view pictures in widescreen.  When in horizontal mode, the button commands on the d-pad change respectively, so that up and down in horizontal view is still volume, and left/right is still tracking.  And finally, the extra things that come with the Zune.  The earbuds are fine.  I'm not rough on earbuds, so they're lasting fine for me, and sound just as good as the apple earbuds.  The magnetic backs are also a nice little feature.  The 2 earbuds stick together, so they don't get as tangled in your pocket.  And the sync/charge cable... well, it's fine.  Nothing wrong with it, it's just a cable.  So, overall, the new software/firmware for the 30 make it infinitely better than with the old stuff.  Here are my ratings on the Zune and software, based on the NEW SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE.  Zune Software- 10/10 (perfect in all ways.)  Zune (new firmware)- 9/10 (Only thing keeping it from a 10 is that it still can't be used as an external hard drive.)  Well then.  This Zune, though older, can be as good as the new ones, and as of now, is worth every bit of what it costs.  Microsoft really did a great job making it into an entirely new system.

<Title>A brilliant MP3 player!
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Eventhough I had read several negative reviews on the Zune, I decided to take a chance and see how it worked for myself. After using the Zune, I have to save that I wholeheartedly love it!  Before I owned a Zune, I used a cheap Coby 512MB MP3 player to hold wma files that I ripped from my favorite CDs. But with only 512 megabytes, storage capacity was quickly becoming a problem.  I had read alot about the Zune in a pamplet in a local department store, and it seemed like a perfect fit! 30 gigabytes, big screen, nice selection of colors to choose from, and a built in FM tuner so I could listen to the radio. (Not to mention that an 8GB ipod nano goes for the same price as the 30GB Zune!)  So now I own a Zune, and love it! Syncing wma files to the Zune is a snap, music sounds crystal clear on the Zune, the screen is of idea size for watching videos and viewing photos, it looks good in the palm of your hand, and it's very durable as well! Needless to say, I didn't experience any of the problems that other Zune owners did. (Maybe it's just because I have Windows XP Professional?) At any rate, Zune is a fantastic MP3 player, and is highly recommended! (Unless your OS is MAC, then stick with ipod or creative Zen)  Pros: Easy to use! Windows Media files translate and sync easily to the Zune! The screen size is idea for viewing videos & photos! 30 Gigabytes of storage space! Stylish in look and in feel, reminicent of the ipod classic. Crystal clear sound quality, experience music in a new level of clarity! Lower in price and more features than ipod. Zune to Zune music sharing via Wifi adds a whole new spin on MP3 players, sure to become standard in future models of MP3's!  Cons: Doesn't work with Mac computers! Only comes with a USB cable for charging, AC (wall) chargers & DC (car) charges have to be purchased separately... Unless you lock it up, it's way too easy to bump a button, turn it on, and drain the battery! (Hopefully they'll make newer ones with simple on/off switches) Lacks to compadability of ipod, there are millions of different ipod docks, but few of them work with Zune. Ordinary USB to AC converters won't work with Zune! Sadly, the Zune's software cannot convert DVDs to video files, you'll have to buy separate software for that...  Overall Rating: 4.8 Stars

<Title>Crappy!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned quite a few mp3 players and when I lost my last one, I decided to jump on the bandwagon and buy something that everyone else is buying. Bad decision. The batter life, just for listening to music, is only around 2hrs. You can't use it as an external storage device, because of software. It doesn't play very many video files, and it doesn't have as many menu features as you would think. You can't even have a song on "1 repeat". You have to erase your quicklist and put the one song on it and hit continuous repeat to do that. This was a waste of my money. What a crappy mp3 player.

Easily charges on my laptop or in an outlet. The only feature they need to add is a sleep mode. That way I can set it and nod off without fear of waking up to a dead Zune.

Zune to Zune sent songs only stay on your Zune for (3) days.  Still work needs to be done. I hope that the next gen. corrects some of these issues. Zune could be the best on the market if Microsoft choose to fix these problems.

<Title>Microsoft Zune: What's Not To Like?
<Date>Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Microsoft Zune: What is not to like?  I picked this Brown 30 gig Gen 1 device up at Costco for under $100.   I am not going to say setup was without its issues. I initially had some problems but I updated my media server which is XP Media Center using the Microsoft Update website and reinstalled and that seemed to take care of the crashes and whatnot.  When you install Zune software from the CD in the package it automatically updated it to the latest and greatest firmware and software which allows full wireless sync like their 2nd generation products.  I have 20 gigs of 6 gigs of photos so I figured I'd be OK. It took most of an afternoon to get them uploaded but when I did I still had a bit over 9 gigs left on the Zune!  Next came the wireless setup. I have a D-Link `N' class router with WPA2 and AES encryption so I figured I'd have to bring down the encryption a tad. Not so! I just changed the settings to allow B, G and N class wireless traffic and allow WPA and WPA2 traffic (which means that my clients are still about as secure as you can get a home network) and volia!   I just logged into my media server and set up a playlist and fired up my Zune. In about 30 seconds I got the new play list sent over.  The sound quality is quite good and the pictures are petty good for a small screen as well!

<Content>I got my zune about 3 weeks ago and absolutely love it.  I love that I can play with the controls while wearing gloves, that I dont scroll past the song or artist I am looking for, the tons of storage that is allotted, its movie playing capability, etc.  I think the software could still use some work because it takes too much time and work to understand it.  I would absolutely recommend buying one to any of my friends that are good with computers....the ones that arent i would make sure to tell them that they may need help with the software etc.

<Title>Another no brainer purchase...Excellent Deal
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you can get one of these for under $100...RUN TO GET IT. The sound is excellent, the capacity is awesome, the features are great. Is it perfect? NO WAY! but for the money, nothing can out there can touch this. A very well known store was running a $99 special for a Brown Zune, but they were sold out. The kid behind the counter was nice enough to sell me a black version for the same amount. LUCKY ME!!!  The software updates automatically into the new ZUNE interface, which is much nicer than the old version. ALL my music from WMP 11 sync nicely into the ZUNE software and loading everything into the ZUne player is automatic. The Zune feels like a well made "toy" . I loaded about 3000 songs, 170 pictures, and I still have 23 gb left. I had second generation Ipod Mini and this is so much better.  Keep in mind that this is not a tiny or sexy little gadget, but if you need something for your 3 mile run or to go to gym, you can always get a $30 little player.  I actually bought a Sandisk CLIP 2 GB player for $35 and it does the trick. But for a multi feature large capacity player, this is great, especially if you can get it for under $100

<Title>New Zune fan Boy
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>OK... first Ipod purchased in 2002.  Second in 2005.  First Zune 2007.  Zune wins almost hands down. 1)Sound quality:  Zune 8/10 for audiophile ears.  Ipod 5/10.  Again, for those who know sound/ do recordings.  Zune by far surpasses Ipod.  The Zune upgraded headphones make ALL the difference as well.  But, even with those headphones on the Ipod, the Zune wins hands down.  2)Software: Itunes is slow, and pay as you go only.  Zune market place (new) great, quick (about 50% quicker than itunes on a Windows). Zune pass is awesome.  $15 bucks a month and I've downloaded near 60 albums in 7 days and they are awesome. Yes, if you let your pass lapse you loose it all. But there's nothing like a music buffet!  you can also buy whatever as a pay as you go too.  3)Zune is much easier to manipulate/ change songs/ genres/ playlists than Ipod.    4) Zune screen is comfortable for 1 hour long (2 hour movie might be a stretch, but havent' tried yet.  Ipod scree (not touch or iphone) is way to small.  5)Wireless sync just makes sense and is graet.  CONS:  No real movies for zune... yet. (Come on Bill! Get this worked out.)  No audible for Zune (which is a real bummer) but per Windows weekly podcast in Nov. they are in talks again with Audible.  Video podcasts are a bit slow to sync and cut off sometimes.    I'm really glad I switched to Zune.  I will give Ipod away once audible is supported.

<Content>First, I have never owned an mp3 player before.  I have 2 teenage daughters who each own Ipods.  They like them.  I really like my Zune 30GB.  Maybe because I have not had a different experience, but I found it easy to set up.  I have not had any trouble with the software either.  I have Windows XP, and the software loaded and ran fine.  I had no trouble synching it and loading music and photos.  Using the Zune marketplace, I subscribed (free) to 4 different podcasts, and they downloaded and syncronized fine.  Listening to FM music worked great too. Really, I have no negatives to tell you about.  Flame me for being a newbie who has little knowledge to compare the Zune with, but for me it works great.  I have about 900 songs ripped from CD's and loaded, 25-30 pictures and 4 days of podcasts and that all uses about 5 GB worth of my 27 GB. I hope this helps some of you.

<Content>Somehow I managed to catch one of these when the price was under $100.  For that price, I think it's a great product.  For the retail price, I'd probably buy something else.  I had to wait a couple of weeks to get one at the special price, but it was worth if for the savings.  You've probably seen these pros and cons before, but here's my take anyway.    The good: Large, bright screen that orients pictures and videos horizontally Solid feel and rubberized back to prevent scratching (see IPOD) Large storage capacity and fast access to files Good sound quality for an MP3 player, but of course, ear buds are cheap  The bad: No instructions in the box except to plug it in and turn it on.   No included AC charger.  Can't play while charging with USB cable Can't download music files purchased from Napster or Rhapsody No gap-free play.  Individual tracks that should seque have gaps Won't work with Windows Media, and Zune software is far inferior No true equalizer, just several preset options

<Title>Solid Performer, Formidable Competitor
<Date>Mon Nov 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've got to say that I'm pleasantly surprised with my Zune. It has a lot of niceties (since a year ago or so) such as the ability to connect to other Zune's or to a WiFi access point that not until recently they were added to the much-famed iPod. The controls are pretty intuitive, navigation is a breeze, the screen is its major selling point and with all due reason: it's very nice and performs very well. To some people the radio feature doesn't matter much; however, to me it's very important to be able to listen to "free," ol' fashion radio stations. Also nice, the easiness to upgrade its firmware (i.e. the software that makes the device work) to have your Zune running with the latest a greatest version (which sometimes adds new functionality and/or improves current features). The video and picture-viewing features are also very well thought out and laid out.  In short, I really like this device. I recommend it instead of any of the other competitors (including Apple's iPod, SanDisk's Sansa and Creative's Zen). Great gift (and self-gift) idea!

<Content>I loved my Zune for almost a year until recently they updated their software.  The new software is full of bugs and not user friendly at all.  I hope Microsoft catches on and realized that the new software will be the downfall of the Zune.  I want to get an Ipod now and think I will.  Going from the old software which was great to the new software is not something you can get used to without feeling rage and anger toward the creators of the new software.  Save yourself some aggravation and get an Ipod.

<Title>Not Without its Flaws
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Brown Zune is definitely (in my opinion) the nicest-looking Zune of the first-run Zune series. After the case color, there's no difference between the Zunes. However, the Zune was not without its share of problems that made it nonfunctional for me and caused me to return the player.  Pros:  1. Looks great. Comes in brown, which looks professional. Smooth and pleasant to the touch. All other colors, even pink, appear attractive on this thing. That can't be said about the dull, boring color line-up of the iPod 6G series.  2. Durable. The Zune can be thrown in your pant pockets and you won't have to worry about it getting squished or scratched (so long as you don't throw it in the same pocket as your keys). Use a screen protector if throwing it in a pocket or backpack with other items.  3. Intuitive. The on-screen navigation and buttons on the case are great. While it looks like a wheel, the main interface is merely a directional pad. No doubt the wheel look was added to make it look like an iPod, but there is no touch-sensitivity or scrolling on that thing.  Cons (outweigh the Pros, for me):  1. The screen is horrendous. While it's big, the colors are horrible. If you upload a picture, it does not appear as it does on your computer. Your computer is able to display 32-bit color while this device seems to downscale all images to 16-bit color. It's very obvious too, not just to the trained eye. Unnecessary grain is added to all pictures, wallpapers and videos. Video quality is definitely surpassed by the iPod line-up.  2. Zune Software. This software is based on Windows Media Player 11, but is even less intuitive. The organizational skills of this software cannot even scratch the surface of iTunes or maybe even Winamp. Unlike the iPod, the Zune cannot be synced with any other piece of software. That mans you're locked down to Windows (XP or Vista) and forced to use WMP11/Zune. At least the iPod works in Windows, Mac and even Linux, and can be synced with software other than iTunes.  3. Album Sorting Problem #1: If you have multiple albums with the same name (for example, "Piano Concertos" by Beethoven and "Piano Concertos" by Chopin) they will be lumped together as if they were one album. They will be listed by the first artist alphabetically (so by this example, all of Chopin's music will appear under Beethoven).  4. Album Sorting Problem #2: The Zune ignores the Disc Number ID3 tag. If you have an album that is multiple discs long (For example, a Beatles Greatest Hits that's 2 or 3 discs long) all of the Track 1's will be lumped together, Track 2's, etc. They will not appear in the correct order. This can be band-aid fixed by sequencing your track titles as one long disc, but that is unnecessary when every other music software on the planet can understand disc numbers.  5. Zune Store. Your song purchases from Microsoft's ironically-named PlaysForSure stores do not work on the Zune. Zune Store songs only play on the Zune (and through the Zune PC software). The Zune store has a pathetic amount of choices, not only compared to iTunes, but even compared to PlaysForSure stores such as Napster. Enough said.  I have gone through many music players, iPods, Sandisks, Creatives, the Zune and others, and can say currently that the Zune (1) has too many flaws for it to be my music player of choice.

<Title>An inflexible device with a pretty screen.
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'd qualify myself as an experienced gadget freak and go through gadgets like socks. I've never owned an iPod, but have owned numerous mp3 players (Creative MicroPhoto, MuVo, Nomad, Rio Carbon, etc...). I've always been intrigued by the Zune, so when I saw that it was on sale for $99 at another online retailer, I thought that I'd give it a try and see what all of the fuss is about.  I've had the Zune for over a week and have collected the following observations:  The Good:  * Beautiful, sharp, crisp 3" screen! Video playback is excellent; no skipping. I've mainly used mp4 and WMV files. * The body feels very solid and durable. I like the brown with green tint; its different from your typical black, silver, or white. The size and weight are fine. I've previously used the Creative Vision:M, which feels like a brick in comparison to the Zune.  * The buttons and nav-pad are very easy to use and straight-forward. * I upgraded to the new firmware so that I could get the same functionality as the 2nd gen Zune. The interface is pleasant, simple, and uncomplicated (almost to a fault... but read on.) * Excellent battery life. I was able to last on a single charge over a 4 day trip with frequent usage. I had to charge it on the last day of the trip. I didn't keep track of hours, but it lasted significantly longer than my Creative MicroPhoto. (Make sure that you prime the battery to get the most out of its life. Fully charge the battery as soon as your receive the unit, then use the unit until the battery life is fully depleted. Repeat this a couple of times.) * To shut the unit off, you must hold down the play/pause button for ~3 seconds and then lock the unit with the switch on the top. Otherwise, it is very easy to wake up the unit by pressing any of the buttons and thereby consume precious battery life. There is an auto-off feature that kicks in after a few minutes of inactivity, but again, its easy to wake up the unit. That being said, the unit has an extremely short, almost non-existent start-up time.   The Annoyances:  * I have experienced skipping with some songs which indicates issues with either the HD, memory, or the sync process. I tried to troubleshoot this on my own, but to no avail (and I do QA as part of my job as a Systems Engineer.) * No plug and play! You must install the Zune desktop player for the unit to be detected by your computer. The unit is not detected as an external drive by Windows Explorer which really sucks as I like to occasionally transfer files between work and home. * The Zune is NOT compatible with Windows Media Player 11. Who was the genius that made this decision at Microsoft? I really don't understand the rationale behind this. It honestly makes no sense. I pray that someday MS comes to its senses and opens up the Zune to WMP11. * The Zune desktop player is very simplistic. Too simplistic. It's an extremely dumbed-down version of Windows Media Player. There is NO advanced tag editing. Ridiculous. I have to do my editing using WMP and then go back to Zune desktop player for syncing. * Zune does not play PlaysforSure media (even MSN Music ... utterly brilliant.) So you're somewhat screwed if you've heavily invested in iTunes, Napster, MusicMatch, WalMart, or 7Digital purchases. To get around this, I used software available online to strip the DRM licensing and convert the files to mp3 format (or whichever format you desire). Its annoying and tedious, but you can do a one-time batch conversion, and then never buy licensed music again. Many of the online music stores, such as Amazon, are now selling mp3s without DRM. I haven't used the Zune Marketplace and can't comment on that. I tend to get all of my music from CDs, Amazon, or 7Digital. * The Zune does NOT recognize playlists created in WMP. It does not recognize .WPL or .m3u files. All playlists are created in a proprietary .ZPL format. * I didn't even bother to play with the Zune video conversion function. I use Movavi to convert DVDs to Zune-compatible WMV files (~1GB for 1 full movie.) Not bad considering you have a 30GB device. I use Crazi Video to convert FLV files from YouTube. Great for capturing music videos. (So at this point, I've probably spent about $60 in DRM-stripping and file conversion software...) * You cannot create video playlists on the Zune or on the desktop player. You can do this in WMP. These come in handy when you have a bunch of music videos or TV shows. If I want to watch another video, you need to go back through the menu, scroll through your videos and select the new one. * The Zune desktop player does NOT detect other USB devices (including MS smartphones.)  * The Zune uses a proprietary USB plug. Most mp3 players and devices use the universal miniUSB cable for charging and data sync. The Zune cable is one more cable to carry around. * No AC adapter is included. It takes about 3 hours to charge via USB. Luckily I have an AC charger that can accommodate USB devices.  * The battery cannot be removed, so you can't swap out batteries while traveling. The battery life indicator is very basic. It would have been nice to have a more detailed power meter showing % remaining. * IMHO, the wireless function is pointless. The only other person in my social circle that has a Zune lives 1000 miles away. It eats up battery life. And as for wireless syncing: I could see value in this if you don't have your sync cable handy, but I could also see the process consuming a lot of battery power depending on the volume of data being exchanged. * I didn't even bother to use the included earbuds. I use my own Shure E3Cs. * No contacts or calendar sync with Outlook. No CLOCK!!!!!! * The Zune can only display JPG images! `Nuff said.  Overall impression: the Zune is an inflexible device with lots of small annoying drawbacks and restrictions. Other than the brilliant screen, its mediocre at best. I tell myself to overlook its flaws for $99 (compared to a $250-300+ Creative or Archos), but its becoming very difficult.    I would not pay full price for the new Zune even though the 2nd generation is marginally smaller, slimmer, has a larger screen, and more storage capacity; it still has the same drawbacks as above. If Microsoft would make the device more open and less proprietary (take a hint from Creative) then you could qualify the Zune as an "iPod killer."

<Title>wanted to like this but was disappointed
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received this zune the other day. I think it is the same with all zunes. Right out of the box i was disappointed. I hooked it up as instructed. I installed the software as instructed. When it came time to actually get the music from my pc to the zune it was very awkward. I tried the usual copy from pc to mp3 player as in the past. The zune would not allow me to copy music to it the windows explorer way. It made me copy through the zune interface way. I found it very awkward to copy from pc to zune. I have had much cheaper mp3 players that were more intuitive in copying music. I am also a geek. I know my computer stuff. I don't recommend that you purchase zune in any flavor or capicity.

<Title>What about the Zune?
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was extremely excited about buying a Zune. I owned an ipod several months back but its hard drive died and it's warranty had expired, so I decided to try a different mp3 player. Delivery was great and in time, but unfortunately not all things that come in pretty boxes are good anymore. Not only was I surprised that a real charger didn't come with it, but also the fact that it wouldn't even turn on. I connected it to my computer to multiple ports, but no sign of life. Even the hold button came off. A new Zune with a flimsy hold button?  I was very dissapointed. Not only does the iPod beat it in terms of design and finness, but in price too. I went out and purchased an 80 gb ipod for $250, had no problems with it and managed to get it synched perfectly.  I read several reviews before purchasing my Zune - may of them were very negative, but I simply assumed that it was just a bad experience with the Zune. The Zune in itself is a bad experience. At least the 30 gb version. Maybe the 2nd generation picked up on its defects and improved, but if you want a sleek, light-weight and long battery mp3 player, stick to the ipod. Not only will you get more of what you pay for, but you will also get less headaches.

<Title>Great with 2nd generation updates
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this after the 2nd generation was announced knowing the firmware was being updated and I am very happy with it. It looks great and works fantastic. I bought the A/V dock and have it hooked up to my stereo. I can sync to the Zune from my laptop (in another room) via the wireless network. This is a very nice feature in that I don't have to hook up my player, it just happens!  The sound, graphics, and user interface are wonderful. The PC software is a little lacking in complexity (no auto playlists, like/dislike rating system) but it is fine once you get use to it and I imagine it is great for those less computer savy.  It doesn't have an equalizer, which is bad, I suppose if you use the headphones but since I am playing it through my home system, I just use those controls (my CD player doesn't have EQ either!). Even if I used the headphones, I am a believer in listening to music how the artists intended and not playing around with this or that.  Some advice: Download the Zune software from the website. That way you have the 2nd generation software installed from the get-go and you don't have to upgrade from the original software. I heard there were some upgrade issues, but those don't exist if you never had the original software in the first place. You can also load and play with your library while you await your Zune being delivered. Once it arrived, I hooked it up and the new firmware was automatically installed. Very smooth!  Great device, my wife and kids agree too.

<Title>Wait if you can
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like this player.  I switched from the iWorld because I was tired of all the problems I was having.  This player works really well. But if you don't need one right now you may want to wait.  I haven't run across any real concerns with the player itself, but the software for the computer has "some" bugs to work through.  Considering that the software was just released a week ago that is not too much of a surprise. I like the feel of the player.  It has enough weight that you know it is there, but not enough that you get tired of carrying it.  Being able to press buttons to move around instead of using a touch device of some kind is nice.  This allows you to change things without having to actually look at the player if you are doing something else.  You can watch the road and reach over and skip to the next song or raise the volume really easily. The screen is really bright and clear.  I watched a video podcast on it and was surprised at how good the small screen was.  It is almost good enough for me to watch more on it, almost.  I really would, but I prefer my 19" monitor.  If I was going to be away from a computer for some time this would work to watch all the videos I would want to. The wireless syncing is such a great idea.  It is slow compared to USB2, but if you keep it plugged into a power outlet the syncing is continuous so you can leave it plugged in overnight in a different room and in the morning everything is ready to go, charged and updated.  This is great for podcasts.  Unfortunately this means that you have to have the computer and zune on the whole time which does take some energy.  But at least you have the option. With the new version of the zune out now this is still a great player thanks to Microsoft updating the software on it to the same as the new version, and the lower price that everyone is selling them for.

Big and beautiful - fabulous colors on all my pics and videos. I paid less than $100 for mine and feel it would have been worth paying even more (glad I didn't, though - who wants to spend extra?) This little gem holds all my music with room to spare. I hooked it up to the Altec Lansing speaker system for Zune and WOW - blows me away. I would highly recommend the Zune to anyone who loves having all their music and pictures at their fingertips. Worth every penny.

<Title>Hated it!
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My Zune was delivered at 7 p.m. on Friday and I had returned it by 9 a.m. Saturday.  I had purchased it as an "upgrade" to my Toshiba Gigabeat, but found it much less satisfactory.  Most frustrating was that installation required that I update my Windows Media Player to version 11, but the Zune is completely imcompatible with WMP!  Zune selected 26 of the several hundred albums on my computer (apparently random choices) and added them to the "collection" on the Zune software.  It would not let me add others to the collection.  After hours of frustrating efforts, I put it all back in the box and returned it (while cursing Bill Gates). I should have done better research on Zune's total incompatibility with WMP software.  I made the mistake of assuming Microsoft products would be compatible. Several members of my family have Creative Zens and are very satisfied, so I will try that next.  Meanwhile, the old Toshiba is more satisfactory than the new Zune.

<Title>This is going back today
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to get a media player so that I could download pod casts. I did not have another media player prior to this so I could not compare it.  I have spent 6 hours on this and at this point it is going back.  First there are no instructions.  I had to play around with it for about 4 hours to finally figure out how the thing worked.  I though I could go to the Zune web site for help.  No such luck, you have to go to the messages boards and sign on to access data.    The Zune was adding data onto it from the web site that I did not want, such as music I would never listen to.  From what I could figure out, music from my  computer has to go to the Zune site, then downloaded to the Zune.  I thought this would just be a drag and drop operation, but if it was, I never could figure it out.  I could not just pick an album on my computer and drop it to the Zune. At this point I am so frustrated I am ready to throw my computer across the room.  I hate this product.

<Content>When it did work, for about 6 months, it lost my music, duplicated music so I had 2 of almost every song, some songs couldn't even be deleted. Then when I tried to update the firmware it just stopped working all together. I tried calling customer service a couple of times and that got me no where, just wasted hours of my time.  I asked if I could just ship it out to be fixed, they denied my request and gave me a couple of article numbers to look up so that I could continue to spend my time fixing this product.  Just stay away from Zune, not only did microsoft make a poor product, it doesn't even stand behind it.  This is one big headache not worth the trouble.

<Content>The Zune is a great product for the value.  When I installed the software, it immediately picked up MOST of my music files and ALL of my pictures.  Now, when I want to show people pictures of my trips (I travel a lot), I just whip out my Zune and show them a slideshow.  There's tons of other things as well such frequent software updates updates.  It has a built-in radio function, whereas with the iPod you have to buy an extra accessory (about $50)to listen to the radio.  The Zune Marketplace now has Podcasts with tons of music videos, TV shows and anything you can dream of downloading for your viewing pleasure.     The screen size is nice and the resolution is great! There's not a thing I find wrong with this product and I'm glad that I got it over the iPod. I like, millions of other people, got sucked into the Apple fad, and bought an iPod nano.  I got a sick feeling in my stomach when I got it and took it back to the store and researched the Zune.

The old software (Firmware) was buggy and not very nice.  The new software is a great leap forward and is much easier to use.  Sound and picture quality is great and with a little effort you can turn included your pictures and even include movies to watch when you travel.  It is much nicer to carry than a heavy DVD player.

<Content>The device itself works fine, and was happy with that.  The Zune software, however, is not so good.  It will go through and re-classify all your mp3 files without your permission.   There is a way to disable this, however it forced me to upgrade my zune software, then went out and changed all my files again.  I called Microsoft Zune support, and got routed to someone that barley spoke English, and dropped my call.  Ended up returning the device, will look at getting an iPod.  Is fine if you don't have many mp3's already, but if you do, be careful because will change how you have them saved on your PC.

<Title>It does what I want it to do -- play music
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I can't speak to all the supposed bells and whistles associated with the Zune (i.e. WIFI access, playing movies etc).  Maybe I'm just old but I don't really care about youtube videos and really -- can't see watching movies on anything smaller than a computer screen.  If I'm not near a TV, then I'll read or knit but I have to have my music!  I'm traveling again and in this post 911 era, need my music to keep me chilled out in the airport and in cubicles.  I like the aesthetics of the Zune -- the matt finish as opposed to the iPod.    I'm not into downloading music off the web.  I take my CDs and copy them with the highest possible bit rate as possible for the best sound quality.  I don't really care about the extra storage required for this since my alternative is hauling a CD Walkman and a bunch of CDs around with me (everything's relative).  With the 30GB Brown selling for 89 bucks, I can carry two -- one with my classical music library and one with my "normal" music.  I have top of the line Shure ear buds and the combination produced outstanding sound quality -- not to mention being able to be in my own little bubble by blocking outside noise.  The interface is very simple to use.  I had no problems with the software installation (I'm using Windows XP) or syncing.    My only complaint is that this doesn't support the Lossless .wav extension which I have used to copy all of my CDs onto my computer.  I could either download a utility which would convert to a WMA format or reload all my CDs.  I guess to me, since this is a Microsoft product, I think it should support all the formats that their own Windows Media player supports.    Oh well!  I still really like it and it is a "mind saver" while you are flying on noisy cramped clausterphobic regional airplanes.

<Title>Great product!
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me clear up one thing before I start this review: I AM NOT A MICROSOFT FANBOY. In fact, I was quite the opposite; I was almost addicted to Apple these last couple of years. I have owned 3 iPods, and they all either became obsolete, broke, or got stolen. Tired of the madness, I decided to try something different. Hence, the reason for my buying of the Zune.  One of the best things about the Zune (in my opinion) is the ability to customize the background. I love this option...it makes the whole experience a whole lot more enjoyable. Another good thing would be the hard case surrounding it. Except for the iPod mini I once owned, all of my iPods were highly scratachable and delicate, and I would freak out if I left so much as one fngerprint on the back. Previous iPod owners may know what I'm talking about (or it might just be me) but not having to buy a case immediately after purchasing the product was pretty cool.   After nearly 3 years of incredibly uncomfortable Apple-issued headphones that broke after 2 months, the Microsoft-issued headphones were equivalent to a miracle. They are just as uncomfortable as Apple's, but the sound quality was amazing!!! I'm not the type to go and buy $300 Shure headphones (I'm too broke to do that), so I was shocked at how clearly I could hear the music (compared to how I heard music on the Apple headphones). This is, of course, a matter of personal preference, but I really like them. People who listen to their MP3 players for long periods of time will absolutely hate these headphones, as they hurt like crazy after half an hour. Moving on...  The software was pretty easy to install. I've heard tons of horror stories about this, but I downloaded mine onto a laptop, so I have no idea if that factored anything into it. That said, the interface is pretty nice, but I kind of miss iTunes for various reasons that I'm not going to go into here. Getting my iTunes library off of my Mac and onto my PC and into my Zune library was incredibly easy, if not seemingly interminable.  Art and videos look great on it. I also like the radio feature.   Things I really hated about the Zune: The fact that it only WORKS ON PCs. Every time I use a PC, I'm reminded of just how much I hate them. The viruses, constant security updates; in other words, things I had grown used to not having on my beloved Mac. (I am such an Apple lover. I'm even obsessed with the actual fruit!) Also the fact that it turns into a near useless pretty brick when it's connected to said PC. And the fact that the selection in the Zune marketplace is so limited (I do like the subscription you can get for it).   Final Verdict: A great 1st generation music player!! The color (I bought red) was incredibly pretty, art, videos, pictures, and other things looked awesome on the screen (which looked colossal compared to my 5.5G iPod). Radio was nice to have. Although it won't convert me to a fulltime PC user, I'll probably use this player for a LONG time.

<Content>I've had my Zune for 7 months and I've NEVER had a problem with it. Not once!! The software works and has worked perfectly for me (including the brand new update!)   It's an amazing device to bring on vacations because with proper applications, DVD movies, and tv shows recorded from my computer can be put onto the Zune.  It's fantastic. I treat my electronics wonderfully and take care of them so I never have any problems. Some of the people who have troubles with the Zune are not doing something right. It's easy to blame an electronic device when it's really the users fault...think about it ;)

<Title>BEWARE OF THE "UPDATE" TO ZUNE VERSION 2!
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I logged in tonight to warn everybody of a very serious problem with the Zune Version 2 software.  Microsoft's own Zune board is alight with many angry (livid, even) posts from Zune owners who upgraded from the Version 1 software and now feel completely betrayed.  Please read on!  First of all, the Zune V.2 software (and upgrade) cripples a TON of features that that were found on the original Zune Version 1 software.  While the Zune V.1 software was never anything to write home about (it was somewhat limited to begin with), at least it worked and allowed you to do some basic batch editing of the "tags" (or "metadata") for each album and song.  It had other nice features such as the very elegant and cool "Paste Album Art" feature (also found in the Windows Media Player).  Inexplicably... maddeningly... Zune Version 2 KILLS these and many more features. With Version 2, Microsoft seems to be going after the Apple playbook and mantra: "Simple is Better."  Unfortunately, for these lunkheads, simple means stripping the software of nearly all of its usefulness other than synching and buying, buying, buying from their "Zune Marketplace."  They are trying to sell Zune Version 2 as an upgrade... don't buy into the lie... it is most DEFINITELY a downgrade.  Go read the user boards at Microsoft's own Zune user site.  Their customers are livid!  But wait, there is more... this is not even the worst of it!  It gets much, much, much worse....  Users who upgraded from Zune Version 1 are reporting, from all over the place, that the Zune Version 2 has TRASHED their "metadata" (tags)!  What's more, while Microsoft quickly acknowledged this by releasing a "fix" -- the fix seems to have done very little to help.   In essence, what the new software does is to jumble up your albums and artwork.  The Beatles "Revolver" album might suddenly show up as having only half of the original songs on its song list.  The "missing" songs may have been arbitrarily replaced by the Bee Gee's "Staying Alive," Stevie Wonder's "Livin' For the City," two dongs by Donovan, another by The Animals and The Carpenter's "Close to You" along with other "new" songs by other artists. And so... in the brave new Zune Version 2 Software world, the Beatles "Revolver" album might be a whole new experience -- though perhaps, not the experience you had hoped for when you plunked down several hundred dollars for the privilege of becoming Microsoft's new experiment.  Since batch editing has now been disabled in Version 2, you'll have to go into Zune Ver. 2 and re-edit each and every erroneous file individually... by hand!  However, if you do that... you are playing a fool's game... as I and many other users have found... your edits WON'T stick.  They may for a day or so.  However, eventually, Zune Ver. 2 will jumble them up again -- often recreating the original errors (obviously, it has a way of remembering erroneous information, but not correct information).    Oh, and that jumbled up "Revolver" album I am talking about... it might also feature strange new cover art -- such as that from Alice Cooper's "Billion Dollar Babies." Again, nice... just not what you were hoping for!  Try to fix the album cover art... you need to use Zune 2's clunky new system, rather than Zune 1's elegant "Past Album Art" feature.  After you do that, you learn that you were playing yet another fool's game as Zune Ver. 2 will just change the cover art right back again.  It likes what it likes and it doesn't care what you like.  What Zune Version 2 does excel at is herding its users into the "Zune Marketplace" so that you can download more $ongs and Video$ right into the player... probably so that Zune can have fun jumbling up your data once again.  I have no idea if Microsoft will properly address this problem.  Right now there are a lot of early adopters with expensive "hockey pucks" sitting at home feeling completely betrayed.  they WANT to love their Zunes... they really could... but how could they under these conditions?  By the way, until a week ago I was a big fan of my 30G Chocolate Brown Zune... and I hope to be one again.  I hope this is just a glitch and that they will soon rectify these (many) problems and stop crippling the software.  I have no ax to grind with Microsoft or Zune. Like other existing Zune owners: I WANT to love my Zune. It is a BEAUTIFUL little machine.  In fact, I had my heart set on upgrading to their new 80G model.  However, this has stopped me dead on my tracks... I won't be getting one for Christmas now... and, unless they fix these problems, I will walk away and right into the waiting arms or Apple's iPod or Creative's Zen or the one pf the fabulous Archos models.  This warning should also give you a pause and reason to hold off on that purchase until more is known and Microsoft fixes these problems.  Right now... the new Zune Software (Version 2) is very, very, very bad news.

<Title>Pretty Peeved
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My whole experience started off poorly. Needed to sign up for some stupid account that I know I'll never used, but will definitely generate me some great spam (oh boy.) Started up the program, made duplicates of lots of songs, and changed the genres of countless, spent nearly 2 hours fixing what it'd done. By the time I was done with that, it was time to load some songs on! But, just my luck, the thing froze on me. After consulting the manual I tried the reset, which of course didn't work. For whatever reason, this device has no hard-reset. After visiting their website (which was thoroughly useless) I gave up hope. So.. how was everyone else's Veteran's day?

<Title>Better than an iPod Classic?
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I believe the new and old Zune are both better than the iPod Classic or Video iPods for several reasons (especially after the firmware update):  1.  Zune can sync via Wi-Fi 2.  "All you can eat" Zune pass. For those who buy multiple cds a month and cycle through cds quite frequently, this is an awesome option - $15/month 3.  Large bright screen 4.  Navigation is even better than iPod 5.  Has a more durable build 6.  The new Zune comes with premium ear-buds 7.  Ability to share music with friends who also have a Zune 8.  Has a built-in FM radio

<Title>Very good product.
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune because I just can't bring myself to pay $250 for an IPod. I told myself that even if it did't have all the same features as the IPod, I'm not paying as much so I shouldn't complain. So far I am very happy with the features and the fact that it seems more durable and scratch resistant than the IPod. I know because my wife and I bought our two kids each a new 30g IPod last Xmas and they are all scratched up. Granted they are young (11 & 14), and they use them more than me and do not like to cover them. Anyway, the sound is good and the video looks good and I am very happy with my purchase.

<Title>Great
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So i bought my Zune about a month ago and i love it. First: the appearance. It looks much cooler than the Ipods, the screen is great, and the green tent on the brown zune looks pretty awesome. Sound and screen quality and ease of access are a major plus and compairs equally to Ipod. I enjoy the controls but many people complain that it does not have a spinning wheel to navigate with, however, is the spinny wheel really THAT great? I like it but i can live without it. I prefer the zune over the ipod simply because EVERYONE has an Ipod and Ipod offers such an amazingly limited amount of personalization. Also, both of my brothers have ipods and they are IMPOSSIBLE to keep from getting scratched to peices while the zune is greatly resistent and durable. However i've noticed that many people are having Zune software issues. I thought i was pretty good with computers and that i wouldnt have a problem but i was wrong. I have a newer computer running Vista and i just couldnt make it work when trying to install off of the CD or the internet. I ended up taking everything to a friends house who happens to be very high up in Cisco and it took him a while to figure it out. Overall i love my zune and at the price or $14o it was an unbeatable deal!

<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Zune with the upgraded software today, the new Wi-Fi feature (Zune to pc) and enhanced interface were nice and all but just a reminder to some of the buyers: at the current stage zune firmware 2.2 does not support east asian characters and also there is no hacking software available to fix this glitch. so if you listen to a lot of songs with foreign language titles then you might wanna consider something else.

<Title>Excellent -- But follow the instructions.
<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this MP3 Player. The only problem I had was that when I started, I tried to plug it into my 4 port USB hub. The Zune needs power from a rear USB port. If you start out knowing that, you should be fine. The Zune holds music, video, pictures and podcasts. My computer transferred the music very quickly. But then my computer has a 3ghz dual core processor with 4gigs of RAM. The software installs easily and the Zune wiil take 3 hours to charge up. When you are using the Zune, it scrolls through the music very fast, no pauses when you are looking for a certain artist. You can add to the Zune on song at a time, multiple songs at a time, a hole album at once or even a while artist or multiple artists at once. You have the option to sync with your computer or not to sync with your computer. I have high speed internet, so the Zune updated to the current software quickly and smoothly. I really like it and I got it for $99 new, so it was a real bargain. I would suggest it to someone looking to get an MP3 player because it has so much space for a reasonable price.

<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Zune 30 for several months and love it. The screen is large enough to watch music videos or even TV shows with comfort. With the newly released firmware I can now sync wirelessly which is really nice especially for those who intend to get a speaker dock. The new Zune software for the desktop has lost some of the advanced features that the original software had, however they are working on adding them back. They are now offering DRM-Free MP3 songs on their Marketplace. For the price the Zune 30 is well worth it and one I'd recommend. I bought 3 of the Zune 30's and just ordered a Zune 4.

<Title>Don't Believe what others say..... This is 5 star Quality!
<Date>Fri Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay.... so after ordering my Zune a few day's ago, I got really freaked about some of the reviews over this product. It seems like people are having a hard time using it. I got my Zune, opened it, and in 2 hours I had all my songs and pictures that I wanted.   A main problem with other people is that they are either technologically challenged, are too old for this new technology, their computer sucks, or simply have no idea what they are doing. I will admit that it took me 2 attempts to get the software started but it only took 5 minutes. Compared to the iPOD, the Zune makes the ipod's screen look like child's play. This screen is HUGE and very clear. The menu is freaking easy to use and the Zune has radio unlike ipod. You can also apply your own pictures as the backgroud unlike ipod. Since it has a rubbery finish... it wont sractch easily, show fingerprints, or smear like the ipod.  It might seem like I am bashing the ipod but in reality, i'm just comparing!   For the price.... you can't ask for anything better. You really have to compare your marginal benifits with your marginal costs but you will easily see that a 30 gig MP3 anywhere else wont sell for less than $250.   After my friends saw my new Zune and all of its features, they were Jelous!! Even though it has a rubbery finsh... it looks VERY sleek with the coal chrome finish on the edges of the screen. You ca also play your pictures in a slideshow as Landscape view and your movies as well. It looks like a mini wide screen!!!!  For these reasons, I give this product 5 out of 5... - Easy to use - Looks incredibly nice - Has radio - Plays all your songs, videos, and pictures - Has a HUGE screen - Wont show finger prints or scratches - 30 gig = $140???? uhhhh, BARGIN!!!!! - BETTER THAN IPOD!!!!!!!!!

<Title>Nice for the Money
<Date>Sat Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is a trusty player that is well organized and offers radio, where iPods do not. The button navigation is not as sleek as an iPod, but still functional. The install of the Zune is probably the worst thing about it. There are about ten different things that can go wrong. For instance, sometimes updated versions of WMP interfere. For me, I had a password on my administrator account that I was unaware of. I had to hack into my own computer to remove the password so that the Zune could access the My Music folder for all users. Anyway, the Zune is pretty, it holds music and video, so there you go. It's targeted to a young, hip crowd, but don't let that put you off. It's a nice player. Even my iPod devoted boyfriend was excitedly playing with it when it arrived. A few notes of caution: If you have an iPod and have downloaded music from the store, chances are you're going to have a hard time transitioning to a Zune. Also, when you first get your Zune, change the rip settings to .mp3. The default is .wma, which can't be read on many other players.

<Title>Zune is great for the money
<Date>Tue Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Zune for about 2 weeks now and it seems to be working great.  I only have about 350 songs, 3,000 pictures, and 4 2-hour movies, but this is only using about 5 gb's.  For my first MP3 player, I think it was a good move.  I picked this up new for $172 (which you can find cheaper now) which is 1/2 the price of the 30 gb Ipod. Pros; - same space as the ipod - has an FM Tuner, so you can listen to the radio as well - larger screen for movie watching - zunemods.com has tutorials on how to convert movies, how to replace the battery, and even replace the hard-drive.  If you're used to working on PC's, the zune is just a small pc. - Coming from Microsoft, it would have been nice to have a clock/calendar  Cons; - Not as many accessories as the Ipod - Zune Marketplace is a little different to I-tunes, so I'm having trouble adjusting - Battery life lasts about 12-13 hours for music.  About 2-3 hours for movies - Wifi is kind of useless - Size as compared to Ipod is minimal, fraction of an inch.. - Headphones that come with the zune don't fit good.  However, I picked up a cheap pair from Walmart and the sound is really good.  Overall, a good product for a first-time user, or someone who wants to save a little money.

<Title>The VERY BEST MP3 PLAYER ANYWHERE!
<Date>Thu Nov 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not going to go through the specs of the Zune, because you could look it up. Instead, I'll tell you how awesome it is:  Lets start with the integrated radio. This feature is perfect for those wondering what songs escaped their collection, and the radio listener. The quality of it is fantastic, although the signal grows weak sometimes, although it is no different from the car radio...  The video screen is the best feature of the Microsoft Zune, hands down! The quality of what you see depends almost exclusively on the quality of what you download onto the Zune, with the exception (I'm guessing, without trial... yet) of BluRay quality movies. The only thing that makes it tough to get your movies on the Zune is the part of getting them off the disc in the right format. After that, its a breeze...  The stock earbuds must be mentioned. These guys have small magnets on the outside of them to attach themselves to each other when you are not using them, or just one. The quality of the sound is fantastic as well.  Customer Service is very polite and helpful. I had a unique issue with the earbuds and called for a replacement. After about ten minutes, I was off the phone with a new set of stock earbuds on the way, and I didn't even have to send in the broken ones... Now, I doubt that they would do the same for the Premium Earbuds..... lol.  There is sooo much more to say, but no time or space to say it in. Try it yourself!

<Title>Love my new zune!
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to admit, I was a bit timid when I read some of the product reviews about this product.  But I figured, hey, for $100, I can give the Zune a try and return it if I'm not satisfied.  My package arrived in no time, and the box was in perfect shape.  The brown color is fine (though it wasn't my first color choice), and it doesn't attract fingerprints!! The greenish light that emanates from the edges of the zune is pretty cool, too.  While the Zune is a bit bigger than what I'm used to in mp3 players, it's not any different than a larger-capacity iPod.      This is my second mp3 player.  I have a 2GB Sansa whose capacity quickly became full, since I share it with my husband.  I have to say, I didn't have the software issues that people in the other reviews had.  I popped in the disk, and while the software downloaded slowly (a cable modem would definitely have been handy), it downloaded perfectly, and even updated itself with no problems whatsoever (and it even prompted me to explain that if I had any problems with device detection, to simply switch to a rear USB port).  It synched my existing library from Windows Media Player (I couldn't even figure out how to use the Sansa software that came with that player) all by itself!!!  That was handy.  It also downloaded my photo library, and still had TONS of space left on its hard drive.       I was also glad to learn that the earbuds actually stayed in my ears (not the case with the Sansa earbuds), although I think I will probably invest in different ones, anyway (I suspect my ears are the problem, not the earbuds).  They did have good sound, though (although one earbud doesn't work, so I was glad to read in another review that customer service rocks, and I won't even have to send in the defective ones).      Probably the only less-than-positive thing I would have to say is buyer beware if you purchase a zune pass monthly membership.  I read the user agreement, and as soon as you stop paying the monthly fee, your ability to use anything you downloaded to your zune is gone.  Which means you'll end up buying everything all over again.  Though I also read that once the new zune debuts, the software will change to support other types of downloads, which is nice.  However, I still like old-fashioned cds, simply because I own what's on them for as long as I want to keep the cd, and it syncs just fine to the Zune.      Overall, this is a great music player.  Thank you, Microsoft!  Keep up the good work.

<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my zune yesterday and am very happy with it. The service on Amazon was excellent (as usual) and I received my zune 30gig the day after I ordered it. For 100 bucks it's definitely worth it. The computer I'm running it on isn't the best but I had no problem installing the software and formatting the zune. The zune software was very helpful and automatically scanned my whole computer getting all my music files. Because I buy mostly CDs I did not have digital cover art for most of my music. The zune software went online and found a lot of it. What it didn't find I got manually from Amazon and Pure Volume. I was not so happy in the picture and particularly, the video aspects of the zune. The pictures it got were only the jpg types but even with that it was a ton of pictures. I'm working on a family computer; I'm the only one who listens to music on it but certainly not the only one who stores pictures on it. I wish I could have manually retrieved the pictures. The video side was sadly lacking in types it would run. I need to learn how to convert my videos to their preferred format. Aside from that, the software was nice and easy to use. Also I went on the zune website and found a simple mod that allows my zune to work as an external hard drive. The zune charged quickly and after I synced all my music, all the videos I could, and some choice pictures I was ready to unplug the zune and use it. I was very pleased with the size, weight, and texture. The screen is a good size and is useful for viewing pictures and videos without straining your eyes. The controls were relatively easy to learn. In fact everything about the device (bar the quality of some of the cover-art) seems rather nice (note: I could not try the wifi for lack of knowing anyone with a zune). Overall, it's a solid multimedia player at a bargain price.

<Title>The Zune is the MP3 Player of Choice
<Date>Sun Nov 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Zune on December 31, 2006.  I gave some time before the review.  When I got my Zune I bought it in the color brown for $250.00.  I will say the brown is very unique and complete, with the green finish.  For the Zune's external, it is beyond 5 stars.  It never gets scratches, looks great, and is comfortable in the hand or pocket.  I have dropped it many times and I don't have a case.  It's still in great condition.   Now, for the internal, I will admit I am still astonished to this day.  Browsing through the music library is easier on the Zune than any other player.  The battery has to be charged around one or twice a week, and I use it daily.  With 30 gigs of storage, you can hold all the videos and music you want.    My sister had a Zune in black so I have experienced file sharing.  A whole CD of music (13 songs) is sent and recieved in around 15 seconds.   Overall, I am most pleased with this device.  Only now my eyes are even more fascinated by the 80 GB Zune.  Hmm, the negative things about the Zune...  All I have experienced is if you have 4000 songs it might take a little bit to get through the list.  Negative hardware...  maybe if you have a Mac there is a problem.      Here is something funny: my Zune has not frozen (it's been over 10 months) so I am yet to need to reset it. My sister had to reset her iPod video the day she opened it, and continues to reset it quite often.  The iTouch looks neat, but I will stick to my beloved Zune.  P.S.: some very neat things happen when connected with a XBox 360 :-)

<Title>the zune is an ipod killer
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had nothing but good luck with my zune. The zune is about half as expensive as the ipod and I have found is alot better. Once you get the software running the softare automatically syncs files from your computer and also finds the album artwork so you don't have to do it. If you know how to work your computer then you won't have any trouble installing the software. It's very easy and you'd pretty much have to be an idiot to not be able to install it. The zune is alot better than the ipod in my opinion becuase you can also add other peoples music to your zune if you have the ipod you have to erase all of your files and sync to the other persons library. With the zune you have the option of connecting as a guest so you can just copy some of the other persons music if you want to without erasing all of yours all in all its a very good device I would recommend this over the ipod and I have no idea why people are talking about it like it's rocket science to install the software those people must be old and not know what they are doing on the computer

<Title>Wonderful MP3 Player, Terrible Software
<Date>Mon Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love the Zune player itself. It has a great interface, it's very sleek, and sound quality is great.  The software on the other hand is completely terrible. It's such a hassle to load music onto the Zune. And you can't just drag and drop into the Zune's directory, you must sync everything.  If Microsoft is willing to fix the software, I would recommend this product without reservations.

<Content>I also bought ipod 4G nano, so I have a comparation. Uploading a vedio in iTurn to Zune is very very slow, because it need time to convert the vedio format, I think.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this thing! My other mp3 player is a Creative Labs Nomad 60gig player.  I think that Creative Labs makes the best players out there, but the old one I have is a bit clunky weighs quite a bit. I bought this one because I decided I wanted the capability of video and it was on sale-- much lower than the price of One hundred thirty nine that it's on sale for now. The newer ones, at 80gbs, are coming out in a week or so, and this is why I bought this close-out model.  It came completely updated with the new firmware that will be on the newer ones.    Once you get it to work, it works very well. The software is very clunky, however. It makes my newer computer work very very hard when it is running.  iTunes doesn't do this, nor do some other programs I run, including Creative Labs software.  I really hate the Zune software, but it does work and it is pretty intuitive. That said, I need to stress that despite the fact that it IS intuitive, it didn't work correctly when I first started. Once I checked other message boards for specific answers to questions, it worked well and as it should.  However, I could not get my Zune to sync properly initially.  Two things I found very important:  First, make sure you use the back USB port on your computer, not the front. I didn't believe this could ever be an issue even though I knew that the front port gave off less power.  However, it couldn't even see my Zune when I used the front port. When I used the back port, it immediately recognized the player.  Secondly, when you set up your Zune for the first time, make sure you do not set it to automatically sync unless you are certain that is what you want it to do.  I have so many music files on my computer and there is no way they can all fit on  30 gb of space.  If it is set on automatically syncing, it will just fill up the Zune with the first 30 gigs, and the rest of my music will be unable to fit on there.  The player works really well and it's user friendly.  I am not sure about the battery life-- I don't think I've been getting the full time, but I'm not sure.  I plug it in when I listen to it at home and have only used it without a power adapter in the car which rarely amounts to a huge amount of time.  However, I am waiting for an additional cable so that I can leave on in the car and power it up to save the battery time.

<Title>No player is perfect
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I tend to buy a new MP3 player about twice a year, and I don't stick to any particular brand.  The 30GB Zune is a solid player, and at $89.99 (current price for the Brown model), it is a great deal.  Pros: -Display.  The screen is the crispest I've seen on any portable device (including the new iPod Touch).  Video is gorgeous, and album art is displayed big & bright. -Sound Quality.  Crystal clear audio, much better than what I've experienced from my 5th-Gen iPod Video & Nano. -FM Tuner.  True, every MP3 player on the market that doesn't bear the Apple logo has had this feature for years, but it's always a welcome touch.  Neutral: -Wireless.  It's a good idea in theory, but serves almost no purpose.  Not very many people have Zunes, so you're not likely to get a lot of use from the sharing feature.  Upcoming firmware updates promise to allow for wireless syncing, which is another feature that sounds great, but is pointless.  Since you have to connect via USB cable to charge anyway, why bother syncing wirelessly? -Battery life.  No better or worse than the 5th-Gen iPods (which was the target competition for this product). -Size.  It's just a little bigger than a pack of playing cards.  This is fine for me, but would be a definite turn-off for those who like their players sleek. -Color.  Brown, Black and White are not the best options Microsoft could have gone with.  But it's not like the color affects performance.  Cons: -Software.  I won't go into details (see other user reviews if you want to read pages and pages of details), but the software is slow, unfriendly, and a resource hog.  Video is particularly difficult, as everything has to be (very, very slowly) encoded into a portable .wmv file prior to being loaded onto the player (and that includes videos that are encoded as a .wmv to begin with).  Microsoft has promised that their next update (due mid-November '07) will resolve these issues, but the current version is just a pain. -Online Store.  Same complaints as the software.  Microsoft has also promised that this will change with the next update. -Cannot record from FM tuner.  Sandisk and Samsung players allow you to record FM radio input as MP3 files.  This is entirely software based, so there's hope that Microsoft will add this feature at a later time (like Creative is planning to do). -No expansion.  Creative & Sandisk both allow for quick expansion by adding some form of Flash memory.  I know my lists of neutrals and cons were longer than my list of pros, but as a basic player is does a good job.  If you are the type to sync your player 4 times a day, than you would be wise to look elsewhere.  But if you're like me and just want something that will do a good job at playing your music, than 30GB is a steal at $90.

<Title>So close to being the Ipod killer they hoped for.
<Date>Thu Nov 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wont get too wordy, Just the good & bad:  Bad: * You MUST use the Zune software to load music onto the device. This forces you to use their somewhat cumbersome & buggy software. I expect it will improve in its next iteration, but it leads into my second point..  * No way to utilize as an external storage device. This should be a simple & straightforward implementation. Almost every other player on the market can do this, the Zune should be able to as well.  * Will not play files with DRM from anywhere other than the Zune Marketplace. If you're ripping your own CDs or aquiring MP3s from other DRM-free sources this isn't an issue.  The good:  * Sound Quality is head & shoulders above any other media player out there. The SQ on this unit is amazing. This is the first device that has ever inspired me to rip CDs at anything over 192Hz. Any other time it just hasn't been worth it since you couldn't hear much of a difference. The zune makes it worth it.  * The display on the Zune is gorgeous. Where else can you get a device with a screen this size for such a minimal cash outlay?  * GUI is well layed out & sensible. There is little to no learning curve on using the unit. I personally find the GUI to be easier to use, and more intuitive than the iPod GUI. If the zune had a click wheel interface it would be considerably better than the iPod's.  * BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY. This was what finally sold me on the Zune. M$ is not giving up on all of the older versions of the zune with the release of the Zune2. The firmware for the Zune2 will work on this model of the Zune. Meaning you will get all of the fixes & features of the new model for a fraction of the price.  Bottom line: Forget for a moment this is a Microsoft product & just compare features. After putting aside my blind hatred for M$, I realized that no other Media Player on the market could offer this many features at this price point.

<Title>I Luv My Zune
<Date>Mon Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Since it's a very short list, here are the failings of the Zune...  1. Podcasting! I don't give a flying fig about them, but honestly even though it won't "seamlessly update" like itunes. It can be done. In fact some more tech savy folks can tell you exactly how to do it. Just search the net, many Zune users have accomplished it just fine. The audio file doesn't care which player is playing it.   2. Accessories!! No, you can't go into any store or autodealer and find a home or car/car stero likely to seamlessly hook up to Zune. Ipods have cornered the market on current "Accessory" availability. But with a "line in" feature you can damn near hook any player up to a car or whatever. The "Zune stuff" you can find is proably a little more pricey just because it isn't as readily available as "ipod made" stuff.  3. The wireless music sharing feature is useless to me. Even though I actually know two Zune users one of us already like the same music and the other one's taste are tottally opposed to mine. Basically (as has been said a thousand times) this much hyped feature is more useless than useful. But the fact that it has Wi-Fi in it creates a big possiblitly for extenability in the future. Plus Xbox fans have Xbox connectivity, but at the time that's useless to me as well.   Basically, there are very little negatives in the negatives.   Long list of positives....  1. I RARELY purchase itunes music and I certainly have no intention of using Zune's marketplace. The only time I did use itunes music was when I had that gift card my sis gave me to go with my new ipod. All my itunes music I CD ripped is on my Zune. Despite what has been said to the contrary, Zune will convert any itunes tracks (acc files I believe?) that WEREN'T purchased through itunes store quite easily. The "DRM free" ones as they're called. I.E. if you ripped 25 CDs in itunes and grabbed a few music files off of some other DRM free music source and have them in you itunes music folder, Zune WILL play them. Converting the other music is perfectly possible too.   2. Zune video kicks almost any other digital music video out of the water (maybe the ipod touch can compete, but the ipod video can't). Sorry, but the widescreen display is AWESOME. You have to adjust yourself to the controls being flipped, but even my mother (who has no particular gaget affection) was blow away when I showed her one of her favorite music videos on the Zune. The screen's display just kicks ipod video's away. And while I did need third party software to convert some videos/dvds, I considered it a very small price to pay to be able to convert a whole DVD into a file I can use on my beautiful Zune.  3. Just like video, pictures look AWESOME on my Zune. I had pics on my nano and sorry, the zune display blows it away in spades.   5. Sorry for all the people who find it useless, but I LIKE the FM radio. I'm quite sure the Zune could have added FM recording, but they don't want the music companies to hate them. That's basically admiting to the Music big wigs that they give away music. It's the reason most big music stores (like Itunes and Zune Marketplace aren't DRM free with the tracks that they sell). Which is why I don't mind buying the darn CD- The Artist/Music CEOs get there cut and I get to rip my CD and store it on any bloody player I want. And I also have a hard copy of my music.   6. Multiple Aritist on a track - I always had a problem with this on itunes/ipod, but by simply having a "contributing artist" listed (first) that was different from my album artist. I love it, so I go to artist A and I see their albums listed along with random track from artist B's album where they were featured and the song is jointly in the list for Artist B's albums. The only stupid thing is while the Zune "computer copy" will list multiple "contributing artist", the actual Zune device will only accept one along with the album artist. But oh well, I couldn't even have a song linked to two artist in my ipod so it's a blessing for me.   7. The software was no problem to install, even with me having to go online for a windows vista update for it and it works almost like Windows Media Player so I pretty much could use it with very little headache.   8. I use to have two copies of almost all my music the "general file" that I used for Windows Media Player and the itunes files, well now that I don't need itunes... bye bye itunes. Bye Bye duplicate libary. Even though Zune does have it's own bulky software (as did itunes) at least I only need one copy of the music to list it in both Zune's software and Windows Media Player.   9. You can listen to Zune while it's charging. Close the Zune software and hook it up to headphones or speakers and boom, music while charging.  10. They call it bulk and ugly, I call it perfect for a clutz. Here I have this pretty pink color in a shell that (maybe is not as cute and lil as my pink nano) but is less likely to scratch. I like the plastic casing or whatever it is the thing is made of. I'm less scared of hurting the thing and it seems to be pretty physically durrable. If I had an ipod touch I know it would be full of ugly fingerprints all the time, but that's not a worry with my Zune.The occassional wipe of the surface keeps it looking nice and it doesn't have an accidental scratch or dent on it (unlike my ipod). And even though some have said you notice a bulkier look in the thing, most people "off the street" thought I had the bloody ipod. The size isn't really that different and while noticably heavier than ipod video, it's not like I feel a rock is in my pocket I just know the zune is there and I actually like that.   11. Zune DOES NOT delete content just because you switch from auto to manuel sync. Yes, it will modify files it's synced to in your computer, but if you switch between manual and auto sync, it does NOT delete all the files on the player YAY!! I pod will kill your whole music list on the player if you switch between the two.   The Mixxed bag...  1. Pre-loaded content: The good of that was I got to see exactly how all of Zune's functions worked right out of the box, but getting rid of it all to put my stuff in was a headache.  2. The software, it's not trouble it's just stupid for Microsoft (father of Windows) to make a Digital Music Player that needs a peice of software that does EXACTLY what Windows Media Player does. Just let the darn player used Windows Media Player.   3. I almost wish it didn't grab the itunes files, as, like I said, I have a double libary and it had some songs listed twice and I had to go back and delete some of my own files just because it had the windows Media copy and the itunes copy.   4. I like manually syncing. Just like itunes, sometimes Zune thinks it knows what I want better than I do so I wish Zune would give you the OPTION of auto sync or manual before it automatically did it on the first hook up.   5. Earbuds by anyone (Apple, Microsoft, Sony) SUCK!!! 1st accessory in any personal Music Player buy, DECENT headphones.   Havivng owned and ipod I had to adjust myself to a lack of a click-wheel, but that was just something born of habit. I'm pretty use to navigating my Zune now and absolutly love it. Unlike my ipod, I haven't had the Zune suddenly freeze and have to be reset. I trust no device though (ipod, Zune, creative) to never die on me and my ipod had to be reset ALOT. It was relatively easy to do, but still annoying. I wish I had another player to compare it to, but as much as I LOVE my gagets my experience has been limited to ipod (my own and others) and the Zune. But let the podders love their pods, my zune is beautiful to me.

<Title>Worst purchase ever!
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am sorry to write this review, but I want to warn people for buying a Zune Player. First of all, as I am from the Netherlands and purchased this product in America, when I came home from holiday this zune player wasn't compitable with Microsoft Vista. So a new mp3 player isn't compitable with a new operating system. So for me as gadget-freak I felt dissappointed already from start. Fortunately it was compitable with my old XP computer.. Installing Zune software isn't too hard but Zune Marketplace can't compete with e.g. Itunes or Rhapsody. Also I find it strange that Rhapsody has far more tracks available than Zune MP.  Now after four months my battery has failed. So my new mp3 player which cannot be installed on a dutch version of Vista is out of order.. I deeply deeply regret this product. I strongly recommend people to buy e.g. the new Ipod Itouch or Iriver... You will be much be happy with either of those..

<Title>Something Outside the box
<Date>Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have followed the Zune since it's launch and so far I have no regrets about purchasing one.The Zune has many strengths that sets it apart from other Mp3 or Multimedia players, those strengths include its case which is almost scratch or smudge resistant,with proper care a Zune won't age as fast as an Ipod and won't loose its asthetic value that much due to the fact that the case looks constantly "glossy". The Zunes screen is fantastic for viewing videos and pictures especially since they can be viewed in landscape mode.    Many have criticised the Zunes Wifi capabilities for not allowing the zune to connect to other devices and Wifi hotspots, that is a weakness of the zune but at the same time I enjoy the fact that I can connect my device to other Zunes in my immediate vicinity.    Compared directly to the Ipod I pick the zune, it has a bigger screen and is naturally a better device for viewing videos.Too cut this review short the Zune is actually of greater value than the Ipod and gives more bang for your buck.

<Title>Great Non Apple Mp3 player
<Date>Thu Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For the price its hard to beat.  I considered purchasing an apple ipod classic and came across the zune price drops and figured it was too hard  not to take a chance on the zune.  As a father of two I purchased it out of practicality, including price and not media hype or coolness factor. I bought it mostly for music storage and pictures. My greatest concerns prior to purchasing were ease of use, functionality and battery life.  My only disappointment is battery life.  I average five hours which seems lousy to me.  The zune requires its own software, similar to itunes with an upgrade that is pending.  Right now the music or only availabe option on the zune marketplace is pretty good, but falls a bit short compared to itunes.  However, its easy to use.   The zune itself is easy to use and the screen is nice and pretty large.  My only real disppointment is the current lack of videos for purchase on the zune marketplace and the short battery life.

<Title>Good, to a point
<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune, mostly so I wouldn't have to buy an iPod, but I didn't do my homework well enough before I bought this product.    In short, Zune does what it says it will do well, but not a single darn thing more.  The good: - The video playback is very nice due to the large screen and the landscape capability. - Playback of MP3 files sounds great, especially with the premium earphones (easily the best earphones I've owned). - 30 gb will be great for most folks, although a little small for me.  The Zune software has a compression utility that works well and allows for more storage without noticable (for me, anyway) quality loss. - The chassis of the Zune is terrific - the lightly textured surface doesn't show fingerprints, it looks great, and it's comfortable in the hand.  The bad: - Not enough video playback types.  It won't even play AVI.   - I just don't like having to use the Zune software, and I don't understand why it's even necessary.  Part of the reason I bought it was so that I wouldn't *have* to use another media management software (ie. iTunes).  I use Windows Media Player as my normal media player and manager, and since it is built to interface with many MP3 players, I assumed it would work with Microsoft's MP3 device offering.  Wrong!  Instead, it is necessary to load Zune's own software, which is a lite version of Windows Media Player in appearance and apparent function.  This is just absurd to me. - Content copy control "feature":  Microsoft apparently went great lengths to make sure everyone's playing nicely and not copying their music files for all their friends by gimping the Zune in a number of ways. *Firstly, you can't synchronize your Zune on more than one computer at a time.  Forget using the Zune to keep your music library synched on a laptop and a desktop, or your home and work computers.  You pick a base computer to sync with, and if you ever decide to change it, or you reformat that base computer, you must *erase* your Zune before you can sync it up anywhere again.  I have about a 35 gb music library, and resynching the whole thing, using compression, takes about 6 hours. *Secondly, the Zune cannot be used as a USB portable hard drive.  This was a big disappointment for me, and I can think of no other reason that Microsoft would prevent this except as another "play-nice" control. - Wireless = useless.  I have yet to meet anyone else with a Zune, much less swapping 30 second music clips (all that the Zune allows) with them.  I suppose I could find an XBox to transmit with, but what's the point of that? - The included earphones and "protective" pouch are mediocre at best.  The day after I got my Zune, I went and bought a plastic shell case and the Zune premium earphones.  My biggest gripes with the Zune is the intentional restriction of features to try to prevent music copying.  While I certainly don't practice or endorse stealing music, these "features" are not going to prevent it for someone who is determined to do so.  It only serves to gimp an otherwise good product and limit its quality and utility.   I wish I had bought a Zen instead.

<Content>I found this Zune to be really cool! It had a lot of features that I would not expect, like the ability to make the wallpaper from any picture on the Zune. I really like it. The only problems that I have with it is that there is no clock on it, it does not have bass, and it's weight (but the weight is to be expect for a 30 Gig).  Another problem, not with the zune itself, but with the zune marketplace, is that they don't sell videos. They only sell music. Other than these things, though, it is a great mp3 player and I would definitely recommend it if you don't mind these minor flaws.

<Date>Fri Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is a fair music player, not the best and not the worst.  If it wasn't for the fact that it is so locked down and Windows only it would be a great deal.  You have to use the Zune software to sync with your computer for transferring music files.  The software is an over glorified Windows Media Player, and makes importing your song library not the easiest thing to do.  So unless you are doing a fresh copy from your CD to the Zune it will not be an easy task.

<Title>Zune is it
<Date>Sat Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had several others and wanted a larger capacity without going to an apple product, personal reason, nothing wrong with the Ipod. The video on the Zune sold me, with a shrink program, I have nearly 60 full length movies on my Zune, and I am averageing nearly 5 hours on the battery with great images. No more carrying DVD's and a player or getting out the laptop on flights. I bought 2 more, one for the wife and ane for the daughter. The software is easy to use, very easy to use. I taught my 10 yr old in one session. She loves her's as well, with roughly 30 movies and nearly 2500 songs, she only has one thing to carry on long trips, a Zune. The wife loves hers and the ease of use is a big reason. There are a couple of gripes, not being able to sync wirelessly is one, and capacity is the other. I have already pre-ordered the 80 GB, so the only issues I had will go away in less than a month!

<Title>Really an iPod killer
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had been looking for a video mp3 player for a few months and when the Zune came up on sale here I decided to go ahead and take the plunge. I can honestly say it was a good idea.  Compared to its rival the video iPod The Zune lacks the popularity but makes up for it in usability. The menu system is very nice, the screen is large and has amazing quality, and the button interface is simple and nice. Some people would prefer the over sensitive touch wheel of the iPod, but I personally prefer the clicking buttons.  A very interesting feature is the double shot: a kind of built in armor for the Zune. you can take car keys to this thing and aside from the screen it will come out unscathed. Other mp3 players scratch if you so much as look at them.  With the next gen of Zunes coming in Nov, it's nice to know that people who already have the old Zunes are in no way being left out as the updates will be applied to the older Zunes as well. When Microsoft says "Welcome to the Social" they really meant it.

<Title>I love my Zune!
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned my Zune since April.  I waited six months to actually write a review to make sure I didn't eat my words.  It has worked beautifully since I bought it.  I have not had a single problem with it even the installation went smoothly.  It is a bit bulky but it will fit in pockets (even in girl jeans).  I hated the headphones and bought some Skullcandy ear buds and the sound it awesome.  I don't download music so I didn't have to deal with that.  I had all my music in Windows Media Player and all of that moved over to the Zune software just fine.  The Zune market place sucks but I have found other places to download music.   I bought this player also because I use my computer as a DVR and it syncs beautifully with my Zune.  And the large screen is really nice to watch TV on the go.   Bottom line is that it is a great start for Microsoft and I am excited to see where they take it from here.  I just wish they would have had the red one when I got mine but I still love my swamp brown one.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this mp3 player.  I've had a 30gb iPod before and it can't compare to the great sound quality of the Zune.  While the Zune is a little bulkier, it's a little more sturdy and durable than an iPod.  The Zune is easy to use.  The only thing that I find annoying is the program that organizes the files, similar to iTunes, is hard to organize if your songs don't have the exact title or they have numbers or dashes in the name.  It will add the same songs twice if you don't sort it properly. The actual player itself is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone.

<Title>A Big Let Down!!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black) with alot of excitment. I saw it and decided to sell my Ipod Nano in order to get funds to purchase it. I bought it and finally turned it on and was ultimately dissapointed.  I made a list of the positives and negatives of this "mP3 Player"  Good: - Looks Pretty Good - Resists scratches pretty nicely - Came with good start off (good headphones, cover, sync cable) - Had a different look than other players  Bad: - The software is a mess to download on the computer..beware! - Thicker/ Heavier than what I like - There is a lag in the programming and transitions between menus - The marketplace is inconvienent and has NO VIDEOS OR PODCASTS!!!!! - Just to remind you... NO VIDEOS OR PODCASTS!!!!!! - Customer Service is rude and not helpful (talked to 4 people and was    treated rude everytime) - A dissapointment  I am selling my zune for a 80 GB Ipod Classic. It is the best choice I have made yet to date.

<Title>bad software is enough to ruin the experience
<Date>Sun Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>the zune software, as compared to itunes is pretty poor.  the zune as a standalone player, on the other hand is ok.  i havent owned the zune for more than 2 days but i've spent almost every waking minute of those 2 days dealing with the zune software interface and have found it annoying.  if i delete items off my pc, it will delete from the zune player as well.  additionally, the software converts the video to a more playable format for the zune itself.  mp4s are supported but if you try to put an mp4 on the zune player, the software takes a considerably long time converting (it took more than 5 minutes to synch 1 music video that was about 3-4 minutes long)  the best things about the zune are the player itself, but the software is a horrible nightmare of an experience.  i actually like the zune's playback and i prefer a directional pad instead of the ipod wheel.  it is far easier to scroll through a large list and narrow in on 1 item when you have a directional pad.  the screen is larger than the ipod and the landscape orientation is pretty nice.   because the software is so bad, it is hard to rate the zune favorably as a whole though.

<Content>Pretty Amazing! I got this thing on woot.com for $100 and it is great. Had no issues with the software or the media player. One tip is just to organize your music before hand the way you want it, it makes things easier when you sync it for the first time and everything shows up structured like you want it.  Still amazed at the wifi sharing feature. If only as many people had zunes as they do ipods it would be even better!

<Title>OK device, terrible software
<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I too wanted to like this.  My expectations were pretty low - play music, have a few pictures of the baby.  The hardware itself is OK, though other than the screen size nothing makes you say "wow, that's nice."  The software is somewhere between tedious and a nightmare. - What genius at Microsoft thought that when you install, the Zune software should automatically pull in every picture on your all your hard drives, without asking you?  I have tens of GB of photos, I don't want them on my Zune.  I had to figure out how to stop it, manually specify folders, erase the Zune.   It imported some playlists I didn't want it to, so it took me a while to figure out that I had to delete those so it would let me delete some music I didn't want on.  Uggh.  If it had just asked what folders I wanted imported at the beginning, it would have avoided all that. - Irony of ironies, it will automatically import all kinds of stuff I don't want, but it won't automatically import the music I want it to - I have to do it manually.  There are folders that it imported one song, but not the others.  It turns out it's missed about 20% of my songs.  I can sort of fix that by dragging the folders (in the Windows file view) and dropping them onto the Zune library view.  It seems like it probably got all the songs, but I didn't need to waste time on that.  More of the same tired Microsoft approach.  We know what's best for you - have it *our* way!

<Title>STOP SYNCING!!!!
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Surprise surprise, microsoft makes another problem, i mean- product and whats wrong with it...the software.  The zune software is HORRIBLE.  It took everything from my hard drive, i have like 30 instructional videos that i dont need in my pocket and it synced ALL of them.  What's worse, I deleted them from the library, and the next time i started up the program, its synced them AGAIN!  It takes the Zune about 20 min each time I attached it to sync to my computer.  I have been an ipod owner for the last 4 years and I LOVE them as much as I love itunes.  The zunes menu system is unintuitive and options are difficult to adjust.  I hope this so called godsend of an update that Microsoft is releasing will improve the functionality of their half-wit product.

<Content>Software is a bit cumbersome at first but once you get the settings the way you want it (tell it not to sync automatically), it works quite well.  The deals out there for this thing right now are a steal for what you get ($139 for new ones, $99 refurbs).  Who cares about zune vs. ipod?  This is a quality 30 GB media player for a great price. Take advantage while you can.  After November when gen comes 2 out, these deals on will be gone for a while. Battery life is a little weak.

<Title>Its O k.
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune is an o k device. Its comparable to the ipod, but i just dont like how limited it can get. I am used to using a PSP and its very simple to import music onto it, with this, you have to download all the files from your computer to the device, including things you dont like, and then have to delete them later. It can be a long process. Also, putting movies into it takes forever. For the psp, all you would need to do is download the mp4 video file then drag and drop it into the psp, with this zune, it has to convert the file, then put it on the player, which take forever. I wont be using my Zune for too much longer, and i hope to sell it and buy the new version of the psp.

<Title>Everything good but the Sync
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune because I didnt want to buy the Ipod. The only problems i had is that it does not come with a portable power unit, so you have to plug it in to your computer in order to charge it.  Also if you wanna see movies you have to download them. There's a way around that put you need another software to sync with it. I bought an external harddrive and created a file and download it as an  MPEG-4. Other than that I think this is a very good device.

<Title>Loved it.. and then it died.
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a huge supporter of Microsoft. I wanted to own a Zune ever since I learned of them and finally got a black one in May of 2007. I paid $250 for mine. I dealt with all of its flaws and saw beyond the things I didn't like about it. The 3 inch screen rocked me and anyone who saw it. I learned how to handle the automatic tagging and became a total Zune expert, learning about the sleep mode and everything. I really liked my Zune and couldn't be happier with any other MP3 player, having owned two before.  And then, a week ago, it stopped charging. It wasn't the USB cable. Uh oh. Funny, I never dropped it AND had purchased a protective silicone case and screen protector for it. What gives?  So, the battery drained all the way down until I couldn't even turn it on anymore. I just learned Microsoft wouldn't support the warranty for mine even though I've had it under a year and qualify for it.  To think that I wholly supported a product that ended up crapping out on me. I feel ashamed telling people this thing was better than an iPod, seeing as everyone I know who's owned an iPod has never had an issue with it. I am now buying a Toshiba Gigabeat. This is ridiculous.

<Title>Buyer Beware
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Zune 5 months ago. It worked very nicely. It has not been dropped, yet the screen stopped working. Customer Support tells me it was from pressure applied to the screen and there is no warranty for the screen. They said it can happen without my being aware of it. This is a very fragile piece of equipment.  Perhaps Microsoft will see fit to fix this problem in the future. I was told to keep checking the website. It is true that Micorsoft admitted there was a problem and extended the warranty on the XBox only when enough people began to return their dead XBoxes,   My next large storage mp3 player will be an Ipod. I have had an Ipod Nano for over a year with no problems.

<Title>Great Deal For iPod Alternate
<Date>Fri Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a terrific deal for people that aren't afraid to try something new in the competitive MP3 player space. With the lower price and the Zune firmware rollout, this deal is a no-brainer!  I bought the generation 1 Zune 30GB after the announcement was made concerning the Zune 2.0 models. I have a large music library that I've archived onto my desktop hard drive and I wanted an MP3 and video player, but was tired of the hassles with iTunes and the iPod in general.  The Zune software (which is funtional and easy to use) was able to catalog and copy the files onto my Zune very quickly. The nice part was that the suite was able to find official album art for most of my collection. I haven't bought anything from the Zune music service, but it looks clean and well organized. The only ding against it is that if you have a large collection of music you bought from iTunes, it will not be able to recognize it at all. To be fair, iTunes won't recognize tracks with competing DRM either, so it's not a Zune specific issue.  The hardware itself seems more durable than the iPod and it also doesn't collect smudges and fingerprints. The aesthetics may not be your cup of tea, as some people think it is "clunky" or too "brick-like." Personally, I like the look of it since it seems more personal and less antiseptic. The screen is large and vibrant. The controls have good tactile presence and are easy to use. (Note that the round control is not a "clickwheel" at all despite it's appearance. It actually mimics the functionality of a bidirectional d-pad like you would find on most cellphones.)  The interface on the player is bright and easy to navigate. You can set custom wallpapers or backgrounds. When you are scrolling through your music collection, the interface actually shows you a tiny thumbnail of the album art which is a nice touch.  Out of the box, the Zune does not support wi-fi to PC syncing of the music and picture collection, but it will within the next couple of weeks thanks to a firmware update. This ability to update the software shows where Microsoft's strength lies and I expect future updates to be backwards compatible until the hardware can no longer support it.  Overall, the 30GB Zune is a winner.

<Title>A good player
<Date>Sat Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me start off with this is an awsome player... but the software is kinda a pain to get used to not as easy as my creative soft ware. This has been my 4th mp3 player the first being a sandisk who screen broke, then a creative zen vision which got stolen, creative zen v with also got stolen and now a zune. I have stayed away from ipods for a couple of reasons, 1. my razor phone has a tendancy to fall out of my pocket so having something with a little thickness keeps it in my pocket, also my friends have had countless problems with there ipods from screens to bad service. Probley on of the best players ive had was the creative zen vision m who's software was fast and simple and had a flawless operation, and i would have boughten another one but i cant find them anyware, so i went with the zune. The software takes a litte getting used to but once you figure it out its very simple. The player works perfectly videos look awsome, the music sounds good, the only thing i dont like is the ear phones as they start to hurt my ears after about 20 minutes of listening.

<Title>Software is terrible
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my daughters birthday a few days ago. I was a great deal at $149.00 however only the Zune software works with it and it is horrible. It can not be recognized by your pc so that you can just drag and drop. Also Windows Media Player does not recognize it either. I thought this was a Microsoft device. Also every time you log it on it tries to sync everything. Sure you can turn that feature off but when you go to the sync screen to put on just the music you want and starts to sync your whole library again anyway. I am going to return this just because of the software. What a shame. Oh and when you do figure how delete all the stuff that it puts on that do not want, good luck actually getting off. I feel Microsoft purposely made it this way so you are steered to their site with their catalog that will try to download to your pc every time. I do not want their catalog on my pc. It takes forever to download, it must be huge. So if you like to be steered around like cattle, buy it!

<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the 30gb zune for about a month at time of writing. It is definitely a player worth considering. If you're completely sick of ipods, their small screens and annoying controls (like I was), this is the only other mp3 player that you should look at. At the current price, it's a steal and you get an excellent product. Videos look amazing, sound is perfect. Battery life is also very good, lasts me about 4 days with about 2 hours of use each day (mixed audio and video). Overall, I greatly recommend this product to anyone, even if you're considering an ipod. I personally like these much much more.

<Title>Great hardware, bad software
<Date>Tue Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I rate the Zune hardware, as in the player itself at 5/5 stars.  Unfortunately, I rate the software that comes packaged with the zune, and which as far as I know must be used with the zune at 1/5 stars.  Thus an average of 3/5 stars for the entire package.  Hardware: Big pretty screen, buttons are less ambiguous and provide more feedback than an Ipod, hard disc sounds/feels more stable than in an Ipod.  Sound feels about equivalent.  Interface is a little clunky and I wish it had more control over settings, the options menu feels like it's there just to suggest that you have control over something rather than offering any actual functionality.  Battery life is fairly short for video playback, but from my research it matches most other media players.  The hardware is not perfect, but when compared to other hardware out there, specifically the Ipod, it is at worst equivalent(interface) and at best superior (Screen size).  Software: Wow.  If ever there was a plague, crafted by deities above to punish mankind for some transgression and converted into software form, it would be the Zune software interface.  It crashes during installation.  It crashes during charging.  It crashes during syncing.  It crashes when it connects to Zune marketplace.  In my experience there is very little that occurs that does NOT force the zune software into a "Not Responding" state, as Windows XP happily informs me every time I connect my Zune to my PC.  I didn't think it could be true that anything could be worse than  iTunes, I thought that Zune negative feedback must just be apple fanboys.    However, I am saddened to admit that doing the simplest things on a Zune such as adding several 20 minute movies takes, literally, hours if it works at all.  With absolutely no feedback about what is going on whatsoever the software randomly freezes, hangs for several minutes, fails to recognize a Zune connected to the PC, reports mysterious errors while syncing videos to the Zune, takes 30+ minutes to convert a 30 minute movie file to its own format before loading, and just generally frustrates and annoys me.  It really is more awful than you can even imagine.  When the software works correctly, it is slow, obnoxious, and not at all pleasant.  When it's not working correctly, it's infuriating, unusable and impossible to troubleshoot.  That about summarizes my experience with Zune so far.  The hardware is like a fine tuned machine, something created be engineers in the future and sent back in time to comfort mankind.  The software is like a freshman computer science students class project, created through well intentioned ignorance and forced upon us because someone has to debug it and grade it.

<Title>Super Happy, although still learning
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very hesitant about getting the Zune over an iPod due some (several) negative reviews.  All I can say is that some people have bad experiences.  Not me.  Granted, the Zune REALLY needs to come with a "real" manual so you don't have to hunt and search all over the Internet for info (which is why only 4 stars, not 5), but it isn't taking too much to learn even with just hooking it up to the computer and playing around.  The software loaded without a hitch, just follow the on-screen instrucitons.    I'm not a computer idiot, not a whiz either, but I would say a general knowledge and lack of fear of computers is helpful because you will have to play around with it to learn how it works.  Radio is great (shows the artist and song that is playing - COOL!!), loaded all my music, and one movie so far (you need additional software for dvd conversion) and I am really happy.  The movie, even loaded with a low bitrate, plays clear and has great sound.  Ignore the negative reviews, save some money (I got mine for the price of the new 4GB nano), and buy the Zune.

<Content>i'm going to start off with the out of the box pros: nice sized screen, simple controls, average 14hr battery life, good price, and pretty good sound. that's about as much as i can tell you for pros based on the fact that i'm stationed in iraq & thanks to the fact that you have to use microsoft's "proprietary software" (isn't that what windows media player is?), i can't load any music on it because it won't install the zune software.  it says i need the new updater software (windows geniune advantage) available at microsoft.com, not a problem stateside but kind of hard when you can't go online. it would have been nice to know before i bought it. all the preloaded stuff is nice, but it gets old pretty quick.  from the limited usability i have the only cons i've found are: 1) you can't save the quick lists you make on the player, maybe you can when you use the zune software on your computer; 2) there's no auto shut-off or sleep function that i've found.  other than that it's a pretty simplified mp3 player with video capabilities (if somewhat limited to wmv) & wifi (should be nice later on once they expand on it). if you want an mp3 player with better extras go with the creative vision or the ipod. if you like it simple and you use a validated "genuine" copy of windows then the zune is for you.

<Title>not so good
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Most mac users probably won't be buying a Zune, but I thought the price was good and I wanted to try something new. Of course I knew it didn't play well with mac os, but I had Vista installed on my mac, so I figured it would work fine with that. It did work, but it took me a long time to get it working and get my music on it. Once I had my music transfered, it did a fine job of playing music, but the interface was not the best I have seen. I would prefer the sansa one over the zune interface. The wireless transfer thing turned out to be a flop for me since I only know one person with a zune, and we couldn't get it to work anyways. Pretty much, I felt like I was stuck with a huge 30gb mp3 player. Yea, music worked fine, but I was expecting more. I'm trying to return it, and now I'm gonna get a sansa. If that thing flops I will go back to an iPod.

<Content>The Zune is a steal compared to the iPod of similar size.  It does everything the iPod does and it's cheaper!  I like it better then the generic Mp3 player I had last too. I like that the Zune is popular enough to have support from 3-party sources but not so popular that there is an accessory for every facet of my life.  That is that there is not an iToilet for the Zune (and yes there is an iToilet for the iPod) but there are accessories for the car and such.

<Content>I purchased a Zune as a workout tool, I get bored running on the treadmille, but with my zune I can run all day!! I watch movies & TV shows that I haven't been able to see in the past and get to catch up.   I purchased PQ DVD to Zune software, this made putting movies onto my Zune easy!!  The zune battery lasts several hours before running out, (I have never run mine out, and have watched it 2 hours straight).

<Title>Excellent overall
<Date>Thu Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Zune is a quite Cool!  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.  The thing is exceedingly easy to use - with most electronic devices, I play with them for a while and then break out the manual and read through it.  I've had my Zune for about three months now, and I just realized the other day that I've never looked at the manual.  Took me about 5 minutes to figure the whole thing out (as opposed to the dang i-pod which is a DISASTER on the user interface).  The sound quality is excellent.  Using WMA-VBR and professional headphones, I can not tell the difference between the Zune and uncompressed original source (again, beats the tinny i-pod sound with no comparison).  Battery life is surprisingly good.  I'm always surprised when I need to recharge it because it runs for so long.  I love the screen, the way it handles pictures and video as well as music, and the overall "feel" of the device is quite solid (although a little heavy for jogging).  The only issue that I have (and the only reason I give it four stars instead of five) is that the player won't sync using the Windows Media Player - you need to use the Zune player.  I don't WANT another player on my computer!!! I don't want Real Player, I don't want Quicktime or itunes or winamp, or whatever.  I just want one player that does everything.  It's quite frustrating that after I rip a CD onto my computer using the Media Player, I need to open a different piece of software to copy the files to the Zune.  I just can't figure out why they would do that.  Other than this one complaint, it's as close to a "perfect" music player as you can get.

<Title>Huge MS fan  hates Zune: No Folders! No Drag & Drop!
<Date>Sat Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm a soldier preparing to deploy sometime in the (non-specified) future to a non-specified middle-eastern country currently the center of our fight with certain insurgents.  Along with 29 other soldiers, I was given a Zune as part of an intensive Arabic language course running for about 20 weeks. I guess the idea will be that we'll use them with our language CDs to study.  Of course when I installed the Zune on my Vista laptop, it grabbed every file, including some pictures I VERY MUCH did not want on an Army Zune (if you get my meaning). Deleting these files was a way bigger ordeal than it should have been.  OK, now to the real problem: No folders for non-music audio files or videos. I listen to many podcasts on my $70 cheapo MP3 player, which has an SD slot, acts as a data file storage device and also lets me browse via folder as well as ID3 tag.  What was MS thinking when they absolutely, intentionally handicapped this device? They had to go out of their way to prevent a user from sorting and browsing files by folder on the device.  I was annoyed at first there was no support within the Zune software for synching/auto-downloading podcasts, but I bit my tongue and installed a third party app and had the zune software monitor the new "podcast" folder I created.   After my first sync I realized it simply dumps all the audio files into the "music" catagory. So now I have to go digging through thousands of files (many of the podcast files have cryptic filenames related to the date, etc) to try and find a podcast to listen to, way to much trouble.  So the Zune will stay in my backpack while I use the far better cheapo MP3 player which let's me drag and drop files and folders via Windows explorer then find them on the device with ease.  Unbelievable from MS, who I constantly defend and support, this thing really sucks. Glad I didn't spend a dime on one.

The unit works so well that I cancelled my satellite radio subscription and I rarely listen to the local FM radio stations anymore.The sound is excellent even for the older songs like the Beatles. I got over 1,000 songs programmed and I still have about 23 GB of room left. 30 GB goes a long way. You can even listen to albums in their entirety or just listen to the songs randomly. The album cover art will stay lit with the home docking unit.You can also put songs in a folder  where you can make your own playlist....you be the DJ!

The marketplace is the worse software i've ever used. And with a screen this size,you would think they would have video. Instead you have to buy pricey 3rd party software to put video on it. No podcast no video no movies or tv shows on the marketplace. Well made player but crappy marketplace. Stay far away from this.

<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm not an idiot. The Zune had a modest rating, throughout the net, of about a 3. Right in the middle. I figured that the 1's were Apple Fanboys and the 5's were Microsoft Fanboys. I also assumed that buying a Zune would be one of the smartest buys of my life. It was 200 bones, looked fire with that big screen, and would go great with my surf-themed everything (with a brand spaking new surf-themed background). It was all working out.  I gave it a chance. I installed it. I transfered all my music (THE MOST STRENUOUS COMPUTER ANYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE), let the Zune install 9 programs into my computer, whatever, I gave it a chance. When I get my wallpaper ready, fix my songs, and get ready for playback, I realized I had made the worst mistake of my life.  Why was my 2gig pc lagging out? Why did the Zune still say it was syncing, when it wasn't? Why is my perfect sized background pixelated to hell? Why do I have to plug and unplug my Zune everytime I make a change? Why can't I just drag and drop? Why is there even a Wi-Fi option? Why is the Zune Marketplace Interface so obnoxiously slow? And Ugly? And useless? and so useless? Why are the headphones so gaudy?  WHY DID I BUY THIS?  Needless to say; It sucked hard. I anticipated this product. I sat at home waiting for it all day. I wanted to like it; I did. But it sucked. After 2 hours of messing with it, I was happy that I left everything in place because it was ready for a trip back to the amazon warehous.  Don't be fooled by the internet. Part of the iPod's appeal is that it is freaking easy (not for computer idiots like my grandparents) so that is is freaking fast. The Zune isn't. Save your money for that new iPod that's coming out or something. But for the love of god do not buy this product on anylevels. It is garbage.  On the brightside, I got a refund. So 5 stars for Amazon, 1 for the Zune.

<Title>...to Zune or not to Zune ...
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a white Zune recently, mainly because it was on sale at a decent price (I believe the next Zune version is coming out soon.)  Here's my impression:  1. The unit is fairly small, thin & light enough to fit in the pocket. It appears well-built. 2. The screen is clear, nice & good size - about 3" at 32040/65k color. 3. Some non-techie people may have difficult time using the software initially. It's not very intuitively designed.  You should have an Internet connection for installation & current firmware updates. 4. Since your machine does not recognize Zune as an external storage device (there's a registry hack for this), you will have to "sync" all your Zune contents via the supplied software. 5. The sound quality is good.  The earbuds came with the Zune are OK. There are better earphones out there if you want to plunge.  6. The battery life seems average.  Audio listening lasts around 10+ hrs  depending on your usage & settings (I turn the Wifi off, don't use EQ often & put it in "sleep mode" when not in use - pressing back/down combination.)   Charging takes about 2 hrs - either via USB connection to your computer or an external wall charger (not included.) I purchased the nice "DLO Power Kit", comes with wall & car adapter, plus USB cable, I'd recommend this kit.  Additionally, to prolong the Lithium-ion battery life, I would recharge it BEFORE the battery is depleted completely.

<Title>Not worth the money
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I run a computer classroom, and I have kids brining in iPods all the time.  They work seamlessly with our computers for music and for use as external drives.    I have had one kid bring in a Zune.  Their mom got it for them because it was cheaper than the iPod and you could share songs for free, she said excitedly.  Of course, she didn't know about the three day or three play limit on your... um... squirting of songs from Zune to Zune.  That was a disappointment for her.  Well, I played with the Zune.  It is heavier than an iPod, bulkier, and just not as classy.  The fake click wheel looking button navigation system felt very cheap.  It was like one of those little 99 buck MP3 players I have had kids bring in... Not something that should be on a device over 200 bucks.  We also couldn't get the thing to work right as an external drive.  She had to move some files, and ended up using her neighbors iPod.    I was not a fan of the Zune.  And the Marketplace where you buy music for it just didn't function as well as iTunes.  Heck, old versions of iMesh and EDonkey were more elegant.  We use iTunes and iPods a lot in my lab for all sorts of musical needs..  The Zune has no place in there... or in my pocket.

<Title>Microsoft Mulitmedia Flop
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you were thinking about buying a Zune, don't. I will admit, I was excited when the Zune was released, it looked like it had a great design, spent a good amount of time in development, would link to my XBox 360, had a larger screen than an iPod, and was, well, Microsoft. The hardware, itself, seems to be a solid piece of equipment (I've had mine for about a month, now, and have not had a single problem with the device), the problem arises with the software.   The Zune software is, undoubtedly, the weakest point of this system; I have had nothing but problems, ever since I first installed it. The software only recognizes my Zune intermittently, at best, even when it shows up fine on the device manager. The only way I have managed to consistently be able to load music or videos onto my device was to uninstall, and then reinstall, the software, while my Zune is connected, which takes about an hour to install and check for updates, plus any time it takes to load your media onto your device, since the software will wipe your Zune upon reinstallation. Also, the library has a tendency to mysteriously disappear, leaving you with no way to load media, since the software will not find any.   Overall, this is a useless piece of junk. I just bought an iPod classic, since I have never had an issue with past iPods or iTunes, and will post my Zune on ebay, for the person unfortunate enough to buy this horrible product. Microsoft, thanks, but no thanks.

<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't get MIcrosoft they think this Zune can take over the Ipod. Who would wan't to buy a bulky player that looks like that old classic football game from the 80s or like something they gave away on Let's Make a Deal. Why  did they pick the color of dookie as a color option. Another stupid thing about this is that you can't use Microsoft's own Media Player or music from other places like itunes and such, you have to download Zune's music and player. Also why is it that you can't use this on a Mac. But if you own a Mac you would wan't to buy a Ipod which comes in different sizes, colors and GB storage. It takes such a long time for the Zune to transfer you music files from your media player to Zune's one.  That sharing music between other Zune's is lame as well becasue how many people do you know that even own a Zune. So what if this has a radio there is nothing great on the radio anyways. If you wan't to buy a mp3 player get a ipod there is a reason there the top selling one and no i am not a Mac/Ipod  fanboy or a employee of Apple.

<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like to go against the grain, and I've personally never liked the look of the iPod anyway, so a went with Zune. I had no problems with installation of the software or syncing my music. Operation is so easy it comes with no manual. The interface is super-intuitive and simple to use. The large screen looks great, and the sound is good.  A few cons to the player, none of which are a deal-breaker for me. I don't mind the Zune software, but I prefer using Windows Media Player and I don't see why you can't sync directly from WMP, considering it is nearly identical to the Zune software except for the skin. In addition, the stylish squared edges of the player make it a little less comfortable to hold, so it's not for runners or anyone looking to walk around holding their player constantly. Also there aren't a lot of accessories out there for Zune, but I found a lot of great stuff on Ebay as far as cases and chargers go.  So all in all, I'm very happy with my Zune. It's a simple player, I've never had any problems using it, and IMO its design is a lot more interesting than the iPod, particularly those ugly little dwarf iPod Nanos they just put out.

<Content>Hi! I bought one last May, and it worked fine for the first 2 weeks. Then, it started freezing when playing songs, no reason at all, it just hanged.. So I tried different things, and seems to work for a while..   But one day after I had used it, put it in my nightstand (not charging) , when I went to use it the screen was cracked. There was a crack in the middle of the screen, but the screen cover was intact. There was a blob of black right in the middle of the screen. Of course, I couldn't see anything. So I called Microsoft, and they say it's not covered by warranty.. I was astounded, it's not like I dropped it or anything, I am very meticulous. After going a round with the customer service rep, I did some research on the internet. Seems I was not the only one with the problem and it is apparently common...  I guess Microsoft just sent me back to Apple, never had a problem with the ipods..

<Content>Just got the Zune, and it rocks to the bone. I had an ipod classic 80gb black, and it sucked. The ipod treated all my videos as 'Movies', and my poor thumb couldn't push the wheel thru even 2 pages of listings. It was horrible. The Zune is powerful, and smarter than almost anyone knows. It rocks, I said. I have 3800 songs, and 190 music videos on it, and there's still 4Gb of space available. The interface and menus are delicious to use, and it works SO good. The 3-inch display works so good, that i'd never think apple again. A big shout for Microsoft & their Zune invention. The Zune loads all Windows Media library very easily & quickly into the Zune memory, and Zune provides so much artwork for the music content, that it's a real dream experience. Also, the videos play widescreen on the 3-inch display, so deluxe is the video viewing. Hats off to Zune, and their Microsoft parent, for making available this great, great player.

<Content>Okay i got my zune, early July. Now i converted from the first click-wheel gen iPod to this here zune because mine finally broke.  Now i was skeptical but for all the music i had i needed something big and an 80gb was out of the question so i looked at several players and not only was this one the cheapest but it was also the most battery efficient and you got more bang for your buck.  Not saying that the iPods are bad, oh no, they are great but they haven't changed. The zune, i think, is the next step to where the PMP (portable media player) should go. Only flaw is the movie compatibility, that is all

<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was very nervous at first especially after reading a lot of the reviews, but this was my experience.    I had done some reading and thought it best to follow Microsoft's suggestion of downloading the Zune software from their website....yeah...that didn't work.  Fortunately they send a copy on disk which started the 3 step process. 1. insert disk 2. plug in Zune to your computer 3. sync  I'm not kidding, it was that easy.  I'm not a techie but I do know a little about electronics, but still...  So what if the Zune marketplace is windows media player with a twist.  I don't care that the hard drive reserves some space so that it can operate.  I don't worry about the bulkiness of the Zune.  It is a device that does what I want it to do.  I want it to hold my music library in its entirety and have enough power to last me through the work day, and it does exactly that.    One suggestion...if you decide to buy a case or protective cover...Zune does lack in accessories, but a hard drive case made by Case Logic works very well.  Not only does it protect, but it holds my zune, earphones, cassette adapter and power cord.    Enjoy...

Trust me, the Zune is way better! It lets you share music, see the album cover,---it lets you do so many things...Oh, and another one of my favorite things is that it has a radio. I love that! The only thing I wish was that there were more colors to choose from, but apart from that, the Zune definitely is the best choice! Buy it! I promise you wont regret it!!!

I had previously ripped all my CDs (3300 songs worth) into itunes and the zune software converted my entire library and uploaded it to the zune in a matter of a few hours.  I like the control (the ipod button annoys me) and the radio feature works well.  The only complaint that I have about the zune is the lack of supporting accessories at this point.

I did try doing troubleshooting, and tech support but to no avail the zune did not respond.   So what did we learn today, all you gotta do is look up ^

<Title>Supa Dupa!!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune is amazing!!  The screen is fantastic!  Many say it is too pixilated but i find that it easy to view at arms length. So you can easily view movies while resting it in your lap. Whereas the ipod and zen screens tend to be a bit cramped.  Navigation is great.  Very intuitive. I found that it was the easiest to use out of its competition.  Its set up in such a way that you don't really have to think about where you're trying to go, you just move over to it.  The menu is arranged vertically and when you select a field the menu you were just in is displayed horizontally at the top of the screen, above the menu you just entered, which is displayed vertically below.  So you can move left and right through your previous menu. The cool thing with the zune is the slide show animation when switching through the menus.  It makes it look very fluid.  Also being able to set your own background it pretty neat and amazingly simple.  All the cool slide transitions work even with your custom picture.  To set a picture as a background is put it on zune software and then view the picture on the zune, press the middle button, and select apply as background. When playing a song the zune displays a huge picture of the album artwork dominating the screen instead of a little thumbnail as in the ipod. The wi-fi feature is great for sharing pictures.  Transmission is almost instantaneous. A lot of people dislike the fact that the zune doesn't have a scroll wheel like the ipod.  Personally I'm glad it doesn't have it because with my ipod I found that if I stuck my hand in my pocket to get it I would sometimes crank the volume all the way up when I brushed against the scroll wheel. The radio is nice to and it pulls the song info and station out of the transmission just like a nice car radio or satellite  radio. Finally the zune has a huge "coolness" factor.  Having an mp3 player that tends to be unique and not the norm creates a lot of, "Wow! Is that a zune?" Sounds cheesy but I've had four people in the last two weeks say exactly that. Oh and some people have said that they have had problems getting their zune to work with windows.  They say that their computer didn't recognize it.  When you first get you're zune the battery is completely flat. So when you install the zune software you may have to wait almost 5 - 10 mins with it plugged in for your computer to recognize it.  The zune just doesn't have enough power to communicate with you're comp.  The same runs true with an ipod except when you fist get one it has partial charge.  If you completely discharge an ipod you will have to wait for it to get some power as well.  It is better to disregard the setup instructions and skip looking for a device, just continue installing and when complete leave the software open, then plug in your zune.  Trust me there are no complications whatsoever for this is what i did. Syncing the zune is really fast.  Copying 5 gigs of data takes about 30 mins.  Thats really fast, almost 10 megabytes a second, or about two songs a second.  Some people have incorrectly said that you need to create a zune sync list, this is false and the software can be a bit misleading.  If you just hit start sync it will automatically sync your entire collection.  You only use the sync list if you want to sync specific songs.

<Content>This is such a great mp3 player!!! I had high expectations for this mp3 and they were highly exceeded!!   This has great sound, a radio, great color, and a terrific format. If you need an mp3 player this should be the one you get.  The only con I can think of is that it has to charge from the pc, and you cannot delete a song from the player unless you use the program that comes with the mp3 player (cd).

<Title>Great value; Doesn't beat the iPod, but isn't beaten either
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>THE GOOD: Flashy presentation, such as the ability to set backgrounds and change themes. Unlike the iPod, and as proprietary as the Zune and its software is, it still allows the user to copy media FROM the device to the computer, even photos. The ability to rewind backwards into previous tracks. Large screen. Hard plastic casing that is not as prone to scratching or smudging as the iPod. Playback, both audio and video, is excellent. Easy to navigate interface. FM radio. Multiple media formats supported (Audio: MP3, AAC, M4A, WMA; Video: WMV, MPEG-4, some MOV). Battery life is decent, as good as most hard-drive based media players. Available in more colors than other products.   THE BAD: Only choice is 30GB (maybe not such a bad thing for those who don't need to tote their entire 100GB library everywhere). Zune's software is not as self-explanatory as iTunes, and lacking in some of iTunes' conveniences (such as drag-and-drop syncing, and the ability to edit synced media's info). No gapless playback between songs. Can't be used as an external hard drive (but with only 30GB to spare, why would you want to?). Zune is about as proprietary as it gets - it can only be used with its software; no Windows Media Player, Napster, etc. (thankfully the software is of good quality) The screen, though larger, is the same resolution as the iPod's. No AVI support (conversion is required).   Overall the Zune is a solid, sturdy device with a great interface that's easy to use and will please the eye as well as the ears. If your not looking to pay for more than 30 GB of storage but want something of a "true" video player (3 inch widescreen or above), then this would be a well-rounded pick over a 30GB iPod (Zune may have limitations on supported file formats, but it beats iPod in that department anyday). However, some choices in software and firmware design do leave one scratching their head. Its unfortunate that unlike the iPod, (as of yet) there is no clock, no gapless playback, no games, and no ability to edit the info of media already synced to the device (such as name and artwork).   I hadn't mentioned the limited WiFi (Zune-to-Zune song sharing) because, as said by countless reviewers, it falls short of being a plus, is not altogether a bad thing, but is disappointing nonetheless. My guess is a full-blown WiFi experience complete with wireless syncing, wireless shopping, and even wireless web surfing would require different hardware, drive up the price, and take away from the original point of the machine. But that's just a guess. We'll have to see what future firmware updates offer.   At just around $200, this is a value.

<Title>Zune or Ipod?
<Date>Mon Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>By now, most have made up their mind about the Zune.  Here recently, I was looking for a 30 gig player and not being much of an Apple-guy, I was down to this or the Creative Zen Vision.  I've owned a Creative Zen Microphoto (loved it) and a Zen V Plus (wasn't too happy with it).  While I liked the design (the clunkiness didn't bother me) of the Vision M, the Zune won me over.  I liked the fact that it was a little more rugged and I liked the d-pad set-up.  I need something that's going to be a little more prone to abuse than something with such a sleek design.  I've read many of the reviews here about the Zune, did some more searches and decided that it was best to fit my needs.    I've been very happy with my choice.  Installing the software was a breeze and the fact that there was no manual actually made me have to figure everything else out on my own.  I'm not a big tech-geek so this fact alone speaks volumes about the cleverness of Microsoft deciding not to package a manual.  Wow.  It's actually user-friendly.  The interface is cool to look at and simple to use.  It's also a nice feature to be able to customize your background and take fuller advantage of the three inch screen.  Video playback is very smooth and the sound (be it through your earbuds or through your car sterio) is awesome.  I've been happy all-around.    I guess the only thing I have to gripe about would be that much like the Ipod, the only way to transfer music (that I know of, anyway) is through the included software.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  This is very much a worthy competitor to the Ipod.  For the diehard Ipod person, this won't change their minds, but to those who are indifferent, they'll be pleasantly suprised with the Zune.

<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I haven't owned any other mp3 players before this and wasn't really looking for one, but when i came across a price mistake on the zune i decided to buy it. Overall i like it and am glad i took the chance buying it.  With 750 gig drives commonplace, 30 gigs might not seem like a lot, but it is plenty if you actually pay for your media. I put every CD i own on it and didn't even fill it half way. Nonetheless, if you are downloading hundreds of gigs of content every month you might find it limiting.  The software isn't anything special but i also have had no major problems with it either. My biggest complaint is that you cannot maintain control and functionality of your zune when you plug it into your computer with the software running. The zune instantly stops playing and goes into sync mode. I haven't messed with the zune marketplace very much but i do know, like at the apple store, it costs too much money to buy an album. I think that the $.99 a song should be lowered to about $.49 a song. It just doesn't seem right that to buy the an entire album it costs roughly what it does in the local music store. When they basically cost the same, i would rather have a physical copy that sits on my shelf. I would be interested in buying TV shows and movies from the marketplace, but unfortunately that isn't available at the present time.   The wifi could have been great and useful, but instead its lame and crippled. I highly doubt i will ever use it in its present form. The three use limits might make sense for stuff you buy from them, but it shouldn't limit what i create myself. About the only good thing about the wifi is that it might indicate what is to come in the future; hopefully they will eventually add features like streaming internet content over wifi and syncing over wifi in. The wifi, as it exists today, seems to useless and added for marketing purposes.   You are not able to use the zune as file storage and that is a big disappointment.   The zune could have been great overall but unfortunately it is not. It is, however, great at playing MP3s and viewing pictures. I am not sure why Microsoft chose to cripple the wifi in the way they did but i am positive that their market share will reflect this decision. The zune could have been, and hopefully will eventually be, much more than it is today.

<Title>Excellent product, minor annoyances
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this Zune for my girlfriend because she wanted a portable media player but hates how iTunes works. I've thought that Zunes sounded pretty decent but wasn't really excited to get one for myself.  After hers came in the mail, I helped her set everything up and while I was doing so I was messing around with the features. I instantly knew I had to get one. The very same night I ordered the Halo 3 Zune. The interface is extremely intuitive, it is has a comfortable feel holding it in hand, and despite the numbers you might see in measurements between it and the iPod, the difference is not bad. Yes, it is bigger. But the bigger screen more than makes up for that fact.  The Zune software was a bit of a struggle since I'd been using iTunes and my iPod for so long. Once I figured out how to operate all the features in the software it became very easy to put together my library and start syncing. It feels much less complicated while still maintaining most of the features of iTunes.   The only complaints that I have are very minor but they still take away from the feeling of just plugging it in and having it work. One is the "manuals" that are inlcuded with the Zune. I have to say it that way because they are nothing more than leaflets with some pictures and a few lines of text that do not give very much detail. I really like the wireless feature that is built in to share songs but as of right now, the 3 plays/3 days idea is crippling what would be a wonderful system. Although, this might be fixed with a later firmware update, but I'm not going to hold my breath for that one. Another is the battery life. While its not a horribly short battery life I certainly feel like I shouldn't be running it as long as I do. I am able to make it home at the end of the day with just barely enough juice to watch a half hour TV show on it.  There is a trick that is not included in the manual which is, instead of putting it into standby by pressing and holding the Play/Pause button press and hold the down arrow until it reaches the bottom of the screen(easiest at the main menu) then press and hold the back button. This will completely shut off the device but will not save where you were last at.  It will, however, keep your battery from slowly being drained all day while your not even using it.  Those are the worst of the complaints. Others are so minor that they aren't even worth bringing up. I would definitely recommend the Zune over an iPod. I used to have an iPod so I've had a good opportunity to compare the features of both. Having done that the Zune is a much better alternative to the iPod. The iPod is a good product but it doesn't quite meet my needs for a media player. I am also not a big fan of Apple so it is nice to break the connection to them for good and stay true to my Microsoft roots.

<Title>Soo close! But still light years ahead of the iPod.
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ahh...the Microsoft Zune. I was looking to replace my 8gb Creative Micro Photo. The Zune with its large screen, multimedia features and 30gb seemed the natural choice.   Right out of the box (awesome packaging) the Zune felt great. Even though it's larger than the iPod, it just felt.....right. Not to heavy, nice textile feel. It feels solid. But, first things first, installation of the software. Here's where things went down hill. I first set up the Zune on my work PC, it went without a hitch. As soon as I tried installing the software on my laptop is when the massive cluster began. Both the CD version and the downloadable version of the software stalled. It took about 2hrs of fooling around before the install completed. And I should note my laptop is fully updated and runs flawlessly, it definitely wasn't a software problem on my end.  The software is an absolute joke. It basically installs what seams to be almost another copy of windows media player. Why Microsoft didn't give the user say.... an option to install Zune plugin for the existing media player is beyond me. And the software is absolutely a must. You need to install it to get the Zune to work. Creative really has the edge in this department. With all their players you can access the HD through my computer and drag and drop files. The software is always optional. I highly recommend any owner go to www.zuneboards.com. They offer user created hacks and utilities that "unlock" the player to play pretty much any type of music and video file, even eBooks and PDFs. I personally downloaded 2 hacks to allow me direct access to the HD and allow for different video formats.  Another downside of the software is its way to complicated. You have to "Name" you're Zune, create a windows Live ID and all this other nonsense. God forbid I just wanna load it up with music and jet. It actually links itself to a kind of "Main" computer. If you take you're Zune and decide to install it on another PC you have to do the registration process all over again and it deletes all your media. It's definitely way more complicated then it has to be, especially considering that we're talking about an MP3 player. And that whole Marketplace using "Microsoft Points" is another boner. But, if you're paying for music these days you're a chump anyway.  So, as you can tell the software is an absolute bear. But once I got it up and running it was great. Transferred all my selected files over and it was trouble free. The only thing I spent some time with was the videos. It takes some tweaking to figure out the right codec and bit rate to get the most out of your videos. I used a program called "Alive Video Converter" to basically convert any file format to WMV or MP4. It also lets you adjust the resolution, video and audio bit rate.  The screen is big and bright and everything looks great. I especially like the fact that the album art takes up pretty much the whole screen.  I haven't used the FM tuner at all. I can't imagine why anyone really would. The WiFi feature is pretty gimmicky. I can't see myself really using it that often. And if I did it would be more for sending pictures. Maybe I if I lived in an urban environment....  All in all this is a great high end MP3 that tries a little too hard. I would definitely buy this instead of an iPod. It's cheaper, more flexible, has better build quality and a lot more options as far as media types.  You might also consider the new Creative 30gb player.

<Title>Software doesn't work with some versions of Windows XP Media Center
<Date>Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Can't tell you how good the player is because I could never get the software to install.  Inserted disk and was told that I needed to upgrade either the software or my operating system.  Further investigations led me to the Zune website where I found out that any version of XP Media Center other than the 2005 version will not work with the Zune player, and that the 2005 edition required an upgrade to "Rollup 2".  Well my version of Media Center is the 2005 edition but this was not recognized and Rollup 2 would not install.  It is absolutely beyond logic to me that Microsoft cannot design a MP3 player with software that will work with all versions of its crappy operating systems, especially those that are only a few years old.  It's even more baffling to me considering that XP Media Center is nothing more than the standard XP with a few extra features, but it's still XP at the core.  I've installed and used software for IPod and Creative players and have had absolutely no problem with their software working with my OS.  Only Microsoft could screw this up.  Needless to say, I quickly repackaged the Zune and returned it to the store and bought a Creative Zen player instead.  Works great, looks awesome, and software installs with no problem.

It was so easy to set-up, I don't mind that it's not paper light or as small as other Mp3 players because I really enjoy the larger viewing screen, especially when watching videos and movies on it. It's slips easily into my back pocket when I go for a walk or cut the lawn, or it fits well in the case I bought for it.

<Title>Sweet Little Hi-Fi
<Date>Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had owned a Dellpod (Dell's version of an MP3 player) for two years and found it to be a solid piece of hardware.  So when it died a respectable death a few months ago, I went back to Dell to see if they had a newer version of their MP3 player... but they had decided to pull out of that market.  I ended up reading review after review of Zune v. iPod.  Also looked around at other options from Creative Labs.  Eventually, I settled on the Zune because... well... I liked the brown color.    As shallow as that may seem, I should point out that my original criteria was not based on brands, but functionality and dependability.  Creative, Apple and Microsoft all have great products with respective pros and cons.  So when I checked each MP3 player out, I realized that there wasn't a clear winner.  So I decided on the player that I found most appealing.  After two months of Zune ownership, I really enjoy it!  My only problem is the software for loading songs onto your player.  When loading songs, you have to be careful on your tags because the slightest difference in the files will cause the songs to not be properly grouped together.  For example: I had 10 songs by John Lennon.  9 songs were tagged identically, but the 10th one had a different year than the other nine... so the player displayed two albums instead of one.  The lesson learned is: check all the boxes of the song's properties to make sure everything is identical for proper song grouping.  The software is also a memory eater.  Too bad Microsoft couldn't integrate their Media Player with the Zune Player.  To me, that would appear to be the simplest solution... but then, I don't work at Microsoft.  Ultimately, the device is fun, the search function of the player is well done, and the sound is clear... a very solid product!

<Content>The Zune is a beautiful device. Compared to the iPod it doesn't do much for itself but than again Apple has been making the iPod for many more years than the Microsoft with the Zune, yet to reach one full year. So in that regard iPod has a step up on Zune. If we were to compare the two at all I would look at the iPod 1st Gen and the Zune and in that respect, running the original iTunes and all I think the Zune has a step up on the competition. The Zune is not yet the iPod killer that it was dolled up by the press to look as but it does have a elegant feel once you get past the lack of a scroll wheel, which hurts my thumb anyways.   The best part I think is that for 360 owners you no longer have to store music on the cramped 360 hard drive! Also if you are buying this and own a 360 that is connected to your PC you will not need to download the Zune media software as you already have it. Microsoft has some good idea,s what with wi-fi and I think their big flaw was not making the Zune more user friendly to their current customers by allowing wi-fi connection to the 360. I was hoping that I would be able to connect my Zune via the wi-fi to my 360, thus giving me more space for other controllers to plug in. That is a flaw but it may be on the horizon, with the new fall software update for the 360 close at hand.  They have the right idea with sharing music but the problem is not theirs when artists like the Rolling Stones cannot be shared. The answer is simple and it is because some artists and or their producers do not want their songs shared at all.   This is not why I wrote this review however, I came because I wanted to tell will be buyers to hold on a little bit longer. The rumor mill is abuzz with the latest word which is that the next Gen Zune will boast a Gameboy like ability to play games yet with the PSP's memory holder, allowing you to store many games on one card. This is all bundled together with the fact that apparently all arcade games on the 360 will be supported by the Zune and you can play them on both devices. If you own an arcade game on the 360 you can transfer it to the Zune and visa versa, which will come in handy for those users who own 360s but not an XBL account.

<Title>Zune 30 GB took me a week to install software
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software for this Zune took me literally a week to install, after several calls to both the Dune technical support and Dell technical support.  On the positive side, the Dune technical support was helpful and I wasn't placed on hold for 20 minutes.  I still have to figure how to put videos on it.  S.S.

<Content>My uncle has a whole collection of ipods and my son has an ipod so I was used to them and still wanted something different. I dont mind the larger size of the zune and love the display. Videos look great and sound is very good. I use a pair of EC4 Sure headphones with it and am very happy with this combination for the price.

<Title>Surprisingly Good
<Date>Mon Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I basically bought this on a whim to replace an older iPod Video, thinking that I would buy it, see how awful it was for a few days then return it for a  Creative Zen or something.  To my surprise, Microsoft has actually put out a very good portable music player and I'm keeping it!  (Note that I said "music" player and not "multi-media" player - more in a second).  Basically here's a few things I like and dont like about the Zune:  First off:  The sound quality on the Zune is absolutely fantastic, MUCH better than the tinny / muddy sound of the iPod. Honestly I've never heard such clear crisp and well defined sound on a portable (and I've used quite a few).  So if you're looking for a music player that actually does its primary function well, hands-down the Zune is the choice for you if sound quality is a priority.  Even the FM tuner is stunning with crystal clear reception and CD quality sound.  The supplied earbuds are also very high quality.    Second: The interface.  Similar to other players, you can sort by artist, genre, song title, or do a shuffle.  Its pretty easy to navigate through.   At first I thought I would miss the scroll whell, until I remembered how touchy that stupid thing was on my iPod; I'd always overshoot my choice by one selection.  Here, you just navigate in the four directions.  One suggestion to MS...it would be nice to be able to scroll by letter, then by title.  To get to the S's for example, you have to hold the button down until the cursor gets there.  Would be nice to scroll sideways to S, and then down to my selection.  But as it is, its not much more time consuming then an iPod search.  Also, whats awesome is the Zune has a dedicated Back and Play/Pause button.  I just wish one of these players would have dedicated volume controls so that I can adjust volume while viewing pictures or something.    Third: Software.  At first I was annoyed because the CD that came in the box is for everything up to XP SP2...no Vista software!  Imagine my surprise when I installed everything and my brand new Zune "is not compatible with this OS."  I was about to hop onto the phone when I saw that there was indeed a Vista version available.  Once installed its a breeze, its basically like Windows Media Player lite.  Its a very simple and slimmed down interface, which I like.  There's no clutter, no flash ads (a la Real Player) and you can get to your music quickly.  I subscribed to the Zune Pass (which is a subsciption service like Rhapsody or Napster) and so far so good - downloads are fast, the selection enormous and the sound quality of the WMA files great.   Last:  Style - Yeah, its been knocked around a bit, but honestly the Zune isnt that much bigger than the other players, its just a little thicker.  I actually like this, as the Zune feels sturdy; you know, like I could actually drop it once or twice and not shatter it (a la iPod!).  The screen is gorgeous, although I wish the resolution was a bit higher.  Alot of pictures look jagged and pixelated on the low-res / large size screen. And really its not that bad looking at all...(especially the Halo version!)   Some annoyances:  Better file support would be nice.  90% of my library is in MP3 format anyways, but I noticed it doesn't support WAV, AIFF, MP4, MOV or .h624 files.  Not that I cruise around with WAV files anyways but some stuff I do have in WAV format.  Of course you can convert it to mp3 or wma anyways so not a huge deal.  As far as video, it technically only supports .wma.  I can IMPORT .mov, .mp4. or .h264 but the zune software has to convert it to WMA, which isn't really a time-efficient option.  Also, theres no video content on the Zune Marketplace, which is surprising considering how huge the screen it...seems like a natural place for videos.  Also, the Zune does not support Audible format audiobooks, so now I have a useless collection of audiobooks I can do nothing with until MS and Audible work out who gets what percentage of my money.    No clock / Sleep timer.  Come on Microsoft, are you kidding me?  This is a given, even on the 20 dollar Coby mp3 players! Luckily I found a way around the sleep timer thing; the unit shuts off after a few minutes of inactivity, so i just make a quick playlist and when it reaches the end it shuts off.  If you like to listen to the radio at night, you're out of luck.  I don't see why a firmware upgrade cant fix this so hopefully this will change soon.    Navigating photos while playing music:  Normally the Back button takes you 'back' to what you were doing before you started navigating around.  Except when viewing photos.  Instead, if you hit the back button it takes you to the last photo you viewed, so there is no 'now playing' option on the Zune.  Again, the lack of dedicated volume controls annoys me here, since I then have to navigate through all the folders to get back to what song I'm at before I can adjust the volume.  Also, without this 'now playing' option when you select the track you're currently on, it starts it over from the beginning.    So there's my good and bad list of the Zune.  Overall I'm quite impressed with it...at Amazon's price its a steal, for the reguar retail price I would go with the Creative Zen as it simply gives you more bang for the buck.  But honestly, MS actually surprised me on this one - I think its a great alternate choice to the Apple closed-system regime.  Most of the people knocking the Zune havent even tried it I supsect.  Its too bad, most people these days are so brainwashed by Apple's marketing that they think the iPod is the only mp3 player in the world.  I think the Zune is solid and will only get better, and its about time Apple had some competition.  So if you want ad-agency created style then go with Apple, if you want a good sounding and very capable music player you cant lose with the Zune.

<Title>Decent for a Microsoft Product
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought my Zune when the first came out. It has been at least 6 months now. Over all I have to say that I am happy with the storage space. This was a contributing factor to my purchase. At the time of purchase I was comparing the Creative, iPod, and Zune models.  I had read that the navigation controls on the creative unit tend to fail often. That the displays are better and it also contained some additional features that I liked. I did not like the prospect of the navigation failing.  The iPod was another problem. The storage was the same, but more importantly it is more widely popular which means easier access to accessories. I do not down load music, I do not believe in down loading music. I have had too many computer failures. At least with my CD collection if my computer fails I can always restore my entire library. So, that said the iPod online service was not a consideration for me. I was concerned with the iPod failure rate. I can honestly say that of all the iPod users I know there are many of them that have had their firmware fail. Most of them occurred after software updates from iPod. Many of these people had owned their iPods from anywhere from a week to a year or more. That was very disconcerting to me. It is important to note, that as long as the iPod was under warranty they usually got a rebuilt unit in exchange. I just thought that a person that had one for a week would get a refund, but iPod service refused and requested they send theirs in for a refurb. That person went through 4 iPods before giving up on them all together.  I then looked at the Zune. In the electronics industry most new products tend to have a lot of quirks and problems with first generations. However, first generations will also typically have the better quality craftsmanship too. The company has not had a chance to look for cheaper parts so that they can lower the price of the product. Knowing this I was reluctant to go with the Zune, but I subsided these doubts and took a chance.  My only regret is that the battery tends to die off quickly. What ever you read online for expected battery life, it is just that EXPECTED. I have not witnessed such battery life. Depending on the timing set for the display power off feature you can have enough batter life for 1 to 3 or 4 hours. With the display on at all times expect about 45 minutes to 1 hour of battery life. With the display on auto shut off after 1 or 5 seconds expect the battery life to increase greatly. I think the most I ever got was between 3 and 4 hours.   The display is a nice feature, but if you want to use it plan on a very short battery life.  I also wish that the software for the zune did not automatically launch when you plug it into the computer. The player does not come with a charger so you have to plug it into the computer to charge the battery. When you do the software automatically starts and synchronizes with your player. This is very discouraging because it is not a short task and ties up computer resources.   It is also strongly recommended that you turn off the WiFi transmitter/receiver so that it does not drain on the battery. If you are interested in battery life I would stick to the smaller players that use regular batteries. My last iRiver player could play for a whole week of use and it used AA batteries. I would use rechargeable batteries. These larger mp3 players are like laptop computers, the batteries die off in a few years and you are stuck with a paper weight.  Speaking of resources the zune software installs these background applications. One of them is a zune launcher and another one I cannot think of the name. There is no way to remove these background applications. They will remain on the computer and take up memory. The second one I cannot remember, something to do with network, will automatically restart if you try to disable it. This is typical Microsoft Piracy and bull noising your computer.   I also would have expected some type of protective case, or carrying strap. I tend to take it with me places, or when I am working out and it has an strange awkward shape which makes carrying it uneasy.   The headset that comes with the Zune is satisfactory for standard earplugs. Any player your buy will come with ear plugs these days, this is no different.  Overall I would say that this device is decent. They have made no effort to place themselves ahead of their competitors. The player and the accessories are proprietary to Microsoft so they keep the prices high. Don't expect anything cheap, but then again most Microsoft products are a bit pricey.   At this time I cannot say that I would recommend for or against this product. I would say that you have to look at all the options and take your own considerations into account.

<Title>It is not for everyone..however, it's exactly for me.
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Does the zune sound good? yes! In a lot of people's opinion it sounds much better from the headphone out than the newest ipods. It has a warm, relaxing, revealing sound. It's the opposite from ipods neutral boring sound, which i dislike. Does the zune support every codec under the sun? No, but if it did support OGG and flac the battery life would suffer too much. So that point is moot. Is the Zune durable? you better believe it. Is the zune easy to use? As long as you update the software/firmware it is incredibly easy. What about DRM files? Only zune files but I don't care because I own my music not rent it.   So if you want a durable player, you don't mind using mp3s, you don't rent music, than the zune is for you. If youre in love with itunes or rhapsody or want a super stylish player, than it's best you stay away. However, if you own your own music than and don't care too much for style than the zune is just right for you  if this review is a little incoherent, forgive me, i've been with grandpas cough medicine all night.

<Content>The zune is overall a quality product. After unwrapping the lovely packaging, i was immediately impressed with the size of the screen. The zune plays video  flawlessly, and music is powerful and smooth. My only complaint with the zune is its battery life; I have discharged it(set it to shuffle all night long) and recharged it, only to get 8-9 hours use. Although 8-9 hours is plenty, i wish it came close to its advertised 15 or so. My other complaint is that the installer can be buggy(must have window's crappy internet explorer installed). The zune program itself can also die sometimes but this has led to no problems. Other than those mild issues, I am completely satisfied with my purchase, and i would still choose the zune over the ipod.

<Title>Zune 
<Date>Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To the point...  First off, you can program the Zune software so that it doesn't pop up when you connect your Zune player to your computer.    Go to:  &lt;Options> &lt;Sync> Deselect or select the options you want off or on.  Secondly, I read a review where the reviewer said that the Zune will not recharge unless the computer is on.  This is not true.  Your Zune will recharge without your computer being on through the USB port.  The problem for some is that the Zune did not come with a manual or guide.  However, I find the lack of a manual refreshing, because it forced me to discover the little nuances of this product on my own, which for me is fun.  When I bought mine I had problems installing the software on Vista Ultimate, but no problem installing it on XP.  After I finally got the software installed on VU, I couldn't figure out how to download music (the one gripe I do have is not being able to drag and drop from outside the Zune Media software).  Phone support for the Zune has been great.  I called in with questions twice, got right through, and the support team walked me through a resolution both times easily.  Bottome line - I love this product.  Sound quality is superb which is, as far as I am concerned the main reason to buy an MP3 player.  The battery life does suck, but at least I'm not recharging AAA batteries any more.  I teach Spin classes (Indoor Cycling) at YMCA's and Golds gyms and the Zune with its large storage and great sound is perfect for that.  Gregg J.

<Title>The Perfect Garbage
<Date>Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I should not rate it 1 star If I can rate it Zero Star.   I bought several Media players for my family. Zune is definitely deserved its terrible name. Microsoft killed Zune's perspective at the first step: it can only accept MS file format. You can not transfer your Video files in AVI format to it  unless you bought another software converter (The windows movie maker can only converter those Old avi files without new codec.) And it can only support English.   Hope MS learns a big lesson from Zune. But it seems not.

<Title>Don't Listen to Negative Reviews!
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of research before deciding to buy my MP3 player.  My last one (a Zen) was stolen and I had been looking to upgrade.  I was very excited to hear about the Zune however, many reviews that I read spoke negatively about the Zune but I decided to take a chance and buy one anyway....and let me tell you,  I don't know what they were talking about!  I love my Zune!  All the negative things such as the poor clarity of the screen, etc. are not noticeable, unless you are extremely picky.  The only so called drawbacks that I've noticed are:  the Zune Marketplace does not offer videos (you can easily get videos from another source) and the package does not come with a wall charger (one can be purchased on Amazon for under $7.00)  The things I love about my Zune are:  it is user friendly, the horizontal video feature, great sound quality, I get great reception on every radio station in my area plus it tells me what song is playing and who its by, the customizable background is fun and scrolling through to find tracks is very easy.  Overall, my Zune suits all my  portable audio visual needs and is one of the most fun pieces of technology that I own.

<Title>Very Satisfied Zune user.
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had my Zune player for roughly 5 months and am very happy with the unit.  I have been travelling a lot this summer, which means the typical bumbs and thumps of airport security and bags being knocked around.  The Zune has worked flawlessly and never shown a sign of trouble.  The sound is crisp and the screen is bright and very sharp.   Battery life is acceptable.  The interface is very simple and the controls are also very easy to learn, to the point that I can do almost anything without having to look at the Zune. All in all I am very happy with it.   The only reason I give it Four Stars instead of Five is due to the Zune Marketplace.  I have never been able to download music from the marketplace; three different hour-long sessions with tech support never resolved the issue.  Not a Zune issue, but some lame Microsoft glitch.

<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After reading many reviews and doing ALOT of research I decided to take the plunge and get a zune. I can say that this is a high quality item... I made the switch from a Philips GoGear 6GB mp3 player, and the difference between the two is astounding.  Start up was VERY simple, and it's a plus that the Zune Marketplace is Vista compatible. Synching the device was even easier. Also, the music selection is impressive, considering that the marketplace is new. So... Pros:  -Ease of startup -Huge music selection -Arrived on time from Amazon -Sound quality -Looks great... -Durable -Pretty good battery life with wifi turned off -User friendly menus -Came with a protective pouch -Firmware updates to improve quality are available  Cons: -Album art tends to be pixelated at times -Provided earbuds aren't the best of quality -There currently aren't any music videos provided by the marketplace  Overall, 5 stars, because the pros definitely make up for the few cons. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a new mp3 player.

<Title>Great player from Microsoft
<Date>Wed Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used a 4GB iPod mini for a little over 2 years before getting a Zune in April. The Zune was $[...] cheaper on [...] than the iPod, and since most of my friends had an iPod I figured I'd take the chance and go with something different. Having used it for about 4 months now, I can say that I am pleased with the product that Microsoft has put out. Better than the iPod? I really can't say, but the Zune is definitely worth the pricetag.  The Zune is made of a durable plastic that feels very solid. I've dropped mine on the floor of the bus a couple times and there's not even a blemish or scratch. It also does not attract fingerprints the way an iPod does. The screen is a different story, so I bought a clear overlay for it to keep the prints off. The navigation circle is good although you have to actually press it down (hold it to scroll through your music faster).  The Zune's interface is very nice, better than the iPod in my opinion. Pushing left and right lets you switch between searching through artists, genres, albums, songs, etc. Pushing up and down scrolls through these options. This makes finding the song you want a breeze. Same goes with videos too, as you can look through only music videos, or movies, or TV shows. The Zune's also got an FM radio, a nice screen that displays the album artwork brilliantly, and of course limited wi-fi music and photo sharing.  There are a few problems I have with the Zune though. First is the lack of a clock. It's fairly minor, but it's pretty annoying to have to reach into my pocket and grab my cell phone to find out what time it is, whereas with the iPod I could just take a peek at the screen. Second is the Zune software. Although it does the job, it cannot even come close to competing with iTunes. I was also very disappointed to find out that the Zune does  not come with a wall charger. So if you're on vacation, you'll have to either chug along a computer with you just to charge your Zune each night. Either that or you can buy a separate charger. It's an essential that I think Microsoft should have included.  Other than that, there are really no drawbacks to the Zune. I'm really can't say that the Zune is better or the iPod is better. Both have their advantages and drawbacks, and you can't go wrong with either one. But if you want to have something different that what 90% of your friends have, the Zune is definitely worth a try. An excellent investment.

<Title>Great little piece of kit
<Date>Sat Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't know about the IPOD, never had one, but I was given a Zune by my wife for Xmas and have not been disappointed with it.  Picture is good, 30GB is more than enough room, no issues with function or interaction with my computer (which is a 2002 Presario, not too top of the line anymore), and ease of use.  I can't give it 5 stars because I have not been able to find the accessories out there that would a completely versatile solution for modern living, like a reliable car adapter, and the thing didn't come with an instruction manual which I thought was pretty poor. We all take high speed internet for granted these days.  I don't know what the standard is for battery life, but mine seems to hold up rather well, and trips across the Pacific (all the way) have not been interupted by the need to recharge or shut off. But for music, which is what I use it for, the thing is blinding, and I can't complain about the movies or pictures I put on it either.  There are some good accessories out there like the speck cases, it's easy to use, and has a good sized window.  Maybe I am not right brained enough to fully appreciate the Ipod, but the Zune was fairly intuitive.  If  you are a diehard Apple person, or loved your friends Ipod, then by all means go with what works.  I couldn't stand the Gameboy look of the thing, didn't want to say "Ipod" like it was a status symbol whenever I pulled the thing out, and found the Zune to be quite good for what I wanted to use it for which was music, a portable photo album, and short video clips that made me laugh.  Again, I recommend it.

<Content>oh come on this 'zune' crap is just a thicker, bulkier, uglyer, vesion of the bestselling mp3 player the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPNDEG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Apple 30 GB iPod video Black (5.5 Generation)</a> this has no acsessories that are any good and the softwear only works with windows. the ipod is the same price (when neither the ipod nor the zune are on sale) but has 1000 times the acsessories. with the ipod theres a product that gives it a 8.5 inch screen way bigger than this peice of crap and also with the ipod you can download the music quick. with another product you can make the ipods screen a vitual 60 inches with the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J3AWQA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">I-Theater Head Mounted Display (HMD) ITheater</a> when microsoft tried with the zune they fell flat on there faces. the zune only has like 2 hours of battery life when watching movies when the 80 gig ipod has about 6 hours of movie. thats like 3 times more. if i put pros and cons there would be no pros and thousnads of cons.                    pros  nothing                   cons big bulky short battery life not many acsessories  copied design from what looks to be from the ipod  only comes in 30 gig thicker  than a 80 gig ipod  ugly  softwear not availible for macs from reveiws it sounds like the softwear dosnt always work  takes a long time to download videos the first version means lots of other flaws that will take years to fix

<Title>Nice
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros:  Looks great, very durable.  Holds a TON.  Software is fairly easy to use.  Lets you chose your background.  A fairly long battery life. Large screen.    Cons: So freakin Proprietary.  Does not support drag and drop or windows media player so to upload you HAVE to install the zune software.  Does not support avi format so you have to convert anything you want to put on it.  Also forget any songs you bought on windows market place because it will not recognize them.  Does not connect with internet or comp over wifi and only supports uploads from zune to zune and those only last for 3 plays or 3 days.    It takes a while to get used to flipping the screen sideways to view movies but it is worth it.  I make it all sound bad but look again at my rating.  It has a lot of cons but the Ipod has many of the same so overall, I like it.  The only one I think MAY be better is the Zen M but that has a smaller screen and is thicker.

<Title>Just as crappy as Microsoft Word and Windows
<Date>Mon Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I USED to have Zune for about a month until I couldn't stand it anymore. It was buggy and songs would get deleted and just wouldn't work at all. Then I got an iMac and decided to just buy an iPod. THANK GOD!  Finally I just threw the Zune in the garbage after Microsoft wouldn't do anything to fix it. I don't understand why people try to avoid iPods. They work 1,000 times better than anything else. Whether or not you like Apple is not an issue; they're just a big, evil, faceless corporation like Microsoft and any other computer company. So what? They have better MP3 players, and that's the point! They are a better deal for how well they work, as well as their reliability and durability.   Just to put it simply; don't waste your money on cheap junk like this. Just get an iPod and you will be happy :) Now I am happy and thoughts of Zune murder are not on my mind!

<Title>WOW!! Apple iWHAT?
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have to say that iam a person who doesnt like to waste money and therefore likes to do research before a purchase, and therefore when I decided to upgrade mp3 players I didnt know whether to get another Ipod (I have a nano) or to try the new Zune. Well, I have read many of the reviews on here about how bad zunes are and how faulty the software is, but decided to try something different from the ipod. Well, to say the least I think the people who are complaining about how bad the Zune is and its malfunctioning should look at themselves before they blame the machine..This is the greatest Mp3 player ever, better than the Ipod, and I owned Ipods since they came out. The software and hardware is incredible. The 3 inch screen is awesome and iam quite impressed by the integretion of a radio tuner as well in the Zune...I could go on for hours about things the Zune has the Ipod doesnt...Well, the Ipod does have a clock and games, but I would rather have a radio tunes than a clock, thats what I have a watch for...Needless to say, great job Microsoft!

<Title>doesn't work
<Date>Tue Aug 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I ordered this and tried to sync it to computer etc with no success.   Called the company and was on the phone with techs for two hours to try to fix the issues which they constinued to insinuate that it was something I was doing wrong.    After two or three tries they finally decided that it was defective.   They said that they would send me packing materials to return it and after they received it they would iether repair or replace it.    Told me it would take 3 to 4 weeks after they received it and that they could nto guarantee color.   (I said that was not acceptable as I had paid extra to get red)   I asked if I could get a refund and they said no.  soooo   I called Amazon and they took it right back and issued a credit to my card. I then order the IPOD and it works perfectly.

<Title>STAY AWAY FROM ZUNE!!
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchased a ZUNE (less than six weeks ago), plugged it in last night to charge and woke up this morning with a cracked LED screen.  Because it was over the 30 day return policy, the store I purchased it at told me, "Sorry, SOL.  Try Microsoft."  Microsoft basically told me I was SOL.  They admitted that "if there were a hairline crack in the screen, the battery basically heats up and causes the screen to crack completely."  The support guys final reply, "Not Microsoft's fault, each unit is tested before shipping.  It would be speculation to say that maybe the unit was purchased like that. Not our problem"    So now I am stuck with a very expensive Zune that is useless.

<Title>Not good with podcast management...
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was quite disappointed in the podcast management of this item.  I listen/watch about 30 podcasts per week, and keeping them all organized and figuring out which ones I had listened to/watched was the most annoying thing.  I ended up returning the Zune and purchasing an Ipod just for the ease of keeping track of podcasts that I have.  If you are wanting to use lots of podcasts, this may not be the best item for you.  But if you are just going to have music/videos on it, then it should be fine.

<Title>content w/ purchase
<Date>Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought then Zune about two months ago and so far it has served me well.  I needed something I could take to the gym on a daily basis that would hold a good chunk of my music collection.  It fits comfortably on my arm tucked in one of the sport bands i bought for it.  I've had one problem with the computer software and ended up having to re-install other then that the transfer process works fine for me.  I have noticed a slight problem with my models battery power, on occasion it will read as full but once its on for 5 minutes the battery jumps to 1/3 its capacity.  I still haven't found out the reason for this problem, i hypothesize that i might not be turning the player off correctly.  I also find it unfortunate that it has a USB charger which makes it difficult to travel with without bring my laptop or finding a computer to charge it with.  other then the rare disappearing battery life and the one glitch with the software i am satisfied with this Microsoft product and plan on using it for quite some time.

<Content>A really great MP3 player despite all those bad Reviews and their cons, i wont believe in biased comments from Apple fanatics anymore. I decided that it was time to try something New..... and at the end The Zune, was worth it.  The only problem that i had was that i couldn't Sync at the beginning...... my fault though... (i didnt update to the latest firmware). But after that, everything worked just fine. Like bread and butter.  BTW, sound quality is superb  Any questions you guys have feel free to ask

<Title>I love the Zune...it's great!
<Date>Sun Jun 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I was in the position of buying a new mp3 player, I had limited my choices down to the iPod video or Zune mp3 players.  A friend of mine, who is a mp3 specialist at Best Buy (who had already had an iPod video) strongly suggested that I get the Zune.  They knew nothing much about it but they supported it because it was basically the new thing on the block and cooler...but also because it had started being received better than the iPod, sparking interest in it versus the "household" iPod.  I must say this is true.  I have no real complaints about the Zune.  The only downfall to it (for me) is that unlike the iPod, there are no games on it.  However, the Zune can make up for that in other areas...such as the fact that it has FM radio  and a wireless shraing network (although mine has never really been of use, and I've heard this from others).  Also, you can personalize the menu with your own pictures or graphics.  Finally, the Zune has a bigger screen than the iPod video's and you turn it sideways to view videos...that's so cool!  I've had my Zune for awhile now, so I can't think of all the pros...and there are no cons for me.  Some users are so technical and too critical with the features of the Zune, being so concerned with such things as the "skip-time" between songs.  All of that is irrelevant!  An mp3 is a big advancement from "back in the day" when all people had were records!  Then they had to "shuffle" their own music by shuffling through all their records.  Anyways, a Zune is a great mp3 player.  I highly suggest it.  Buy a Zune!  Forget iPods!  P.S. I also bought my Zune to support Microsoft...some perspective customers may want to do the same.  :)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPLP3C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-9345451-4710463">Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Black)</a>

<Content>I bought my son an I-pod video, after seeing all the troubles it had with picture files, I bought myself a ZUNE. It has great sound, very easy navigation and excellent compability with Windows. It is a little bigger than I-pod and the battery life has been a little shorter than I-pod in my experience. But all around, I am very happy with ZUNE and I think it is better than I-pod.

<Title>For those who want something different then an Apple Ipod.
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The main reason I bought the Microsoft Zune was because I wanted something different then Apple's Ipod.  I wanted something that fit my personality.  I'm not one of those people that despises things that are popular.  I just wanted something different.  The other main reason I bought the Zune was because I didn't like the control functions on the Ipod and didn't really have fond memories of the iTunes program before the Ipod came out.  I like the fact that the Zune has a click wheel instead of a scroll wheel.  The charge lasts me a full day if I'm using it all day long.  If I'm not it lasts longer.  The only really disappointment I had is I really should ordered a Red Zune because that is the one I really wanted.  Buy this player.  It plays videos perfectly, and it syncs music perfectly as well and it lets you set your choice of album art.

<Title>Just Awesome!
<Date>Fri Aug 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own several iPods.  To be honest, for my workouts I do prefer to use my shuffle for obvious reasons.  But the Zune in terms of home, office, car, and travel is just the coolest.  Yes, the software is a bit different and yes, if you are used to iTunes you will think it's difficult at first but within a day of palying around with it I was pretty tuned in on how to use.  The fact that you can download all you want for about $16 a month is perfect for people who purchase a lot of music.  With the ability to connect MP3s to virtually anything now, why should I purchase?  Saves a ton of money and find pretty much everything I want on Zune.  ALSO, if you do want to purchase from Zune, songs are only 79 cents compared to 99 cents on most other sites. Small but can add up if you do want to purchase a lot.  And then I don't have to transfer everyting via CD from iTunes. Goes right into my music library.  The screen is great quality too and I've had a chance to see what's coming out over the next year and they will have some smaller devices etc.  As I've seen in other comments, Zune will catch up.  I mean, remember the first iPod?  But bottom line, if you are a die hard iPod person then it's not for you.  If you're looking for something better for universal use, this is the ticket.  I love mine!

I love the big screen and the cheap music options. plus it is the Prefect companion to my Xbox 360. I also taike mine to my barbershop and get fresh music and a fresh fade at the same time (every one who works at the barbershop has a zune and we wirelessly trade music) Quit looking at mp3 players and get a Zune!

<Content>After 3 iPods failing on me I decided to check out the Zune, this thing is wonderful! Its a bit bigger, but thats not a problem. It does everything very well, the controls are simple and very user friendly. The Zune software automatically downloads album cover art to display when I play songs. This same software is really easy to use and makes me wonder why I ever wasted time with iTunes. The large screen is impressive looking and makes movie and picture viewing a breeze. I'd recommend the Zune to anyone, It's top notch!

<Title>Bought 2 for each daughter and regret it!
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nothing but problems and more problems.  Customer service is a joke and so is the non-existent product line.  I don't know where to start.  Customer service is what is making me want to get rid of these expensive desk decorations as these guys don't know their heads from their back ends.    After 3 days of calling and Microsoft cancelling our account and all the hours upon hours of downloaded songs expiring and getting different "this is how you fix it" stories from many dingalings, we thought we finally got it running again.  Not so.  Microsoft couldn't reconnect my account after their shutting it down by mistake AND charging us for a month we never used, so we had to start over by opening a new account. (Our account was 7 months old and had a tremendous amount of downloaded songs... all were automatically "expired" so no using the Zune). Nothing would work on their software which kept coming up with our old accounts names and numbers (after re-signing up) and allowing anything to work.  Old "tags" stay on the screen and new ones wouldn't come up and be added or replace these so we could access the songs.  Our account showed the account as reopened but wouldn't allow us access to anything after charging our credit card TWICE to get it started again.  It goes on and on with the help of several idiots at Microsoft which so far has wasted about 6 hours of my time and still they won't work again.  All songs (we'd downloaded about 1,000 to our Zunes so they DID work for a month or two and it was almost nice) expired and we had to START EVERYTHING OVER. Like that would do any good. Obviously I'm incredibly frustrated with this as much money has been spent not only on 2 Zunes but cords, sets of new cords to replace ones that stopped working, monster cords to replace the new cords which also stopped working and a monthly $15 charge just to access songs that I can't get access to.  ARGH!  Anyway, I have had it.  The $80.00 car charging/house charging set stopped working (cheap garbage), the cords that charge and connect to the pc don't work properly (sometimes work..sometimes do nothing) and it's nothing but a pointless hassle.  Trying to find accessories was so frustrating I gave up.  Radio Shack kept telling us "buy Ipod accessories, they ALL work with Zune". Right... Best Buy carried nothing but the Zune itself...oh...and Zune gift cards which the website wouldn't accept!  We finally found ONE overpriced dock that has some sort of speaker system to project sound in their rooms. The huge price (When Ipod has loads of accessories and for 1/3 the price!) kept me from wasting my money.  The only thing that's worked for more than a few months is the "monster charger" for the car.  That is great.  But unfortunately you need a crappy ZUNE to make it worthwhile.  I hate these things and am ready to sell them on eBay for IPODS!!  HORRIBLE!  Beware before you buy as you apparently must have lots of time and $$ to waste!

<Title>The Microsoft Zune
<Date>Sun Jul 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Over half the reviews i have seen on this product seem to be from people who do not actually own the very product they are reviewing, they either rate it a 5 star and say anything from "It's not an ipod, thank god!" or a 1 star "Wi-Fi sucks, no plays-for-sure, get an iPod!" Where is the user experience??? Well, to kick off my review I will tell you what most people will not know without user experience.   The zune software, ITS REALLY GOOD. All the glitches you have heard have been fixed, I installed it within a matter of maybe 10 minutes, and in that 10 minutes i downloaded it, installed it, downloaded updates, set up my Zune, entered my information to download through Zune Marketplace, and started syncing my music to my zune. All within a matter of 10 minutes. Here is some cool fun facts about the software:  You know when you plug in an ipod, or just about any other mp3 player, you get the "Do Not Disconnect", or "Connected" or something along the lines. You cannot even use your mp3 player while its charging via computer USB. The unique thing about the zune software, is that if you have your Zune plugged in and the Zune Software open, the zune charges and it says "connected" on its screen, and just like any other MP3 player, you cant do anything with it. BUT, with out even touching the zune product, you just close out of the Zune Software on your computer, and Poof! Your zune is still charging and you can use it.  Zune software, similar to iTunes, automatically downloads album artwork and updates song information.  There is not much else to say about the software, its REALLY easy to use, very sleek, and runs just as smoothly.   The Zune... ahh here is where it gets good  First thing, this is kind of cool, and i dont think anyone has mentioned it. When i entered the Serial Number into the Zune website to register it. I noticed a few things: 1: the serial number is kinda dug into the zune, it isnt printed right onto the surface, its hard to describe in words, but it just makes it so that it cant easily scratch off and become illegible.   2:  There is a little message "Hello from Seattle" kind of cool... just thought ide say it.  Ok enough about that, lets talk about size (its huge right? thats what everyone says!!!)  Huge? Hah! this thing is tiny! A Dollar bill completely covers the face of it with 2 inches hanging over it, as far as thickness goes, it is exactly the thickness of 2 #2 pencils, it is really not that big, its just bigger than the ipod, so people say its HUGE or that it is a brick.   Now navigation.. (it sucks right? I mean, theres no click wheel! Its a phony!!)  Hmm... well, again, its hard to explain, but it is really, really easy to navigate through your 3000+ songs. I have a little over 2,300 songs, and i get to what i want to listen to in no time.. heres an example: Im searching through my mp3's in Artist mode, so i see all of the artists. I want to listen to "Bullet for my Valentine" but i accidentally go to Buckcherry, with the iPod, you have to press menu, then move the cursor down to Bullet for my Valentine, then press "ok", well, with the Zune, you just simple press the left side of the directional pad, again, its hard to explain, it really is, ill just give you the verdict. ITS REALLY EASY.  The Screen, (Sure, its big, but it has the same resolution!) True... but to the human eye pictures/menu/songs/movies look no different, some reviewers said that it made everything look really blurry.. thats some BS right there. You cant even tell, if Microsoft hadnt released that the resolution was the same, not a single person would have noticed.  Overall performance (IT FREAKIN LAGS, its the slowest buggiest MP3 player ever!!) Again, B to the S. The only time i have ever, EVER gotten a lag of any sort, is when I am playing a song, and at the "now playing screen" and i rapidly press "back" 5 or six times to get to the main menu, yeah, theres a lag. But to prevent that just press and hold the back button and the main menu will appear shortly.. no lag.  File support (It doesnt support Playsforsure, and only supports WMV video!! Get a freakin iPod) What i think is the most ridiculous thing ever about the zune is the fellow that says this: The zune doesnt support Microsoft's own Playsforsure format, so please, leave all your troubles behind and get an iPod!  What is so bad about that is that the iPod doesnt support Playsforsure either.. so how does getting an ipod leave all your troubles behind, if you are Napster, Yahoo, URGE, Rhapsody, any of those, they will not work with an iPod, the will not work with a Zune... I recommend the Zen Vision: M for playing "playsforsure" somgs.  The Wi-fi (it sucks, 3 days 3 plays is soo bad!!!" Thats totally true, but think of it this way, look at the PSP:  when it was first released, you could only share pictures and play ad-hoc. Well now, with a ton of firmware updates (its up to 3.3 or something now) the PSP now plays online and browses the web with an internet browser. I believe it got that internet browser in update 2.0. The zune is at 1.4 firmware wise. Give it some time!!!  Color Options (theres sOOOO many, microsoft is so desperate) Theres so many because they wont people to have their own zune, not the standard black and white, Get brown, or red, or Halo 3, or even pink!! they are ALL the same price..  Packaging (no one ever said crap about this now did they) Its really nice, its compact, they packed it in really, really thick carboard, it almost feels like a thin wood. compared to the ipods packaging this is stellar. I'm not going to destroy your experience, as opening the Zune is truly really awesome, so all i will say, is that the Zune packaging is FLIPPIN AMAZING.  Contents (again, no one ever said crap about this)  It comes with a sync cable, headphones, case, zune, CD, and a manual. Headphones: These are really comfortable, so-so sound (same as ipods), but these have a unique cord management system. Like the ipod's headphopnes, they have that thing thats slides up and connects the 2 ear pieces. But the earpieces are also magnetic, so they stick together preventing a lot of tangles and knots and messes.  Sync Cable: Its even got that same doubleshot finish the zune has, other than that, its a sync cable, nothing special Case: this is a REALLY, REALLY good free-bee case. It feels really, really soft and it is perfect size. No wiggle room at all. It clings to the zune protecting it from keys, coins or whatever else is in your pocket.  CD:  yes, it actually comes with one, unlike the ipod Manual: It's a little too simple, just 3 steps  1 install software 2 charge zune 3 load music each step showing a picture.  But they also have this product guide, that just shows all the safety precautions, like dont throw in an open flame, and ridiculous stuff like that.   Please, feel free to comment and i will answer back as soon as i can.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ZUNE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS AN MP3 PLAYER

<Title>Zune and Creative Comparison w/a little iPod Mention
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have read a few of the reviews here and some of the discussion board posts below. Many people compare the Zune to the iPod, and some people just talk about the Zune without giving that much helpful information. I've seen a couple people request Creative comparisons. Since I had a Creative Zen and now have a Zune, I will just write about my experiences with both, tell why I picked each player vs others, compare the two based on my experiences and give feedback on the Zune. I also want those of you who came here for a real review and not to read iPod whores talk about how the Zune doesn't stack up to the iPod, causing you maybe to get a false sense of the Zune or not know what to believe, and/or those of you who really want to know what the Zune is like to walk away from this review feeling like I've given you a real opinion that is not fanatical or anti-XYZ mp3 player in any sense on the product. I still think you should look at some of the posts by people who are so psychotic about the iPod that they troll here and/or have long, drawn-out comparisons/checklists that set out to prove how much better the iPod is than the Zune just so you can look at what features the Zune has and see which of those that are lacking and that are there matter most to you (because a lot of those things on those lists really don't matter much, at least not to me)--that's how you should make your decision (in particular, look at CFranz's review and PalmerDeville's discussion board comparison below, entitled "A Hands-On Review of the Zune (vs iPod), which I think actually has some of the Zune's alleged lack of features wrong).  (If you just want to read a review of the Zune, skip down a few paragraphs...)  And that's how I've been making my decisions about mp3 players. I got my first one, the Creative Zen Touch 20GB, almost two years ago. At the time, I was looking for what I felt was the best buy given my criteria--a player that would hold a lot of songs but was still relatively inexpensive. My school sells iPods on campus, and since I was on campus I came extremely close to rushing over to the computer store to buy a video iPod. I thought the fact that it played videos was cool, though I could live without that feature. They had a lot of GBs, so it could hold a lot of songs. Oh, and everyone had one. They were just about the only mp3 player I was hearing anything about. Two major things stopped me. First, when I realized that iPods only work with iTunes, I was turned off. I had (and still do) a subscription to Rhapsody. I love Rhapsody because the songs are great sound quality, great collection of songs and you can pay monthly, quarterly or yearly and have access to songs rather than paying per song. But with Rhapsody, you can either only stream songs all you want or you can get the subscription that allows you to transfer songs directly to your mp3 player (pretty much all players except iPods, and I think maybe even the Zunes). Basically, you license the songs--once you cancel that service, you lose the songs. I knew this when I upgraded to that service, but I did it anyway because I was lazy and didn't feel like ripping songs from all my CDs, downloading songs or using programs like Total Recorder, Limewire or (later on) Replay to get the songs I wanted for free. The second thing was the cost for the GBs, as well the cost in comparison to other players. I scanned iPods, and even with my school discount those things were either costing *over* $300 for the video iPods or cost an amount for, like, a 4GB iPod that I would have only paid for something with 10GB, at least. I've seen people say iPods cost what the Zunes do, which is something I've never witnessed...maybe iPod's prices have gone down, or certain iPods cost the same as a Zune. (Another consideration was I'd heard that there were several problems with iPods, such as breaking down, which I later learned after purchasing a Zen that they had a similar problem with many players, although mine never broke down)  This is what led me to the Creative Zen Touch 20GB. It didn't play videos or accept pictures or anything like that. It basically just played music, but it would play a LOT of it and for only $215 (where I found it). That was good enough for me, and that's what I bought. From day one, I had problems with that thing. I just thought the setup part was a little too difficult, what, with loading software onto your computer AND onto your player, then realizing there was an update and re-loading THAT software and stuff like that. The player was bulky, which was fine with me even though I noticed most other players were smaller/thinner after the fact. The look of the player, especially internally (i.e. the menus, background, etc) vs, say, the Zune reminds me of how computers from the 80s look vs computers nowadays. It was just a really plain player that, if all you wanted to do was hear a lot of music, got the job done.   But, boy, did it take a lot of work to get the job done. I noticed that Napster was offering a free trial for either a week or two weeks, so I downloaded that and started transfering songs to my Zen from their service since the Zen allegedly worked with Napster, according to Napster's compatibility list. I was considering possibly switching to Napster from Rhapsody until every time I tried to sync songs from Napster to the Zen, the sync list would get maybe 60-70% completed and then freeze up. After messing with this several times, I blamed it on Napster, cancelled after a month and then started syncing songs from Rhapsody. Rhapsody worked great with the Zen for a while, but the problem with Rhapsody is they release new versions of their program every time you turn around. Unfortunately, pretty much every time they did this I wouldn't be able to sync songs directly from Rhapsody to the Zen for a long time. Usually, once I was able to sync again without incident, Rhapsody would force another upgrade on me. Eventually, I realized Windows Media Player would sync these songs without too many problems (even though there would definitely be some problems) and started using that to sync songs after I downloaded them from Rhapsody. I also went ahead and started ripping more and more songs from my CD collection to sync, among other tricks. Those would almost never have problems syncing to Zen, unless the Zen froze up in the process...  Which brings me to more problems I experienced with the Zen. There was a period of time that, save for the problems with syncing and the occasional Zen freeze-up, I was absolutely in love with that player and swore I would never by one from any company other than Creative. Then over time, more and more problems popped up. I always felt like the Zen's advertisement of 24-hour battery life was a lie. I travel a lot, long trips, and figured theoretically that it would take 8 hours for one battery bar to go down on my player. Well...taking Amtrak to or from Ann Arbor/Chicago, basically a 5-hour trip...one bar would be down by the end of that trip. Chicago to Memphis on Amtrak, approximately 10 & 1/2 hours, two bars could be down and that's not even with me using the player the whole time. I understand that the more songs you have on the player, the lower the battery life is, but I still think it's misleading to say 24-hours. As time went by, the freezing became more frequent, and then I also started having problems with the buttons on my player making the wrong selections. I logged onto Creative's message boards a lot because I experienced so many various issues with the player, and I pretty much always found other users with the same problems, many times not even just with the Zen Touch. I was praying like hell that my player wouldn't experience any serious problems, and I never wanted to take my Zen to a repair shop for some of the more irritating problems such as the buttons not working correctly because I knew I'd probably end up losing all (eventually) 2100+ songs I put on it. Many people reformatted their Creative players or were told to, or were told to download updates/revert back to older software versions, whenever they had a problem with it, and you just lose all your songs when you do that. Another really irritating thing to deal with was how picky the player was about ID tag information for your songs. For example, if you wanted to play songs on random and you didn't have artist, title or album information entered in for a song, that song would not be included in the random shuffle. You had to edit your tags to make sure they had this information. The software to download to sync with the Zen was crap, which is why I eventually stuck with WMP above all others. I couldn't even see half the song titles on my Zen whenever tried to use that program to create playlists for my Zen. Finally, off and on, my lap top wouldn't recognize my Zen. Many times I would have to re-download the driver onto my lap top to get it to recognize it. There were other issues with the Creative Zen, areas in which they maybe could have done better (such as ease of menu navigation, etc) that customers complained about, but these were my biggest problems with that player.   ***The Zune*** (vs Zen) In my family, I'm the one everyone runs to with technology issues. But even though I had recommended Creative to several people, including my brother and sister, my brother and sister went out and bought Zunes for themselves, probably in March or April. I tried theirs out and had them tell me about their Zunes. I wasn't even really in the market for a new player, except the buttons not working right on my Zen really was getting worse and worse and more irritating, but I really liked their Zunes. I could tell that it was a better product than the Creative players, which honestly surprised me because I felt like everything Microsoft comes out with is crap and expected nothing better from their mp3 player. I liked the way it looked, and while it might not be as small as iPods it is smaller than my Zen was. I'm happy with the size. I also thought it was really cool how it played FM radio, as well as that you could see the album art while the song is playing (depending...more on this in a second).   My brother and sister always need help with any technology, so I figured they were going to have tons of questions and complaints about their Zunes--how to install/setup the Zune software, how to do this, how to do that, this or that isn't working right, etc. But the only questions I was getting from them concerned how to convert videos to WMV files. They surely would have had questions had they bought Creatives like I told them to. I see many people here claim problems with the Zune software, but they have had no such problems. I figure those problems relate to, as some have said, where your USB port is, as well as what operating system you have. My sister and brother have Windows Media Center on a computer with front USB ports, and I have Windows XP Professional Edition on a lap top with three back USB ports. They got their players working without me, got songs on their players without me and have been getting movies on their players pretty much without me.  As far as my player, I was kind of baffled at first because I didn't see an AC adapter to plug it in and charge the battery up. Then I called up my sister and found out you don't even need one with the Zune like you do with the Zen because it charges with the sync cable hooked up to your computer. Awesome. So I installed the software from the CD that came with the Zune, hooked up the Zune, honestly did have a little trouble getting the lap top to recognize the Zune but it didn't take long to fix that, and it was working. This was easier to setup than the Zen, no question, at least for me. I didn't like that the player wasn't going to work with Windows Media Player or that I'm wasting hard drive space with a program that is just like Windows Media Player (according to others here, though, it does work with WMP, but the research I did said it wouldn't. I haven't tried it with WMP), but I do like how much faster songs sync to my player with Zune's WMP copycat than WMP synced to my Zen. As far as Rhapsody, I haven't tried it with Rhapsody, although I read when I did some research on the Zune (a lot more badmouthing from iPod fanatics) that it won't work with anything but Zune's Marketplace.   At this point, that's not an issue to me anymore. And I've got to be honest with you--it's really silly to become dependent on one type of player all because you purchased their picky formats. I knew I wasn't going to have the Zen for the rest of my life, and those people with iPods who purchase songs from iTunes are not going to be able to hang onto that forever. It's a waste of money, and even my syncing songs from Rhapsody was a waste of money. I recommend thinking ahead and getting songs in formats that will be pretty universal to most players, such as mp3 and wma formats, and save all those songs on CD-Rs or DVD-Rs as data discs for when you get a new mp3 player. Those of you who get songs from iTunes know the burn-the-CD-and-rip trick--use that. I am in the process of getting my songs all license-free in mp3 and wma formats, using the songs I've ripped from CDs, as well as other ways already mentioned. Some of you might have a problem with getting music illegally, but these companies really try to tie our hands and it's ridiculous. Just a suggestion, but I know that I'm never going to have to worry about losing my songs again or how to switch mp3 players. If you love music like I do, purchasing thousands of songs only to lose them is entirely too much.   I think the Zune is easy to use, cool menu/navigation, easy to see the listings and was a really great buy, but *no* mp3 player is perfect. Obviously, the Marketplace and the WMP copycat software are kind of negatives, unless you don't use the software. Once again, I think the 14-hr battery-life claims with this player are a lie. I work 8 hours a day. I travel on the train to work for nearly an hour, and I travel home for nearly an hour. By the time I'm on the afternoon train, the battery is on its last leg, and there is usually 1-2 hours in that 10-hr time frame that I'm not even listening to the player. The album art...(sighs). That would be one of the coolest things to me if this weren't, once again, about pickiness with ID tags. Those of you who purchase songs from Zune's Marketplace might not have this issue. But if you're ripping songs from CD, downloading or other things, the ID tag information the Zune software picks up for many of your songs turns out incorrect. So you will sometimes either end up with the wrong album art for some songs, or you will end up with no album art. It's a pain in the @ss correcting the ID tags, particularly if you're wading through a lot of tracks. The battery charges up somewhat slowly with this player. It took next to no time for the Zen to charge, and you could listen to the Zen as it charged. With the Zune, it apparently takes knowing to close the Zune software in order to listen as it charges. Another issue with the ID tags--you can end up with several listings for the same song. For example, if in the ID tag info for the "album artist" is written differently from the song artist, it will create multiple listings for that song. It also does really weird grouping things, such as if more than one artist has the same album title those artists' album title will be grouped in under every other artist with that same title. So if you have "Greatest Hits" collections by several different artists on your player...all of their GH CDs will be listed under every artist with a GH CD on your player, as if Martina McBride is the artist of a Guns N Roses GH CD, for example. Crazy. Finally, the Zen and Zune have similar sound quality, except the Zen is louder. I realize some of you are like a walking, talking public announcement on hearing, but some songs you just want played really loud. I don't like that you can't correct tag issues and/or delete songs from your player without hooking the Zune back up to the computer and manually doing it from the Zune software. At least with the Zen, I could delete songs directly from the mp3 player and look at the ID tag information from the mp3 player (though I couldn't edit it from there).     My Biggest So-Whats: -The screen--I care next to nothing about being able to watch videos on an mp3 player. Wanna know why? Because I don't care how big or great-looking the screen/resolution is on an mp3 player, it's not going to be as big as, *at least*, a decent portable DVD player's screen...which still makes it--guess what--TOO SMALL to be interested in watching videos on one of those things. At least that's true for me. And if an mp3 player is big enough to see a video to my satisfaction, then that player is just too damn big. I'm sticking with my lap top and my TV on the video front. Besides, converting to WMV or any other format is a pain in the @ss and just not worth it, to me, and I don't care for how picky iPods and the Zune are about video formats. I'm sorry that I can't help those of you who care about that kind of thing in this review, but what I would say is if anything needing videos to be in WMV format and wanting the best picture quality are probably negatives for those who do care...although from what I've seen of the Zune's picture quality, it's pretty good.   -The weight--It's still not that big of a player, so I don't get the complaining about this. Most people I see with iPods have the ones that are not that much smaller than this Zune is.  -No scroll wheel--I had a touchpad on the Zen and was actually kind of annoyed with it sometimes. I have absolutely no problems with clicking a button, and I'm not sure why anyone else would have that problem, either.  -WiFi is "worthless"--True it is. The reason why, more than anything else, in my opinion, is that not many people have Zunes. I could really care less about the copyright/play/maintain restrictions on songs you send to others. You can easily go sit down and get the songs yourself, if you really want them. Indeed, that's how you've been getting along for the past few years anyways. But because of the fact that relatively few people have Zunes, you can turn on the WiFi feature anyway and not have anybody to send to/from nearby. I'm in Chicago right now, so as many people as I see all over the place--I've seen some with Zunes on the train--you'd think there'd be people on the WiFi feature...but that's just not the case.  -Not sold in other countries--I'm from the US, so...besides, it's a new player. -No engraving--No, but you can name your player from the Zune software, then go into "Settings" to see it. I don't really need either of those features. -Doesn't work with PlaysForSure--Good, because that was crap. I honestly think that was one of the problems with my Zen. This is one of the reasons why I say get your songs in universal formats and quit purchasing songs from picky player markets designed to keep you imprisoned to one mp3 player, because you ought to know that those are not always going to be compatible with other players, which means you're wasting money. If you must buy, buy from sites that will allow you to download in mp3 or wma format.  -Other things iPods have that the Zune doesn't--some people disregard the argument that Zunes are newer. But iPods really have been around for a long time. I don't see that many things missing with the Zune, though, that I would demand in an mp3 player, and most things I see listed by others are nitpicky not essentials. My biggest complaints as of right now are with the tagging issues/the fact that I can't have album art for every song without pulling teeth (which is not essential, so I can deal with it) and that the battery doesn't last as long as with the Zen nor charge fast enough. I think that if those are my biggest problems with the Zune, then the Zune is pretty alright. No problems with the buttons whatsoever, and my sister and brother have both said they haven't had any problems with their Zunes. Looking at the lists I recommended you see near the beginning of my story/review, I really don't see where the Zune is so much worse off than the iPod, as long as you're not picky and/or snobbish about looks/design.

On top of that the sound quality for listening to mp3's is excelent, And the media sharing is pretty cool too (assuming you know someone with a zune). overall dispite being a tiny bit bulky(but still easily small enough to run or workout with)out of all the media players i own(ipod 5.5,zen,psp...)the Zune is my favorite multimedia player.

<Title>You just can't compare it to the ipod anymore
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The zune is such a great device. I am very happy with it after owning a lot of things including the gigabeat s and the ipod. Now what I like about this over the ipod is that the screen is bigger and it has a bigger color variety. As to were the ipod screen is smaller but still big and it only has two colors.I mean sure you can say "what about the new nanos and the minis" but we are not trying to compare the zune to them, because the zune will blow them out the water.Apple needs to step the ipod up with more colors, white and black are getting stale. Also I like how the zune does not get scratches or finger prints easily. Were the ipod is a huge magnet for both. The zune also has limited editon items like the red,baby pink,orange,hot pink,and halo 3 editions. And those are just to name a few.What does the ipod have, I dont know the U2 edition. Now everyone complains about wifi but think, you have to start somewhere and better to have wifi than no wifi. The feature will be implemented more in the future and with all the hackers and whatnot out there it might be possilbe for them to create a custom firmware for the zune so it can use internet or something. Now that's what I like about ipod over zune, the fact that it has custom firmware like ipodlinux and rockbox. I liked playing mario and stuff on it. But the only reason why zune does not have that is because it's still new and the ipod has been out for years. So just give it time.

<Title>Amazing.
<Date>Fri Jul 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Origginally, I had planned to get an Ipod Video, I'll be honest. But since I have a PC rather then a Mac, I came upon the Zune. Yeah, the price is kind of steep, but It is absolutely worth it. I had no problems with it at all, and everything worked really smoothly.  The syncing was very quick, and the zune supports WAY more types of files then the videe Ipod, including .wma, .wmv, .mp4, and .mp3.  The LCD screen is amazing and great to watch videos on. My pictures looked better on the Zune then on my computer! There is also the ability to have a slideshow of whatever pictures you want, which is great.   You can customize the main screen of your zune with one of YOUR pictures, too!   The zune is a little big, but it is pretty much the same size as the Ipod Video, except it is thicker. I like this beacause I don't feel like it is going to shatter like the flimsy-looking Ipod.   Ipod Killer or Not, The Zune is AMAZING and definately worth it.

<Content>I got my Zune as a birthday present.  My fianchas an I-pod, so I wanted something different, and I must say I am very pleased.  The controls are fairly simple (touch pad vs. a scroll pad), uploading and storage are excellent, and the video and sound quality is very good.  The built-in FM tuner is a nice touch, as is being able to customize the background picture.  I don't use the wireless Zune-to-Zune feature (mainly because I don't know anyone else who owns one) and it is heaveir than an I-pod, but not cumbersome.  All in all, a very good purchase.

I read all of the Zune reviews about how people had trouble getting the software loaded, and didnt think anything of it.  i have the windows media program that is listed on the website as something that the zune would work with.   well it doesnt.  if i want my zune to work id either have to get a whole new computer or completely whipe my hard drive and start over.  i dont have the time or the patience.    BUT.  i do like how it's organized.  it charged fairly wuickly and as far as i can tell from the pre loaded stuff it'd be a pretty dcent thing if i could put my own music and videos on there.    all in all, im sending my brand new zune back and getting something else---and praying that it will be more compatible with my computer.

<Title>Better than an iPod
<Date>Sat Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are undecided between a Zune and an iPod, go for the Zune.  It is a far superior product.  I previously owned an iPod and switched to the Zune because I was unhappy with Apple's technical assistance and the overall sound quality of the iPod.  I took a gamble on the Zune and am glad that I did.  It is a far superior product.  In fact the comparison isn't even close.  The sound quality is much better, it is easier to use, the accompanying software is better (once you learn how to use it),and the technical assistance is superior (acutally, it doesn't take much to beat Apple's technical assistance). My only complaint is that the manual that comes with it leaves much to be desired.

<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Zune is...problematic. I'm a finicky person about audio, and it's lack of lossless support and a proper line-out bother me (especially the latter; in a unit this size, there's no reason to omit it). However, the superb sound quality, incredible build, and gorgeous interface make up for the bad points. That is until the battery runs out, which is ignorantly fast and often. Oh, and since Microsoft is too cheap to provide an AC adapter, be sure to calculate another $90 or so to pick up the travel pack, which you'll quickly find you need if you really use your mp3 player. Long story short, it's a piece of crap I'd murder someone over if they touched it.

<Content>The Zune is far and away much better than an IPOD.  Just looking at an IPOD and it gets scratched.  The center touch input is buggy at best and rarely easy to use.  The Zune positive feedback input is a delight. It sounds great and videos on it are bright and smooth.  You can burn your music and put it on your Zune and you can suscribe to Zune Marketplace  Where for $14.99/mo you have unlimited downloads of all your music. Or you can just listen to single song or whole album without downloading it.  This is something ITunes can't even touch...  I have purchased one IPOD and 2 Zunes.  I just threw my IPOD away, I would not submit any of my friends to it's torment...  Do yourself a favor and buy a Zune, the subscription service alone is something IPOD does not offer and is great, as is the Zune itself..

<Title>Better Than I Expected!

<Content>After going back and forth between the iPod and the Zune, I finally decided on the Zune. (Mostly because of the lack of enthusiasm iPod owners had about their devices and the encouragement of current Zune owners). Installing the software was very simple. Took about 20 minutes to install all the updates and software.  The Zune synchronized immediately with the software and transferring 16 gigs worth of music took less than 30 minutes which is quite a feat if you ask me! Each song took only about 5 seconds to transfer!   The device itself is a little heavier and bigger than I expected, but seems very durable and scratch-resistant.  The menu screen is self-explanatory and it's easy to find the track you are looking for. The resolution is fantastic and the sound quality is great.   The software itself was a bit confusing; it took me a while to find the small button in the corner that allows you to transfer your own music (aside from the ones you get from the marketplace, if you go that route).  Also, like Windows Media Player, once the device starts syncing, you can't delete some songs from the playlist; you have to go in after it's done transferring and delete them (this only occurred because I decided to transfer an entire music folder rather than selecting each individual song, and I had to go back and delete the ones that I didn't really want).   Aside from minor organizational issues with the software, the interface is comparable to iTunes and much more visually pleasing. The device itself is user friendly and simple. The battery life has been beating my friend's iPod and while his is coated in screen scratches, I have no problems at all! I highly recommend buying this over an iPod anyday!
