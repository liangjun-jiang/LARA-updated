<Title>How can you go wrong?
<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Two weeks before the 80GB came out my wife purchased the 60GB. Fortunately, Apple has a great return policy that allows 14 days to return product. We returned the 60GB and immediately ordered the 80GB and so glad we did!   It was $50 cheaper than the older one and holds 20GB more! Love the new functionality and the brighter display really does help during daytime use. The new search functionality is cool and they did improve batterly life. (We recently took a 14 hour drive down the CA coast and that iPod ran smoothly all day WITHOUT a car charger)  Love it. Highly recommend to anyone in the market.

<Title>Simply the best MP3 player around!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned the 60GB Video iPod for close to a year now and with 11,000 tracks, 10 (Music) videos, and about 30 photos on it, I had 2.13GB free and was wondering what to do for more space.  Then along came the 80GB video iPod. More than enough room for my growing music collection, well at least for another year or so. Meant for those with large music collections.  Exactly the same size as the 60GB model, this too comes in black (which I got) and white, and it is cheaper than the 60GB model was when it came out.  It seems Apple finally acknowledged complaints about the earphones as they have been redesigned and fit better and less painfully in the ear for a long period of time, something I could never bear to do with the previous earphones. Oh, and sound quality is great too!!  I'll move right to the major changes with this version. First up is gapless playback of tracks. No more gaps between your tracks on Madonna's 'Confessions On A Dancefloor', or those Donna Summer 70s albums, or your live albums. Note, if you update the software on your 'older' video iPods, gapless playback works on those too.  Next is the new search method, you can now search for artists/albums by alphabet or numbers, still by using the scroll wheel to type out the names. This makes it much easier for someone like me with over 1000 albums stored.  Battery life has been improved for video playback, to 6 and a half hours. The screen resolution is brighter and sharper, making viewing of videos and images an even greater joy.  And finally, iTunes has also been updated. Among other things is a new interface, showing at a glance, how much space music, photos, and videos each take up, and space left. You can also set it to search the internet for CD artwork for CDs you've ripped yourself.  Still remaining are all the usual cool iPod features: You can attach CD artwork (doesn't make the iPod sluggish, or even skip like it used to), include individual track lyrics (both of which are essential to a music buff like me), screen lock, contacts, stopwatch, video playback (this responds faster now and resolution has been increased), photo display (you can do a slideshow of your photos while music plays) and downloadable games. You can also use it as a removeable hard drive, for backing up your data.  You definitely must get a case for your iPod, if you don't want it looking like your cat's scratch post within a week of use. There are loads of cases out there; rubber, leather, to clear hard plastic, the latter which I favour as it protects better, and you still get to see your iPod in all it's glory. XtremeMac, and agent18 (do a google search) make great tough plastic cases which snap on and off with ease, and protect all parts, especially the screen.  Also on the downside, as well as still scrimping on a wall charger (it charges by USB), there isn't an iTunes CD in the pack. You must now download iTunes (for free) from the internet.  Still, this is definitely my favourite gadget of the moment (it feels awesome to be holding over 1000 CDs in the palm of my hand), and yet again raises the bar for other MP3 players.

<Title>I'm really glad I waited!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When the 60 GB iPod came out one of my best friends got one and gave me his old 10 GB one for me to become familiarized with it, and thus decide if I really wanted an iPod.  After a couple of weeks I was really tempted to get one of the cool-looking black 60 GB myself, but when I was done uploading all of my music into my computer it came to almost 15,000 songs (59.35GB), so I decided to wait for a bigger iPod instead. I'm so glad that I waited!  My new 80 GB black iPod arrived today! I've just uploaded all of my music into it (it took me almost three hours to do it), and I love the huge improvements that this new iPod has (especially when compared to my old 10GB one!).  I just love the fact that I will finally be able to carry all of my music collection with me, wherever I go! And, that I will be able to find whatever I'm looking for, easier than before (thanks to this iPod's new "search" feature, which works really great!). The screen is so much easier to navigate, and so intuitive! Besides, its sharpness and brightness are really amazing. Even the new ear-phones are quite an improvement over the old ones, they are much more comfortable!  I know that it will take me some time to fill the remaining 20 GB in my new iPod. When that happens I will probably be ready for the iPod's succesor. In the meantime, I'm ready to enjoy my gorgeous new iPod!

<Title>Minor improvements makes this a great player
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, this is, to my knowledge, the cheapest 80GB Hard Drive MP3 player on the market, and with a name like Apple backing it up, this rendition of the iPod is well worth your time to look at.  *Technically this is still not the iPod Video, this is still an iPod with video playback; rumors are still buzzing about a Widescreen iPod, but still no official word*  NEW: -Longer battery life -Games -iTunes 7 has movies -Search feature -Larger capacity -Brighter screen  GOOD: -Great GB/$$ ratio -Great build -Bright screen -Battery life on video is double what it was before -Great interface -Innovative search -Games are pretty fun -Excellent design -Minimal buttons -Oodles of potential accessories  BAD: -Still scratches easily -Prone to fingerprints -Sometimes a little sluggish (not as much as before) -Battery isn't removable -Still no FM tuner, line-in, or voice record -Expensive accessories (not many in box) -Cheap earbuds  BOTTOM LINE: If you are too hardcore for the 30GB version, than this is definately your cup of tea. This is the perfect MP3 player for any causual music and video enjoyer's needs!

<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third iPod and this is the best one yet. This is my first video capable and this is a huge addition now with the brighter screen. One thing that may be a no-brainer or not; I suggest you "restore" your iPod first thing. I started dumping tunes and stuff on it immediately and had playback and rebooting  issues. However I "restored" it with iTunes 7.1 and this thing with all the bells and whistles is more responsive than my 30gb 4G model was!!! Oh and don't be cheap get the 80gb model. You will not regret it!!!

<Title>iPod Convert here. . .
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before this, I had a 20gb iRiver that lasted me 3 1/2 years.  My iRiver died a few months back and I decided to take the iPod plunge since there was no non-iPod high capacity player (>= 60GB) that met my requirements.  My huge CD collection (~500 - 600) had already been ripped to .wma which was a huge concern for me.  I read so much about "you can't convert lossy to lossy (wma to aac)" that I really tried to NOT go with an iPod.    Finally I decided to download iTunes and convert a few of my 192kbps wmas to 160kbps aac.  I couldn't tell the difference!!  I picked up the black 80GB (on sale) and really like it.  It took about 36 hrs to convert my old .wmas to aac and only about 2 hours to synch up the iPod after that.  I love the fact that I can use the Shuffle feature to listen to non-repeating GOOD music for days on end!!  I really like the fact that all my actions (playcount & skips) and ratings are synched to iTunes (and vice-versa) whenever I plug the iPod back in.  I also like the huge aftermarket for iPod stuff.    Movies are very cool on this.  I converted Back To The Future and have watched it a couple of times on this iPod.  I can't believe the detail on this!  I didn't purchase this iPod because of the video, I really wanted to be able to store my entire music collection on it and carry it wherever I go.  I can do that and more now. . .   *** Update *** A few months into owning this and my review stands.  I've used this a lot more than I used my iRiver.  What I really like about this is that when I buy a new (well, used) CD, I put the CD in the PC Drive, click 'yes' to "Do you want to rip this?".  When I plug my iPod in, all the new music is synched, all my play & skip counts are updated, etc.  I don't have to think about folder structures!!  I bought an FM tuner for it shortly after writing the original review.  Since then I've not listened to normal radio (save for the very few times I forgot the iPod).    This has now been on a couple of trips, one cross country & a trip to Europe.  Battery life has never really been stressed (nice to say after 12 hours of flying/layovers).  I have a pair of Sure e3cn's which really bring out the sound.  To date, I've only ripped one movie (Back To The Future) and have gotten stuck on The Matrix.  I never really bought this to watch movies anyway so it doesn't change my opinion of the iPod...

<Title>Not a simple to use device -- maddening problems
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you plan to buy this item, be aware that you need to buy a docking station with it, and an FM transmitter for your car (if you want hands free operation.  I bought the Apple i-Pod with 80 gigabytes.  You need the docking station to load your CD's effortlessly -- otherwise you may never be able to load them.  Then the i-Tunes software is frustrating.  I loaded three (3) CD's that were "The Definitive Collection" of the artists.  They were jumbled together on i-Tunes.    I have a CD entitled "Wagner's Greatest Hits" which i-Tunes loaded as multiple CD's. "The Most Relaxing Piano Album in the World . . . Ever" was loaded as multiple albums rather than one album.  I have not tried to play anything directly from the i-Pod when it was not in the docking station.  I fear that when I try to play an entire opera CD, I will have to play one song, then the next, requiring me to bring the booklet with me if I want to listen to a continuous opera on a plane.     If i-Tunes names your album, then you cannot change the name of the album (at least no way known to this sophisticated computer user).  There are no instructions on how to bring pieces back into one album.  Also if you want artwork for your album, Apple's i-Tunes store will tell you that there is no artwork available to you for your purchased CD even though there is artwork for downloadable CD's, just not for you who purchased your CD before you purchased it before you purchased your i-Pod.  These problems need to be address by Apple for the adult user, who buys CD's and has a collection of CD's, and who wants to load them on the i-Pod.  Why would I want 80 gigabytes of storage?  I would rate the i-Pod okay, but it needs improvements for adults.

<Title>King of Portable Media Devices for a Reason
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The latest flagship of the iPod lineup has only marginal differences between it's prior generation. Yet, the changes are exactly the little things that every wanted out of the prior models. iPod now has a much brighter screen with better resolution, it has the kind of space that allows you to tote quite a few movies, TV shows, and still have room for your whole music collection. The unspoken charm of this device is the simplicity of the interface and controls. The iPod is really a marvelous example of market research. How do consumers use their device, what is the average assumption of intuitive? The iPod hits that nail on the head.   Then there is the software. If you've never seen or used iTunes you probably take residence under a rock. To recap; however, it sports the same simplicity and intuitive and easy use as the Mac platform is famous for, and the iPod subscribes to. None of the features are cut from the Windows version of the software, giving it appeal on both PC and Mac.  I've used many media stores, including Urge, and iTunes is undoubtedly the best in selection, the easiest to use, and the easiest to navigate. Having developed the iPod side by side with iTunes, the iPod and iTunes sync with that hand and glove perfection that allows you to never worry about what problems you might encounter. Unless of course you jump on their upgrades too quickly. You'll want to give Apple time to work out the bugs on new releases of iTunes before you upgrade. Trust me!  The new games are fun for time-killing, but they really aren't meant for anything more. They are a selection of games that you could comfortably spend 5 minutes playing while you are on your break, or waiting for your wife to get ready for 45 minutes as she checks in with you every 5 saying she's just about ready... but anyway. The games have lush graphics, I would consider them Gameboy Advance quality graphics. There's a very limited array of games, and I seriously wouldn't recommend the iPod if your sole interest in it is of gaming with it.  Pros of the new iPod, and iPods in general: -Not just music, but movies, TV, games, calander appointments, to do, stopwatch, contacts with pictures -TV out quality is excellent. DVD-like even. -Audio quality has improved over prior generations -Ability to save documents as simple text and read them on the go, which is great for emails -Can be used as a portable storage device. At 80gb, that's quite an attractive feature. -My favorite feature over other audio devices is that it saves your place. For instance, if you start watching a movie on iTunes, then sync it to your iPod, the iPod will start the movie from where you left off in it on your computer.  Cons: -Screen Size is still too small for an honestly ideal mobile viewing experience. I think it's great for a 15 at work, but I'd hate to have my eyes strained on it for a 5 hour car trip. -Battery life just isn't there for the video veiwing. If you use the highest brightness settings you are looking at just over an hour of video. -Touch pad can take some getting used to. It's pretty sensitive. -iTunes only carries Disney and it's sub-studios for Movie content. -DRM, of course, is always a bitch.

<Title>Good for music, video, and pictures
<Date>Wed Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Most of the reviews have done a better job than I could about the details of the good and bad about the 80GB iPod, so I'll talk to the people like me: Mac owners with loads of pictures, a number of songs, and a few videos.  My primary purpose in getting the 80GB iPod was to take around my collection of photos from iPhoto for family gatherings and the like; also some of the short family videos I've done. (Obviously for this I also needed Apple's AV cable, not included, which handles video and stereo audio.) I agonized over the choice between the 60GB and 30GB models; when the new 80GB came out (for a lower price!) it seemed like a sign to go with the higher capacity.  Good choice. Within a week of getting the iPod I had filled it to over 60GB with files that I would have had to delete from my hard drive otherwise in the course of a video project; it makes an *excellent* spare drive in a pinch. And even after finishing the project and moving the files back to the computer, I have 32GB of photos, music, and video. So if you have to choose a size, go with 80GB -- it will be less space than you think sooner than you think.  Synching from iPhoto is as automatic and excellent as the synchs from iTunes. The iPod keeps track of how the photos are organized, making it easy to find groups and sort through them by date. Note, however, that if you are not organized in iPhoto, you won't have an easy time finding things on the iPod.  Video playback is excellent, both on the small screen and on the TV (we have SD, not HD -- I would not expect the HD screen to be kind to the 640x480 output). Slideshows are also very good, although I wish it were easier to customize the tunes that go with different sets of pictures. And now I have six years of photos (over 8,000 pictures) that fit into my pocket.  One thing I did not anticipate was need a remote control for the video and slideshows. So far I have not seen a product on the market that has not been slammed by reviewers.  Side note: using the AV cable, I was able to capture video and audio output from the iPod to my digital camcorder. This let me take a snippet from an iTunes music video and include it on a DVD video project I did for my nephew. Not the best quality, obviously, but the object wasn't to strip off the copy protection, I just wanted to get enough of the video to add some flavor to the other video I was creating.  I haven't given the battery a solid test yet (that will come with an overseas flight in a couple weeks), but while waiting in a store while my wife clothes shopped I went through a couple hours of video podcasts without the battery meter taking a noticeable hit.

<Title>Apple shipping iPods with computer viruses
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this Apple 80 GB iPod with Video Playback as a Christmas gift for my daughter, so it is still shrinkwrapped. Reuters reported this week that Apple recently shipped iPods which contain computer viruses. Amazon cannot (or will not) confirm whether my iPod is safe to give my daughter; instead I was provided an 800 number to call Apple which is on par with calling the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.  After dropping $350 for a reasonably nice gift, my joy of giving is now obviously hampered because I don't know if on Christmas morning my daughter will unleash a computer virus on whatever computer or network into which she plugs her shiny new iPod. Amazon and Apple are two of the most prestigious companies in the world, and they really need to step up to resolve this latest debacle. I need to know if this bad Apple is going to spoil the whole bunch, and I need to know now.

<Title>Great for Audio (when not frozen), TERRIBLE FOR VIDEO
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the 80gb Generation 5.5 iPod with video. I have had it for about a month now, & every time I have ever tried to play a video it would play for about a second, then get corrupted & freeze. When I go "back", trying to get to the menu, the entire iPod then FREEZES & no matter what you do it is completely unresolvably FROZEN until it runs out of juice and you plug it in to recharge it. This is pretty awful, since this is undoubtedly shortening the life of the battery considerably. Worse than that, the only fix anyone online has had for me so far was "Wait until the battery dies and then recharge it & it'll be fine", which I was - you can imagine - less than pleased with hearing, since I'd figured that much out frustratingly on my own. There has to be a better answer than that, or I'm going to feel pretty ripped off.

<Content>While the newest 6G iPod Classic offers some new features and a slim profile, this older 5.5G iPod is the best one currently available (12/24/07).  With a Wolfson DAC, a component not featured in new "classic" iPods, this 80GB iPod features the sound quality that made iPod a viable music listening platform. It also has a bright screen, good battery life, and the ability to play videos, photos, songs, games and more! It plays entire albums flawlessly with no gaps between tracks, a problem that plagued older iPods for years.  Finding a good deal on this unit is the best possible 80GB iPod purchase you can make until Apple hopefully fixes the 6G iPod sound problems. Let's keep our fingers crossed for the upcoming 7th generation.

<Title>It's a library that I can carry in my hand
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally fell for the siren call of owning an Apple iPod.  I already own a Toshiba Gigabeat for music, but it is getting outdated and I wanted something different to download all of my audiobooks so when I travel I wouldn't be carrying pounds of printed material or loads of disks. I probably went overboard on storage space with my 80gb iPod Classic, but I have found I can download from the iTunes store, the different vendors like Audible and Alibris as well as copy from the audio cds I own.  It's like walking around with a library that fits in the palm of my hand.  The downsides to the iPod are the earbuds that came with it (I just substituted the Phillips earbuds I use with the Gigabeat) and I would like more control on how things are downloaded.  My audiobook cds all want to be saved into Music and not the audiobooks section of the iPod.  I use playlists extensively in order not to have to scroll down all the titles when I am looking for the book I want.  And yes, now that I have used the iPod for a while, I am also adding music to it.  With a USB adaptor for charging the iPod this player goes anywhere and gives great sound.

They are too big and do not stay secure in my ears, so I will be purchasing some other kind in the near future.  I purchased a refurbished model of this IPod and found the description to be very honest and detailed. The only thing that wasn't mentioned was that there were quite a few tiny scratches(from previous usage) on the back of the casing. Otherwise it was in perfect conditon and packaged nicely. Thank you, Amazon for a terrific buying experience! I will not hesitate to do further business with you in the future!!!

<Title>Apple iPod 80GB
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great product but there are a few glitches if you are not carefull.  I have not bought any songs, I downloaded all my own CD's using my Windows XP computer.  I soon realized I needed to move my itunes library to an external drive to free up the space on my c:drive.   Now if I try to use my song library I get error message "files not found do you want to search" If I search I can find the song in Windows but have to find each song individually, I can then add it to the library at the new drive location.   I have 2600 songs I burned from my CD collection and I have now started this time consuming task to be able to use my itunes library.   Meanwhile I cannot attach my iPod to the computer as I am told this will clear the iPod drive.  So if you buy this great item be careful if you need to move your songs to another drive or computer. There is a way to do it, but it is not the most obvious way.

<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple needs to get there enginers to make a player with a little bit different design if look at it, it looks like any other ipod. you cant tell the difference between any of them only size, it gets boring and the finish on it is tarrible it scrtches and to me its very uncoftrible in my big hands. Any body that is going to buy this dont because there are to many problems with ipods and for starters the constomer service is terrable if something goes wrong with your ipod dont bother sending it in under the warrenty because you may not get it back for atleast 2 months. Apple tries to get the warrenty to go out then fix it and charge you that is what happened to me. I said just keep it because there is no point in having a broken ipod. So i switched over to creative which has much better survises player has had no problems. Ipod is over rated and it wasn't even the first creative was with there muvo jukebox. Would you rather have an ipod that has problems and cost more or you could a creative spend less and get better mp3 such as the creative zen v which i have now i spent 120 on a 2 GB while an apple nano costs 150 not a huge difference but its still a difference. I almost forgot my player holds 1000 songs because i use WMA and a two GB nano will hold 500 to get a player that would hold as much as mine does it would cost 180. Now that is a big difference stick with creative not Apple. Other than those problems it is not a taribble player, as long as it works.

<Title>Buy two, your going to need them in the long run.
<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(Ryan Gonce)-About 2 years ago I bought my first Ipod for $375. Within a year the hard drive crashed. Luckily I was able to send it in to Apple and receive a "new" Ipod. These presses took about 6 weeks to complete. I was so happy to receive, what I thought, was a brand new scratch free Ipod. Though it was scratch free, I later found out that it was only a refurbished Ipod which was thrown together and sent back to me. Within another year the hard drive crashed again. Two times was enough for me. I called Apple and told them the issue I was having. Their exact words were, "You're better off buying a new one!" They told me that it would be $260 to repair an Ipod that they had thrown together for me. To me this was ridiculous. If your car broke down within a year, wouldn't you want a new one? Not a refurbished POS someone had just returned. After waiting on the customer service line from 4:30pm-6:00pm on hold all they could tell me was that I was screwed. They stated that they didn't have to tell me it was refurbished and that they could do nothing for me. I am telling you this as a warning. My girlfriend also purchased an Ipod about a year after mine. Within a year it began to freeze and would randomly stop playing her music. She sent it in 3 times to have then said there was nothing wrong with it. I'm not sure what Apples customer service is trying to do, but it is definite lost a customer. I was an Ipod owner, loved my Ipod, but not enough to spend $250-350 on a new one every two years. If you do happen to buy an Ipod I wish you luck in the years to come. I'll be investing some time into the Microsoft zune.

<Title>It keeps getting better (still with the same old problems though)
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't know about you but I have a pretty abusive relationship with my Ipod. I started off with my first Ipod, a 20gb back in 2004. A year later, it crashed and burned and went to Ipod heaven. Which takes us to 2005. I replaced my 20gb with a 30gb. One year later, can we guess what happens now? You bet that baby did the same thing. crash/burn/heaven. Which now takes us to two weeks ago. I went to best buy and made the jump from 30gb to 80gb. The screen, is brighter and the battery life is so much better (thankfully) Also, the size is really why I went for it. Being that I listen to music that normally have longer song lengths, I could only get maybe 5,250 on my 30 gb on a good day. Whenever i'd get to that point, i'd have to delete songs just to add new ones and basically, it was just a real pain. So now, I no longer have that problem and doubt I will for a while now. again though, I don't exspect it to last more than a year, plus with them being over 300 dollars, having an Ipod is going to be a long term pain basically. It still is very much worth it as music is a huge part of my life. now all I have to do is rip my albums to itunes and add them to my Ipod. My biggest complaint, is not that it scratches, or smudge marks. I am very much used to that, plus that isn't  something a case couldn't easily fix. The fact that, in the two weeks I have owned my ipod. It has frozen on me twice. Then there is the annoying action of having to wait for the battery to die and having to let it charge again. Other than that, the positive as usual outweigh the negative with the Ipod. So, if you have the cash and can deal with the annoying aspects of it, this is very much worth it. Enjoy.

Considering the fact that Apple computers have many firewire ports and emphasizes the value of firewire, it's a [...]that this 'best' version doesn't support firewire data transfer.  [...]

<Content>First of all, I have to say how much I absolutely love my iPod.  I am really enjoying using it and having all of my cd's on there (and I have many, many, many cd's).  It's such an amazing product and I only wish I'd bought one earlier. Secondly, I have to tell people out there that if you are like me (or what I used to be like), don't think that this is some complex piece of equipment that you won't be able to use.  My biggest concern had always been how to download music onto it and everyone kept telling me just how easy it was to do that.  I never believed anyone because everyone swears by how easy it is and I've heard that all before without it actually being easy.  This however ... is super easy to use.  Just put your cd into the computer and itunes asks you if you want to import the cd.  You say yes (untick any songs you don't want) and after you've done a few cd's, you plug the iPod into the computer and sit back while it downloads for you.  I wish I'd known earlier. Itunes is easy too to use.  The only problem I have with it here in Australia, is the variety is poor and minimal.  We don't have great R&B or hip hop music to download, and no movies or new TV shows.  I wish Australia would get with the program and move their behinds. The quality in the sound and picture (for music videos) are both superb and I really really enjoy this.  I have downloaded close to over 650 cd's and I'm not even halfway through my capacity.  It's the best invention of late and I hope that people who think it's complex to operate would read this and understand that if I can do it; anyone can.  I hope you love your iPod as much as me.  And PS. ... Black is the only way to go.

<Title>this was definitely worth the wait!
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i started out with a 64mb diamond rio pmp500 in 2000, then a 256mb samsung yp55 in 2003.  I pretty much held out on buying an ipod because of the price and not having a mac.  Well that changed when i bought a powerbook g4 last winter and the ipod prices dropped this past september... i just had to get an ipod.  First off, the great thing about the ipod is not the hardware itself, but it's the software that really makes the ipod shine.  Yes the ipod is really nice and has great features, but itunes allows the ipod to become the complete package in audio/video portability.  You can carry all your music, photos, contacts, videos, calender info, etc on the ipod.  You can even use it to store files if you've run out of space on your computer.  Although the screen is only 2.5" big watching movies on it isnt a problem at all... it comes out nice and clear.    I have no regrets buying my ipod, it's everything i wanted and more!  But be warned, you'll probably want to buy a mac after getting this.

<Title>FIX THIS DEVICE!
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Want to buy this new one, as my old one is crapping out, (the central "select" button is wearing out), but cannot quite bring myself to part with the money.  Should my $300+ device be worn out in a year?  And what about the battery that is not really replaceable and is too small, and the problems with iTunes?  I was looking for an improvement in the new iPods, not just refinements in the size!  iTunes does not work well.  It garbles information, esp when downloading cds, but sometimes at random, and now refuses to play whenever another program is running.  The battery needs to be a rechargeable/renewable.  It could just as easily take AA batteries, or a clip type battery like old cell phones?  How about making the unit compatable with other providers?  If Apple is determined to have it all; service, hardware,operating system, consumer sales, then it had better get it's act together.  It's not enough to just show up.

<Content>I just got the 80GB iPod, it's my first iPod or MP3 player of any type.  I find the design simple, elegant, and functional.  I love it.  It took a few days to get all my CDs loaded, but it's been working flawlessly.  After reading about problems others had with scratching the surface, and seeing that the junky little carrying case included in the box is sub-standard, I went online and found an excellent protective case (the ToughSkin case made by Speck), which is a tough rubberized case with a clear protective cover for the iPod's video screen.  Now I'm a happy little camper.

<Title>Very convenient, but the sound quality underwhelms
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After hearing so much about iPod from people I respect and reviews galore, I finally broke down and bought one.  Not sure I'll keep it, I must say.  I've had this for a few days and listened to a LOT of varied music, ranging from new recordings of Mahler symphonies to Cassandra Wilson to the Chemical Brothers.  I give the iPod an "A" for convenience.  But the bottom line for a portable audio device (still iPod's primary function) is the quality of the sound.  And even with reasonable (though not audiophile) earbuds (Sennheiser CX300-B), the sound quality is not that great.  On this iPod, even uncompressed WAV files lack the sound depth that I heard (with the same earbuds) on my old iRiver SlimX CD player.  And if you listen to something with challenging bass demands (e.g., Chemical Brothers), harmonic distortion is inescapable.  It's pretty frustrating.  A related irritation is the absence of the obvious feature for addressing the sound quality issue:  a user-configurable EQ setting.  iPod offers a bunch of pre-defined settings (e.g., "rock", "dance") that supposedly optimize the sound for an Apple engineer's conception of the genre.  But imagine a digital camera that offered only the pre-defined combinations of aperture and shutter speed settings for various types of pictures (e.g., "portrait", "sports") without even giving the user the option of adjusting these settings himself/herself.  That's effectively what iPod sticks us with.  There is much to like about iPods.  The convenience is undeniable.  The form factor is elegant.  And the user interface, integration with iTunes, etc. warrant the praise they've received.  But for heaven's sake:  I wish that SOMEBODY who makes portable audio devices would remember that job number 1 is _sound quality_.  At least so far, iPod's sound quality is its worst feature, and this new model only continues the broader decline of quality standards among portable audio products.

<Title>My First Ipod
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The high price was the only thing that held me back on buying an Ipod before. I've had my Ipod for a couple of weeks now and I can't think of a product that made a better impression on me than the Ipod. It's a joy unpacking the thing (How could they stuff it all in that small box?) from the very start it feels like your unpacking something special. A review isn't complete without at least one point of comment though: a very labor intensive activity is to keep your music library organized by adding artwork (Album covers) and assigning Genres etc. to the songs. The problem is that the only thing you can do from the Ipod is to rate the songs. The only way you can change/delete your files is from the pc and I don't spend much time listening to my music while behind the pc so this would be a very useful feature on the Ipod that I hope will be available on a future firmware update. (Fingers crossed) If you are thinking of buying an Ipod and considering an alternative make, I advise you to stop wasting your time. The Ipod will not disappoint. Promise!

<Title>do not buy. I want my money back
<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Instead of paying my car bill, I chose to buy the ipod 5th gen 80gb. that was not the right thing to do. purchase it from wal-mart, drove to my  house and could not wait to start. problems problems problems.  1. plug it to my computer, the light came on once and never to be seen again. rush to walt-mart, they gave me another one.   2. Plug it in to my brandnew macbook. the light came on "yippie" this time itune wont read, have to download itune. no problem. do not disconnect sign never came off. at this point i'm just sad. called Apple, support staff are CLUELESS. took it back to wal-mart, manager at wal-mart looks at me funny. they gave me another one.   3. working. YES. download a stack of song, am very happy. two days later. lights will not come on. lost my receipt. wal-mart manager will not exchange, called apple, i was sent to apple store 1hr away from my house. staff ignored me. finally they zap it with something and it work while i was in the car.  4. at home will not work. called apple, after reset and reboot. NOTHING. finally apple agree for me to send it to them for another one. at this point i'm thinking the gods are laughing at me for spending so much money on such stupid thing, hell i could've send it to a country that needed it for food or something.   5. true to their word, they sent me a box free shipping. two days later got my new apple. so far this is my 4th one and none are working. very quickly apple sent me my new ipod. it works until two days later I get a very low battery sign. let it sign for 10hrs, same thing. At this poing I want to cry. went on apple website, there are many people complaining about the same thing. WTF. no response from apple.   6. called apple, pleaded with them to give me at least 1/2 of my money back. i dont want this anymore. apple agreed to sent another free shipping box to get my apple fix. at this point i dont care.   The apple people must know they are feeding us items that are not fit to be sold because it was too easy for them to say that they will replace it for me. how many times can you replace one item. honestly one day another reliable company will come up with something better than apple that will wipe them out of the competition. i'm a hugh apple fan. now when i go to the computer store and see something by apple i move away from it. i keep begging for my money back but can get it back. if the next one they send me doesnt work i will go straight to the lake by house and throw it there.   will keep you posted  if i still have the energy. by the way own three computer at home plus a mac book. my computers work fine.

<Title>Not for Classical
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're into rock, hip hop, jazz ect, generally any music except for classical you will love your ipod. I put all my non classical cd's in it, and I had in it with no problem Dave Matthews, U2 so on and so forth. It goes and gets the cd artwork and info from the cd; it's great for this.   BUT the biggest part of my musical addiction is classical. I have a 40gb IRiver H340 that the battery is going on and is no longer working correctly. All the files are WMA not MP3, so they either have to be converted to work in the ipod or reinstalled. I have about 500 cd's of classical music from A-Zelenka, and the thought of having to reinstall all the information in the correct order has me about to pull my hair out. FYI It doesn't convert a file it converts one piece of music at a time. This means you have to manually click on each piece to convert. And it displays them in itunes in what I would call a "random order". I'm not a classical snob but I want the information displayed on the screen of the ipod to at least be correct. It either picks the wrong information for the cd, or it doesn't group the whole cd as one cd. And I don't want to see U2 or Enya listed as a composer. I like U2 but Musica Antiqua Cologne under Reinhard Goebel is a little different then U2. Yea yea I know its differentiated by genres, WRONG. J.P. Rameau's Les Fetes d'Hebe was listed as alternative & punk not classical. Just another thing I'll have to fix. Apple won the MP3 war, but my war with my ipod is just starting.

<Title>Works Great for Classical, Podcast playback could improve
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this 5.5 generation iPod after reading the that 6th generation is a lemon.  This has probably to do with Apple changing the internal components to lower the price.  Everything got up and running easily.  Since I already have iTunes and a 3rd generation hard-drive iPod, I just used the charger that came with that one to charge my new one.  Syncing with iTunes 7.5 was easy, and mysteriously it named my iPod after my husband because the Windows PC has his name as default.  The only glitch is that I could not eject my iPod 5.5 Gen (like I can my 3rd Gen) from iTunes.  Windows complains that some file on the iPod is being accessed.  What I had to do was to go to the Explorer, select the drive letter that was assigned to the iPod and "eject" there.  Then go to the Stop devices and stop that device.  In any case, the iPod "Do not Disconnect" was gone, and I unplugged it, even though Windows complains that it could not stop the device.  The clickwheel is slightly different than the touchwheel on my 3rd generation which feels more responsive.  But it works okay.  Regarding the comment on Classical music, if the albums you import have ID tags online, then all of it imports correctly, including artist, song title, etc.  I have lots of classical albums and it works fine.  Also, if you want the iPod to remember where it was, you need to go to "Get Info"->"Options" tab, and check the box "Remember Playback Position".  This way if you're in the middle of a long symphony and you turn off your iPod, you can get back to it.  What I can't believe is that the iPod software is so lame when it comes to Podcasts.  Each Podcast episode is "1 of 1", and listed in reverse chronological order.  This means that if you want to listen to it in chronological order, you must scroll all the way to the end.  Then you select the episode, and as soon as it is finished, it pops back to the main menu, and you have to click and scroll all over again to get to the second episode.  If you select the Title of the Podcast category, and click "play", you'll get the last episode, after which it jumps back to the main menu.  You'd think that Apple, the inventor of podcasts would by default create a chronologically ordered playlist by default of any podcast and allow you to play it as a collection starting at "1 of 100", with the back and next buttons allowing you to go back and forth.  In anycase after more research I found out that you have to go to iTunes on the PC and create a playlist.  You can then drag/drop the episodes in the order you want to hear it.  Or you can create a "Smart Playlist", and it'll create one in alphabetical order, which usually works out to be in chronological order (but not always, depends on naming convention of the Podcaster).  I could not figure out how to make a "Smart Playlist" go in chronological order, so if someone knows how, please comment.

<Title>The Way it Should Be
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had previously owned a Philips GOGear HDD6330 30GB mp3 player and had many many problems.  Mostly with syncing the songs onto the device and also some with proper playback.  The interface was also not as nice nor responsive as the iPod.  So I returned the Philips and got the 80GB iPod.  It has not let me down once.  It sounds great, the battery lasts for days (4-6 hours a day use).  itunes is very easy to use and seems to almost know what you need to do before you do.  podcasts are neat and free, you can download tons of videos from google video, you can put pictures on it, no problems finding accessories.  It is really just night and day vs. the current windows based offerings.  I have about 6,500 songs, 50 videos, 200 photos, and all of my outlook contacts on my iPod and it is only about half full.  Not to mention the games that come with it.  If you don't mind spending a little more for quality, this is the way to go, it just works.  My wife also has the 30GB white version and loves it.  it does have a lot less space and shorter battery life than the 80 GB, but it is about 1/2 the thickness and still has all of the other features that make iPods so great.  We also both sync using the same itunes without any problems (turn off auto syncing to do this and drag songs etc to device.)  This was not the case when we both were using Philips GoGears and Windows Media Player.  Everyone else that I know that owns an iPod has never said anything bad about them, Apple really has a winner here, it would take a lot of convincing to ever switch me back over to windows based mp3 systems.

<Title>Best iPod Yet--Absolutely Incredible
<Date>Mon Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Despite being a PC person, I purchased an iPod mini a couple of years back and was impressed with how simple and elegant it was.  I followed this up with a Nano for my wife and was very happy with the improvements, even if it was not as tough as the mini.  The iPod Video blew me away.  For those of you who wonder if you can really watch a show on that so-called little screen, the answer is a definitive yes.  It is bright, clear and large enough when holding to cause you to forget you are watching that sized screen.  Everything about this one is better--battery life, brighter screen, unit size, memory.  I bought the 80G version and highly recommend it.  The only (minor) downside with the black is that it can hold fingerprints, but with a protective cover--which is recommended--this is a non-issue.

<Title>Be careful, this device is incompatable with most PC's
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Without going into the quality of the IPOD you need to be warned about one thing.  This device requires the WinXP operating system with service pack 2 installed and a broadband connection.  You cannot get the software without the broadband connection (at 35 megs don't even think of trying to download it over a dial-up) and even if you download it at your local library when you try and install it on your home PC it will hang up since it's looking for that internet connection.  The other point to remember is that SP2 is required for the computer to be able to sense and communicate with the IPOD.  Check your computer carefully before you buy.  If you computer was built/purchased before about Sept. of 2004 and you haven't upgraded the operating system you will not have service pack 2 installed and the IPOD won't sync with iTunes.  You can always download the patch from Microsoft but be careful.  The reason that over 50% of the pre-service pack 2 computers were never upgraded was because of trouble with the patch, incompatabilies with programs or other issues.  Very few people recommended the installation of the pack (except for Microsoft, of course) and rather suggested the purchase of security software, since the majority of what SP2 did was to install heightened security on the PC.

<Title>It gets ugly fast
<Date>Fri Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i don't like how easy it get scratch, and if u get the black one even worst, i went shopping for cases but they get scratch inside the cases too, just by been in the case, i return the case, then i when for those clear stickers and i recomend to put those on on a really clean table and very dry and clean hands may be use glove cause a little touch and there goes your finger print in the sticker, and with a black ipod you can't miss it. and if u don't take your time u will have a lot of air bubbles showing in your ipod, so after a week looks like something that i have for a year, it sucks.

<Title>Great as always, with some quirky flaws..
<Date>Sat Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>You can't beat the sound quality, and video quality. The changeable menus are great too. It's a solid "buffer" in between Apple's legacy design and interface, and the new lines coming out soon that will surely turn people's heads. Why did they leave the charger adapted out of the package? No install CD? Apple's software updater can be annoying too. But, in summary, great sound quality, and hell... it's an ipod!

<Title>Lack of Video Support compared to Zen!! Only con i see, but its a big deal
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Im would love to buy this 80GB iPod, i really would. The only thing keeping me from buying such a beautifully looking designed piece of technology is the lack of video format support. Ive looked at the Zen and it supports a ton of video formats, but the one thing that keeps me from buying it is it looks really ugly and plasticky. I hate having to convert my recorded TiVO shows just to upload to my iPod, its way too time consuming. Maybe "it's not what's on the outside, but whats on the inside that counts" might apply here too. Im going to decide tomorrow and i might up flipping a coin.  Boy would i love that iPod but that lacking video format support just turns me off.

<Title>Best iPod and iTunes combination yet!
<Date>Sun Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 80GB (and 30GB) 5.5 Generation iPods are remarkable! Sound quality has always been good with iPods but I clearly hear (coming from a 4 Generation unit) that the sound is even better. Apple has done great work on this and, combined with their newly designed (and much more comfortable!)  headphones, it's as pleasant as ever. At home I plug my iPod into a separate headphone amp and use expensive full-size headphones and, believe me, I can tell the difference between these two generations. Sound was very good before and is even better now.   The new iTunes 7.0 software is excellent. Gapless music playback is a wonderful addition! No more "dead space" between tracks that were meant to be played smoothly from one to the other. There's also various album cover art views, free album cover art from the iTunes store, integrated control of your iPod, and an even easier way to control what is synched (or not synched) to your iPod. An easy to use product is now even easier to use. It's the perfect compliment to the iPod.   And what a great value these iPods are! Two months ago you'd pay $300 for the 30GB model and $400 for a 60GB. Now they're each $50 less and yet they have much brighter screens, gapless music playback, the new headphones, 75% longer battery life, and software searching with the wheel to easily find any track/artist/album. In the case of the high-end model (the one I now own), they also added an extra 20GB of hard disk space (80GB instead of 60).

<Title>Great Sound, Good Video, Still Has Hard Drive Crash Issues
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I first saw the Apple 80 GB iPod Video at a friend's house, and I knew that the only thing standing in the way of getting one of these fine new mp3 players was my wife's permission. One day, she told me that she could use an mp3 player to store all of her worship today praise choir songs. I knew that this was the appointed time, so I offered to give her my iPod if I could have permission to get this new one as an early Christmas present.   Cha Ching! Now I have the iPod! The sound is terrific, the video screen is sharp and pretty, and the controls work like a charm.  But I am sorry to report that these things still have hard drive crash issues. I have already had the thing freeze twice on me during playback, and I had to load my songs three times before they would play properly, and I wasted many, many hours fighting with my new toy. I may have to go back to the store and get another one if I continue to have issues, but for now, I finally have the songs loaded, and they are working well (at leasr for the moment). The videos also work nicely, and you will want to get an audio/video cord so that you can watch your downloaded videos on your TV.  I recommend this mp3 player, but I pray you get one that doesn't have the crash issues where you constantly have to reboot the unit or reload your crashed music library.  Rev. Marc Axelrod

<Title>A defective Ipod
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchase my Ipod in December and loved it, but have not used it much.  A week ago I tried to use the Ipod and discovered that the battery would not hold the charge, so I called apple to report the problem.  They asked me to ship the Ipod to them, but I would have to pay a standard $30.00 for shipping.  They sent me a shipping carton to package the Ipod for shipping, but the mailing label was not in my name (someone else's name), and all the instructions were in Spanish. It took me at least three hours and numerous calls to apple to sort out the problem...I am now waiting for the new carton they promised, with English instructions. I am mad that I am being charged shipping cost when the Ipod is practically new, still under warranty, and initially was so expensive.  I am assuming that they will now send me a refurbished Ipod.  What bothers me most is that after buying this expensive (now defective) PDA, I have to pay shipping costs for them to fix the problem.

<Title>I Use mine all the time
<Date>Wed Oct 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod is great, I love mine, I have over a thousand songs, a hundred pictures, and a half hour Beavis & Butt-head movie, and it's barely made a dent in the storage space. BUT.. sometimes in my car adapter it goes nuts. It jumps from one screen to another randomly. Also, I don't like that when you are in a playlist, you can't shuffle WITHIN that playlist. You can only shuffle all the songs. I don't want to shuffle all 1000 songs, just the ones in my heavy metal playlist! Unless I am missing some trick, but I don't think I am. But overall, it's great to have an ipod. Purists sneer at them because the sound may not be as perfect as it could be, but you know what, it's good enough for 99% of the headphones and car stereo speakers it will be played on. If you are a hardcore sound perfectionist, this isn't for you. If you are tired of juggling CD's in your car, this is much more compact, however you can still be distracted fiddling with the wheel control in the car, and unless you are driving a tank, that's dangerous. If you are considering getting your first ipod, get a good case for it, and buy it online so you can get the laser engraving done on the back. I wish I had done that.

<Title>Best Purchase Ever
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off this is a great product. I can not believe I have gone without one for this long. I would highly recommend the 80 Gig as it is more versatile with holding video, pictures, and TV shows. Also you can load contacts etc.  I use this everyday on the train to work and it sure makes the long road trips easier to handle. I would recommend purchasing a few products with this as you will find them very useful.   First off purchase the iCare as it adds another year and phone support for your iPod.  Next purchase the FM transmitter for your car this comes in handy on road trips.  Also a plug adapter for charging your iPod with out the PC / Laptop.  Better earbuds help with the bass and treble in your music, wouldn't hurt to get a splitter for a friend on a plane also.  Have fun with your iPod!

<Title>So much room and not enough songs
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've always thought iPods were overrated, and I still do.  But, I had to give the 80gb iPod five stars because of its functions, and the storage size.  I've had this for about two months and I just managed to fill a quarter of it, including podcasts and some music videos (though for some reason sound is lost in them).  The shuffle modes are great but only compared to the Sansa e260, since that's the only other mp3 player I've owned.  You can shuffle albums, and it seems to shuffle songs in an album, but I forget what I did to do that.  My sansa didn't really shuffle albums well, it would play a couple of songs, then off it went to the next album.  This iPod never does that.  If you don't care about shuffling albums, then this is neither a bonus nor a minus. I bought this fully aware that it didn't have a FM radio built in, and though it would have been nice, I knew that I would have to give that up so I could start carrying around my entire CD library in this little thing.  But, in place of radio (sort of) you get podcasts, of which some can really be interesting, and through iTunes, you can get a free song each week (though you may have to wait a couple of weeks to get a song you really like). Overall, I'm very happy with it.  One downside to owning an iPod, though, is that accessories (especially the ones that you could really use) cost a lot (more than what they're really worth).  If you have the money, and you don't really care about FM radio, I would recommend this.  And please, don't buy this then complain that it doesn't have a FM radio tuner built in, because Apple never said it did.  Know what you're getting into before you buy something.  That's all.

<Title>Where Is Bluetooth
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>More of the same in most respects: the good, the bad, and the ugly.    But the most obvious limitation is the lack of Bluetooth. Currently to use with Bluetooth it is necessary to buy an adapter (I use TEN Technology naviPlay Bluetooth Stereo Adapter for iPod - that doesn't fit that well alone and doesn't fit with any protective cover.  The functionality with a Bluetooth enabled cell phone once it is all set up is great.  You listen to iPod when call comes in you here tone on headset and can switch to phone and when you hang up phone back to iPod.  It is also great in the gym or running or working out.  No cord between iPod and headphones to get twisted up and pull out.  But as mentioned the technology to add Bluetooth to the iPod is really a kluge.  As more and more quality Bluetooth enabled headsets become available enabling the iPod with Bluetooth is really a no brainer.  The need is obvious; the technology trivial, Apple must know this is a must.  The failure to do so may be to provide an advantage to the iPod cell phone, but failure to do so seems to have more to do with greed than anything else.  Hopefully the lack of Bluetooth is why Apple chose to designate this generation as 5.5. Maybe in 6, but then again MS Word does not have iPod in their spell check dictionary.

If they wait long enough and keep the price the same, they will not have to pay anyone the difference.  They know nobody will buy this at this price since the new ones are out.  Why else would they sell these at elevated price (knowing nobody in their right mind would buy them)?  My friend who bought one at Costco has 90 days to return with no questions asked.  I wish I had done the same.

<Content>I have purchased the iPods since the first day they came out and I have to tell you that it is a love/hate purchase. I am on my 4th iPod with a hard drive and they have all crashed within 1 -2 yrs.  Now that the Nano has come out which is not a hard drive as the iPods they are more durable.  Of course, with the Nano you only get a max of 8GB but I am going to take that and live with it as I am so tired of having the large iPods crash.  I am not up for spending $300 plus every two yrs on this kind of device.  Apple really lacks in customer service on this product.  FYI: I have been and still am an Apple advocate as I love their products but the iPods with the large hard drives ARE A SERIOUS ALERT~!!!!  If you are new to this type of purchase and have a concern for where you put your money, then buy the 8 GB Nano as there is not a hard drive issue there.  BEWARE OF HARD DRIVE iPODS!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>A beauty - and not a scratch in sight
<Date>Wed Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First up, I'm surprised at the comments about the scratches. What are people doing to their iPods? I thought I treated mine rough, but clearly some are throwing it out the window. My iPod is completely scratch-free after just over a month of use, and it's been painless to use. It's my fourth iPod - I bought the first model the day it was released (5 gigs - how I thought that was a lot!) and then upgraded to the third generation model. Finally I treated myself to this in order to a) carry my massive music collection b) watch videos and video podcasts and c) use with my Canon DSLR camera. (I also have a Shuffle - a great device for the gym!)  The screen looks small but I'm surprised how immersive an experience it is to watch video on it. I thought about waiting for the rumoured large-screen video iPod but reasoned that I actually don't need something so big or battery-hungry and am really pleased with the current screen size. It's also really good at displaying photos, either on the screen (nice, crisp images and colour reproduction) or on TV or data projector.  Sound is good too, though they no longer provide those little black covers for the earbuds which mean mine keep dropping out (I suppose my ears aren't compatible!) Anyway, I used the ones from the old iPod...  I like the new features such as the letters that pop up on screen when you scroll through long lists, and the search feature. The new games are great too - Bejewelled and Texas Hold 'Em helped me through a tedious train journey recently.  As for my old iPods, well I'm glad to report that they maintained their value and were happily sold to new loving parents ;-) Personally I'd be wary of any reviewer that says theirs cracked, or the battery failed or whatever - either they got a duff one (and by a the law of averages, there have to be a few in every batch) or they're not telling the truth. Seriously - I've been a happy iPod user for over five years now and I've not only never had a problem with any of mine, no one I know has either (and there are a lot of iPod owners near me!)  Buy with confidence.

The iRiver was a great mp3 player but the iPod does so much more besides having a color screen, album cover support, and thank god for gapless playback.    I had to go to the 80 Gb as my music collection is 40 GBs (ripped at 128 - 192 kbps) I also have over 1000 pictures and 50 home movies of my 4 month old son and wife. not to mention podcasts and movies. not much on the tv shows though.

<Title>Good for music, only fair for video
<Date>Sun Dec 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought the 80GB iPod about 6 weeks ago, and exchanged it after a week since it kept locking up and re-booting itself several times a day, especially while playing videos (but also with mp3 files or photos.)  My new one has similar problems, and I frequently have to "re-boot" the iPod to get it working again after it locks up if I try to watch a video.   I have tried reinstalling the operating software as suggested on the Apple site, but that didn't seem to improve the situation.  Overall, I am generally happy with the iPod, but my primary use was always planned to be audio.  I don't think my replacement iPod works any better, I just have given up on watching video and only mostly use it for audio now.  Just doing that is not too frustrating.  My suggestion is - don't get your hopes up about easily watching movies or TV shows on your iPod.  The whole reason I bought an iPod in the first place was that I figured Apple had worked out all the bugs by now, but apparently not.

<Title>This makes my day...
<Date>Mon Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>...every single day! I don't know why other users are having big troubles in using this device, this is my second ipod, the first one was a 4th gen. 20 gb, which I had for 2 years and sold it in really good conditions (battery still lasted 12 hrs.), little bit scratched, but all in all in near perfect conditions, I have a 80gb 5.5 gen. ipod for 1 month now and guess what, it has worked to prefection, I have itunes in both of the computers I work with, my laptop at home and my pc at work, and in both  my ipod performs pretty well.............sound quality it certainly doesn't suck, I sometimes plug my ipod to a really decent home stereo and wow! it blows up! even if the transfer is analog and not digital, excellent performance............and the earbuds, well, they have improved it, more comfortable to your ears, better sound..............I really recommend this device for hours and hours of entertainment...   LET ME ADD ONE MORE THING, A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE!!!  IF YOU LOVE LIVE ALBUMS OR CLASSICAL MUSIC ALBUMS, WELL, WITH THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS THERE WAS THE ANNOYING SPACING TIME BETWEEN EACH SONG, AND I REALLY HATED THAT FOR A LIVE ALBUM! IT IS SUPPOSED TO PLAY CONTINOUS WITH ZERO INTERRUMPTIONS!! WELL, GUESS WHAT, THE 5.5 GEN HAS NO THIS ANNOYING SPACING TIME, SO YOU LISTEN TO YOUR LIVE ALBUMS LIKE THEY WHERE TYE PHYSICLA CDS!!!

<Title>Gorgeous!  A beautiful precision instrument
<Date>Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 80GB iPod continues Apple's streak of home run iPod products, and it is a beautiful, precision instrument that anyone would be happy to own.  Mine arrived yesterday (8.24.2007) and I immediately interfaced it to iTunes and synched up my music and photos.  What a thrill to have essentially infinite space for songs, and plenty of room for photos to show friends.  The 80GB iPod fit nicely into my Kensington cradle for interfacing with our Bose stereo, and with the supplied adaptor it fit nicely into the Bose outdoor speakers' cradle.    I selected the black unit, and I am glad I did--it looks sensational, although my previous white one did too.  The click wheel on the 80GB unit has a subtly different feel to it from my older 20GB unit, a more "heavy duty" feel that I really like a lot.  The big color display on the 80GB iPod is gorgeous, and it is great fun to see album covers displayed as the unit plays all my favorite tunes.  It is great for the occasional movie.  I have loaded several movies and TV episodes (Star Trek) on the IPOD and they are great fun to watch.  Due to its small size, the picture is as crisp as a razor!  Very cool.  The 80GB size allows storage of quite a few films and TV episodes, too.  A good pair of headphones, such as my Bose stereo headphones, is definitely a nice-to-have.  With 80GB storage, the iPod makes a very satisfactory place to stash photos during trips--even with all my songs loaded on, there is tons of capacity for temporarily downloading photos to it as an ordinary HDD.  Buyers will want some kind of protective case for this iPod since all iPods are doubtless prone to scratching otherwise.  Fortunately, iPod covers have become a cottage industry and there are an infinite number to choose from.  My old iPod's leather cover, with the plastic protection for the display, fits the new iPod just fine and protects the display and body of the iPod.  This is a wonderful product that everyone is going to want!

<Title>Still the Best
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple still makes the best mp3 players around, in my opinion. I bought this to replace a stolen, 4th generation, 30 GB iPod. This one is faster, more reliable, has better battery life, has more space, cost about the same, and looks cooler.  Pros:  - sleek  - easy to use  - reliable (old iPod would hang up very frequently while caching music; this one does not)  - battery life improved  - iTunes makes life easy (despite being the only DRM-enabled source for audio files on iPods)  Cons:  - battery life still needs improvement  - still fails to start up sometimes when battery is at roughly 30%; plugging it in for just a moment gets it going again  - scratches.*   * I haven't had enough scratching to bother me, but I do think it scratches a little easily. Nearly all of the scratches I can find on mine are (a) on the metal backing or (b) on the center button of the click wheel. In other words, the inevitable scratches are all cosmetic on my iPod - none of them interfere with my actual enjoyment of the product by being, say, on the screen.  All in all, a great player, and one I'm glad I bought.

<Title>Very nice but not as well built as the 4G and less accessories
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Apple has actually raised the price buy making you buy the AC adapter seperately.  There are no longer any foam covers for the earbuds included either.  The do give you a fabric case but I can't see anyone using it much as you cannot operate the iPod controls when it is in it.  While it is a nicely built machine, the 4th generation 60G appears to be more solidly built.  Also, I have had to reset the software twice in two weeks.  With the 4G it was twice in about 2 years and I used it more often.

<Title>Common issues with the iPod
<Date>Thu Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>All the reviews are very complimentary about the iPod...and I agree with all of them. I use the iPod a lot and have had the odd problem/question. This actually prompted me to do some research on the web and find the most common problems/questions on the iPod. Ive listed them below. Feel free to add to this (does amazon allow that?)  1) My iTunes is not recognizing my iPod For Windows users. After connecting an iPod, it doesn't show up in iTunes (but is seen in My Computer).  Yeah, this is a pickle. iTunes is the iPod management software, so if it doesn't see the iPod you cannot do anything with it. There are several possible fixes.  2) I get the "Do not disconnect" message on my iPod screen. The iPod connects to your computer by way of a USB port. All devices that connect using USB must be "unmounted" before you unplug them. The "Do Not Disconnect" message lets you know that you still have to unmount the iPod.  3) How do I convert my movies (DVD) to view on my iPod (video)? Convert DVD filed into iPod format. Follow these simple steps. How to transfer music from ipod to itunes (computer). Basically, in order to transfer songs from the iPod to your computer, you have to undermine the design of the iPod. Whenever you use a device in a way it's not designed, you increase the chances that it'll break. That said, a lot of people have done this with no problems and it's a real life saver if your computer crashed and you lost your whole iTunes music library.  4) How do I use my ipod as a Hard drive: Havent foubd a great way to do this.  5) ipod Battery problem Im guessing majority of these is bcos people have not charged it!!  6) iPod Frozen Ive seen this soo many times..has actually never happened to me yet. Will do some more research and post solutions to this.

<Content>The 80 gig ipod is great! It is funny to see these ipod haters who don't own one or have used one rip it apart. Go get a job and find something better to do. I originally wanted anything but the Apple ipod, because of the ban wagon syndrome.  After my research there was no question.....i was wrong, ipod is number one for a reason.   The 80 gig video ipod does everything I want it to. I have home videos, movies, my entire photo album and of course music on this thing. It does everything I expect. Video might be hard to see on the screen but for what you have to work with it looks great. I watched Scarface the other day on a flight and I had to pick it back up after I landed (even though I have seen it many times). All of the accessories that you can add to this player makes it worth the 330.

<Title>Four stars for the size, functionality, and ease of use....But c'mon Apple, make a scratch resistant case already!
<Date>Thu Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I have been an IPod fan for a while and was thrilled to see this new model come out in 80GB with video capability, color screen and the whole works. This is a perfect item for those who want to carry around the bulk of their music as well as their online video library. For those like me who have hours of tv shows and movies I like to carry around, the 80GB version is definitely the better way to go than the 30GB. Battery life is excellent and the color screen is crisp and clear, although I still hate the earbuds with a passion bordering on wanting to crush them with a bat. "I'll show you PC LOAD LETTER!"   The casing is sleek and very visually appealing, but looks apparently come at the price of the high sensitivity to scratching. Even babying the IPod wont keep it from getting dinged. You would have thought they could have fixed this by now, but they didn't, and that's a big negative for this model. At least this problem is a known commodity, allowing you to decide if it's worth the money. And speaking of worth, the price point seems well suited for Christmas buyers. For 80GB of memory (the average hard drive size on a laptop) $300 or so is not bad.   Think about the type of use you want to get out of it, and then make the your decision. If you are more a music fan with the occasional video, then go with the 30GB, and spend the extra on accessories. Some excellent headphones would be a great place to start. If there are mechanical issues, Apple will fix them under the warranty. I've had several mechanical issues with my first generation shuffle and first generation mini, and I had replacements for both in a week. If you know you are going to get the 80GB IPod, wait a few weeks after christmas. The price points usually drop a bit as Apple gets ready to start rolling out updated models. All in all, a solid product from a solid name...   A.G. Corwin  St.Louis, MO

<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>CONS: 1. keeps freezing up and crashing: they should incorporate an off switch, such a pain to have to wait for the battery to discharge! 2. takes such a long time to connect to itunes then even more time for it to sync 3. file conversion to ipod video is neither simple nor quick - you have to wait wait wait and be very patient 4. scratches easily, too easily 5. compared to my other ipods, shuffle, mini, nano and 30gb, a bit too bulky 6. most things necessary come as extras and therefore extra costs: av connections cables, necessary protection case, radio etc...  PROS:  1. gorgeous to look at: people who don't have it will be envious 2. for it's size video is good once you have finally finished with the time consuming conversion 3. sound is good  In sum, it's ok but i'm giving it 2 stars instead of 3 because it keeps hanging. They need to work on the hardware and software - and remove all the incompatibility with other files - everyone knows how to work around it anyway - you guys just cause your users a lot of irritaion!

<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this iPod to replace my first generation iPod mini, and WOW! What a difference a few years (and an extra hundred dollars) makes. The 80 GB iPod is absolutely incredible. The color screen depicts sharp, vivid images and video. Unlike my old mini, there was no software to install with this model: I just connected it to my computer and started syncing my music. The amount of storage space on the new iPod is amazing: I think I'll be able to store every single song that was ever recorded! Finally, the battery life is much better than on my old mini, which needed to be recharged every two or three hours.   In a perfect world, the iPod would come with a built-in AM/FM radio tuner. It would have an even better battery, its glossy black body wouldn't become so easily dirtied with fingerprints, and its silver backing wouldn't scratch quite as easily. However, none of these minor shortcomings are enough for me to give this iPod any less than a five-star rating. I love, love, love my new iPod...and I cannot believe my iPod mini cost a whopping $250 when I purchased it just a few short years ago. The $350 price tag for the 80 GB iPod is very reasonable, considering how much bling you get for your buck. My only fear is that Apple will soon unveil an even cooler iPod, and I'll want to upgrade once again. Hopefully they'll hold off for a little while longer...

<Title>by Flash based technology not Harddisk based.
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are many reviews I read here complaining about the Ipod freezing up after about a year. Well duh - it uses a hard disk which spins around with a little "needle" to read the tracks, so any vibrations/movement while the thing is working can potentially damage the hard disk. So guess what - you can have it in your car, on the bus, on the train or in a plain but eventually the hard disk will decide it's had enough. If you carry your player around a lot I highly recommend a flash based player. I see people with these hard disk based players on the bus and really that's a no-no.

<Title>The Best MP3 On The Market
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the 80 GB iPod from Costco 2 months ago. I used a bunch of  birthday cash for a radical device that I would otherwise not buy. It is  truely amazaing for all the things it can do. I have had no problems with lockup. Of course I bought a good case and even a mini camera bag to keep it and the accessories in. If you read any reviews about viruses,just run your anti virus program on the iPod before you load music, if viruses are present, simply delete. The most amazing thing about iPod is all the accessories to get for it. A decent set of headphones is a must because the earbuds included just don't work for most people. I own the DLO docking station and it works perfectly to pipe the sound thru your reciever, it is amazing how such a small device can create all that crystal clear sound. I have asked Santa Clause for some other accessories and I will let you know how they work out. You must try out a game that is included with the iPod called Name That Tune. The game plays 30 seconds of the song and you have to choose the artist; the quicker you choose and get it right, the more points you score, cool. If you are considering buying a like an iPod such as Zune or any of the others, don't. The iPod is the best in MP3 players.

<Title>Adults Beware, You won't want to put up with this treatment!
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My computer freezes up when I connect my new 80 GB Ipod to it, so I can't download my extensive collection of audio books to the Ipod, but I must say that the songs imported by one of the techs at the Apple store on one of my trips there do sound nice.  Aside from the sound quality, I would recommend that an adult with a PC and no patience for nonsense answers and poor treatment look for an MP3 player.  The way Apple sells and supports products is amazingly awful and disrespectful to their customers.  I started by loading the Itunes software and importing my audio books and meditation CDs into the Itunes library.  I was very happy with the ease of use of the Itunes software and the help section, which answered all my questions about importing and renaming files.  I could even turn off the screen that shows the annoying ads from the Itunes store!    The lovely black Ipod came with a very small instruction pamphlet, which I followed carefully.  After charging the Ipod for 4 hours with a ridiculously short USB cord, I opened Itunes and turned on the Ipod.  The Itunes software didn't recognize the Ipod, the Ipod froze on with a "Do Not Disconnect" message, and my computer turned itself off.    I called the Apple store and was told how to reset the Ipod.  Then the girl at the store connected me with Tech support in India.  I couldn't understand the man at all so I called the store back.  The girl at the store got snotty with me about not using a Mac and asked me just how old my PC was?    I then drove to the store where I found that:   1)	They kept asking me if I was using a Mac, as if only a freak would use a PC.   2)	They didn't want to exchange brand spanking new Ipod that didn't work for a new one, the wanted to send it away to be fixed.  Once you buy an Ipod they are not going to easily take it back, even if it doesn't work! And if you open the box they have a 10% restocking fee, should you decide to return or exchange it.  2)	They were happy to help me after I loudly exclaimed loudly to others at the cash register with stacks of Ipods in their hands that my new Ipod just froze up and wouldn't work right out of the box.   3)	Everything including a USB cord long enough to really connect the Ipod to the computer, a real carrying case and a wall charger costs extra and the prices on the accessories are very inflated. I find that to be a real rip-off.  An adult expects a product to work out of the box and to have proper basic accessories with it.  5)	The cement flooring in the stark store kills the feet of a 40 something woman after a few minutes...think of the young kids working there...bulging leg veins and foot problems in their 20s after a few weeks of work.  I find the amazingly hard floor not at all attractive and  very disrespectful to both Apple's workers and their customers.  4)	The Ipod worked when synced with a Mac and I got some songs uploaded to it that I didn't want.  6)	I was told that it must be the software so I should go home and reload the Itunes software.  So, I went home and saved my Itunes library to a disk, uninstalled the software, redownloaded Itunes and reinstalled it. Upon connection to the computer, my Ipod froze again and froze my computer.  I tried the USB 1.1 port and the Ipod and computer froze again.  I called tech support again, it was evening now, and got someone from the United States.  He was nice but didn't know much about PCs.  He said that the PC staff is only in from 6-6 PST, but they had holiday hours for Mac support.  When asked what percent of computers in this country are Mac he said 4 or 5%.  So they don't supply support for PC users during their extended helpline hours. The 95 or 96% of their buyers who own a PC aren't as important as the 4 or 5% who own a Mac.  I find that to be very disrespectful to their customers and pointed that out to the tech. He didn't disagree.  When asked about the very short cord he said that most of the designers use a laptop.  You'd think they'd test drive their designs with some PC users, wouldn't you?    So, as of this writing I cannot use the Ipod with my PC.  It could be the USB 2.0 port...which works with everything else...my camera and my Treo phone.  I went online and didn't find much information.  The scant instruction manual mentioned further information about compatible USB 2.0 cards at the ipodstore site but all I found was "Reset, Retry, Restart, Reinstall, Restore" advice.    I'll call tomorrow and see if the Ipod PC people really know PCs.  I've already wasted several hours on this expensive toy and wouldn't recommend it for adults who have no patience or time to waste.

<Title>What a sleek baby!
<Date>Sat Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's practically impossible not to love this gadget. Everything about it is smooth and sleek, including even the box it comes in.  I bought this model because I really needed the space. My multimedia collection is currently at almost 40 GB and growing. Now I can hold my entire music, video, and picture collection in one place and not worry about running out of storage anytime soon. I have been impressed so far.   The screen, though small, is very, very crisp. The pictures and movies on the screen are crystal clear and very sharp, almost like watching high definition TV on a small screen. With the right accessories, you can hook up the iPod to any TV set and enjoy your videos and pictures on a big screen. Battery life has been exceptionally excellent in this model. The calendar and contacts features are fine and sync with Microsoft Outlook easily, but don't ditch your PDA just yet.  I highly recommend this model. It is a great improvement over previous models, especially in battery life, which comes in handy if you travel a lot with your iPod.

Pros: Large, Bright Screen Very Attractive Holds A LOT of Songs and Movies Portable Fast Transfer-Some People have said the transfer was slow, but it is faster than any other mp3 player I have had  Cons: You pretty much have to use iTunes Scratches easily Freezes Up Sometimes (which you can fix by flipping the hold switch to "on" then "off"... next press the menu button and center button down for about 6-10 seconds. might have to repeat the second part - I got this from the Apple website) Slightly Bulky, but not terribly You can't take the music back off of the iPod without 3rd party software

<Title>I will always stay with an IPOD.  Apple is the best!
<Date>Thu Dec 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hello everyone.  Well, I purchased my first Ipod about 7 months ago.  It was when the 60gb came out.  My old one from Dell was about to crash, and I thought I would go with an IPOD.  I downloaded Itunes, and it easily transfered all my music on my hard drive to itunes with just one click.  All I had to do was install the IPOD software.  That wasn't a big deal either.(This is when I was still using my dell laptop.  I just recently switched to a macbook.  I have now changed sides, and I think I will only get apple computers.  You don't have the headaches at all of managing a PC, for example not worrying about viruses.)  Even with a pc IPOD is so much easier to upload your music, and pictures.  It pretty much does it all automatically when you just plug in the IPOD.  I first had a 60gb in white.  I loved it.  I got white because I heard it showed the fingerprints less.  I disagree with the people who stated that an IPOD is fragile.  I agree it is prone to scratches.  My white one does have some, but not major ones.  I have dropped my white IPOD several times.  Two of the times have been on my tile floor.  And it was still working just fine.  I expected the opposite when I picked it, but I was relieved.  I just purchase a 80gb black one.  I have been using handbrake software to put my dvd movies on my computer so, I can transfer them to my IPOD.  A two hour movie takes about a 1GB of space.  So, I thought the 80 GB would be a nice upgrade.           When my black one arrived I was very happy with it.  It looks the same.  I do think it looks better in black.  I have a clear hard case on order so, I don't get scratches on it.  I didn't order it from Amazon.  I got it from Apple because they were offering free engraving for the holiday.  Only took about five minutes to load up my entire Itunes library which was a total of 1009 items, plus 200 photos.  Just pluged it in, and it did everything on its own.  Also, you don't have to get any new accesories if you have a 30gb or 60gb video IPOD.  You can still use your current ones.          The menu settings are the same as the 60GB.  It does seem to run a little faster then the 60gb, and the screen is sharper and brighter.  I notice an improvement in the battery life when watching videos and viewing photos.  A nice improvement.  I am not saying however that if you have a older 30gb or 60gb, that it is definiyly has to be replaced with the 80gb.  The only reason I would recommended it is if you think you are going to need more space on the drive.  Or if you are like me, and like to always have to newest model.  I am going to keep my white one as a spare, or incase I have a friend who wants to use it when traveling.  I am going to use the old one to backup my laptop.           Now on to my thoughts on Apple.  I have had nothing but great experiance from them.  They are very helpful from my experiance.  As to Itunes, I don't see a downside to having to only use them.  If I find a song I want on another MP3 website that Itunes does't have, I just download it and burn it to a RW disc, then I use Itunes to rip it back on the computer.  Works fine.  Maybe a bit more work, but not a major deal.  Itunes is very good software, and very easy to use.  As with most mac software.         Anyway, my babbling is done.  I would highly recommend the 80gb IPOD.  Not a necessity if you already have the older version however.  The improvements are not that great to completly replace a working older version of the Video IPOD.  It just depends on the space needs of the individual.  So, I have now became an loyal apple user, and I will never use another kind or brand of MP3 player.  Thank you Apple for making a great product!

<Title>The most advanced and fully-featured iPod to date
<Date>Fri Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The 80 GB iPod is the most polished and fully-feature iPod to date.  Music, videos, photos, podcasts, games, and notes in the palm of your hand.  In addition, an 80 GB behemoth is at your fingertips too.  However, the iPod does have some minor but noticeable flaws.   PROS:  - Most sophisticated iPod yet with music, videos, photos and more - Brighter backlight then its preceding generation - Extended battery life gives more video playback time - Spacious 80 GB hard drive - Five year old and aging click wheel continues to show its ease of use - Well supported by the prestigious iTunes 7 media program - Overall, a well rounded media player that everybody should have   CONS:  - Overall, no new major installment to the iPod then its last version. - As its predecessor, iPod screen and especially body very prone to nicks and scratches.  Also leaves unattractive fingerprints and smudges. - Small iPod screen not ideal for extended periods of video-watching. - Very narrow video-format compatibility - Does not contain official software or instructions on how to convert common video file formats such as AVI or MPEG to the video format the iPod only reads, MP4 - FireWire functionality has disappeared and is no longer compatible

<Title>quite simply the best out there
<Date>Mon Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>in october 2001 apple introduced iPod to the world.  it was $50 bucks more than this guy, 5 GB capacity (anyone remember the "1,000 songs in your pocket" mantra?), and was slightly bigger than this guy as well. not to mention the other trappings of early technology (shorter battery life, b/w screen, etc.) here we are five years later, and apple hasn't stopped innovating yet.  they haven't rested on their laurels or allowed the competitors to get anywhere near as close.  just look at this year's other offerings for proof (will the Zune even take off?  think not.) an avid music fan, and owner of over 3,000 cd's, i jumped on this guy when it came out...   i know lots of folks who will use a fraction of the disk space for tunes, and the other gigs will be devoted to other fanciful things such as tv shows, music videos, podcasts, etc. that's what i love about this thing.  the technology keeps marching forward, turning the iPod into the portable entertainment center we've dreamed of. my iPod, however, is all about music.  and that's what it does best anyway.  ingenious searching and browsing, gapless playback, incredible sound, 20 hour battery life, etc. if i had a complaint about this bad boy (in my humble opinion, the current undisputed king of portable electronics world), it would be that the "80 GB" moniker thrown around is a bit misleading. the operating system and other things take up about 4 gigs, leaving you with about 76 gig worth of storage space...  this is the bomb!  all i need (until the next gen of iPod arrives, that is).  apple fan for life!

<Title>Nice upgrade
<Date>Wed Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I must say, having upgraded from a 40G Photo, the iPod Video is really nice. The screen is noticeably larger. I've already watched video on it, and I like it. (Just don't try to watch wide screen movies or TV shows. The screen is too small.) Also, the battery life is GREAT! I can't wait to take it with me when I fly. You're theoretically able to watch a 6 hours of video before you drain the battery.  The new iPod also gives you more control. You can change the brightness of your screen, and there's a new search feature that lets you search your entire collection in a snap. Another great addition is the letters that appear when you're scrolling through lists of artists or albums. It helps you keep up with where you are alphabetically so you can slow down and avoid scrolling past it.  However, like other iPod models, the back of the ipod and the screen are easy to scratch. It didn't really bother me when I had my first iPod; I just accepted it as normal wear and tear. However, now that I'll be watching videos on the screen, I'm a lot more concerned about it. I really recommend buying a case as soon as possible. They're worth the investment.  When you buy your 80G, the box includes a USB cable, really horrible headphones that most everyone I know throws away, a quick start guide, and a black velvet sleeve for protecting your iPod. (The sleeve is nice as an interim case, but you probably won't use it for much more than that.) The kit doesn't include a dock or a wall charger. The USB cable both charges and syncs your iPod, so you don't really need either of these things unless you really want them. (The dock is basically a middle man between the USB cable and your iPod. I really wouldn't recommend it, since you're paying $39 for a piece of plastic that is basically superfluous.)  If you're new to iPods, I'd like to address a couple of complaints that new users often have. Most of these are quite easy to fix:  1.) BAD SOUND QUALITY. You have control over this. If you toy with your advanced preferences, you can change how you import music from your CDs. CNET actually has a tutorial on this under tips and tricks. ("Toss your CDs after archiving your digital media") The Apple Lossless codec is probably your best bet. Lossless essentially means that all of the song data is imported; none of it is lost in compression, which is the case with both mp3 and AAC codecs.  2.) BAD HEADPHONES. Yes, the headphones that are included for free are terrible. You get what you pay for, and, in this case, you aren't paying anything, so the lack of quality shouldn't really surprise you.  3.) BAD BATTERY. No, your battery will not last forever. No battery does. Apple uses lithium-ion batteries, which have a lot of advantages: they won't develop a memory, they're incredibly lightweight, and they hold a charge when not in use. However, there is a tradeoff; they only last about two years. This doesn't mean you have to throw your iPod away. Apple offers battery changing service for $59, or, if you're brave, you can purchase a DIY kit for about $30. (I'm not very good with my hands and I managed to do this. It comes with tools and a really great instructional video.)  4.) INCOMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS. Despite the fact that iPods are made by "Mac people," this doesn't mean that your iPod won't play nice when hooked up to your PC. In my two (going on three) years using an iPod with Windows XP, I've never had a compatibility problem. Also, there is excellent support on Apple's website for Windows users.  Basically, you will have a much more pleasant experience with your iPod if you do a little bit of research. The iPod is an instrument, and you can't just pick it up and immediately know how to use it through osmosis. Try going to Apple Support's iPod 101 or reading your manual (Which you'll have to find online, since they only included a Quick Start guide in the box.) Taking the time to get to know your iPod will ease your initial frustration, and help you maximize your iPod's potential in the long run.

<Title>Decent MP3 Player, some flaws
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple's Generation 5.5 iPod is by far the most advanced MP3 player on the market. The user controls are superb and it is easy to access the media you are looking for. However, Apple still requires the use of its proprietary iTunes software to update your iPod. To bypass this, I purchased Anapod Explorer to get direct access to my files. However, the video support on the Ipod is not yet up to standard, only supporting iTunes downloaded files or files converted into the format using one of the many shareware products available online. All together a good product.

<Title>Excellent...so far, so good...UPDATED
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Just picked this baby up.  I did so after trading in the new Creative Zen Vision Widescreen (60gb).  I loved the Creative Zen at first, and, like most people I showed it to, was simply in awe of the screen size.  However, that love quickly descended to hatred when I started trying to import videos/dvd/tv shows to it.  Absolutely HORRIBLE to work with and customer service was practically nil.  Then, the d*mn thing started crashing, crashing, crashing.  Forums within the Creative website seem to indicate this has been a problem since the days of the 30 gb Creative Zen M.  So, back it went.  Good riddance.  Enter iPod.  Got the 80gb and have to say that within minutes, I was up and running.  Installed complete seasons of t.v. shows, tons of music, still have TONS of space left.  The screen looks just fine, and with the separate A/V combo pack (that even includes a remote), I was able to hook it up to my plasma with surround sound and watch t.v. shows there (and even video podcasts).  Connected it through the stereo system...beautiful.  EXTREMELY user friendly, very intiuitve, great customer service.  I can't speak highly enough about this and would greatly encourage those in the market to go this route.  I avoided iPod for years, tried other MP3 players out there, and regret (somewhat) waiting this long.  The only thing I am glad about waiting for...was the ability to get this 80gb video.  Now, if a widescreen iPod ever does come out, I'll be right on board with that as well.  UPDATED TO ADD -   This month my iPod died.  Something to do with the battery, and it was only working when plugged into the wall, not working on its own, not via USB, not via car.  So, took it into the local iPod store here on Miami Beach, and no questions, no hassle, they took it back and gave me a brand-new one out of the box (NOT refurbished).  Gotta love such stellar customer service.  The new one is working even better than the first.  Still love this baby.

<Title>Bittersweet Treat
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well I bought this for myself after waiting pretty much since day one of the ipod coming out. I'm a music lover (a vast understatement) and felt this would be much more than a nice toy for someone like myself. I was right. As soon as I got it out of the box, I was enthralled. There are some things about the ipod that I felt should have been included and thusfar are not...such as being able to link two ipods/mp3 players together to share music, no relevant manual (there are some excellent independant manuals out there for it though), having iTunes (an excellent service) as an option, not a requirement as it currently is. Some other things as well. Regardless of these small issues, I was extremely happy with my first ipod, this 5.5 80gb version. I say "was" for a reason though. I had it a full three weeks before a blind date stole it (yeah I know, it's like a special power of mine I think). My point in this is what should be obvious to anyone but perhaps, like myself, it doesn't occur to you when you receive your new player. Get the thing marked with your own initials and write down the unique ID number on it as soon as it's out of the box. If you're lazy like I am, you might also be tempted not to back up all your music all the time as well, DO SO...theres nothing quite like having to hunt through and find those rare tracks once again. Just make CDs of all your music if you didn't buy them that way. Treat this thing like a wallet. If you leave it laying on a table or some other place and turn your head for even a second, it will attract attention. Most jewelers will make a simple engraving for a small fee. It's worth it. At 80 gig (thats 100 megabytes = 1 gigabyte = a hell of a lot of room), you likely won't need another ipod for quite some time. Make sure it stays yours.

<Title>The 80GB Ipod is Still The Best

<Content>My 17 year old son is a music connoisseur, and when his old 80GB Ipod was stolen at work, he did not hesitate to spend the funds to replace it in kind. He lives with his Ipod, and he really does need the extra large capacity of the 80 GB model to fit all of his music on it.Amazon, as usual, had the best price, allowing for no sales tax and free shipping. I persuaded him to wait 5 days or so, and save almost $50 from the store price, even at that famous warehouse store. The white model is just slightly cheaper, and it is what he prefers. The Ipod may have its quirks, but if you use it all day every day, it is well worth the extra cost, and the lack of an easily replaceable battery.

Battery life is much improved, screen is very bright.  The touch-wheel on the new one seems a bit more sensitive.

<Content>a very common item.  nowadays you dont really see many people without an ipod.  i guess this is also a guarantee of ipods' quality.  if you want a reliable mp3 player, this is good, but if u want individuality, this is not what you are looking for.

<Title>It's a GEM!
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Seriously, I love this thing. There are so many things you can do, including putting DVDs into it (you have to use special programs for that, though). Once you figure out how to work it and put in your media, it becomes your ultimate mobile entertainment center. Who knew such a small device held so much? Don't let anyone tell you that their iPod knockoffs (e.g. the ZEN) are better, because iPod is top-of-the-line.

<Title>Pricy, but nice!
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This was a good purchase - now I carry over 1100 favorite songs in the car without lugging along an armload of CDs, and, with "shuffle" can play a mix of favorites all the time.  The first extra I added was a Belkin F8Z115 CASE to protect the finish of the ipod - next, a Kensington FM ipod transmitter/charger to play the music through the car speakers.    I also "sync" all my digital pictures off my laptop computer into this 80gig ipod, so it acts as a backup disc for pictures.

<Title>Love it but would not sync with my PC!
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Amazon shipped right on time, price was right, it looks gorgeous, and is great to use while traveling.  VERY happy with the purchase part of the product via Amazon. One might think watching shows on this would be difficult with a smaller screen, but the clarity is so great it rocks!  The issue that made it 3 stars was that this thing would not sync with my PC for ANYTHING.  Apple;s lovely customer service is available until 6 PM, so if you work, just forget about getting help with your $350 new product.  The store won't touch it if you work with a PC, so that's fun.  About 60 people on iTunes chat had the same errors as me, with zero resolution from Apple.  LUCKILY, I had a crafty friend who figured out the issue, and it now works fine!  But, still, I spend $350 and can't use it for 3 weeks with no help from Apple?  Not good.

<Title>Great Product.
<Date>Wed Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first MP3 player and I love it. I am giving it four stars only because the battery isn't removable. I only use it for music and don't really care about video or any other uses. I have a lot of music and am up to 9800 or so songs and it is a little over half way full!  If you have a ton of music and video, this is the product for you.   The Creative Zen 60gb player is getting great reviews on C-Net and other sources. I was torn between these players and went for the 80 gigs!   Con's:  No voice recorder.  No FM tuner (but who needs a radio when they have over 9000 songs or     more?!)  Scratches easily.    Pro's:  Good audio quality (the most important feature)  Great menu's  Good battery life (read the other reviews for information on this)  iTunes imports CDs faster and smoother than musicmatch jukebox.(Yes, I have a PC and have no problems with iTunes).  Bottom line is that you get a huge music library in the palm of your hand! Just hook it up to your hi fi with a y cable and you don't have to search for your CD's or tapes to play them! Just search throught the easy to use menu and you are in music bliss for hours! If you are like me and hate hearing the same songs over and over, this is for you.

<Title>BEST ONE YET
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 3rd Ipod and by far my favorite. I quickly transferred over 5000 songs and videos to it and then put 9 movies on it and still have TONS of room.  Who needs a portable DVD player on a plane when you have this.  Just make sure you have the battery charged full before you get on the plane because one movie almost uses the entire battery life.  And if you dont have good eyesight you may want to watch a movie on something else.  Oh and download the full screen version of the movie so it takes up the entire screen.

<Content>Like Apple needs another 5 star review. But I have to say that this is the best thing ever invented. Hands down. I actually had a 60 GB until the 80 came out. So I gave away the 60 and got the 80. I love it. You must have one. I mean now. Get one. Don't forget to have some better headphones as they enhance your experience and, let's face it, there is something yucky about having those little buds stuck in your ears.

<Content>i just bought mine 1 1/2 month ago and i'm already having problems with it freezing up (judging from other reviews, that's a recurring problem with i-pods). after i sync or charge it, using my mac-book,  the "do not disconnect" sign does not turn off. when i reset the i-pod, the apple logo stays on for at least five minutes before it reboots. the problem, needless to say, is really annoying. i'll send it to apple and see whether the problem gets solved, but in the meantime, i rate the product only 3/5.

<Title>Infuriated
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I recently purchesed the 80 gig Ipod. I also decided to go with one day shipping. I lived at the time in a apartment complex.   DHL shipping said they "attempted to deliver, but patron was not home." Which Is false, I was at home the entire day. DHL could not even find the apartment complex(maybe the large signs wern't enough?)  It wasn't until 6:45 that night did they deliver the IPOD, not too the apartment, but the office. The clear and large numbers above each building were apparently out of sight for them.  The package itself was bare, with only the IPOD in a box with NO INSTRUCTIONS, only the Ipod, a 50 cent cloth case to it,earbuds, and a USB cord. I knew what to do, but how would someone with out experience with PC Hardware?  The first few days with the IPOD were enjoyable, it was my first MP3 player. I had a massive CD and DVD collection, I began ripping them and coverting them. I put about 12 hours of movies on there, which took about 4-6 to convert to the IPOD format, and another 3 or 4 for music.  I return home from vacation, download I tunes and plug in my ipod. Ready to put in some more music that I have on my computer at home. When I receive a messege.  "Ipod can only be synhed with one instance of Itunes at a time, all data must be deleated in order to put new music on."  So in other words, I wasted 16 hours converting and placing files on the IPOD, only to have to deleate them 3 days later.   The product itself is good, the service and software is horrible.

<Content>Apple has paid attention to every little detail in engineering this product including the packaging. An 80 GB hard drive in the back of my palm - my entire music collection, my favourite photos, now even some videos and podcasts, all can go where I go. I just hope the hard drive lasts more than the 4 years that my 60 GB unit held upto. Good Job, Steve!

<Title>Mostly satisfied
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a very easy to use product as long as you have iTunes.  Everything for the most part is self explanitory.  However I have some gripes.  It says here about crossfading songs.  But that only works and is used in iTunes, not for your iPod.      It also says in this description that you can tweak the equalizer...um there is no equalizer.  Maybe I missed it, but I looked through everthing to find it.  All there is are sound presets.  Like hip hop, rock, jazz, etc.  I can't find one that I like.  I don't have the sound blasting, and I have very good headphones (stock ones suck), but when there are a lot of guitars and bass in a song, it sounds almost distorted, like th iPod can't handle it.  And over all, all songs sound a littel too crispy.  All the sound presets add either too much treble or too much bass.  And if you turn off the presets it's too plain and flat. I thought maybe there might be something wrong with it, but I know two other people that have the 80G iPod and theirs sounds the same.      So considering my 3 year old Pioneer MP3 CD player has much better sound than a brand new iPod, I'm dissapointed and must complain.  If I'm doing something wrong, could someone reply to this and give some suggestions?      Other than this complaint, I rather like my iPod.  So 4 stars not 5.

<Title>Notes from a new Ipod user...
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Ipod, and immediately it started working.  Then, all of a sudden, it flipped out and stopped.  I couldn't get it running.  I tried the soft reset, nothing.  Then I finally called the applecare and they told me to do the soft reset (toggle the hold switch, then hold the menu/center buttons together).  After the apple logo comes on, you then stop holding the menu/center and click the center & play button together.  This saved my ipod, and me from the hassle of returning it to Amazon.

<Title>Nice replacement for my iPod mini
<Date>Thu Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this 80GB iPod video to replace my 2-year-old iPod mini (the battery was shot), and also to serve as an external hard drive for my PC laptop. So far it's working great, and I love it! My music, movies, podcasts, etc. are easy to navigate through the menus, and the iPod itself is very easy to use. The click-wheel is not as sensitive as it was on my mini, so I no longer have any problems with music unintentionally skipping or pausing. My videos show up great on the color screen, and even low-definition videos I download from YouTube or elsewhere appear to be high-quality on my iPod screen. I have most of my music library (about 5,000 songs) and 5 videos (including 4 full-length movies) on the iPod, and it's not even half way full yet. I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase.  However, the biggest drawback is that the screen and body of the iPod smudges very easily due to fingerprints. I would have also preferred that it come with a belt clip -- I used the belt clip that came with my iPod mini whenever I took it out of my carrying case. The dock that comes with this iPod in the box is very flimsy and I couldn't use it. The carrying case that comes with is it OK and will help protect the iPod from smudging and damage until you manage to procure a better carrying case (I ordered the Belkin II with kickstand). Also, I originally intended to purchase the black iPod, but the price went up at the last minute so I bought this one instead. I have absolutely no regrets about this purchase -- Amazon has the cheapest price on the Internet because they offer free super saver shipping on the iPod itself and also on the carrying case I purchased along with my iPod.  Side note: I sold my iPod mini online to a trading company called NextWorth, and they are giving me cash for it. I recommend this if you are replacing an old iPod with this one.

Although the one downside was it had a lot of fingerprints on the finish and it could scratch without a case on.

<Content>Please, if you are considering purchasing this product, be aware that the company does not stand behind their product.  It will break just after the warranty expires and they do not repair their iPods, only replace them.  If you happen to be days outside your warranty they'll tell you they will take back the broken one and give you 10% off a new one.  Look elsewhere for a product much easier to use and more reliable.  Don't waste your money on this item.

<Title>Nice bells & whistles, but burned in the end
<Date>Mon Jul 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally bought into the Ipod hype this January and purchased 2 80 gigs; one for me and my Sis.  It's a very good device with lots of plusses and few minues.  The one thing I MUST WARN about is to not run or even jog on a treadmill with your 80 gig Ipod.  I'm a distance runner and 30 minutes into running on the treadmill the Ipod will skip and go out.  My Ipod was in a sports armband when this happened.  A screen would repeatedly pop up saying something about a firmwire accessory not being supported when there was nothing even plugged into the Ipod.  I disregarded it and eventually got pretty much burned in the end.  Now my Ipod is recognized by any computer and the only way I can charge it is to use a dock.  And even when it's charged, the battery drains so dramatically fast that it lasts 2 hours tops.  I've even fully charged it and let it sit overnight and the battery manages to drain itself overnight.  So now I cannot add anything to it and I haven't even filled half of it.  Moral of the story, do not use your Ipod while excercising.  Luckily my Sis never used the Ipod I bought her so I'm hoping to get it from her.  But I still threw $350 bucks to the wind none the less...
