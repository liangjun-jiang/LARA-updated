<Content>I bought this Mp3 for my daughter for Xmas - not wanting to spend alot because of her age (12)- after ONE WEEK it wouldn't hold a charge, would not power down completely, and had to be reset every time we wanted to do ANYTHING with it!!!!  Not worth the problems!!!!!

<Title>A good little unit
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>for the price.  My husband bought this for me from Walgreens when it was on sale.  It's easy to use, although a mite sensitive.  The headphones look like stethoscope ends and are too bulky to use comfortably.  The unit is a perfect match for Windows Media player (make sure you have version 11, with the patches provided on the Microsoft website), and syncing the music from the media player to the MP3 player is quick and easy.  I get barely 8 hours of continuous play, but that's long enough for work.  The sound quality is excellent, and you can fit a heck of a lot of songs on the 1.9 gig (not the 2 gig that's on the package) memory.  All in all, for the price, I found the unit to be worth the money.

<Title>Without AC power adapter.
<Date>Wed Jun 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product claim to have an AC power adapter but it does not have it at all. What a problem!. I have purchased several items from amazon and all has been OK, but in this ocation not seems to be the case.  Because I live in venezuela Amazon return feature is not easy for me. As well not has built in stereo speakers.  The another features of this product are ok.

<Title>Review of Coby MP-C7095 MP3 Player
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I found the Coby to be easy to download to for music; however, it has been difficult to download picts and other media images.  It is very sensitive to heat and whenever I have taken it to the beach or pool, it quits working within minutes of being in the sun (on my towel or chair).  The battery life according to the manual is 20 hours of playback time - not even close! I do like the slimness of the unit but the touchpad control is so sensitive, you must use the hold button every time you play your tracks which is somewhat annoying if you like to manually skip to songs yourself.  The sound quality is good.  It works best with Windows Media Player and I did have difficulty getting it to download from any other program (i.e. Musicmatch Jukebox).

<Content>This is a flashy design and ok to use but awfully fragile. The unit fell 16 inches off my bed onto the floor and apparantly sustained enough damage to disrupt the 3.5mm receiver. When I wanted to listen to music I had to press on the bottom right corner ( above the 3.5mm input port) or press down on the headphone plug itself ,to hear properly.  Otherwise the sound came out only half normal volume and sounded extremley tinny.  This does not bode well for the future of the product at least from my personal standpoint.  At 30 years old i've seen and owned a few really cool mp3 players and while I realise that some can be fragile a 16 inch drop shouldnt be enough to harm the headphone jack this badly.  The 10 day return period for ABC warehouse ( the store I purchased it at) has worn out so I repaired it myself by inserting a small 10mmx10mm square of aluminum between the exterior housing and the 3.5 mm jack. This has restored the functionality of the unit to normal although with a slight bulge on the bottom.     Also the unit does not handle video well ( flickers) nor can you really see any pictures on the small screen. The pictures tend to be centered and pixelated which is unfortunate because the unit seems to be able to  provide you with rich colors otherwise.  One VERY irritating thing. When you click on MUSIC it opens the first folder you have in the music section and you have to back out of it to get to the main music list to see all your music folders and playlists. This may not seem like a big deal but when you have to do this everytime you want to start listening to music it gets irritating.   Also the battery apparantly drains slowly even when the unit is turned off. I noticed this when I left it off in a desk drawer for 3 days and when I went to turn it on it died within 5 minutes even tho it was fully charged for 10 hours overnight before being stored.   I realise this isnt proper and I should probably just send the unit in for replacement/refund or repair but for $60 it simply isnt worth the time and effort when I can simply buy a different mp3 player from a different company with the same amount of ram for the same price when this one inevitably dies.

<Title>Poorly Made.  Not sure how it passed QC
<Date>Sun Jul 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is one of the worst mp3 players I have seen.  The first unit I purchased arrived doa.  The replacement worked, but the battery only holds a charge of about 10 minutes (appx length of 3 songs).  The second unit that I had purchased at the same time works while plugged into a computer, but will not hold a charge at all. The touch pad is a nice feature but only works about half the time. However, this is just "glitter & effects" to mask how poorly made this mp3 player is.  I made the mistake of researching this brand after purchasing it and it seems that there is definitely a problem with their batteries, among other things.  I would recommend purchasing another brand.

<Title>Looks can be deceiving
<Date>Tue Jul 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The size and ease of use on this product are nice and that is where it ends. It looks sharp and worked great for about 3 songs. After that, the low battery message comes on and then it is done. I charged it overnight and still the same results. I, like other viewers, did my research too late. If I had read more of the reviews on Coby products, I probably would not have purchased anything from them. After this, I guarantee I will not purchase another Coby product. It is packed up in the box to be returned tomorrow.

<Title>Can't ask for more for its price...maybe a bit more
<Date>Wed Aug 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Good product. the feature set in this for its price is amazing. the down side to this item is that it comes with a really gawky headset. and if you plan on watching a movie on it be prepare to have the battery go dead on you real quick. as an MP3 player and a USB storage this works great. id recommend you buy this. it looks nice too.

<Title>Battery
<Date>Sat Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player holds a ton of songs. More songs than i can think of. The sound quality is great, but the battery life is very short. My mp3 only really plays for about an hour before dying. With no warning and with the battery meter full it drops down to nothing.

<Title>This is very upsetting
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We got this for my daughter for Christmas and it will not hold a charge.  She opened it up and we have been trying to charge it ALL day.  We even tried our other computer to see if it was the computers fault, so far NOTHING!!  What we really hate is that the customer service is closed today because of the holiday so there is noone to talk to.  I understand it is Christmas but it still sucks!  This is the second item that she opened up today that was broke.  We are going to return both items and get her an ipod.
