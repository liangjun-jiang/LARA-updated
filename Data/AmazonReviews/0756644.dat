<Title>Tailor made for lap swimming
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using my Oregon Scientific MP3 player for a month now (the 512MB version), and I absolutely love it. Swimming laps is now a really fun experience, and the sound quality is great once your ears are submerged. Plus the player is tiny, buoyant and it clips to your swimsuit.  But here's a tip: You must wear a swim cap to keep the earphones stored in your ears. Also, don't bother using the earbuds b/c they drown out the sound (pun intended).  I would advise using the OS player exclusively in the pool. It's not good as an all-purpose MP3 player b/c the bass quality is subpar out of the water.  Plus, uploading songs into the player is more difficult than say an iPod. But all the effort is worth it if you like swimming to music.

<Title>On the bright side, I wasn't electrocuted...
<Date>Sat Aug 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...On the down side, after six months of proper usage, water has seeped in, the display is no longer visible, the unit doesn't work, and the USB plug is rusted.    I was initially pleased with my purchase.  I solved the loose earbud problem by adding Jabra EarGels.  I paid attention to the Oregon Scientific guidelines for the player-surface swimming only, for half an hour, and was careful about a tight seal after charging.  However, after four months, the display had water in it.  The player continued to work for another two months before quitting entirely.  It has taken over six weeks for me hear back from Oregon Scientific on how to send the product back-and there is no guarantee they'll fix it.  So I have switched to an iPod Shuffle and an Otterbox waterproof box.  It's big and bulky, but I'm betting it's a far better investment than another Oregon Scientific product.

<Title>Not your industry standards
<Date>Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Although this player is waterproof & shock resistant the download is slow and cumberson and when the player is shut off it reverts back to the first song.  I would not recomend this player.

<Title>Great waterproof MP3 Player - bad earphone adopters
<Date>Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is a great product.  For those who need all the motivation they can get to do their laps and are craving some music, this product will please.  I bought a couple of Speedo waterproof radios a few years back and thier reception went from bad to horrible within a month of use.  The MP3 player allows you to listen to music of your choice underwater, clearly. Loading music is a snap, and the player displays the artist and song in easy to read font.  Like many reviewers have mentioned, the adaptors for the earphones don't stay in your ears as you swim unless you use a swim cap.  I found the swim cap annoying, so I swapped out the waterproof earphone adaptors from my useless Speedo waterproof radio I somehow never threw away -- and voila - the perfect product!!! Now I have to come up with a new excuse not to finish my laps.

<Title>Very disappointed
<Date>Sat Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was very disappointed in this MP3 player since it's the most popular waterproof available.  I followed the instructions, but found water in the screen after two uses & rust-colored water coming out of the holes in the ear buds.  The third time I tried to use it...it wouldn't even power on.  The player is difficult to use because each button performs multiple functions.  Even with the manual in front of me, it's confusing to operate.  The buttons are small and VERY difficult to push.  The water ear buds are uncomfortable & don't stay in place while aqua-jogging.  The screen is hard to read even when it's illuminated.  The clip comes off so easily that it's almost impossible to clip the unit to anything b/c it just pops off.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone for any reason.  Fortunately, I've recieved a full refund from the vendor.  Thanks to the suggestion of another reviewer, I've learned about Otterboxes.  I'll be buying an iPod Nano as soon as Otterbox markets the box to fit!

<Title>Shame on OSI!!!
<Date>Thu Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Good idea, but a flawed design...and ridiculously poor customer service!  The volume level and sound quality are poor, but it was so great to be able to water walk/dance with my own peppy music mix!  So I kept the unit anyway.  Like other reviewers, I could not tolerate the size of the ear bud covers, so I used the unit without them, being very careful not to get the headphones wet, but one of the headphone speakers blew anyway (it developed a very annoying buzz/rattle).  That was in July, and it's now October.  I have called OSI customer service at least 7 or 8 times in this period, OSI has the worst customer service of any company I've ever dealt with!  They promised twice to send me the replacement headphones, but failed to notify me that they were on backorder, so I had to call back repeatedly.  They told me that they had gotten a shipment of headphones, but they were rusted, so they couldn't send them out.  Since they couldn't get the headphones to me, they finally sent me an RMA to exchange the entire unit.   That was 3-1/2 weeks ago. Last night, I got a package from OSI...I was so excited!  But it the replacement speakers from July, but now I have no unit!  OSI customer service says it'll being going out today, but I have lost all faith in them.  My bottom line recommendation.  Buy this mp3 player at your own risk...and don't expect it to work well, and don't expect any product support for it.

<Title>MP3,MP120, Oregon Scientific 
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Unit is easy to program but I have had nothing but problems with the ear-phones from day one. I was sent replacement rubber cups that protect the phones from water but they too come off. This design is not well suited for our ears, much less water, thus it is just a glorified expensive MP3 player and does not perform as advertised, water proof not with those ear-phones SHAME ON YOU O.S. take this unit off the market. I do not recommed this unit as water proof no way !!

<Title>I should have read the reviews
<Date>Fri Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i am very dissapointed in this product, it seems to be a sturdy little unit and waterproof, so far, but somebody forgot to tell the manufacturer that this thing is supposed to play music.  the supplied headphones are so poor that i cant hear any music or my mpg books when swimming or in the hot tub and there is no way to use your own headphones as the unit will no longer be waterproof.  i listen to audio books as mpegs and there is no bookmark featrue also turn it off and it wont remember where you left off so you spend many minutes trying to find your shut off point.  and remember the only way to recharge is to connect it to a usb cable on a computer.  try to use the oregonscientific website, yea right, its impossible, all Glitzy music and eye candy and not helpful at all. the company is not interested in your problems with the product.  the only way possible to use this product is if i can figure out how to re-solder and seal new head phones into this unit so i can actually hear sound and then use them in the hot tub only, unless i can find a pair of water proof ear buds for swimming. actually i'm wondering if this company can be sued under "Rico" for 'bait and switch',  bottom line "dont buy this worthless device"

<Title>Attention: DO NOT PURCHASE! OUTRAGEOUS! A rip-off!
<Date>Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I definitely agree with Larry. The same things happened to me and the customer service keep saying that there is no complaint about the product. When I uploaded some songs, it said that the disk was full and after unplugged it from the computer it was completely dead. I went to the shop and they gave me another one. This one worked properly for a few times and then water leaked inside and it stopped working again. I went to the shop again and then I started having a lot of problem with the customer service. They wanted to charge me half of the price of a new one for the repair (around US$80) and it was still under warranty as I have purchased it only 2 months before that. Beside that, the sound is really, really poor and the earphones, like the rest of the unit, are not waterproof at all and they don't suit your ears. They keep falling. You cannot swim with them, unless you wear something to hold them like a swim cap. The problem with the sound is really from its earphones because I've tried with another ones and the sound was much better but you cannot use your own earphones on the water because the design doesn't allow you. And believe it or not, the only difference between normal earphones and this one is that those ones have rubber covers that keep falling all the time.  Conclusion: Very expensive, very uncomfortable, not waterproof, very poor sound. The customer service is the worse I've ever seen. A rip-off!

<Title>Handy small size but NOT WORTH THE MONEY!
<Date>Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the OSI 512 MB Waterproof Mp3 player about 6 mos ago. The player has been totally waterproof so far. I have taken it in pools, hot tubs, and saunas with no problem. Although I am satisfied with the waterproof capability, I am dissatisfied with many other features. First, the headphones are of very poor quality, the sound is almost tinny and the ear pieces have repetedly shocked me, which has caused me to be wary of actually using the player. Another major downfall is that you have no ability to make playlists - the music is automatically arranged alphabetically, which makes it difficult and time consuming to find specific songs. Also, the player will not save your place when it is turned off, so you can't pick up in the middle of a song, and it is useless to try to listen to audiobooks. When uploading files, the drag and drop navigation is easy, but the limited file capacity is frusterating. Just a few m43 files basically use up all of the memory space. The warranty is a joke and OSI's customer service is horrendous. Navigating through the equalizer modes is complicated and cumbersome. Overall, I am extremely disapointed with this purchase. I doubt I will ever buy another Oregon Scientific product again. Right now, I am only using the MP120 through the FM Transmitter in my car due to the poor sound quality and the earphone-shocking-issues. I am currently waiting for my i-pod 20GB to arrive and wishing that I had purchased that in the first place. If you are thinking of buying this product PLEASE consider it carefully, it is definitely Buyer Beware on this one.

<Content>I read the reviews and thought ... not going to happen to me.  It did.  This player worked a total of 10 times and then nothing.  Don't buy it!  It was nice to swim with, the head phones did suck, but I wasn't expecting it to be great sound quality under water, apparently OS did not do proper R&D before launching this product.

<Title>Can't go swimming without taking it with me
<Date>Wed Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After read many negative reviews, I took a leap of faith to buy this mp3 player.  It turned out better than I expected.  Please do not buy this thing if you're planning to use it without wearing swimming cap.  The headphone won't stay till. The reason I gave it 3 stars because the headphone hurts my ears after using it for more than 45 mins.  Overall, I am glad to buy this mp3 player.  It keeps my workout more entertaining.

<Title>Don't buy it, even if you think it will be ok.  
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I read the bad reviews and knew what I was getting into but thought it would be ok.  I was wrong.  After two uses, the headphone connection started to go bad.  If you tighten up the headphone bottom unit, to prevent water from getting into the unit, the headphone connection does not work.  In my case, I loosened the headphone bottom unit just a little past extremely tight, to get the headphones to work, and water leaked into the unit.  I have an extended warranty but it will not cover water damage.  Nothing like a $100 paperweight.  Having to remove and re-tighten the headphone bottom unit (to charge or download music) is this products downfall, because the headphone connection will go bad, like in my case, or you will not tighten the unit enough, again like in my case, and water will ruin the unit.

<Title>It's OK.
<Date>Fri Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using mine for a year or so, and I like it. I did have to add some earbud caps that came off an old waterproof player in order for the earphones to stay in my ears. It works fine, but it is not terribly convenient to organize your music. There doesn't seem to be any way to set it to shuffle play, and the only way to organize a playlist is alphabetically by name of song. So I'm constantly having to rename my songs in order to get them in the order I want. I wouldn't buy it again, but if you get a good deal on one, it might be worth a try.

<Title>It will last you 3 months tops
<Date>Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I swim almost every day for about 30-45 minutes. I thought it would be really neat to try to add music to my workout so I got MP120 as it was the only player under 100 at that time. First thing I noticed about MP120 was that the headphone wires were too much in the way and needed to be tucked under the swimming cap or wound around the goggle strap. Second and far more annoying problem was that the ear buds would fall out whenever I immersed in the water or tried to do a flip. So if you are only planning to use a kick board, this player may be great for you, for free style, [...] stroke, butter fly, or flips, I wouldn't recommend it.  After about 3 months, the water started getting into the ear buds and I noticed corrosion in and around the headphone speakers. It wasn't long before the left speaker started buzzing and the sound was seriously degraded.  The customer support for Oregon Scientific is absolutely of the worst kind. Long wait times, false promises and no records of previous calls are all too common. I called three times just to get a request in for a replacement ear buds. The person took the request, and said they would ship a new replacement free of charge since the product was still under the warranty. After three weeks I still haven't received anything. I tried calling the support again and after about 40 minutes of waiting I got to the same person I talked to the last time, however he had no recollection of me and was not able to pull anything on his computer, so he took the order again. I called again 6 months later and asked if they could try shipping the replacement since I haven't received it, but this time I was told my product is no longer under warranty and that I would have to buy a new MP3 player. Nice.  My next set will be Finis SwimMp3 Player which I have heard is superior in many ways.  Update (April 4, 2007): I did received a call from Oregon Scientific tech support on March 28 with an apology and a claim that they are commited on improving the user experience. I got the new set of ear buds the other day, and they seem to have a better design. For one, they don't fall out anymore and the sound is better. On the older set, the sound would degenerate when the cap was placed over the buds. The new head phones don't have this problem. I'm willing to give them another try.

<Content>This player can hardly fit any music in it and the one that I bought would make constant sounds when was used on the FM mode. Thus, it couldn't be used as a radio and neither it could store enogh songs to be considered an mp3 player. Do not buy this.
