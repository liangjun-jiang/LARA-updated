<Product Name>iRiver Clix Rhapsody 4GB Digital Music and Video Player
<Title>Better than the Sansa Rhapsody, but still some flaws...
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To the best of my knowledge, there are only two mp3 players on the market that actually advertise to be compatible with Rhapsody.  Those two players are the Sansa Rhapsody and the iriver clix Rhapsody.  Since I have a Rhapsody account, these players attracted my attention.  I started out with the Sansa and after a year, I was disappointed with random shut downs, the player locking up, and in the end, the player not even turning on.  So my next natural progression was the clix Rhapsody from iriver.  After reading many reviews, I finally bit the bullet, and purchased the clix.  The price is obviously much higher then the 4GB Sansa, but hey you get a pretty sweet player.  Here are the pros: -Player style is a huge plus, easy to navigate with the "screen buttons" -The screen is amazing.  Still kind of small, but still good enough to play some music videos -Volume is insane at 20 and it reaches 40! -Adjustable EQ is much better than Sansa's -Flash games are fun for those boring times, but they cut the battery -Player boot up is about 10x faster than the Sansa's  Here are the cons: -The battery definitely doesn't last for 24 hours of continuous playback.  The most I've gotten was 8-9 hours. -When using Rhapsody to update player, it seriously takes 10 minutes to load my player's music.  This could be a rhapsody software problem, but it's really annoying. -There are random "skips" in audio playback like it's playing from a CD.  There is no pattern to the annoyances, they just happen. -Audio playback stops when you start playing flash games.  Due to the cons, which can be very nerve racking, I gave this player a 4 out of 5 rating.  I would have liked to give this player a 5, but the "skips" really tick me off when I'm trying to rock out...

<Product Name>iRiver Clix Rhapsody 4GB Digital Music and Video Player
<Title>Perfect size for a front pocket!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First off, let me just admit that I'm an MP3 player addict and I usually get the big hard drive ones.  So for comparison purposes, I've put this up against an iPod Touch, an iPod Video 5.5, and my Archos 605.  The main thing that drove me to buy a Clix was the glowing CNet review and numerous comments about the superb audio quality of the iRiver players and the Clix in particular.  After a lot of fiddling with audio settings, I finally see why the clix 2 gets such rave reviews for audio quality.  However, straight out of the box it doesn't sound very good at all, you will need to spend some quality time with your clix to get good sound.  As is my wont, I like to list out the things I love followed by the things I don't love so much:  1) This thing is real nice to look at, its sleek and thin, clean design. 2) Perfectly sized for a pants pocket, which is a first for me! 3) Beautiful screen for the price. 4) Innovative D-Click interface with lots of dedicated buttons for volume, power, hold and even a special programmable button. 5) Easy to operate blind with only a little bit of practice so you don't necessarily have to take it out and look at it to see what you're doing. 6) Very customizable in so many ways. 7) After setting to MTP mode I was immediately able to download my music and playlists, as well as album art and song ratings using Media Monkey; this was as easy as the iTunes/iPod setup which is a minor miracle.  I'm very impressed, given the problems I've had doing same with my Archos 605. 8) Built in mini-USB port, might sound like a minor thing but none of my other players has it. 9) Special button: one button can be assigned to a special function which is nice (I set mine to do Play/Pause). 10) Lots of other features which I don't use and other reviewers have described in detail. 11) Flash theming: you can download all sorts of flash background themes and fonts and really customize the look of the player.  12) If you are patient, you can really get some great sound out of this thing by fiddling with the Wow and SRS and other EQ settings.  Things that I'm not loving so much: 1) Fits so well in my jeans pocket, but every time I bend over it starts fast forwarding.  I have to put it on hold every time I put it in my pocket.  Basically, the down side of the D-Click interface is that it is easily activated by random bumps and jostles so I pretty much have to put it on hold all the time.  I also find this can be hard on battery life as my case will keep the screen alive when fully closed. This has become a real problem to me, unfortunately my noreve case isn't helping matters at all. 2) After the joys of touch screen interfaces, I find it a little tedious to not have any sort of sliding/touchy interface for doing things like scrolling through long lists of songs. 3) Hard to find accessories: welcome to life outside the Apple happy place, I have yet to find a store that actually will sell me an accessory for the Clix.  Looks like I will be ordering everything online!  So for now I have to carry it in my pocket whether I like it or not; fortunately that works pretty well! 4) Battery life is a bit disappointing, I end up putting it on the charger whenever I'm not using it! 5) Although the screen is beautiful, its very hard to read in full sunlight.. unlike my iPods. 6) I can't get this thing to work with Rhapsody ToGo to save my life, in spite of going around with Real and iRiver tech support it still doesn't work for me; I have heard it works for others though.   7) Tech support, where is it?  I put in a ticket and never got any response at all so it appears to be non-existent.  Makes Archos tech support look stellar by comparison!  So, in summary, this is the best pocket player I've ever found, the sound is crisp and clean, the interface is innovative and fun.  I think its a great little MP3 player for the price but I don't think it holds up to the higher priced iPod Touch overall... not surprising since it is a hundred dollars cheaper!  Update after 1 month of ownership:  well I have to say this little player has really grown on me.  After fiddling with settings I now find that the sound is as good as advertised (still lacking some power though!), it is addictive, all my other players don't seem quite as crisp and clear anymore.  I've updated my pros and cons accordingly.  Normally this would be good enough reason to bump the rating to 5 stars, however I've discovered a few more things I'm not so happy with so I'm leaving it at 4.  Hoping the next version (Clix+ ??) will resolve some of these problems!
