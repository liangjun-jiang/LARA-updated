<Content>If u are thinking of getting an ipod or ipod mini, don't get those. Get this it has a color screen (good quality)it plays MP4 and mp3 this means u can watch movies and other video look at pictures, and much much more! This is also much smaller that either of the ipods.

<Content>This is the most difficult product to try to figure out how to use that I have ever purchased.  The instructions were obviously written in Chinese and very poorly translated to English.  There are many words that don't even make sense and many misspelled words.  I am still trying to return it and am getting the run around from Visual Land's customer service.  I would NOT recommend this product or this company.
