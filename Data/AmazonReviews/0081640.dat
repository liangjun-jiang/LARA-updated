<Title>Tiny but amazing at this price

<Content>Even though the screen is tiny (they call it a 1" screen but it's actually about 1/2" x 3/4" viewable), this little MP3/video player has me scratching my head in wonder.  How do they do this for $20???  Windows recognizes it as a removeable disk, so dragging and dropping files is a breeze.  The videos I loaded (old TV shows I watched as a kid) run smoothly and in full color with enough clarity to feel like you simply shrunk your TV set.  It's ideal for cartoons, sitcoms, or videos that don't need a lot of detail to understand what's going on. My daughter put one in her Barbie dollhouse so now Barbie has a working TV -- my GI Joe never had it so good!  With 512M, there's more than enough room for songs and even a few TV shows.  Important tip:  be sure to use the included CD to upgrade the firmware (version 9.1.07 can be found at http://www.tatung.at/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=99&Itemid=47). You'll get more features, like e-books and a separate video menu.  You'll also be able to play back AMV video formats as well as the proprietary(?) MTV format. The joystick control is clever and intuitive, though I sometimes still forget how to go to the previous menu with it.  There are other buttons on it like EQ for controlling bass and treble and AB for marking and repeating sections of a song.  There's a neat "tempo" feature that my kids like to use to make things sound like chipmunks. It's a voice recorder, it has lyric display capabilities, it can display your digital photos...just amazing! For those like me who want to know the dark side of a product, the video format converter took some patience...not so much from the Tatung side, but getting the video in a format the software will convert. (I wanted to load youtube videos but had to get them from the FLV format to either an AVI or a WMV format first.  If your videos are already in this format, conversion is simple and fast).  Also, once converted, the MTV files took much more memory than the original file.  I haven't tried the AMV format yet; it might be better.  Still, there was plenty of room for a few 1/2 hr TV shows, with room to spare for some music. The FM radio is not part of the player -- it's attached to the headphones and has a scan button to tune in stations.  This can be frustrating if you don't know where you are on the FM dial. The built-in battery uses the USB port to charge which is a blessing and a curse.  I like it a lot, the charge lasts for a long time, but you're out of luck if it dies and you're not near a computer.  This has yet to be a problem for me. I bought 3 of these and I plan to buy more to use as prizes for my middle school students.

<Title>great for the price, interface a little awkward to use
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I'm amazed at all the things this mp3 player can do for the price - play music, show jpg images, play videos. It's also a cute little thing, the screen is about the size of a postage stamp. The only down side is that the interface is a bit awkward to use. It has a mode for music (which is also the mode for videos) and another for pictures, and a few others for things like recoding your own voice. However, if you load it up with a bunch of mp3s, and go to music mode, it doesn't show you a list of the songs, it just takes you to the first song and you have to push on the next button until you get to the song you want. So if you just want to play all the songs you loaded on it in order, it's very easy to use, but if you want a particular song, it's a bit clunky. You can organize the songs in different folders, but then it gets even more difficult to use. There's a way to show all the folders you have and enter a specific one to play all the songs there, but it requires you to push the same button for either a long or short time depending on what you're doing and it's very difficult to push the button for the correct length of time.   In short, its wonderful if you just want to play all the songs in a row or just have one album at a time so there's not a lot of songs to go through, but if you want to fill the mp3 player with lots of different albums and be able to choose to play a particular one, it's kind of difficult to do so.

<Title>Great price, good product.

<Content>I agree with the other two reviewers.  It's really hard to beat for the price.  I could not get the radio mode to work, but I mainly wanted it for uploading songs to listen to as I get exercise.  The sound quality is really great.  Even my picky husband likes it.   :-D

<Title>Great for the kids at the price!

<Content>I bought one for my young son for Christmas and was so impressed I bought a second for my younger daughter. They both LOVE them. These are tiny units that play videos and music, but we've loaded them up with videos the kids enjoy. I hear them playing them all the time. My daughter received an I-Dog which she hooks up to play with while watching videos. The beauty is, at $20 a pop, if they damage or lose one, it's not a big deal.   GREAT starter unit. Judging from the children's response, they've learned to care for the unit quickly. It's their favorite toy from Christmas.  The unit is small, no longer than 2" and no wider than 1". The screen is even smaller. You can convert AVI format video into MTV video in minutes using the included software, then load it onto the unit via USB connection. The charge takes about 2-4 hours and plays for a very long time. I haven't actually check just how long, but it's been weeks since Christmas and I've only charged either unit 2 times.   The 512MB memory cannot be expanded and the MTV format is larger than the AVI format storage requirements. You can fit about 10 converted videos onto the unit. That's about 30 minutes of play which is perfect for a child. You could of course fit more music, but the video is what makes the unit a joy for the children.   The controls are tiny and difficult to master. I've found myself getting frustrated and simply turning off the unit and restarting (a matter of seconds) when I could not exit a file folder or exit a particular menu. The kids have mastered the important parts, turning the unit on, finding the given video and hitting play. The unit also records, plays music and includes headphones with an AM/FM receiver.  I highly recommend this as a starter unit for kids, or for the adult who wants a "throw-away" unit that has a lot of functionality, but is inexpensive. The video capability on the tiny screen is mesmerizing to young children. Hours of fun...
