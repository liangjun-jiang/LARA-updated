<Title>Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality. But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box. There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them. iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly. Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance. iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best.

<Title>Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player:  - Incredibly small, thin, and very light. - Well designed, fit on your palm, pocket, or pencil case. - High resolution colour screen, shows albumart, photos, and games in colors. - Superb sound. - Click wheel; easy navigation as the original iPod. - New features:   > World Clock   > Stopwatch   > Screen Lock - now with iTunes 5, it's easy to sync AddressBook, Calendar, etc between Ms Outlook and iPod nano. - with flash memory, the nano is 100% skip free; a true sport companion. - headphone jack at the bottom, making it easier to read the screen (without rotating it first) when we take the nano out from our jeans pocket.  Although it comes with lots of advantages, yet:  - 4 GB is the maximum capacity possible. - USB connection only. - No charger adapter, you should use the USB connection to recharge the battery. It means the computer or laptop should be around you. Make sure you bring your laptop on your vacation. - Only two colors available, black or white. No more pink, blue, green, etc.  Accessories that you may like: - The lanyard. With this earphone, you can wear your iPod nano as necklace. No more tangle and you can change the music right away without reaching your pocket. - The silicon case. This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano. It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you're sitting.   Overall this is a really great product! Before deciding to buy this MP3 player, make sure you have USB 2.0 on you computer or laptop. Some people had bought this nano and having USB 1 connection on their PC, making the song transfer a painful and time consuming process. It will takes hours to fill up your iPod nano with USB 1. Therefore, the existance of USB 2.0 on your PC is crucial. Also, if you are frequent traveller, it is a good idea to buy another accessory for recharging the battery og your iPod without connecting it to PC. Otherwise, you will have to bring your laptop with you or look for PCs on your vacation to recharge your nano.

<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>Awesome device!
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This thing rocks! I received it as a present and really love it. This is my first iPod of any kind, so here goes.  The Good: 1) Size & Design - Need I say more? It is very small and looks stunning. Apple have done it again!  2) Easy-to-use Software - You use iTunes to organize your files and import them to the player. It can also be automatically synchronized to add or delete files to your player as needed. 3) Good Sound Quality - The quality from the earphones is wonderful. Bass, mids, treble: all there!  The Bad: 1) Picture Import - Pictures can only be imported by folder, so if you want to put just ONE picture into the device, you have to create a separate folder for it and then import that. 2) Scratches - Nanos, especially the black ones, get scratched VERY easily. Note this before you put it to use and perhaps purchase the necessary bag/film/other protector to keep it looking new. 3) Battery Replacements - I'm actually not sure about this, but this thing looks like it's solidly closed. Will there be a way to change the internal battery when it expires? I don't know.  This is a super player! You will love it! Buy it! :)

<Title>I'm glad I slept on the iPod mini
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After being an ipod owner for the last two years, I was in the market for a second iPod. I slept on the iPod mini and I'm glad because now there's the iPod mini. I love it. I was worried that it'd be a total drag to set up but it was perfectly compatible with all my previous iTunes stuff. I didn't have to even load the included CD all I did was downlaod the latest verisons of the iPod updater and I made sure that I had the latest upgrade of iTunes.  The nano works with all my previous cables for my 3rd generation iPod. So after I removed it from the package I plugged it in my previous iPod's AC adapter. The one draw back is the nano does not include an AC adapter but you can still charge it with the usb cable. I was able to get a full charge in about an hour with the AC adapter. With that said, I highly reccomend this amazing mp3 player. It exceeded my expectations. The ease of use, the design, everything is wonderful. Now you may think...why spend money on an mp3 player that only holds 500 songs? Well, how many people do you know that have time to listen to 5000 songs everyday? I can manage my playlists. I control what's being fed into my iPod and I like that. This is a great 2nd iPod for current iPod owners and a treat to first time buyers.

<Title>A good product, as old as it is.
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It's probably been about 2 years since a review was writting for this iPod, but hey; I'm bored, and it's 3:35 AM. Anyway, I originally bought this thing a couple of years ago. It's still functioning properly and I've never had that many problems with it, and you can't imagine how many times this thing's been beaten around! The battery life has been pretty exceptional, though I can tell it has been getting a lot worse for the couple of years I've had it. I really thought I would have to replace the battery, but that was unnecessery.   To this day, I have been using this iPod with no problems (other than some click wheel problems, but that was easily fixed), and if you don't want to spend so much on the newer ones, this one's for you. I honestly can't compare this Nano with the other two generations, but all I know is that this one is durable, reliable, and easy to use. I may be getting the latest generation of the Nano by tomorrow (Dec. 17, 2007. The new nano with video capabilites) and I'll see if I can do a quick comparison between the two when I get it. I'll post the comparison on the Nano: Black product.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges is very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 2-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 500 songs. For $50 more, you can buy the 4-gigabyte, which olds approximately 1000 songs. If you think the higher capacity could be useful to you, the $50, for an extra 2-gigabytes is a good value. However, if you're on a budget, or are not so concerned with capacity, this 2-gigabyte model will get the job done. 500 songs is a lot of music, so you will rarely find yourself in a situation, where you need more than that.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color.  This white iPod Nano will match your iMac, iBook, or other Apple products.  Furthermore, the white is less likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  It is a good idea to protect your iPod Nano, if you're concerned about its appearance.  The chrome finish, on the back, is particularly prone to scratches.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>You've gotta hold it to believe it
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 90% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. So for the storage reason alone, I can't chuck my 20GB model just yet. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.   ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $100, you can upgrade to a Photo that has ten times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is-it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.   Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their demure size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 2-4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>best balance of usability and portability among all iPods
<Date>Wed Sep 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just got my 4gb black iPod nano yesterday.  I got one because my 4G 20gb iPod was having intermittent dropouts when used with a tape-deck adapter or certain pairs of non-Apple earphones.  A few websites surmise that it's a problem with gold-plated jacks.  I'm happy to report that no such dropouts occur with the nano, even after purposely twisting and wiggling the jack.    My first day with the iPod nano has been an awesome experience.  When not in use, I walked around the whole day with it in my pocket and forgot it was there most of the time.  The screen is very bright and easy to read.  The click wheel is more sensitive than the one on my 4G iPod, but I got used to it.  Amazingly, it continued to work even when a thick clear plastic film separated the wheel from my finger.  I guess I should qualify that I'm really not sure whether the wheel is more sensitve or the GUI is just more responsive.  Synching on iPod nano over USB 2.0 seems just as fast as my 4G over Firewire 400.  For those worried about the durability of the tiny nano, please read the Ars Technica review.  They threw one out of a moving car then ran over it with the car, and it still played.

<Title>What else would you expect from Apple?
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Forgive me for coming off like an Apple fanboy, but to be honest after buying my first iBook there was no way I could go back to the PC world and the same can be said for the iPod.   As an owner of a 15GB, 512MB Shuffle, and previous mini owner I can honestly say that I like iPods, and when the nano was introduced it was hard for me not to get one. After taking it home and opening up the box (always a little more fun with Apple's more dressed up packaging) I couldn't believe my eyes. This black 2GB nano was TINY. I was a little skeptical about the size at first because it might be too small, but even as a 5'9" person with normal sized hands it was still easy to use.  The color screen is just an added bonus. I never saw the point of having a color screen for a music player but after using this  it's hard to go back to the black and white. Although the screen is small, the photos and album art look nice and vibrant thanks to the surprisingly high resolution screen.  One major reason the iPod has sold so well is because of its seamless integration with iTunes and there is no surprise here. Just plug it into the USB 2 and it's pretty much set up.  So to sum things up here's what I thought about the nano:  Positives - Looks fabulous, especially the black - Has the 30 pin dock connector like the full size iPods, meaning that it is compatible with practically all the accesories out there, which is a lot -Click wheel, although smaller, is still easy to use - The sound on iPods are underrated compared to other music players, and the nano sounds just fine especially with the right set of headphones  Negatives (although only a couple, to me they are HUGE) - Battery life, although considered average at 14 hours, could've been a LOT better considering it's a flash player. But then again not all flash players have a color screen - Apple should've known by now, but the material they use for the face of the iPod is just too fragile. Yes it makes it sleek and what-not but this thing just scuffs up too easily and considering how I payed a lot of money (especially that i'm a college student) I don't want this thing to be scratched from light use. - This is in conjunction with the previous gripe, but it's nice to see that Apple is making their own case (nano tubes), but they should've had these available the same day as the nano, because right now there are a lot of users that are already disappointed with the durability of the face of the nano.

<Content>The minute I saw it, I had to have it.  Once it arrived, I was not disappointed, far from it: it is smaller and more elegant in reality than it appears in photos.  And it sounds good, and the screen is very, very sharp.  Finally, it works with standard iPod accessories, like my Griffin Technologies Tune Juice.  If you travel extensively, the larger hard drive based iPod is probably better, but if you stay close to home, and can rotate the music on your iPod Nano, this is the ideal option.  The flash memory based Nano is quieter, and has better battery life.

<Content>I've received 2GB iPod nano today.  I tried to upload 290 songs to my iPod nano using iTunes 5 in Windows environment. It took more than twenty five minutes to sync all songs. I don't know why. I used latest notebook from Samsung (same as Dell's ODM model). Also browsing speed is some kind of bulky. I'd like to use Firewire to transfer songs, but iPod nano doesn't support Firewire data transfer. I've read other reviews that transfer speed is far more better than mine. What's wrong with my iPod nano? :-(

<Title>Everything awesome except for cheap scratchable plastic face
<Date>Fri Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Sure, it looks and works wonderful. But putting this thing into a pocket scratches the finish. The plastic is softer than a CD. They (APPLE) want you to buy colorful cases (thirtybucks) to protect it. why would I put a pink plastic case over a nice shiny black ipod nano? Well the thing does scratch easily but I refuse to that much for a set of ugly cases. So just expect scratches with even cotton pockets on your levis. Now for the good part. The thing is really small and so high tech that it could have come off the starship enterprise. The thing works great and the music sounds great. The screen is brighter than the regular ipod photo (I have the 30gig model). So other than the cheap plastic front, the rest of it is really awesome.

<Content>The day I was planning to buy an iPod mimi, was the day that iPod nano was announced. I have decided to get the nano and I am happy that I did. It is very impressive. I have transfered many songs and pictures to my nano. It is very small. I still didn't take off the plastic from the front part of the nano, I don't want it to get scratched up. I wish they had a clear case avalable at the market. I bought a black nano and don't want to use a different color case. Overall, it is nice. Only negative part is that as soon as you touch the nano, shades of your fingerprints gets traced to the nano and if you try to erase the traces with the cloth, the surface gets messy. Hopefully the battery will last a long time. [...]

<Content>This thing holds 2 GB of data. This equals about 250 songs. "What only 250? There are way better mp3 players with way more memory!" Let's face it. Who listens to 250 songs a day, even a week? If you want to hear new stuff, how long does it take to add and delete songs? I have over 4,000 songs on my computer, and this thing works just fine. I don't think anyone needs more than 2 GB of data. Yeah, changing songs every day can be a hassle, but there's no need to go any higher. The only thing that I see as a problem is the price. You could buy the 20GB Photo for only a hundred more dollars. The math for the prices is not linear. The 20GB should cost 10 times that of the Nano since its hard drive is 10 times bigger, or better yet the Nano should cost a tenth of the 20GB, making it about $30. Just a thought, Apple.

<Title>Compelled to review
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't write a lot of reviews, but feel obligated when there is a product, book or something that i really enjoy. While the Nano certainly doesn't need any additional support with all the positive reviews I see, I didn't feel right about enjoying it so much without sharing my experience. I was torn between the 2 and 4 gb models, and almost went to 4 for only $50, but I then equated that to spending an extra $0.25 at the movies for the extra large coke - you just don't need it! 500 songs should be plenty, especially since you can erase and replace whenever you want!  besides, if you've read the tipping point by malcolm gladwell (not a plug, but I'll be reviewing that next!), you know that after 150 songs you probably have too many songs to be familiar with anyway!!! What can I say, the ipod experience is awesome, and the size of this new unit makes it even better than I imagined. Buy one.

<Title>Apple admits to Nano duds
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a "vendor quality issue". Apple finally admits it.   So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars, I say call yourself lucky that your's isn't one of the duds, and ask that you apologize to those you flamed.   To those stuck with the broken units, get back with Apple and demand a replacement of your DEFECTIVE unit.   I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option

<Title>Beautiful Nano has a few Weak Spots
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The nano is beautifully engineered hardware & software; However, there are some flaws:  ** Cheap Earbuds - the included earbuds sound lousy - not even close to my old Sony MDR-E838's that I got years ago with a minidisc portable.    ** Has only canned equalizer settings to choose from.  Haven't found a way to use the custom EQ settings from iTunes.    ** Weight is over spec - advertised as 1.5 oz (42.5 g), actual is 1.75 oz (49.5 g) - not including earbuds.  Otherwise it's fantastic - integrates perfectly with iTunes.  No problems here with scratches or cracks so far.

<Title>Running with tunes again
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had the 4th Generation 40GB iPod for ~1 year and love it.  It holds a fair amount of my music collection and entertains me more than I can imagine. Along comes the iPod Nano and oh my word!  I've been running with the 40GB version and I'd been contemplating picking up a Shuffle.  Then Steve Jobs has to go and show me this...  I tried to order one as soon as I could find it.  Finally tracked down a 2GB black version and I use it every single day.  It has helped get me through more long runs and training than I ever imagined.  It goes with me everywhere. My only complaint is that the face & back can get scratched fairly easily.  I don't have the time to sit and baby the Nano every time I go running, so I've decided to just live with it.  It is more for function than for beauty in my case anyways. If you pick one up you won't regret it!

<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was in the market for an iPod for a while now and had my heart set on the U2 photo edition.... until I saw the Nano. It's unbelievably small, yet packs the same features as the traditional iPods (only thing lacking was the space). I mainly use mine in the car so it's not a porblem to change around the songs when I feel like.... but that combined with the Belkin FM transmitter makes it a dream !!

<Title>Flashy, but can't work too well... 3 1/2 stars
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I saw this iPod nano and LOVED it.  It was small, flashy, and had everything you would need in an mp3 player.  BUT, when I was just dreaming about having a nano (I have a blue mini and even though the nano outshines it, I still LOVE it) a girl with a locker next to me had hers in her hand.  I asked her if I could hold it and she yes.  After fantazing about how that could be MY nano, she exclaimed that it would turn off. (you have to press the play button for it to turn off.) I see it and the battery is full, so I try to turn it off for her... it wouldnt work.  So, her had to keep her nano turned on for the rest of the school day until she could reset it.  It ended up with a dead battery... The nano has faults... people who have the iPod nano notice these faults even though they put 5 STARS ***** sometimes it would freeze on them, it won't play, they notice these mistakes but are so entrapped into the nano that they don't want to admit it. Even though i have 3 stars, I would reccommend the nano to people who just love flashy and OKAY working mp3 players.  The people who would buy this iPod need to be patient. It would definely freeze on them.  But, I admit, I would love to get an iPod nano, because I'm one of those people... but just warning those impatient people out there!!! =]

<Content>I've had an i-Pod Nano for over a year, and I'm still just amazed!  What a great invention.  Wish Elvis could see them. No more taking CD's (or tapes--yes I can even remember "records") to have music. I have the 500-song capacity nano, but it's just amazing!  I can't compare it to any other mp3's or anything--I just think how great these little gadgets are! I have had NO problems with the Nano.  I do have it in a clear case so it isn't scratched. Do I need to even bother checking "I am over the age of 13"? (My next "amazing invention" is going to be a GPS.  I can't wait!)

<Title>Blaaaaa
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have owned a black 1st gen 2GB iPod for about a year, and I'm not happy.  I had very few problems with it until recently, the buttons on it stopped working and doing apples recommended "5 r's" did not help.  I called apples technical service line and guess what...THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TALK TO ME...unless your ipod is still under the 1 year warranty, they will not give any help, at all, none. They did however refer me to their online forums...what a joy...here I find 20 other people with he same problem I'm having, with still no answers.  I found no "authorized ipod technician" on these forums, just a bunch of frustrated customers with unanswered questions.  Apple refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem and don't seem too keen on fixing it.  If you do still plan on buying this product (and I don't recommend it) at least buy an extended service plan like I did.  When I got mine Bestbuy offered a 2 year "Product Replacement Plan" basically you can send your ipod in any time within 2 years for any problem and they will send you a voucher which is in-store credit for the cost of the ipod when you bought it + any tax, A great deal in my opinion, I think it only cost an extra $30

<Content>I got the first generation nano 2GB as a xmas present back in 2005. I thought it was great,until March 2006. I was using it one day when it just froze. It came back about 24 hours later. It froze about every 2 months after that. I am now fed up with Apple and thank god, I lost my iPod the other day. I was glad! I later went to buy.com and ordered a Zune 30GB for about $100. What a deal that is! I am trying to make a promise to myself not to buy an Apple product again. Steve Jobs can go take his iPod and iPhone and stick it up his a$$!

<Title>I should have gotten the 4gb!!!
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My brother got me the ipod shuffle for my birthday- but luckily the nano was released within 30 days of my return by date!!!! so i got the white nano- there were 2 guys at the apple store returning the black ones because the screen was all scratched up. they ended up going with the white because it's harder to see scratches.  knock on wood- i have not experienced any defects with the nano casing or lcd screen. (in reference to the numerous lawsuits being filed)  the color screen is amazingly clear. i wear super tight ultra low rise jeans and the nano easily slips into my front pocket!   i've never owned, touched, or used an ipod previous to this gift-  but i use mac. being able to use my "magic bone" (yeah i'm one of those nerds who name inanimate objects) for ical, contacts, and notes is simply fabulous! currently i'm running jaguar so i had to use isync to synchronize my files- but it's really not a big hassle... though i may change my mind when i upgrade to tiger later on this week. i kept reading info saying you HAD to have 10.4--- NOT TRUE! you just have to do one extra step- click the options button on itunes.  if you're going to get a nano- get the 4GB!!!! I'm probably going to give my 2GB to a friend and buy the 4GB... 500 songs is really not enough... plus- i had to delete the entire song directory just so i could download some applications from a friends computer. if you plan on using the nano for data storage and music- get the 4GB!!!!  SENUTI- google it- i didn't realize til last week that you couldn't transfer music FROM the ipod nano TO your computer. This program is freeware- and works perfectly for transfering music files. using the nano with Tiger is just one step easier for syncing your ical and contacts- but i still don't think its necessary to run tiger with your nano.

<Title>Another reason to love Apple
<Date>Thu Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple is like a a bad marriage. The husband beats the wife but the wife sticks around to take in the name of love. Thats what being an Ipod owner is. Take a product that is "popular amoung the masses" and make it one of the worst products ever to be manufactured, wrap it in white and silver and bam, commercial sussess! Why is it about this liitel Ipod that makes people spend their savings. Not only do ALL Ipods have terrible battery life, but now there are reports surfacing that the screens are some crap and that it fades or becomes almost to hard to read after like two weeks. It seems that one must handle this new Nano like a paper crane, when its supposed to be something that is easy to transport.   All in all the Nano proves that Apple is sacrificing workmanship in exchanges for trendiness. Its sad when Americans waste 200.00 for a product that will essentially do nothing but let them down. Apple shouldnt release such a defective product until it can come up with the technology to make it durable. The idea is there, but the workmanship isnt.  So if your one of those urban-wannabe-chic-metrosexual-look at me and my liitle Nano type of people, do your self a favor. Save your money and buy a Walkman cassette player.   Long live 8-Trac!

<Title>Just fascinating over and over again
<Date>Fri Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Every time I  look at the little black nano I am surprised about its size, its feel and its capabilities...the menus work well, the wheel responds fast (er than my 30 GB iPOd photo) and updating it via USB isnt as much of a pain inthe brain as I initially feared it might be...   downsides are:   its either PC or Mac compatibility , NOT both...(and I thought i could use it as a convenient way to transfer files)  and....its princesslike behavior towards anything that touches it...the little jeanpocket Steve put it in? hm. nothing in it...but it has scratches when i took it out...a cloth to polish sunglasses (the high quality super-technical stuff that comes with Ray Bans)..scratches it too...  But this lead to the development of our nano leather sleeves...so bad things have a good outcome sometimes, you can find it by searching for a "nano sleeve" here on amazon.   Buy a nano, be happy and remember: WRAP WHAT YOU LOVE!

<Title>Killer Gadget BUT a case is a MUST!!!!
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I received my custom engraved 2GB white iPod nano yesterday and had about 4 hours playing with it and these are my ideas about it...(already have a 1 GB shuffle) 1. Packing (might not be a whole lot but it means something): Very simple yet elegant packing, box and Apple sign look so classy on it. Once you open it, the iPod is safely embedded in hard card board where it fits snuggly. Now on the back of the iPod is a *small* piece of plastic with 5 lines (yes 5 lines) that gives you the how to instructions...Now I'd like ANY of the mp3 manufacturers out there who claim to be 'iPod killers' to show me the instructions on how to use their mp3 players...please give me a break...the manual for the nano is like 10 folded pages...very simple and to the point!  2. Look and feel:  Not much to say here, everyone has seen this thing and yes it is VERY VERY small, you might think it's delicate however it's very hard and sturdy. As for the feel...this thing feels solid...not like some cheap mp3 player out there.  3. Scratchability and finger print-catchability: Personally, I have NOT removed the plastic film all along the front because from the glossiness and shine of the surface it's clear that even tiny dust particles will scratch the surface if you try and wipe it off with anything even  with your fingers or a soft cloth. Now the thing that everyone's been kinda ignoring it is the finger prints on the back, I had prepared myself by washing my hands before handling it (sounds crazy but I did it after I saw the shinyness of the back), after charging the iPod and putting some pictures on it, I held it in my hand for a little - about 30 minutes or so-(hey you know I've been patient for 3 charging hours, now's the time to play) I basically played a few songs, a few podcasts, then I was brave enough to flip the iPod over and look at the 'shiny' glossy back and oh my god, I was shocked at the amount of finger prints all over the back. This thing is a finger print MAGNET...now to clean the back I had to use a piece of cloth that came with Oakley glasses...it took me roughly 15 minutes to clean the back 'cautiously' such that the glossy back doesn't scratch while I'm cleaning the finger prints.  4. Charging: 1 hour and the battery sign was full, but since this was a first charge I left it 3 hours just to charge the battery completely.  5. Usability: For being the first iPod I have with a screen it took me roughly 2 minutes to figure out how to navigate the menus back and forth and to play songs and to view the pictures...very simple and very straight forward.  Conclusion: Great gadget but having a case for it is a MUST if you want to save the great looks, otherwise don't regret losing the looks and ending up with just the great performance. I'm personally thinking of buying the double layer iSkin Duo for the iPod nano..and till then my iPod nano is going to be wrapped in the plastic it came in in the box, I don't want to spoil the looks of my cute iPod.

<Date>Sat Oct 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought my nano today and i have to say, it is simply amazing. the sound quality is great, it sounds just like the speakers i use for my comp. the interface is incredibly simple, and i like the wheel feature, you just have to run your finger over it and it will move. However, the only complaint i have with the nano is that the back gets scratched up easily. BY THE WAY FOR EVERYONE WHO SAYS NANO SCRATCHES EASY NANO IS MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE ORIGINAL IPOD. the back is soooo nice, but once u get fingerprints on it, it looks old. I'd recommend buying a scratch-removing cream from walmart, or any other store like that. you can also get them on ebay for about 7 bucks a tube. This is my first ipod and i simply love it!

<Content>I actually bought my Nano used (only 6 mo. old) from my brother-in-law upgrading to the iPod 80 gig. It holds all my songs but I've had to reformat as the songs began messing up - Never thought an audio file could run at higher speed. Think 45 rpm sped up to 78 rpm. Weird. I hated the iPod buds as they wouldn't stay in my ears. Wish I could delete songs direct from my iPod or at least when connected to my PC. Otherwise it helps alot with my dreary commute by train.

<Title>Needs to hold more songs and how do you put photos on it!
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The ipod nano is OK but is not great it can hold some more song and is a huge pain to put photos on it because the camera adapter does not work with the ipod nano.If you want to get an ipod nano get the new one which can hold up to 500 songs,1,000 songsor 2,000 songs and comes in 6 colors and the colors are Blue,Pink,Black,Green,Silver and Red.(Red is only sold on [...]).

<Title>My Favorite New Toy
<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Commuting to work I often wondered how this teeny-tiny gadget that I see other commuters have "plugged" in their ears work and just what was the "craze".  When I finally gotten up the nerve and purchased my iPod, after very easy registering and downloading, I now have my answer as to what everyone have "plugged" in their ears.  The sound is incredible and it is now a pleasure to know I never have to carry around a CD player with a gazillion CD's!  I'm elated that I've made it to the 21st Century -- it is a wonderful investment, especially for someone who is not savvy in computer-downloading.

<Content>you guys should really consider on getting on getting this ipod ano. It is really great. Im not a huge fan of the 2nd generation ipod nanos so i got this one because of its style and look. Also apple doesn't make this kind of ipod nano anymore so maybe in a few years it will be worth alot of money like the 3rd gen and 1st gen ipods. The sound quality is really great. also the way of findong and picking out your own song is really easy. I suggest on getting this ipod nano. This ipod nano is the 1st generation by the way. deffinetly get the 1st generation ipod it is just great

<Title>DECEPTIVE
<Date>Tue Mar 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this item for my boss--it was a group gift. The price was excellent. However, when it arrived, the receipt indicated that it was not new, but a refurbished item. I was appalled as the description never indicated that.  My only recourse was to call Ritz Camera immediately. The representative informed me that all their ipods on amazon are refurbished. When I told her that it was not marked as such, she reiterated that they should be advertised that way and that it was Amazon's mistake. I was told that Ritz would send me an authorization form to make the return...plus the 25 dollar shipping I paid to expedite the item. I am still waiting for the form and it's been almost a month. I e mailed Amazon about the problem but never heard back from them. I also had to send back a sport sleeve accessory that I had purchased on Amazon as well...and also paid shipping. I again e mailed Amazon asking to be able to be credited for the shipping due to this debacle. Never heard back again. I would hesitate to do any buying from Amazon again. There is no recourse and no one to talk to if there is a problem.Buyer beware !!

<Title>Thing of Genius!
<Date>Sun Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Words can't describe how amazing this new product is. IPOD NANO! You might think that I am someone that has bought this product yesterday and don't know how garbage this is. Wrong! I bought it on the first day when it came out and it never lost my approval. Firstly, people say that it is so small that it can break easily. This is the most durable music product that I have ever owned. I dropped it from my head to the floor and from the shelf twice. It still works and looks beautiful. People get angry when this thing is scratched. What can you expect, it is to be portable, and the back is reflectant.  What I dissaprove is the lacking of a charger. You could charge it on the usb port which I do. So i leave the computer on for around four hours lol. The size is amazing. It is so portable that I can listen to it all day, which I do. The screen is crisp and clear, comparing to my cell phone with the same size. I'm suprised that it has a six lines of text on it and photo playback! The click wheel is a thing of genius. It is like two diffent sets of buttons in one. The headphones are great but get a bit tistorted while playing loud. I have 350 songs on it at this moment, but I would recommend getting the 4 gb. I am returning mine for the 4 gb. The orignal ipod cost the same much with 20gb but I'm sticking with the Nano.   Pros: Ultra Small Fast downloading (half a sec per song) shiny back lol Crisp screen clickwheel  Cons: No charger (USB PORT) Scratches easily (not a problem) Too much attention  Beware! This gathers too much attention, it could get stolen easily.  All in all, this is my best investment, and I highly recommend you getting this. 10 Stars!

<Title>Scratches way to easily
<Date>Fri Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have joined a class action lawsuit against Apple because of how easily the Nano scratches.  For those of you who think this lawsuit is stupid, worthless and for those who think the iPod nano is made exactly the same as previous iPods, you're wrong. I suggest to those who believe this to read the filing that these two law firms filed. It suggests that Apple knowingly made these iPods with thinner materials, making them easier to scratch, to lower manufacturing cost. This is why this lawsuit is not stupid or "bull". A company who makes a bad product knowingly should be held accountable!  I have five iPods; iPod mini, a 20GB iPod, an iPod shuffle, an iPod U2 Edition, & iPod nano. All of them have gone into my hoodie pocket that contains nothing else (no keys, no pens, paper, etc.). All of them are scratch free except the iPod nano. I bought the iPod nano September 15, 2005 at Best Buy and took it home where I laid the box on my desk. It stayed there until Monday morning where I took it out of the box (for the first time) and loaded all the music I wanted onto it. I was leaving for vacation that day by the way. I put the Nano in my hoodie pocket, with nothing else in there, and left for the bus. A few moments into my trip and I took the Nano out of my soft cotton made hoodie pocket and it was scratched badly enough already that it is hard to see what is on the screen.  I feel I, and everyone else who has a scratched iPod nano, am entitled to a new iPod nano from Apple, however, all I really want Apple to do is admit that they have a bad product out there and I want them to fix it for future iPod nanos (which I have no doubt they've already done). Maybe before you commit on a case such as this, you should get off your lazy ass and actually do some reading and research. Not all lawsuits are frivolous!

<Title>Worthless Software
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll start off by saying that I am biased against apple.  I bought this thing for my mom because she wanted something small and thought this looked cool.  The software for this is some of the worst I have ever used in my life.  I thought that the creative labs MediaScource was bad but I was wrong.  One thing that I could never figure out is why USB devices are so annoying to install.  You can't plug it in prior to installing the software and if you do you're SOL.  After installing and uninstalling every bit of the drivers that came with this thing I still cannot get iTunes to recognize the iPod even though Windows does.  And of course it will not function without iTunes.  Even during the installation when it tries to format the iPod it just stalls out (much to my dismay the progress bar is just on a set loop; so it does not actually show any progress).    I am not a fan of any of the MP3 player software; I personally would like to see it function like a removable storage device.  Just move whatever files you want over and it will play anything that's a supported file type (just like an MP3 CD you put in your car).  But it is especially annoying when the software you need won't recognize your device even though everything else does.

<Title>I have lotsa toys, but the Ipod Nano is awesome!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have a lot of audio equipment.  My main system headphone amp is worth $1000 by itself.  I love music.  Mainly classical.  I am also a geek, and love portable audio. I have had cassettes, and have minidisc.  I have had hard drive players by Creative, Rio, Archos, eDigital, iRiver, going back to the Creative Jukebox 1.  I wanted an iPod Mini, but they are discontinued.  So I got a iPod Nano 2gb.  Had it for about a week.  IT IS AWESOME.  The best portable player I  have tried.  Interface, sound, size, screen.  Just great!  The software (iTunes) is ok.  It is not perfect, but does the job well.  Creative has a good software package, and the iRiver makes you use Windows Media Player or the like...it comes with no software.  The iPod comes with two nice bonus features.  1) Podcasts.  Sound files from sources all over the net, that can be added and updated to your iPod automatically when you connect it to PC. 2) [...].  Audible Manager does not work with the iPod, but you CAN play files you legally download with Audible Manager to your computer!  There is also online music purchasing from iTunes website.  I don't use that though.  Too bad iPod can't work with Rhapsody, my current online service.  Proponents of other brands say the fact that the iPod batteries cannot be user changed is bbbbbaaaaddddd.  I thought that.  Now I don't mind.  Apples battery service is only $60 (check their website for details).  A battery for other brands is usually $50. Little difference.  Not many accessories out for Nano yet.  I ordered a case for it online from eBay (no, don't get your ipod from eBay).  Downsides: I wish I had gotten the 4gb! You can only charge Nano with USB cable connected to your PC (cable supplied).  An optional charger from Apple is $30! There are cheaper substitutes out there, but buyer beware! The Nano scratches easily.  But I got it to listen to music with, not visually adore, though I do....  I gave the iPod Nano five stars.  It's worth it. Too me, it's only main competitor is Creative Zen Micro.  I have one of these too.  Yeah, Geek.  But the Zen will not play protected files [...] (I think it will with the update of firmware, but I did not like this update).  If you decide to purchase a player, make sure you have a good return policy.  One comment..the itunes software is strange in some functions.  Like it does not use the word "delete".  To delete something, you use "Clear".  Weird.  As usual, provided help files leave a bit to be desired.

<Title>So easy to scratch you wished it was an itch!
<Date>Sat Oct 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I saw it.  I loved it.  I wanted it.  I paid $250 for it.  It ordered it engraved.  I finally got it.  I loved it even more.  It looked good.  It sounded good.  It was exactly as advertised.  Until.  Until the second day.  It was scratched so badly you would think some cat had a fever.  If you have to have one, get a sleeve for it first.  Don't open the box until you get a sleeve!  Then be sure you use the softest cloth possible to put it in its sleeve.  Then never, ever take it out of its sleeve.  In a sleeve, it may not look as cool as the product you bought but it won't have any scratches on it.  Well at least not as many.  At least then you'll be able to see the screen.  Apple is usually a pretty good manufacturer but I haven't a clue how this product got by their quality control department.

Once i bought it i couldn't believe how wonderful is this player, no comments about ITunes.  As everything pretty you have to take care of it so it can continue looking pretty, as the same as a car or everything else.  I didn't take off the cover from the face so it's all good, i'll get the silicone cover later, anyway is not a matter of showing it to everybody, it's a listening to music thing.

This product was purchased under the "used" category but the seller, true to their comments about it being either a return or store display item seemed accurate. The IPOD seemed brand new and there have been no problems with it. The seller said all features had been tested. I think they must have been very diligent in their assessments. Again, we've had no problems with it and our daughter was so excited about getting an IPOD for Christmas. We could not have afforded one in any other way.

<Content>I LOVE the iPod nano! Sure, there's the 4GB version but I see no need in spending more money when I can get this less expensive one that holds 500 songs.  I love the style and yes, be careful that it doesn't get scratched. For this, I recommend getting a iPod case.   The iPod 2GB nano is very small and handy. The navigation is super easy. I love that unlike other mp3 players, you can organize your songs. You don't have to click 6,000 times just to get to one song!  If you want a nice trendy mp3 player that can store a decent amount of songs AND that isn't as expensive as the recent iPods, then this is the one for you. :)

<Title>Love My Nano! Better Than I Expected!
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Upon asking for any mp3 player for my birthday, my husband went above and beyond and got me the White 2 GB iPod Nano. I've been overly impressed with its performance and durability thus far! I don't have a huge music library so the 2 GB is more than enough for my needs and I don't ever see myself using it for all of its capabilities - since I mainly wanted an mp3 player for the gym. But for the more experienced, all-inclusive iPod user this little guy does it all, and with ease! Transfer speed is faster than I would have expected, and installation was a cinch as long as you follow the directions they give you EXACTLY! If you plug in your iPod before installing iTunes you ARE going to have trouble with iTunes recognizing it.  The 4-star rating is more in relation to my issues with the iTunes software, which I found a little less than user-friendly. Simple things like right-clicking on the name of the track to rename it isn't possible (you have to click once, pause and click again). I think the design is a little overly simplistic, which leaves a need for general-use explanation. Other than little things here and there iTunes is nicely automated to sync with all of your music and picture folders.  One bone I have to pick with Apple is this...you release a great product and practically NO accessories??? This product has been out for over a month now, and the only thing available (thank goodness) is the armband. You'd think at the very least they would have also released the protective sleeves...but apple.com and even Amazon don't show it's availability for another 2 weeks or so. I can't wait for the accessories to come out since I'd love to get something to play this in my car.  Overall - great product, maybe a little pricey given the other varieties that are out there. But I think you're paying a premium for the size (or lack thereof), and flashiness of it all. I personally was glad I received the Nano as opposed to a full-sized iPod. I held my friends a few days after I got my Nano and I couldn't imagine using it at the gym with how heavy it was. I think the newest generation iPods (with video) are slightly smaller and lighter than the old ones, though.

<Title>Once again amazed by Apple
<Date>Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The ipod Nano is (in my opinion) the best ipod that Apple has ever made. It is also one of the smallest MP3 players so it's easy to hold. Also if you have an ipod mini, this is a good upgrade. Here's some stuff you should know before buying one.  The size: Impossibly small. Thats all there is to it. And the only way you'll truly understand is if you hold one.   The screen: Perfected but very small. But what can you expect, the ipod itself is small. Besides, a 2-inch screen is fine for music, a little too small for pictures, but at least its in color. Everything looks better on a color screen!   The sound: Awesome sound! (if it didn't have good sound I probably would have rated it 3 stars) Along with the screen, the sound is also perfected. No static, no skips. Nothing to mess up your songs. Its simple, you press play and you hear music, not static. Clean, sweet, music.  The games: A great, fun, waste of time. I especially like music trivia, where they play part of one of your songs and you have to try to guess what song it is. The other games are Brick (similar to pong), solitaire (you know, the card game), and parachute. All of the games are really fun ways to occupy your time, great for when your stuck in a terminal waiting for a plane.  The photos: The photo storage is one of the main reasons I bought this ipod. The 20 GB ipod photo may store more photos, but the Nano is smaller and less expensive. It holds enough pictures for any photography geek to be satisfied with. I also enjoy the slideshows with music feature, it's fun to mess around with. I'd say, this is the second best way to occupy your time (the games are a clear first place).  The headphones: No. I do not like the headphones at all. They have a weird shape that isn't that comfortable. I use the headphones from my old MP3 player because I simply do not like them.  Downloading music: Itunes is very easy and fast. The only problem with it is, if you are one who likes hundreds of songs, you'll end up spending enough money to buy an 60 GB ipod with video, and that wouldn't be very good, would it. If this is you, limewire is only fifty bucks away.  Here's a list of accessories you might want to consider buying. 1.) Some sort of ipod Nano armband for those of you who run. It isn't fun having to carry an MP3 player when your trying to run. Trust me. 2.) An ipod Nano dock so you can connect to a computer and get songs and photos easier and faster. It won't kill your bank account, only about $30. 3.) Any earphones or headphones from Bose are great, but if Bose isn't in your budget, still buy new headphones because like I said, the ipod headphones stink. 4.) An itrip FM transmitter to listen to the radio on your ipod. They dont have their own radios like most other MP3 players do.  Overall, the ipod Nano is Apple's best MP3 player with a great screen, great sound, and a great size. This MP3 player is for anyone, kids, adults, grandparents, makes a great gift and is somewhat affordable. I hope you take my advise and buy the Ipod Nano because you will be as amazed and satisfied as I am.

<Title>It's good...yet bad
<Date>Sat Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This ipod is pretty much a shrunk down version of the ipod photo. It does all the same things including playing music and slide shows. There of course are a few problems. For one the ipod scratches like no other. If you barley even touch you will see a mark on the body. Just a minor touch to the screen makes a mark that is easily visible. Another problem wiht the ipod is that it cracks in half easily. My friend sat down with it in his pocket and it cracked in half rigth down the middle. All in all I have to say that I just don't like this ipod. I do know that you can buy a case for it but it costs almost 30 dollers to buy a case that isn't that good. I would highly recomend buying the new ipod that can play videos.

<Title>one word: AMAZING!
<Date>Sun Oct 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I got the iPod nano, 2GB in white for my sweet 16. I LOVE IT. Only my second mp3 player, but my first flash player. It looks so small in the commercial, but is TINY in your hands. I got fingerprints on the back too easily, and there is some mark on the front already, but other than that its ok. I've heard it scratches easily. It comes with some games, like solitaire, blocks, parachute, and a music game. You can sync your calendar and contacts with it, whether you use a Mac or PC. The sound is great. The earphones that come with it don't fit in my ears, so I use my own. The click wheel is fun. Kind of strange if its your first iPod, but its easy to get into. Also, you can customize the main menu, if you dont want to go through multiple menus to get to "repeat" you can just put it on the main menu. It doesn't come with an adapter, you have to plug it in to the computer to charge it, or buy an adapter. I think that kind of sucks, but when am I without my computer? Overall, its great. Everything I wanted and more.

<Title>Small But Perfectly Formed !!
<Date>Thu Nov 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok... This might be the first iPod that I've owned but I've been an admirier of Apple's work for some time. I have several friends with various generations of the original iPod and always loved the combination of art and technology that goes into them.  I had been the owner of a Sony mp3 player for about 2 years and until this summer had no reason to think about replacing it. 256meg of memory seemed enough for me and it was small too. What more did I need really ?? However, over the summer my trusty sony got washed and so it was time to look for something to replace it.   In the run up to my birthday Apple launched the Nano and I instantly fell in love with it. I have no real need for 60 gigabytes of storage but knew that 256 meg was limiting the amount of music I could carry around with me. Even the 2gig version which held 500 songs would be fine for me. I added a Nano to my birthday wish list and waited !!  Last Friday I opened up the sleek box to feast my eyes on my Nano for the first time. Even though I'd read pages of reviews about the player, I was still amazed at the size (or lack of size) of this unit. It's just tiny !! Not so small that you'd lose it but small enough that when It's in your pocket you can forget its there. The screen is so bright and clear and the sound !!.... WOW. For such a small player, it certainly packs quite a punch in the volume department. Full volume would certainly lead to hearing damage after a short time.  The iTunes software that comes with it is easy to install and easy to use. I was soon burning my CD's onto my PC with ease. A 10-12 track CD takes around 2-3 minutes to load onto the PC but uploading those same songs onto the iPod takes a fraction of that time. Infact on day 1 I loaded about 450 songs onto my player and it can't have taken more than 5 or 6 minutes. The product specs say that the 2gig version will hold 500 songs. Well I've got about 560 on mine at the moment and there is still about 250 meg free. I'm sure that the actual storage capabilities depend on the length of the songs you're loading.  I'd read lots about the problems with early versions of the Nano with regard to failing screens and scratches etc. but guess what ??... stuff gets scratched and damaged, thats just how it is. if you;re silly enough to think that anything will stay as pristine as the day it was bought, then you're bound to be dissappointed. I will be buying a case for mine (probably an Agent18 hard case) because I want to keep it in the best shape possible. I'd reccommend others do the same, not because it will fall apart if you don't but because when you're spending $200 on something, you want to look after it !!  I'm not going to tell anyone that the iPod Nano is the best value mp3 player on the market. There are plenty of others that have it beat hands down in terms of storage and price. However, I am willing to say that It's probably the sexiest mp3 player around and has the competition beat when it comes to looks. Add to that the fact that 500+ songs is probably more than enough for most users, that the quality of the sound is excellent and that (sor far) battery life has been up there with most of the others on the market, this really is an awesome piece of kit and well worth considering if you don't need the ability to carry around 25,000 songs !!  Bottom line... if you want a great looking player that is very capable and also has some neat additional functions that most of the others don't have then get out there and get yourself a Nano. If you want something thats gonna hold thousands and thousands of songs and withstand you throwing it around all the time, look elsewhere !!  I love mine  Mark

<Title>Overall a very good mp3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just bought my ipod nano today and I love it. It's truly an incredible device. Despite the negativness about scratches and the screen flaws, I took my precautions in advance and I'm able to enjoy this great mp3 player. I carry in an elegant silicon case which I bought from ebay at a very reasonable price.  Pros: Excellent and ergonomic design Very small size thus very protable Excellent screen Functional buttons (the wheel works fine even though I haven't removed the plastic tape and I carry it in a silicone case) Satisfactory sound quality Cool extra features  Cons: The headphones that come with the nano need replacment, the sound quality comes out very poor No extra accesories in the box, apart from the bad headphones, the useless for most people dock adapter and the USB cable iTunes is necessary or it won't load The expensive accesories It scratches easily   Overall its a great mp3 player, that you can really enjoy if you have some things in mind: You should first buy protective case against scratces You should first buy a good pair of headphones You should treat the device with care because it's more fragile compared to other versions of ipod

<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This IPOD is just not worth it.  After trading in my older IPOD for the nano, I was shocked at how scratched this one gets.  Then, after putting it in my pocket--as advertised--the screen cracked under very, very little pressure.  This is a design flaw that is becoming well known and will lead to this product's demise.

<Title>One of my best investments.
<Date>Sat Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> I have owned MP3 players that go up to $400 dollars and there is only one (and my last) that I honestly can say I couldn't imagine going on without, an iPod Nano. Why? Well a few reasons but to make it as short as possible:  Positive: 1.) Storage: With 2GB you can fit up to 500 songs and I don't know about you, but when I work out I truly go up to, at the most, 80-90 songs simply because I shuffle through them and change them often. A lot of times when I'm running at the gym there's usually that one song that gets my adreneline going and I'll listen to it a couple of times. 2.) Durability: Sadly, I have dropped my iPod Nano far too many times but if there's one thing that always impresses me, it's always just like new. Music plays great and hardly any scratches. (Remember I've dropped it numerous times now.) 3.) Easy to use: At first you might be a little confused but within minutes it's like two plus two. 4.) Light weight and convenient. 5.) Battery life: I have left my Nano uncharged for up to two days and then used it for around two hours and it STILL had life left!  6.) Good for both male/female: Yes, it's cute but I have seen men and women carrying the Nano around and there really is no labeled gender on this MP3 player.  Negative: The only bad thing about the Nano is that once in a great while it won't shut off for some reason when I want it to, but whenever I just give it a second and try it again, it powers off. This is minor and really doesn't affect the user at all.  Summary: This really has been one of my personal best investments and it is worth every cent; on sale or not. I recommend this to people who work out, are on the go, or maybe just to enjoy their music anywhere-anytime.

<Content>for a older man to use this product is amazing from a haunch that predated back in the early 70's.  back then, there was no walkman in the market and the small transistor radio has been around in the 50's. by then a small portable cassette tape decks were in the market. so the haunch that i was discussing with a friend is, " would it be nice in the future to have a pocket size 'thing' that can be carried around in your pocket with a headphone to listen to a recorded music?". my dream come true. it is small pocket size friendly, affordable, the headphone delivers good sound for its size, but the battery does not last long enough for a long trip.

<Title>The Perfect iPod
<Date>Thu Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is my first iPod purchase. After months of being subjected to the horrible music they play at my gym, I decided to take action and bring my own music to work out to! I knew from the get-go that I would purchase an iPod because I am an Apple fanatic. The decision for the 2GB Nano came when I saw how teensy the player is - I can wear it in the arm band holder and hardly even know it's there. Plus it holds up to 500 songs and plays for 14 hours (way longer than I'll ever need it to play, but it's refreshing to know that I could if needed).   I haven't used the slide show feature yet, but it sounds like something that would be cool to set up to show others (honestly I can't think of when I would need to look at photos on the screen).  All in all, I would say that if you are looking for a player to carry in your pocket or purse, this one is perfect. I haven't had any problems with it and couldn't be happier. It makes going to the gym so much nicer!

<Title>Fragile... yet beautiful! A review by a non-iPodder
<Date>Sun Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Let me start by saying that I'm coming to the iPod Nano from the world of flash MP3 players, this is my first iPod because I was waiting for Apple to make a decent flash MP3... and they've finally done it!  So here are the things I love about my iPod Nano after about a month of use:  1) Making playlists on iTunes, this is a wonderful feature that you just don't find outside the iPod world! 2) Beauty, the iPod Nano is without doubt the sexiest MP3 player alive today. Apple really knows how to make beautiful products. 3) Sound is great. 4) Love that click wheel thing, another great idea by Apple. 5) Beautiful big color display makes navigation easy and fun.  I know much of that is old hat to the iPod world, but for me coming from a world of Muvo's and iAudio these are wonderful features. Now for the bad news, why I didn't give the Nano a 5:  1) Fragile!! Doesn't Apple understand that part of the appeal of a flash player is ruggedness? I'm scared to take this thing outside or even put it in my pocket without protection.. I immediately went out and spent another $30 for a decent case which leads to 2) Where are the accessories? My iAudio's and Muvos came with cases and lanyards and armbands. iPod Nano: nothing!! The most expensive player I've bought to date and the one most in need of a protective case and I have to go and spend an extra $30 for what should have been included!  In summary, this is a wonderful product and a delight to use and behold. However, Apple does need to get a clue about durability and accessories imho!

<Date>Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Yeah apple for coming out with a bigger flash drive! I give them complete kudos for teaming up with Samsung on this! Anyways...that said...I still think that it lacks some features that are available in other models that are not apple! I think that I would still tell customers that really want a sports model that the shuffle still is a better way to go! I work in the retail industry (MP3) and have seen several broken screens already...and a couple screen where half the screen goes out! That said if you are still wanting a NANO please with it also imediately get a protective case, and I would reccomended Apples additional insurance on it! They sell it for 2 years for 59.00! That being said invest in it...The battery is a internal lithium ion battery, and is roughly good for a year to a year and a half.... if it goes out on you APPLE charges about 100+ dollars to fix it! I have seen them go out as early as three months from my customers! Nothing would be worse then getting stuck six months into being the proud new parent of a IPOD with a huge service bill from APPLE to get the now exspensive hunk of junk running again...EVEN if you don't buy it from APPLE lots of retailers offer service plans on them SO DO YOUR RESEARCH! SO you don't become one of the many disenchanted ipod owners I have met....Do your research, and don't be a I-sheep!

<Date>Mon Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the worst consumer product I have ever purchased.  I feared the worst when I opened the box and found out it does not come with a manual.  The "quick start" guide is inaccurate and useless.  There is no way to connect this very pretty paperweight to a computer in order to download music, since the installation program did not work on either of the two computers I own--dell laptop and dell desktop.  (perhaps this is a way to get you to buy an apple computer.) The online manual does not answer any questions relating to installation problems.  The telephone backup number is neither on the support website nor on any of the written material which comes with the nano and required a seperate websearch.  After finding the number, getting through to a tech person is quite difficult.  (when you say Ipod nano to the phone tree it asks you what type of macintosh you own) After a 15 minute wait, the telephone backup person was unable to solve the problem.  She then claimed that she would send me an article about how to solve the problem by email but didnt do so.  It is possible that someone with a great deal of computer experience could make this work but I have only been using a pc for 15 years and have never taken a computing course.

For this price, APPLE needs to include this as not all people who use it have a computer or always have one readily available with a USB port.

<Content>Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out  how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 players

<Content>DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!  Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).  Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan.

<Title>My 1st IPOD
<Date>Mon Nov 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer & uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers.

<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Okay. This is a device that I have owned (I say have, because I am about ready to sell it to some interested buyers)... but I found something that is way better. The Sony PSP.   Yea, the Sony PSP. It plays music, it has capability to insert a 4 gig SD PSP memory chip (mine has the one gigger at the moment until I sell my nano and buy the 4 gigger on a popular auction site), it play videos in GREAT video quality, and it plays games, AND it is web ready, you can surf the web anywhere there is a HOT SPOT. Hold pictures, and you can trade pics with other PSP's or email them from the web browser. USB hook up point. Has devices that charge it from the car... I use my FM Transmitter (iRiver) to broadcast the music in my car (yes this also has a headphone jack) - and there are about 100 accesories you can get for this device, including a BOOM BOX type of thing you sit this into (like the apples) but it only cost $199, and Apples cost $359. How much would you pay for a Video iPod? That only plays minimal games? $350?   GUESS how much the PSP cost? $199.   I really loved the iPod, but I really feel like I was ripped off by Sony because I didn't know that this device did all these things. Quite frankly I would not have bought the four different iPods I bought had I known that this device did all that it did.   It is NOT as small as a nano, but not much bigger than a iPod Video device. (and news is, they are going to make that one biggger too). So if your demands are a very small expensive device that only plays music, the iPod is for you. If you want more flexability in a device.. there is not a cheaper multimedia device on the market. Simply put.   The reason I put this in the Apple Nano review? Because I would have liked to have read this before I bought my nano, here in the amazon review section (which I use all the time) and changed my mind and bought the PSP.   Sony is looking for a device that will compete with APPLE all the time, and they don't even know they already have it. They should market this more instead of making those UGLY Mp3 players that will never come close to being as cool as any MP3 player that Apple makes (I use the term MP3 loosely here, and those apple folks know what I mean). Sony wake up. Apple folks who want to play games and have multimedia action, wake up!   All said and done, this may be the product for you.  But look.  It might not be the product.  The PSP does a LOT.  Plus music.  Have fun.

<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have one just like this and I love it so I bought one for my wife and she's gotten a lot of use out of her's as well!! I would certainly spend the extra money and go with the Apple because I have had little problems with their iTunes software. Also, if I were to buy another one, I would probably want a little more memory since I already have my 2 Gig practically full.

<Content>It is definitely temperamental, and I have had to talk to Apple tech support a number of times. . . for various problems, such as freezing up and not responding at all, for instance. When that happens you have to let the battery run out completely, which means you have to re-download everything that was on it when you power up again!! This has happened twice in the less than six months I have had my iPod.   I don't know if there is an MP3 device that is better - if there is I would love to know about it.

<Content>Well this is a very good ipod! I love it!!!!! I was going to get the sandisk 1gb but for 90 dollers more I would rather get an ipod! Downloading took almost a minute for 7 songs! Awsome! Itunes is easy! And even naming your songs is as easy as counting to 10! I got it as a early Christmas present! I am so lucky! The headphones are nice if you put the protecters on! Lightly place them in your ear! I am listing to my nano right now! If you really think about it Apple is not thay expensive! I mean I got a 2 bg wich holds 500 songs and 25,000 photos witch doesn't even take up a gb! If you are on vacatoin and run out of space on your digital camara, just load them on the ipod!     Pros:      excellent sound!     gorgeous color     easy use     quick charge     nice quick wheel         cons:     nothing except Apple has everything seprate!

<Title>iPod Nano
<Date>Wed Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, I bought iPod Nano and I have to confess, it is absolutely perfect! The use of flash-memory was a well-thought decision, and made the Nano look like a toy MP3 player. I live in Brazil and when I showed it to my friends, they didn't believed that such a little thing could play musics and hold up to 2000 5 MP pictures. I was really lucky of not losing them.  But, I have to confess too, this thing really scratches!! I was afraid of taking it for a lot of places because of the big risk of making a horrible scratch just in front of the photo you're showing to your friends. Even a nice case cannot protect your little gadget form the dangers of nowadays. I found myself needing to put mine in a sock and have the utmost care with it. In the other hand, one friend of mine bought the white Nano and till today, there are no scratch problems.  And other thing: I don't know if this happens to all iPods or just to mine, but sometimes the Play/Pause button didn't work everytime, and to switch my Nano off, I had to be very patient. Apple should correct this.  In the end, I recommend it. But I think you'd better buy the white Nano if you don't want to live with some incovenient scratches.

<Title>nifty little gadget
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Before buying i read the below reviews. GLAD I DID.however it is a FANTASTIC little gadget. despite it took me a day or so to master and im still having a little trouble with how gentle the scroll touch is.    1) the PLUG is separate! strange but true, i thought people were joking but i ordered one anyway, even though this comes with the USB cables, chamoix case etc it doesnt have an AC plug.   2) KEEP THE PLASTIC ON, i have only had this a few days and i decided to keep the screen plastic on the front and just trim the pull tab off. Like a palmtop the facia is very delicate and i have already noticed a few light scratches just from having it in my pocket. if you've already done this spend the few $ to buy the screen protectors for a palmtop and just trim it to size  3) the size. Well i tend to switch out my playlists to my mood anyway and it is fairly fast, HOWEVER, i could not fit more than a single playlist at a time so the size is a little bit limiting.   4) in case any tech savies care the new game packages such as HALO etc that are planned for the next year or so to go on the ipod probably will not fit on this AS WELL AS your music. If you want anything other than a fairly basic music player then opt for the bigger better ones.   5) THE ACTUAL SIZE: i also could not believe the size. i have seen the ads etc but when it finally arrived and i opened the case i almost couldnt find it because i thought it was just a picture that was part if the package. silly but true. it is tiny! however it also seemes very delicate because of this and im terrified of causing major damage by the slightest unintentional action such as leaving it in my bag and having somehting else bang against it.

<Title>This is the best
<Date>Sat Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Simply said, I love this Nano.  It is light-weight, easy to use, not bulky, the sound quality is excellent (especially after I got rid of the ear-buds that came with it - too big for my ears - and got a decent pair of earphones), and the color isn't white.  That said, I quickly realized that 500 songs were too few and have recently upgraded to the new iPod video.  But there are times when I really miss my Nano.  A couple of years ago, I unfortunately bought a second iPod (the Nano was my third) that was a lemon from the getgo.  It wouldn't hold a charge, and my local Apple dealer said, too bad.  I had sold my first iPod when I got the second, larger iPod/lemon. I still have it in its original box.  But I missed my music and I missed my iPod.  So when Apple came out with the Nano, it was love at first sight, and I decided to try again.  This Nano holds its charge without a problem.  For the beginner iPodder, the Nano is the perfect choice.

<Title>Great portable music player
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This little gem from Apple will hold close to 500 songs.  That is close to 40 compact discs.  This is perfect for having a large variety of music at your fingetips while walking, exercising or if you just want to crank up your music without disturbing others. If you use your player for strictly walking or working out, the NANO is the best choice by far.  It is so light that you really won't notice it in you shirt pocket.    If you have an extensive CD collection (over 100 CDs) and you are going to use it primarily as a music source for your home stereo, you really should consider getting the 30 or 60 gig model. If you can't afford the NANO, check out the iPod shuffle. It too is great for portability and affordability.  WHAT SCREEN SCRATCHES? I have had my NANO for about two months now.  I walk with it every day for over an hour. There is not a single mark or scratch on my screen. I always make sure that my pocket is free from any loose change, paper clips or keys that could damage the screen. When I put it down, it is always screen side up and I don't put stuff on top of my NANO. It is just like anything else, if you take care of it, you shouldn't have any problems :)  All iPods have scratchy chrome backsides....  but who cares?   If it bothers you that much, you should buy a case.  I would rather spend the money on a nice set of earphones! Which brings me to.............  WHY ONLY FOUR STARS? I threw those horrible "toy" earbuds immediately into the garbage where they belong. They were replaced with a pair of Shure E2C "in ear" earphones. If you are a true music lover and have about a hundred extra bucks, you can get a very nice pair of earphones that will give you a high end quality of sound even at 128 kbps compression.  You can't afford that you say? Even a twenty dollar pair of Sony earphones will be a major quality improvement in your listening pleasure.     ENJOY!

<Content>I needed a rugged MP3 player for jogging and travel. So far the nano has fit the bill (I 've used the device since July 2006). The ergonomics is satisfactory, but over rated. The touch wheel doesn't always respond as expected, and the iTunes softway disapoints if you're expecting a completely intuitive user interface. I originaly had a player from Creative, it stopped working twice and had to be exchanged by the seller. Its software was at best cluggy, would work with one of my computers, but not with the other. I had to download different software for different computers...bad quality all around.

She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening!

<Title>Expensive but a neat little toy
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't own the Apple Nano. My friend does and I used it enough to write an Amazon review about it.  Sound Quality: The sound quality was not as good as on my iRiver (my i had more clarity and a little more bass response), but the difference isn't even noticeable unless your obsessive-compuslive about sound. There is a custom EQ along with some presets to match what genre of music you like. I've never seen the Apple earbuds but most people say they are awful so you should probably pick up some better earbuds or headphones (the ones I have are the Panasonic RPHJE50's and my friend's are the cheaper Sony MDRJ10's if that helps you on your search).  Interface: Well, I must say I'm impressed. I will say that it's much easier to use than most MP3 players on the market (the iPod's interface is really the whole reason they are so popular). The artists, albums, genres, and titles are set up like most, in category forms so you can find your song. Note that 500 songs (128 kbps, trust me don't go any lower) is around 40 albums, so I would recommend stepping up to the 4 GB Nano which will hold 1,000 songs/80 albums. The software the Nano uses is iTunes (which most people are familiar with). It does pretty much any function Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or MusicMatch would do. It's easy to create playlists on iTunes and send them into your player.  Features: The Apple Nano has some features, even though it's somewhat lacking. One of the best features is it's size. This thing is small, only 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.27 inches and only weighs 1.5 ounces. The player does display album art, most MP3 players will not do that. It has a nice 1.5-inch color display and a photo viewer. It works with most OSs, even my friend got it to work on Windows 98. Some websites will podcast and you can put casts on your Nano. The Nano has some nice features, however, some of the features are lacking. The battery life is only 14 hours while most MP3 players are more than this. It charges and syncs with one USB, which means you have to take both along if you have to charge it. Hopefully your computer has a USB port in the front like me, that way you won't have much of a hassle. There is no FM tuner/recording but most people don't need that feature, however I think it should be deserved for the high cost.  Durability: The durability is much better than an iPod. I've heard batterys are fine on the Nano unlike iPods. It seems pretty durable, though I would highly recommend getting a case AND a rubber thing for it for two reasons. 1) It scratches very easily, both the plastic and the LCD. 2) The Nano will probably break if you drop it on concrete or the road.  Price: Just in my opinion, the price is way too high for just a 2 GB MP3 player. I think Apple is just asking for too much. I know it's small, but that still doesn't balance the price.  Overall: The Apple 2 GB Nano is a treat anyone would enjoy. Though the price is high and it doesn't have a radio or a record feature, it's good because of its size and its ease of use. 4 stars.

<Title>This thing sucks!
<Date>Tue Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ha, just kidding. I've never had an mp3 player. I previously owned a Sony MiniDisk player, however after finding out about the hidden rootkit on my hard drive, I have desided to jump Sony's ship. Boy, am I glad I did.  + I bought the 2 gig white version. I only have 300 songs on it right now and I still have plenty of room.   + Cut the bottom half of the clear plastic that comes on the front and you have a perfect screen protector.   + while the black looks cooler, the white shows almost no fingerprints (eccept the back).  + playback is skip free (no moving parts as opposed to hard-drive or MiniDisk based music players). So, jump rope and jog to your hearts content.  + Sound quality is great, it has plenty of equalizer settings (I use neutral)   - beware of the ear phones, many people find that they hurt your ears. Not me so much, however the sound quality is abysmal. Expect to spend some money on new headphones.  + the screen while small, is perfect for checking the cd that's playin. You can't see the details, but if you've ever seen the cd cover, a glance and you'll recognize what's playin.  + I haven't put any pictures on it but, if you don't have a picture of the cd case you can drag any picture you want into the artwork box. I have pictures of my wife, cats and other things I've picked up around the web (pictures that is).  -/+ I haven't had any battery problems since I have been adding new music almost every other day. So, I guess we'll see. I am worried about the $100 it will cost to change the battery but, by then I'm sure I'll have some new gadget.  - only because it's sooo expensive. I like to take it to the gym; it doesn't come with a case or lanyard so I have to hold it in my hand or put it in the cup holder on the treadmill. When I use free weights, I find myself compulsively checking it. (...).  +itunes is great. I used Sony's Sonic Stage previously (at the time I thought it was great), it sVcks compared to itunes. With Sonic you have to "check songs back in" and you can only take them out a preset # of times. What a joke! With itunes I can burn my entire music collection to dvd and send them to anyone.  -Watch out for that guy eye'n you on the train. These things are the Nike Air Jordans of 2006 and showing them around the wrong people could just get yer azz kicked. jay%^)

<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I agree with most of what everyone has said. The Nano is great for the gym and the casual music listener. But my god, look at the thing wrong and it scratches. I'm very careful with my things but when the cord from the provided headphones can scratch the screen that's pretty sad. Mine already has several scratches and I've only used it twice. I eventually put the sticker from the original box back on the screen. This thing definitely requires protection.

<Content>I have had my nano for about 2 1/2 months and i was very impressed initially. The sound is amazing and the color screen is awesome...until it gets scratched up. My best advice is to buy a case with your nano and put it in there as soon as it is out of the box. Also about a week ago my nano started going berserk and shuffling through songs really fast whenever i touched play. To fix this i had to clear the drive and reload all of my songs. Pain in the a$$. Overall it is a good product, just be sure to buy a case and a 2 year protection plan

I reccomend this ipod to all music lovers.  The one downside is that it scratches. But you can get a case for an extremely low price. If you travel alot, then I'd reccomend the charger.

<Title>iPod nano is pretty good
<Date>Sat Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my nano about two weeks ago from [...]. I got it customed engraved with my name on it. Everyone says they scratch easily, but I left the film on the front and not on the back and mine is fine. You just have to be extremely careful with it. My case hasn't arrived yet, but it hopefully will soon. The click wheel is great and handy to use when you want to listen to a specific song. The battery dies kind of quickly when you play games, even with the backlight off. The backlight also runs the battery down quite quickly, but if you don't have the backlight on very often, the battery lasts for a while. iTunes is pretty simple to use, but I haven't gotten the chance to download online yet. The screen is very beautiful in color. If you are a cautious, responsible person then this is the right mp3 player for you. But if you aren't a very careful person, I would recommend you get the iPod mini if you can still find one. Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I hope this helps customize your overall decision on which iPod to get.

<Content>With the current state of low-cost electronic technology, the prices for these things is a rip-off.  Also Amazon's inability to deliver them until the middle of January (order placed Dec. 6)makes one wonder if Amazon is looking out for their customers.

<Title>Problems? Whatever!
<Date>Sun Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It's funny sometimes, how when people review products here, they seem to nitpick. But anways...  I got a Nano for Christmas, and have been not only pleased, but was extremely excited. Who doesn't want a sleek liitle black piece of joy that knows all their favourite songs and even has pictures of they're friends to boot!? I honestly, never had much of want for one, but as soon as I heard I was getting one, it all changed.   For some, having all your music in your coat pocket, may not sound appealing. But, as an eplieptic, I've never had a drivers liscense. So with that said, it's such a relief now, to know that I dont have to carry around all those cd cases and that walkman. Having an Ipod frees you to relax and enjoy the journey, and not have to lug around "luggage", just so you can have something to listen to on your way home. And btw, 2 Gigs isn't really that bad. I only have a 2G, and it suits my music library fine. Yeah, if I had the choice I would take the 4G, but don't worry if you only got the 2, as it's more than you think it is. I guess if you have an extensive library (thousands of songs, that you listen to on a regular basis), then you're gonna want a regular sized iPod anyways.  So, enough with the novel... Is the iPod Nano worth buying? Yeah! You bet it is! And if you are already using iTunes on your Pc or Mac, then you'll be all the more prepared for the whole process. Loading songs into the iPod is extremely easy, just select and drag. And don't listen to all the hoopla about all the Adobe software you need to put your pictures on your iPod. It's simply a case of creating a folder on your computer that keeps those pictures, then selecting that folder in iTunes.   As I said, it's an EXTREMELY easy system to work with. The click wheel may take a a few minutes to get the hang of, but it really is not a problem either. And don't let all the reviewers put you off with all the talk about how bad the earphones are. They sound nice and clear! Unfortunately they aren't COMPLETELY comfortable. once again, COMPLETELY... as in, they aren't bad, just a slight annoyance. You do get two sets of foam earbuds to fix that, and I am still experimenting with those, so I don't really have a full opinion on that.  Also i'm hearing alot about the problems with the screen, case and click wheel scratching. Sure, if you keep it out of a case for too long, it's exposed and it's gonna get scratched. Sure! That's common sense! One of the things some people seem to oddly forget is how Apple packs the Nano with a clear plastic cover when it's shipped. So, no real need, unless it gets torn or dirty (etc.), to have to go out and buy screen covers. I have also bought a silicone case for it as well (the DLO Jam Jacket works well... just make sure not to bend the plastic screen cover). It gives you access to all your connections (USB and earphones), and your Hold button. And it keeps the case nice and protected from regular wear and tear.  I also bought what Apple calls "iPod Socks". I only found one set in the three or four stores where I went to to buy my iPod stuff.. but they are nice to have (Amazon sells them also). In one pack you'll get six socks and they're all in different colors. I do recommend those! They're great! But, on the other hand, Apple's "Nano Tubes" have been getting alot of slack for supposedly scratching the case's surface. I had bought a set (of 5, in different colors), but have left them in the package, and am contemplating returning them, as to keep my precious Nano out of harms way.  So, once again, is it worth it? You bet!

<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i never actually purchased this product but i have numerous friends who have. yes it is thinner than a pencil and i can see the highlights of something being thin however ipod nano goes too far. all of my friends that have put other types of ipods have been able to put them in their pockets without problems but my friends who have got ipod nanos have put them in their pockets and after a couple of times doing so it was so thin that they snapped in their pockets (apple couldn't give them refunds). i suggest the ipod mini because it is virtually the same size but thicker so they wont snap.

<Title>Truly Awesome !!!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The 2GB iPod Nano is a truly awesome music media device, it has a very cool and trend setting design, has a color backlit LCD display, plays a variety of digital compressed music file formats including MP3, and can be used to store and view PC files such image files. The circular touch controls and LCD display are intuitive and easy to use. It is fully PC or Mac compatible but not both at the same time since you must format the Nano's flash drive file system to use either PC or Mac. Along with the main device the package includes the very impressive iTunes and Quicktime media software on CD, a set of earbud headphones, a thin fabric based carrying pouch, and a combination USB data and power chord. The internal battery provides up to fourteen hours of music listening.  I recently got one of these 2GB black iPod Nano players as a Christmas gift. If you are new to these devices or unfamiliar with the latest iPod or new MP3 players on the market it is ok because I haven't owned a portable music storage device since having a small Sony Walkman cassette player very many years ago. The advances in micro computer technology over the past decade have introduced a new breed of amazing portable audio/video/storage devices. The latest of these is the flash memory based iPod Nano portable music and photo device. Improvements in flash memory technology have allowed Apple to develop a super small version of their popular iPod brand with no micro hard drive which means no moving parts to break, skip free listening, and extended battery life in an insanely small package. The first question that you might be curious to know is "How good is the sound ?". If you are an audiophile like me I am difficult to please with anything but the best quality but surprisingly this iPod Nano device did not disappoint me.  I understand that like most MP3 digital music players the iPod Nano uses a compressed digital source to create its audio signal. You can only expect "near CD quality" from any of these devices and with that in mind don't plan on hearing audiophile sounds coming from these. However, for a tiny portable device you can expect very good sound quality similar to a good computer based sound system.  The included earbud headphones are one of the weakest components in the included iPod Nano package bundle while the iTunes software really surprised me.  The problem with the supplied earbud headphones was that after a few minutes of sitting inside my ears they began to physically irritate and hurt my ears. Their sound quality was ok but overall they left much to be desired. Instead of using the earbuds I ended up using a small pair of the old style, over the head and over the ears headphones that came with an inexpensive ($29) portable Sony AM/FM/TV band audio Walkman that I had recently purchased for using at football games.  This is only a temporary solution and I will be looking to purchase a high sound quality brand of mini headphones with a similar design as my Sony brand. If the supplied iPod earbuds don't work for you then expect to spend from fifteen to one hundred dollars for a better set of low power compliant replacement headphones that use the mini-stereo jack.   The biggest surprise in the iPod Nano package was the quality of and ease of use of the iTunes software.  The iTunes music player along with Quicktime video player is basically Apple's answer to the Microsoft Media Player.  If you already own a newer Mac computer running a 10.x OS then you are already familiar with Apple's intuitive design, ease of use, and built in iPod integration.  For Windows XP users like me you will be in for a treat. After giving up on playing MP3 and other media formats on my PC I have started listening to MP3 music again. Apple has thought through almost every aspect of their media software and have created one of most impressive programs for the PC that I have used. The iTunes program also nicely integrates with the Apple iTunes website where you may purchase and download thousands of songs for your listening pleasure. Connecting your iPod to its supplied USB connection chord automatically launches the previously installed iTunes software and automatically syncs and transfers your iTunes file and song play list to the iPod device's file and song play list. The Nano's USB chord is the only method used to supply power to recharge the Nano's internal battery. You must purchase a separate USB power adapter ($29) if you want to recharge the iPod without using a computer with a USB port.  One of the biggest gripes about the Nano is how easily its shiny finish and display window scratches and this has actually generated a class action lawsuit against Apple claiming it to be a major design flaw. Apple claims that the scratch problem only effects a small percentage of Nano devices and that the problem is no worse than with previous versions of iPod devices. My suggestion is that you immediately purchase a protective cover or case along with your Nano so that you can protect it from this problem. Purchase a very high quality cover for the Nano such as a protective leather case from Pacific Design ($34.99) or a fully water proof, dirt proof, shock and drop proof enclosure from OtterBox ($39.95). Also, I do not recommend putting the iPod Nano in your pants pocket or along with keys or other gadgets since the color LCD display has been reported by some owners to crack or break under moderate force.    PROS: It is a compact, state of the art, digital media storage, image viewer and music playback device in an unbelievably tiny package It has a trend setting design, great sound quality, no moving parts, sharp and clear LCD color display, decent battery life, and includes the excellent iTunes and Quicktime software for integrating with your PC or Mac. It stores up to 500 songs for 2GB model and up to 1000 songs for the 4GB model.  CONS: It is fragile and scratch prone compared to previous iPods or other MP3 players. Many expensive accessories must be purchased to protect and fully utilize the Nano media device including a high quality protective case, better headphones, and an external power charger. The storage capacity may be limiting for some people. Although it can display images it does not play video media.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Expect to spend at least $100 or more for your extra accessories in addition to the original cost of Apple's iPod Nano package. If you are a previous iPod or MP3 music device owner you may want to consider the 4GB iPod Nano instead. After you invest more money for the essential Nano accessories that extra $50 for the 4GB Nano model to double the storage capacity is going to seem like a bargain. Because of the fragility of this device I would not recommend it for younger children and instead go with a less expensive iPod Shuffle and also take note of my volume level advice. As with any MP3 player users should keep the volume at medium or low settings and try not to use it for much longer than one hour (up to two hours maximum) per day since using music devices such as these with the in ear style headphones for long periods of time at higher volume levels can cause permanent hearing loss (this is especially a problem when using the earbud style of headphones). If you want to use your iPod in loud environments such as when traveling on a train or bus consider purchasing a set of compact noise cancelling headphones. There are also serious safety risks associated with using any music device such as an iPod with headphones while running, biking, or driving a motor vehicle on a public roadway.   THE BOTTOM LINE:  Apple's current version of the iPod Nano is one of the most truly awesome music and media players available and its sound quality, design, and software are state of the art but when adding in the extra cost of essential accessories and the device's questionable durability I am only able to give it a value rating of FOUR out of FIVE STARS.

<Title>I love my 2GB White iPod Nano!!!!!!!
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the review I have been LONGING to make- one for a gorgous, beautiful white iPod nano! I got it for Christmas from my parents. I love my nano, I call it my ba"nana". (Nano, Nana) Its sitting next to me right now... I love it.   Unlike the iPod mini that my cousin got for Christmas, my iPod nano came charged and ready for action! When I opened the package, I took out my nano and quickly figured out how to turn it on and off! (But, playing with friends assortment of ipods, minis, nanos, videos, photos, and normal, didn't hurt a bit) This iPod is easy to learn how to use- EVEN IF you don't have prior experience!  My Computer if so old so I can't download songs from it. My mom is bringing her laptop home so I can download all my songs!So, all yesterdy, I played games on my iPod nano.  If you are thinking of getting a nano, GET ONE! but, get a 2GB White iPod Nano!   iPod addict, M@NDY

I love it so much that I might even want to get the i pod mini later. If you have never had an ipod before, you should get the 2 gb nano, and then later get the mini, 4gb nano, shuffle, etc. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR TEENS AND ADULTS!  500 is more than you think, I got all of my favorite songs and I still have about 320 songs left!

Peoples' biggest complaint seems to be the scratches, but imo, it's not a huge deal, just get a case. You should ALWAYS have a case for your mp3 player regardless of what kind it is. Anyway, I am a very happy customer.

<Content>I ordered my "In Stock" Nano 2gb before Christmas, and paid $15 extra for next day delivery (to make sure it would arrive by my daughter's birthday on the 27th).  As of Dec 26th the delivery date's been updated to December 30th.  Classic deceptive marketing. The local retailer down the street now has a slew of them in-stock, so I'll buy mine there, and return Amazon's when it finally arrives. So much for quality of service.

<Title>Give Honor To Whom Honor Is Due
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I seldomly if ever give any reviews a five star rating. But I have to give honor where honor is due. Considering the fact that all of the the BEST BUYS  CIRCUIT CITY's and Comp USA in my area have sold out of all of their Ipods, shuffle, nano, etc. Apple must be doing something right. I must admit though I can appreciate a good gadget I have not been lusting over the ipod nano, I just recently decided to get it. I do admire the size of the nano but I also like the size of the shuffle. It was the color display that sold me. I can just see myself now surfing through the ipod shuffle frantically unable to find the song that I had in mind to listen to (not a good thing), so I decided to go with the nano. The ability to import 500 songs is also a plus although it will probably take years before I reach that capacity. I also like the thought of putting pictures on my nano. I have seven very adorable nieces. The headphones in my opinion are pretty comfortable and attractive (I'm from the old school when head-phones use to look like ear-muffs).  I don't have any prior experiece with ipods so I didn't quite know how to import my music right off the bat but I'm a swift sister and a smart cookie so I grasped it pretty quickly.

<Title>LOVIN IT!
<Date>Wed Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received this as a present for christmas. I had read and heard about it, but it's so true...you really dont believe how small it is til you actually hold it in your hand. Then you say to yourself..."is this possible?" Well it is, and it's quite the little gadget. Let me first say that (obviously) it is very compact and easy to slide into your pocket to carry around, which is nice for life on the move. Secondly, it is SOOO easy to transfer songs onto your ipod. If you don't already have a library on iTunes, the software is all included. Once you have all your songs on a playlist, it automatically transfers them for you, its great.  The only tiny downsides to the 2GB are that it only holds around the area of 500 songs, for some this may be perfect, but if you have a larger archive (like myself) the 4GB is definately for you.  oh and also the Black does tend to show scratches easily..but no need for me to get too critical...  This is an amazing device and trust me, you wont be disappointed!

<Title>Very Useful, but a Bit Pricey...
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod is a well-designed compressed music file player with easy-to-use resident software. Forget about the photo angle - the images are just too small to be useful. The iPod nano is all about music.  It's hard to get away from the fact that it's expensive for what it is and you're chained to Apple's software (iTunes) to get the job done. But it does that job very well indeed. Legal internet intrusion, obvious and not so obvious, is way out of hand these days so I'm glad I've iTunes set up on a computer that is never online. (I buy CDs and copy directly to the hard drive using preferred software.)  ITunes is now only available as a 36MBish download, so too bad if you don't connect or don't have broadband. Doubtless Apple wants us all to visit its site on a regular basis and be uniquely identified and enticed to buy. Arguably, copying entire CDs or just our favourite tracks is the best approach for those who are definitely serious about their music rather than those who collect a mass of Chart songs and listen to them as if the whole process is some kind of fashion statement. Arguably!  Music on the move doesn't appeal to a lot of people. The headphones aren't great, background sound can be a nuisance, and there are health concerns over sound levels. Thankfully the iPod gives us the option to dock it with something substantial like Monitor Audio's excellent I-deck or smaller portable players such as Koda's Imoves. Or you can simply connect your player to your hi-fi with the appropriate lead.  I originally bought a 2GB iPod and quickly filled it. I have quite a collection of homemade compilation CDs that hold all my favourite tracks from the last 35 years and along with a few special complete albums they very neatly filled the 1.8GB capacity with 404 songs (the Yes album "Relayer" included). So I bought a 4GB iPod to take me much further with new rock releases and classical and Irish music too, and I much prefer the choice of 2 iPods.  To have all your favourite music residing in a couple of tiny players is a real boon. It's the most efficient way of managing and listening to music. Put them in Exspect EX410 cases - very well made.

<Title>Great player....but a little pricey
<Date>Sat Oct 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to upgrade from a 64MB player, so this was a BIG change.  It is definitely a good buy, but I believe Apple could come down on the price a bit. It is very easy to use, but if you're not used to iPods, the click wheel can be a little tricky at first. It doesn't come with a charger so the only way to charge it is to plug it in to a computer; you can, however, purchase one.  Overall, this is a good player, but if you're looking for a bargain-look elsewhere.   Also, all you who are complaining about not being able to fit enough music on you 2GB iPod...it's a 2GB iPod- you knew what you were buying!

I have an audio port in my car stereo so it works out great. I don't even carry CDs around anymore. It's easy to use, very small and looks pretty cool too.  My only complaint would be that you are expected to use iTunes with it. There are hacks that you can find on the net that allow you to play MP3s without having them converted to the proprietary format. I got used to iTunes... it's not so bad. I've since made it my default MP3 player and have actually grown fond of it.  **shrugs** Just my .02 worth.
