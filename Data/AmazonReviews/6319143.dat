<Content>so when i bough this ipod nano. i called in to mack sure it is what im getting like there was a case pichtured in it and im like wow this is a great deal for the price the rep said that it would be coming with a case so i bought it and when it came i opened it and it had marks on the sceen and everything. it did not come with the case that was saposed to come with it i call them and i said whats the deal with the case and they were like it does not come with the case and i said why is it pichtured then there like to sell more so im like so ur cheating people to buy it thinkgin its going to come with a case. so i told them i want a case since it was in the photos. so they eneded up sending me a i pod case that doesnot even fit my ipod nano. they said they had shiped it and when i got it it was shiped a week later so they are just scammers trying to get your money so make sure you call them and make sure everything pichtured comes with it!

<Title>iPod Nano, first generation
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a shuffle and got an Nano for my children.  This product was refurbished and an older generation but this is what I wanted as my children are younger.  I didn't want to spend too much money on something that would likely be dropped dozens of times or even lost.  Love the iPod, easy to use, easy to sync.  Wish I had gotten one capable of playing videos but won't send it back because of that.  Product was shipped on time and arrived in stated condition.  No complaints.

<Title>I-pod is good
<Date>Sat Mar 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Whats good about the I-pod nano is that its so small. You can fit it in your pocket with a slide. (unlike the big one witch you need a case for) I have been doing some research and i have found the i-pod nano is the best 1gb (2gb or 4gb) mp3 player. The mini has no color,the others are very expensive and arn't that portable as the nano. This is a great MP3 player to carry around. I recomend you buy it.

<Title>I love my nano!!!!!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Got this for a birthday gift and it may be the best gift that I have even received.  It is incredibly easy to use and the sound is AMAZING!!! iTunes has been pretty simple to set up and purchasing songs is a little too easy...its hard to not get too carried away.  I am so excited that I found singles that I couldn't find on Napster.  The only sad thing is that I have a lot of purchased Napster tracks that I couldn't automatically transfer into iTunes.  I will try to burn them onto CDs and then import them into iTunes.  I definitely recommend the Nano for any music lover.

<Content>Just got my mine in the mail from Amazon.com, plugged it in for a battery charge, loaded all of my favorite songs at the same time. And now, I am listening to each one of them. The quality of the sound is very clear and loud if you wish it that way. It's got a shuffle functionality which works perfectly if you go to the gym and don't want to listen to only one album. The little device is so light too. I mean. 5 stars is well deserved for it. Lastly, the 14 hours of battery is true. :) Enjoy!

<Title>good mp3 player
<Date>Sun Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>overall i found the 1gb ipod nano pretty good for everyday use. i can plug it into the car, or listen to it while at the gym. sound quality is above average. it has some simple games included too. since the i pods are popular by far, theres so many accesories available and to choose from. the downside is that the nano scratches so easily, so i had to cover it with a film and rubber casing. playing the games likes to drain the batteries because of the constantly lit screen. the other thing down the road is wondering how long the internal battery will last. i've heard apple customer service is very good from friends, so that's a plus. when i compared it to other players of this memory capacity and features, i found that the nano overall dominates, other than its nonreplaceable battery.

<Title>good and bad
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(to save some time read this) Pros - small, portable. - clear screen. - stylish. - automatic sync. using Itune. - include other programs(games,photo/slideshow,notepad.etc) - lock  Cons - deliget - too expensive( so as other accessories). - only Itune compatible. - only 1 GB ( comparing to 2,4,30,& 60 GB) - fingerprints are visible after using it. - unable to delete music from nano whitout using a computer. - a few bugs need to be fixed (the screen gets stuck sometimes).  (to get more info read this) i like ipod nanos, its easy 2 use, it looks cool, just like a mini version of a pocket pc.but the bad thing about it, is that it cost wayyy to much comparing to other mp3 makers. the only way to copy music to nano is using itune( and a couple of other 3rd party programs). itune rename the file name to 4 letter which makes everything more comfusing.i recommend getting a 2 or 4 GB nano because 1 GB is not big enough(around 240 songs).i also recommend getting something that protects the nano, fingerprints get on very easly. overall, i  think this is a good product.

<Title>Wading through the hype
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Nano is a good product, and a good value depending on what you're looking for in a music player.   First, the bad. Yes, it scratches and smudges easily. Even moderate handling is likely to leave your beautiful gadget hopelessly marred. That's a fact. I bought a case right away and still have some minor scratches on the surface. If you buy a Nano, buy a case (gel or otherwise) on the same trip--it will save you some trouble down the road. Second, the software needs a little tweaking. While most of the time, it works fine, I did experience a glitch here and there that mysteriously returns me to the main menu. It's not damning, but it can be annoying. Hopefully, Apple will fix this soon. Third, if you're dikkering, as I was between a Shuffle and a Nano, know that the Nano is a bit more delicate. I bought this for working out, and I do worry that I'll have to cash in my Applecare warranty more with this than I ever did with my shuffle. It has a screen, it's smaller, and it's more delicate.  Now, the good. First, it's gorgeous--flat out, a beautiful design. You will marvel at the screen and the impossible thinness. I also own a mini, and as lovely as that is, this is even prettier. Second, again, if you're dikkering between a Shuffle and a Nano, the battery life is quite good. I got about 11 hours on a single charge, and considering the bright color screen, this is great. Additionally, it holds a charge well between uses. Very little power seems to eke out. Third, you can use playlists. If you're like me, and have different playlists for different moods, the Nano is superior to the Shuffle in this respect. Finally, the screen. It's quite nice. I expected to not use it much, but find myself glancing at it constantly for the time of day and song titles (album art is a bonus).   So here's my recommendation: if you don't need your whole collection with you or are considering a shuffle, the Nano is also a great choice. Yes, the screen and front can get marred, but if you invest in a case, you'll be fine. The sound quality is great (better than my Mini) and the form factor is good for workouts or car trips. You really can't go wrong unless you need a higher-capacity player. Great product, overall.

<Title>The actual thing is great
<Date>Sun Apr 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The new iPod is, without a doubt, a perfect Mp3 Player; especially the feature of scrolling the lists up and down with simply moving the tip of your finger around the wheel. But there is one thing, not about this actual iPod, but about the reviews that Amazon and other sources give to such things. It's when they say, like, "Memory holds UP TO (example) 240 SONGS". IS "SONG" A NEW UNIT OF MEASURING THE SPACE? I'm used to using bytes, kilobytes, etc. It is not only technically incorrect to estimate the number of songs that the memory can hold (a single song can be 2, 4, 7, 10, (...) megabytes big, depending on its length and format), but it also pisses me off whenever I hear or read something like that.

<Title>Just plain awesome
<Date>Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After avoiding purchasing an MP3 player for some time now, I finally gave in and settled for an iPod.  The Apple 1 GB iPod Nano is the very first Apple product I have ever bought and put to use, and I have been more than satisfied with it since I got it.  The sleek design of the Nano sealed the deal for me; with an incredibly thin body and frame that slides right into your pocket.  I was initially fearful of it's fragility, but after everything I've put my Nano through, I must say that it is quite durable.  The 1 GB can hold up to 240 songs, which is more than enough for me personally, and isn't a bad deal at all for Apple's asking price.  If there's any shortcomings, it's that the selection dial can be too touch sensitive, and that it would be nice if the battery life were longer than the 12-14 hours of life, but those are only minor gripes at best for what you get here.  All in all, if you are looking to get your first iPod, the 1GB Nano is a perfect place to start.

<Content>My Apple iPod came in what appeared to be it's original box, witht the headphones, usb cable, booklet and software all wrapped up and sealed. The only gripe I have about this purchase is that there is a small scratch on the screen, so when I'm scrolling or playing games or viewing photos on the iPod, it is a little annoying. The product itself works great, the battery is very long-lasting, and the sound for the headphones is very nice. I just wish I knew about the scratch before I purchased it.

<Title>Just Buy It- It's worth it
<Date>Tue Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Considering the price, I was hesitant about buying th Nano. But Now that I have the ipod nano, its worth it.   Don't believe the lies that ipod nanos scratch easily and is not durable. Only morons scratch their ipods. It's been 3 months and I have not scratched my nano. I have dropped it several times and I have lied on it while I was sleeping (thousands of times). Buy a nice silicon, aluminum, or leather case and you're be fine. A good case will absorb the shock of dropping. Leave the plastic sticker on and your screen will be protected from scratches and other things.   When you first take the ipod out of the box, be careful. First and foremost, get a case and everything will be swell.   Ipod provide spectacular sounds and multiple useful features (games, calendar, stop watch, contacts, notes, clock: worldwide, shuffle, photos, and etc.). I really enjoy the "on-the-go" playlist option. The "on-the go" playlist allows you to make a playlist on the ipod.   The things I hate about the ipod are the short battery life and the headphones. The good thing is that these things can be easily fixed. Buy a car charger and home charger on ebay and a cheap high performing sony headphones at walmart and everything is good.   The ipod is enjoyable and itunes is really user-friendly.

<Content>I was hesitant about the nano after a VERY bad experience with the shuffle. I have had it now for about a month, and I dont see how I lived without it. It's size is amazing! It can fit in my pocket comfortably. The display is amazing it shows the albulm cover and you can also shuffle songs on the ipod nano. Uploading photos to the already user friendly iTunes, is a snap. If you have outlook express you can also upload your calendar to your ipod. With other features like games,  and a clock (just to name a few). The nano gives off great sound. The photo's look great on the ipod, I didnt expect such great quality. If you order from apple.com you can get a message engraved free, thats the only thing I wish amazon would offer. Anyways, GREAT BUY!

<Date>Thu Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received my Nano as an anniversary gift from my husband. He had it delivered to me at work. I usually leave the electronic stuff for him to figure out but this time I was too anxious to get it working. So I read the simple instructions, installed the software, plugged it into my computer and it was good to go!  I had seen it online before and I knew that it was going to be small, but I couldn't believe how tiny and cute that it was and the engraving on the back was such a nice touch.  I also love the photo album feature, its great to be able to show off all those personal pictures that don't usually make it off your digital camera.  One suggestion is to go out and buy a cover for it immediately and keep the plastic film that it came with on it until you do because the back does scratch really easily.

<Content>I bought the 1 GB version for my car.   I have the old Ipod 20 GB, but when my car drives through a rough pavement, the tracks keep skipping.  So I decided to try the most affordable Nano... (paid about $140 at an Apple Reseller). No suprise, it does the job.   Even on rough bumps, the tracks keep playing smoothly.  The earphones sound excellent too.   Thanks to Apple for making this excellent gadget.

<Date>Tue Apr 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been wanting an MP3 player since they came on the market.  I wanted to wait a while to see if they would come down in price.  Finally, last month I got an email ad about the ipod nano.  I was very pleased with the price, so I bought one. "Wow," I have been blown away. I did not know how wonderful it could be having one.  I walk for exercise, and using a CD player was no fun at all, with all the skipping, you know what I mean. I am so impressed with the ipod Nano. The sound clarity is unbelievable.  I wasn't sure the sound quality would be there,  but it is way better than any CD player I have used. I can't compare it with any other MP3 since it is my first,  however I love it so much,  I plan on getting one for my son.  Best investment I've made all year. Folks you will not be disappointed. How can so much power be inside such a little device? I love it.

I enjoy that fact that is is so thin and little I can slip in my back pocket and not even know it is there!  Excellent buy!

<Content>This is a GREAT iPod. A lot of people say that the black iPod scratches up, but if you take care of it and keep it in a case it's all good. Why wouldn't you keep it in a case, there's so many different designs and colors out there. It's hard to resist buying a cover or case. The music quality is AWESOME. It holds 240 songs and can hold photos, too. I'm seriously thinking about updating to a Video iPod, because you get more out of it. This one is just music, excite your life with video too. If you're not a video person though this iPod is perfect for you. GO APPLE!!!

<Content>I gave this iPod only 1 star because besides the fact they are built nicely and that they are "classy and popular", they are misleading. Don't get your hopes up if you have many songs you plan on loading onto it. I cannot even get half the number of songs it advertises for (240) on mine. I do not recommend it if you plan on loading more than sixty songs onto your iPod, which most people do. Avoid the 1 GB iPod Nano and avoid hours of frustration if this applies to you.
