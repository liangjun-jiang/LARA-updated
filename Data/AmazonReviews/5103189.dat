<Title>Perfect for a First Time MP3 Purchaser
<Date>Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As the mother of two teenage daughters I have been on the purchasing end of MP3 players.  After observing their enjoyment I decided that I too needed one.  The price is great and this player is really easy to operate (even for a forty-something year old mom!).

<Title>Good Value MP3 Player
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I didn't have very high expectations since this MP3 player was under $30, however it has been very reliable and easy to use. A great starter MP3 player for a teenager or someone nearly 40 like me who is finally buying one.

<Title>I'm Very Pleased
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I Brought this for my nephew, and i'm glad to report there are no problems with this player. When i first got it i was testing it out at work, where i'm located in the basement of the building, i don't even get cell phone reception down here, but i was able to pick up radio stations with little static. I also love the lcd diplay, this was i good buy.  The only thing is that it's sort of difficult to get back to the main menu when you are in fm mode.

<Content>I've had this a week and love it. It was a little hard to copy songs to it at first but once I figured it out it was very simple. I have used it for 16 hours on one battery without any problems.

<Title>A surprisingly sound little investment
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my first MP3 player, and I've had my COBY MPC855 for about 2 yrs. The first thing I was surprised was that the sound quality was so good. Amazing for a small device. And the supplied earbuds are not only comfortable, they provide impressively good fidelity. So good for music and digital FM is handy, too, works fine as do the presets and equalizer functions. I'm a reporter, and was surprised to find that the voice recorder's quality was not only good enough to record an interview simply by placing it on the table in front of the interviewees, it was also good enough to use for a Podcast. Impressive! Takes a little getting used to moving through the files, but after a little practice, becomes second nature. PROS: Nice sound, with several equalizer settings. Great voice recording! Does well with AAA battery. Direct USB is very handy versus using a cable, and option to use as "jump drive" is neat. CONS: I've had trouble with downloaded purchased protected Windows Media tracks, can't get them to play. Otherwise I'd give this 5 stars. Ripped tracks drag-and-drop seamlessly using Sync in Windows Media Player, couldn't be easier. Flimsy buttons?  The back button on mine has become stuck, maybe it was my fault when I used it in rapid succession and held it down too hard. My buttons are white and stick up from the top, doesn't look like the image on this page,so maybe it's a previous gen model? And maybe the sound level doesn't go high enough? But plenty for my 50-yr old ears. Other than that, no complaints, and has provided 2 yrs of great performance. For around $25, a solid starter, gift, or second MP3.
