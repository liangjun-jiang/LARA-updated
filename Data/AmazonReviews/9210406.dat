<Title>Pretty Cheap

<Content>Earphones fall apart in about 4 weeks, wire length for earphones is way too short to even place in a pocket, easily gets scratched, easily gets dented, hard to navigate, cheap menues, dont buy it or else youll regret it.

<Title>Not a dependable unit
<Date>Thu Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Upon receiving the MP3 player everything worked as expected. However, the unit kept indicating that the battery was not fully charged, even though it was charged overnight. Now it's come to the point where it won't hold a charge and the unit is therefore completely useless. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this MP3 player: it lacks dependability. It only uses USB 1.0 (slower) to load music and photos ... not the faster USB 2.0 I'm sending it back.

<Title>Decent Player
<Date>Fri Mar 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I use the Pic N Roll every day at work to play music continually throughout the day, and I have to say it works pretty well.  My only concern is there is no "screensaver" function so the LCD is continually lit.  You could probably get more battery life if it had that option, but again it's a minor complaint.    I will admit the headphones aren't the best but hey they're free.  I bought this for the player, not the headphones.

<Title>Truly Amazing For The Asking Price
<Date>Mon Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This item is a must have, what a great alternative to the cost of the PoD.   The MP310 Truly Digital Player Pic' n Roll! is more than just an MP3 player! It not only plays your music, and you can pick from several equalizer settings for your listening pleasure, it has its own built-in FM radio, with really good reception. It also has an open voice, line-in, or directly from FM radio recording system and you can do all this while you listen. Truly includes a couple of games, you can add your favorite eBooks, and you can even add photos to view on the Truly Color Screen. Set the screen to go dark after your personal selected time and add your favorite photo for the wallpaper as a personal touch.  Surprisingly the menus are easy to navigate, for an item like this. Expect to refer to the manual, till you get everything you want out of the Truly system.   This item comes with very well built accessories; like the earbud headphones they are comfortable and even have there own volume control and are almost long enough to comfortably wear while The MP310 Truly Digital Player Pic' n Roll is in my pants pocket (well I can wear the right earbud no problem while the player is in my pocket but I am over six foot tall). The charger is top of the line and it has a built in led. You even get a short patch cord 1/8" ends that can be used as a hard line-in for recording from your CD player or Hi-Fi, you may want to get a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter to directly plug into a standard headphone or microphone jack.  Inclosing this is not just an MP3 player, It Is A Personal Digital Media Device.
