<Title>a monster drive, with some minor drawbacks
<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is my very first MP3 player. Overall it is a fantastic product. I would instist that the first thing you do is download and install the latest updates from the RCA website. They fix most of the little complaints that people have said about it elsewhere.<p>Why I bought it. I was looking for a product that was affordable and I could take anywhere. I'm a pastor, so I can take the thing from my house, to my car and then plug it directly into my sound board for ministry stuff. Very cool. Here was my just1. size of storage. 40 gb is a monster amount of storage. 2. Accesories. This thing came loaded with everything from good software to a car kit to a rechargeable battery. 3. Ease of use. Love the fact that on USB 2.0 I can get a charge and download with one cord... awesome. 4. Price. So much cheaper than the other 40 gb MP3 players... and with more freebies. 5. Packaging. It was in a very nice package... rarely think about that but it was a nice touch.<p>Critiques - 1. hate the headphones that came with it. 2. I wish that I could add more categories easier... such as Christmas music or whatever, I'd like to be able to do that easier. 3. Would like to be able to create playlists without using my PC. <p>On a huge plus side... RCA seems to be listening to criticism of its products and make changes that can be updated via their website. <p>Overall, a great product and worth my $$$.

<Title>Great Buy - Still a bit dim-witted though.
<Date>Thu Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>It's hard to go wrong with these capabilities at this price, and it is a good sign that a recent firmware upgrade fixes the Lyra's dumbest oversight (not remembering what song was being played before the unit was shut off).     Now it is time for RCA to deal with the second big issue. You should be able to (but cannot) create playlists on the fly - in other words you should be able to cue the next song or songs as you go. As the Lyra currently functions, you cannot select your next song without terminating the song you are playing. If you want to create a playlist, you need to stop playback and select all of the songs you want to play before starting. Then *WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA???* it will play them in alphabetical order rather than the order you selected them in.     I can only imagine that fixing these deficiencies will not be difficult for RCA, and that they will do so in the next firmware upgrade! (HINT! HINT!)     When this is done I will gladly lift my rating to 5-stars. If nothing else - this thing is a great portable back up device for any and all files you need to store (plug-n-play, drag-n-drop bliss).

<Title>Recommended, nice alternative to ipod
<Date>Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Simple, easy to use, and a good alternative to the i-pod.<p>This was my 3rd mp3 player I've purchased, and probably the last one I will purchase for some time. No significant problems. Easy to start-up and download songs. Great (40 gb) memory, at an affordable price. I had a chance to compare it to my brother-in-laws i-pod, and the RCA held its own. The only real differnce is the i-pod is smaller, and quite a bit lighter. Fair enough, but that doesn't warrant the price differential. The Lyra is not unduly bulky, although it is somewhat heavy. Nonetheless, I have taken it on long plane rides and have had no problems.<p>Sound quality is comparable to the i-pod (I'm starting to believe the i-pod is the standard for mp3 players). Downloading is easy. My only real complaint is the confusing &quot;playlist&quot; feature. I still don't know exactly how to create a playlist, although to be fair, I haven't had the time to figure it out. Finally, you cannot erase a song from the player itself ; this is problematic because I have one song that always crashes the player.<p>Don't let this dissuade you, however. My complaints are minimal. And having compared it directly to the i-pod, I can tell you (unless price means nothing to you) that dollar for dollar, this beats the i-pod. And that says a lot.

<Content>If I could give it a zero I would. I got it for Christmas and tried to charge it, after 5 minutes of charging it said &quot;Battery Full&quot;. So, I unplug it and try to turn it on and nothing happens. I repeat this process for hours. Finally it works and I unplug it and turn it on, and it bursts open the case just comes off. I am now trying to fix the situation. What I am trying to say is buyer beware.<p>                             Frustrated Consumer

<Title>Amazing value, more than adequate functionality
<Date>Sat Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was hestitant to delve into the world of MP3 jukeboxes, as the technology is relatively new. However, I am a music fanatic and cannot live without it. I'm listening to it 24/7, in my car, at the gym, at work, etc. You can appreciate my frustration then when it comes to swapping CDs at the gym or in my car. Enter the RCA lyra.<p>I have over 300 CDs and 6,500 songs on my harddrive. Moving them over was as quick and as easy as drag-and-drop from windows explorer. I personally hate Musicmatch Jukebox software and didn't even bother to install it. It's really unecessary in my eyes. Most other jukeboxes require special software to get you going, and to get a windows explorer interface for the Creative Nomad Zen you have to shell out 25 bucks for third-party software.<p>Pros: Huge storage capacity, wicked 5-band graphic equalizer, line-out jack (most jukeboxes lack this!), large, bright display, comes with a plethora of accessories, top-notch volume level and sound quality, cool-ass case!<p>Cons: Buttons can be a bit small and hard to find without looking, much bigger and bulkier than the Apple Ipod, internal battery only (crappy!)<p>To be honest, I don't have enough good to say about this player. Taking your music with you is as easy as selecting the proper audio device - for portable use a set of good headphones is all you need (those RCA clip-on headphones are retarded - get a set of sony streetstyles: cheap, comfy and sound great!) For PC use, all you need is a USB cable - just connect and play your music through Winamp or another mp3 software device. The best part?<p>I own a JVC MP3 car CD player with a stereo minijack input on the front of it. All you have to do is connect the Lyra to that jack with a line-out cable (not supplied, but easy to find) and you have all your music at the touch of a button! No more toting around bulky, expensive CDs! <p>Size is the only advantage Ipod has over this thing. Sure, the Ipod's smaller, but the lyra has better sound, a better interface, more connectivity options, more accessories, 10gb more of storage capacity, more more more. I bought my Lyra brand new on Ebay for 200 bucks - that's almost 300 less than an Ipod. Give me one reason why I should've shelled out that much more for an arguably inferior product.<p>Word of advice: Your Lyra will function much better and faster if you organize the HD with as many folders and subfolders as possible. The first time I fired it up I had all 6,000 songs in one folder and it took almost a minute to switch from song to song. Then I made 24 subfolders, one for each letter of the alphabet, and switch time was almost instantaneous. You don't have to worry about navigating through those folders on the lyra interface - regardless of the organization of the files, it still groups them by artist, genre, etc.<p>In short, this is easily the best jukebox on the market for the money. Ipod doesn't even come close. As if all this wasn't enough, it functions as a removeable 40gb harddrive.... You can move anything with it, not just music.<p>HIGHLY recommended.

<Title>an excellent jukebox
<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Originally I was looking for an Ipod, but since people were going nuts for them and paying outrageous prices (I saw 5 Gb Ipods going for $200) I decided I should find a cheap alternative.  I found the 40 Gb Lyra for $200 and decided to go for it.  I've had it for two weeks now and I'm quite impressed.  First of all, 40 Gb for $200 is an unbeatable price.  Aesthetically, the player is nice.  There is very little mirrored chrome (a little on the border) to be scratched, most of it has a nice matte or frost finish.  It is the largest of the harddrive jukeboxes, but I haven't found it to be bulky--It fits nicely in my pocket.  The LCD screen is large and backlit with a nice shade of blue which is easy on the eyes in the dark and attractive to the whole appearance of the player.  I've read complaints about the joystick controls.  If your basic faculties are intact you'll have no problem operating the joysticks, and may even find them optimal for browsing through hundreds of directories.  As for what really matters, the playback, this is where the Lyra really shines.  The playback is flawless--I've yet to see it freeze or skip.  It is crisp, loud, and has an excellent graphic eq to bring out the desired sound of any song, along with several genre presets.  The software package is okay, MusicMatch may be fine for the average user, but audiophiles and techies know its junky software.  The package is great.  It came with the 12v car charger, cassette adapter, RCA cables, usb cable, wall charger, decent headphones, an adapter for the line out jack, and a sleek protective case.  Being usb 2.0 its pretty quick on the file transfers, it took about 10 minutes to transfer 23 Gb.  It was advertised that the lyra gets 12 hours on a charge, however I usually get about 10 hours, not much to complain of.  My only complaint with this player is the short pause time allowed until it backs out to the directory and its inability to save its place after turned off.  The pros definately outweigh the cons.  The Lyra 2840 is the best bang for the buck, even aside from the value, it is a top of the line mp3 jukebox

<Title>I-Pod My A**
<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had been thinking about buying a portable mp3 player for quite some time and had narrowed my possible selections down to the I-Pod, the iRiver iHP 120 and the Lyra. After fully weighing my options, i chose the Lyra and i haven't looked back. The i-pod is $200 more with half the storage space and half the features, so what the hell is the point? Apple has alot of nerve charging what they charge for a product that is inferior to many others out there. the Lyra transfers files FAST (via USB2.0), creates on the fly playlists, has insane sound quality, stores EVERY file type (as a portable hard drive), comes with all the accesories you can ask for and has HUGE capacity (40GB). to all you i-pod shoppers, STOP, forget about being flashy, the RCA Lyra is the be-all, end-all mp3 player on the market

<Date>Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought this as an xmas present to myself.  The &quot;first&quot; one i received had a HUGE scratch across the screen.  I thought i would be able to put up with it, but it was just ridiculous so i setup a exchange thru amazon (which i must say was the best part of my experience thus far.)  the UPS guy was there the next morning to pick it up, and my replacement was there the following day.  so far, i was ok with the situation, these things happened, and I hadnt ever had a problem with Amazon in the past so i figured, what the hay.  Then the second one came and it ALSO had a scratch on the screen.  much smaller, but still obviously scratched.  I had just chosen to &quot;deal with it&quot;.  Then it started having the same problem another person mentioned in their review, it would not power up. I charged it till it was full, but it wouldn't power back up.  I had to plug it in to get ANY power and then after about 20 minutes or so, if i would turn it off, it would not turn back on.  &quot;SCREW IT&quot; i said.  and i setup another return for a refund this time, not a replacement. I still think this is a good product and from all the other reviews i've read, it looks like my issues were just flukes.  But im gonna take out the only variable in question and just go buy it at a retail store. That way i will be sure to avoid any cosmetic defects and i suppose i'll take my chances with the whole battery issue. wish me luck!

<Title>Very easy to use, incredible amount of space
<Date>Tue Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've owned this for over a week.  Here are my comments:<p>Cons:<br>Not a real "con" but the packaging for this thing was amazing.  It was sealed so tightly they clearly didn't want anything bumping it.  The plastic it came in was very hard to cut through and once cut, it was sharp.  I sliced myself in my eagerness to get the Lyra out of its packaging so beware!  Another "con" is the lack of documentation.  While I was impressed that what was included came in multiple languages, it was not much.  You have to print off the User's Guide at http://www.rca.com/documents/RD2825_2840UsersGuideENGLISH_702125_25.pdf.  It would have been nice if there were some preliminary instructions included.  I know that some electronic devices must charge for a full 24 hours before you use them.  In any case, I think the first charge took 3 hours or less, which is not long to wait.  It's also too bad that the software included was MusicMatch rather than just some simple editor for editing your own playlists.  Lastly, the "thumbstick" on it takes some getting used to.  Instead of pushing down on it left or right, you learn to sway the thumbstick left or right and then once you get the hang of it you're set.  <p>Pros:<br>The price is great considering what you get for it.  The box contained: the Lyra (40GB!), a USB cable, headphones, an AC charger, a power adaptor for the car, a cassette adaptor for the car, a case for the Lyra, and stereo cables for connecting it to a stereo.  And, the AC adaptor that plugs into your wall socket is horizontal rather than the typical bulky charger that takes up a lot of wall socket space.  That was smart thinking.  The real pro for this is that you install the drivers off the disk in a couple of minutes and then plug in your device and it is recognized as another drive on your system.  Copying via the USB cable is extremely fast, I can transfer a CD of average length in 15-20 seconds.<p>In short, for under $300, you get an immense amount of power at your fingertips.  The device supports many audio formats and even it it doesn't, it also serves as a portable hard drive that you can put anything on and take it with you!

<Title>okay product, could be much better
<Date>Fri Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had no problems with my Lyra until I upgraded the firmware.  When I downloaded the August 13th upgrade though, it started freezing every 5 minutes or so.  Rendering it useless.  A week later though they put up a new upgrade, and since I've had no problems and my Lyra is running better than ever. I don't find the Lyra that difficult to use, I had my 100+ CD collection on it and ready to use within several hours.  Most of that time was spent transferring the files from my computer to the Lyra though.  Someone who is not used to dealing with this type of device may have problems though.   Now the downsides, it's kind of bulky and I'm still annoyed about the firmware upgrade that caused mine to freeze up so much. To be honest, I was almost glad when I thought it broke because then I could justify buying an ipod.  Well, it's working again and I'm happy because it turned out to not be such a waste of money.  So, obviously I'm happy enough with my Lyra to keep using it but, if you can afford a 40 GB ipod get it instead. The lyra is just a mediocre MP3 jukebox, but for the price it's okay.  I would like to give it 3.5 stars rather four, because it is so mediocre, but the price almost makes up for that (and you can't give half star ratings).

<Date>Sat Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I don't recall when I've had such a frustrating and disappointing experience with a piece of equipment before! I downloaded about two dozen albums and a few zillion old time radio shows, in hopes of being able to listen to them on my long drives. I'd push the buttons and it would take forever for anything to happen. Then it would tell me there was an error, but of course, no explanation for why or how to correct it. Why can't people learn how to simply communicate? Sure, I lost money on it, but I can't tell you how much I enjoyed smashing it to pieces and ripping the guts out of it! I guess I'd have to say, it was well worth it... 40 GB's is worthless if it won't play anything! It's heavy and the buttons are designed for some delicate flower... You can have it!!!

<Title>Still a beta product!
<Date>Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This product is still in beta stage with respect to reading labels of WMA files (as of August 2004 firmware).  The device interface and PC software are poorly designed.  The device does not read labels of WMA files translated from other formats (e.g., translating from MP3 into WMA).  I own other portable devices that have no problem in reading those same labels.  The device does not have a "Genre" browsing option; instead, the programmed option is "Genre/Artist," but mislabeled.  If you want to play files within a genre, you have to create a playlist on the fly and then play your playlist.   The RD2840 offered the option of adding files to a "Like" and "Dislike" playlists.  The idea is great, if it was well designed.  The limitation is that you cannot classify a file as "Like" or "Dislike" if already within a playlist.  This is not a smart design.  The random play is poorly designed as well.  Every time the Lyra is turned on, files are played in identical order.  So much for random play ...  I even experience two songs bouncing back and forth, for ever.  With the new August 2004 firmare, it took too many seconds to highlight and genre and go to the next one.  This is not acceptable.  The device offered an excellent possibility by doubling as an external hard drive.  To load music files, you only need to drag and drop within windows explorer.  The idea is great; however, the PC software is also poorly designed.  To have such drag/drop flexibility, additional software is obviously needed to "profile" the device contents to create the artist/album/genre playlists.  However, you are forced to profile ALL device contents whenever you add a single audio file.  The PC profiling took several minutes with my 15 GB music collection.  I wonder how long it will take when the collection tops the 40 GB.  Why did not the sofwtare allowed the user to profile only the new added files?  The Lyra software puts an icon in the software tray and no option is given to the user to not load at startup.  I get annoyed by software designed under the assumption that all users are non experienced.  I was initially impressed by the potential of the device.  For example, you can program your own MS-DOS batch files to copy only the files that you want and keep synchronized the device with your PC at your own taste.  However, the Lyra RD2840 has too many glitches to enjoy this potential.  It does not matter that it is inexpensive, loaded with a car adapter and tape adapter, with an extra line out, and huge hard drive ... the design is too brute to be enjoyable.  I own a RCA Lyra kazoo, 32 MB, that I enjoy a lot but has been ready for firmware update since a long time ago.  The update never showed up.  I would not hold my breath with this Lyra RD2840.  I sent it back to the store and purchased a Zen Xtra of lower capacity but much, much superior, and greatly enjoyable, design.

<Title>My experiences with the RCA Lyra...
<Date>Sun Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>We bought this MP3 player around Christmas 2003. We did this at the "spur-of-the-moment", dropped $300 for it. We loaded the player with a lot of songs on it--and about two to three weeks later, we started having problems with it. The buttons came defective--they were hard to press, and didn't always function like they should have. The player often froze in the middle of a song--it just sat there, screen frozen, no button would do anything, nothing we could do except to let the battery run down and recharge.  [...]The new one (the second one we had) works MUCH better than the one that replaced it, but still occasionally freezes in the middle of a song (but not as much as the old one did). We found that we could reset with a paperclip--but still somewhat annoying. This player is currently hooked up to our home stereo system, where it suits us fine--but the next thing we're buying will be an iPod!

<Title>A great price but...
<Date>Fri Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I received this player as a gift 8 months ago.  Since then I've used it basically all day every day at work both as a music player and as an external hard drive.    When the player was new, the only problem I had with it was the awful Musicmatch software that it came with.  Once I had all my music on it (4000+ songs), I profiled it, which took around 30 minutes.  After profiling, I turned on the player and noticed that most of the albums I had transferred contained only every other song or every third song.  I profiled again, and then again before all the songs showed up.  I have to do this every time I add music to the player, so I end up saving up a bunch of music and then adding it all at the same time because I don't want to wait around to profile and then re-profile every time I buy a new CD.    As the player gets older, I'm having more problems.  It locked up for the first time just the other day, the screen was frozen and the unit wouldn't even power off.  I waited about 12 hours for the battery to die, then it worked again when I plugged it in.  Now during periods of extended music play, I'll have to turn it off and then back on every 30 minutes or so because the music will suddenly become distorted like a radio station that isn't quite tuned in.  I also have problems with the fit and finish of the unit.  The display is a little crooked inside the screen (I've never dropped or abused the player in any way).  The play and select buttons on the front are OK, but the volume buttons on the side are way too small and are partially covered by the carrying case.  The unit also becomes very hot during long file transfers, I've found that removing the carrying case during transfers will partially alleviate this.  My friends with ipods have never reported any of these probems.  Overall, with its large capacity and low price I'd say that this is worth the money, but if you can afford an Ipod I'd get that because this is not a very high quality product.

<Title>This is in No Way Mac Compatable
<Date>Tue Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am running a Mac OS 10.3 and I bought this because the store was out of iPods and I needed an MP3 player quick. On the box it says that this is a Mac Compatable MP3 player.  First of all, there is absolutely no support for Macs on the printed manual or the CD disc that comes with it. There is also no support on the web page, everything is PC geared so any updates for your player will be unavailable to you. Second of all, if you've been using iTunes then this player will not recognize any of the tags except for "song"; everything else comes up "unknown". If you're buying the 40gig player, that is a lot of songs you're going to have to manually change for this player. I guess it makes sense that they wouldn't try to gear this to Mac users since they should know that the iPod is far superior (and it is). Even if you're not a Mac user you should shell out the extra $100 for the Ipod; you won't regret it. My Roommate has a PC and an iPod and he loves Itunes over "media player" and he loves his iPod too.

And judging by some of the other reviews, I'm probably not even going to bother with RCA support since it looks like that's useless.   I'm gonna rip the thing apart, and see if I can fix it (or completely destroy it).   Good thing I backed up all 20GB of songs before it died, but I'm still pretty angry over it dying.

<Content>I wanted an I-Pod but couldn't justify the cash and I also read too many web sites that complained about horrible battery experiences. So I purchased a Lyra RD2840 in October, 2003 and have been using it constantly since then. I share some of the complaints about the user interface and form factor that others have but overall I have been satisfied with this unit. What I like the best about the unit is the external hard feature. I have used it to transfer entire hard drives form 1 computer to another and it works great! I dumped the Music Match software that came with the unit and now I just use Media Player and/or WinAmp to create play lists on the device.  Just create an MP3 play list on any software and copy the play lit file to the Lyra's lyrahdd_playlists folder and you are ready to rock. I have over 20 GB of songs on it and it works great all ay long. I use it at work and while riding my bike and have never had an issue with the internal drive. I have had some problems with mp3 files obtained fro questionable sources, they can hang the unit and a reset is required. Overall I would recommend this product for someone who wants a large-capacity player without the high price of an I-Pod.  
<Overall>3
