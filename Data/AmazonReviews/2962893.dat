<Title>Great, but wait.
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod mini is the perfect portable music player for anybody without an enormous music library.  My 1300 song library fits on the iPod mini's 4GB storage.  It is truly small, slightly bigger than my (small) cell phone. This is great, but don't buy it yet.  Announced Feb. 23, the iPod mini will be released with new colors, a full color screen and 5 or 6 GB's of storage.  ALL FOR THE SAME PRICE!!  I am a PC guy, but Apple has perfectly designed the iPod mini.  So wait a few weeks, then buy a new iPod mini.

<Title>Recommended, but With a Few Caveats.
<Date>Wed Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Apple launched its aggressive marketing campaign for the iPod, I reacted with a degree of resistance. Why bother getting an iPod? I own hundreds of CDs, and the disc player I already have is fine as it is. But once I got my hands on the mini, it instantly changed the way I listen to music. The iPod mini is a nice way to listen to/store your favorite tunes, and it deserves both praise and criticism.   THE PROS?   It's easy to install. All you have to do is recharge your iPod mini, connect it to your computer, transfer your music library on your hard drive to iTunes (which you will need to install either from the website or the enclosed CD), and you're ready to play your iPod. It's that simple. If a dolt like me can operate this thing, so can you.   Store up to 1,000 tunes. But that figure assumes that the average song you load is 4 minutes long. Because I like to listen to a lot of extended dance remixes that are 6 minutes or longer, I really have only 700 tunes max on my iPod. Still, that's a lot of music to carry.   Easy to carry and you'll look cool. The iPod mini is my new buddy at the gym, where almost everybody has one. With the right accessories (sold separately), you can clip it to your pants, wear it with an arm wrist, or carry it in the palm of your hand while running.   THE CONS?   Flimsy headphones. The iPod mini has decent sound quality, but you wouldn't know it by using the headphones, which deliver a thin and hollow sound. Not only that, but one of the speakers has already blown out after only a week's worth of use. Apple should be ashamed of themselves for manufacturing such weak headphones.   8 hour battery life? I don't think so! Battery life is such a controversial issue with the iPod, because so many people have claimed that it's much less than 8 hours. If you don't use the click wheel and keep the volume at a low level, then I'm sure you may get 8 hours if you're lucky. But I like to turn up the bass on mine, use the equalizer, and set the volume relatively high - all of which gave me a battery life of only 3 hours. So, the more features you use on your iPod mini, the less likely you'll get anything close to 8 hours. (Note: the new iPod minis now have a battery life of up to 18 hours, which is more than double that of the one I currently have)  THE BOTTOM LINE:   All in all, I like and recommend the iPod mini to anyone with a fairly large CD collection and an up-to-date computer. But it comes with its flaws so consumers should be advised before jumping in. And depending on how often you listen to music, you way want to skip this and get the 20GB, the new 30GB iPod photo or even the 40GB for just a few dollars more. Overall, it gets my green light.

<Title>Just got my 6 GB mini ... Awesome !
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wow!  Got the e-mail from Apple (Since I own the a 10 GB 1st Gen. and a 40 GB 4th) on Tuesday about the release of the new players, ordered it, and had it today, Thursday! 2 days!    Anyway, I ordered the green and I have to say it's a much richer green than the previous 4 gb.  Looks awesome and, as usual with the other ipods I have, the setup and installation was a breeze.  Sound quality excellent!  Ease of use excellent! Just excellent period!  I own, and have tried players from other manufactuers like iRiver, RCA, and most recently, Creative.  All of them have their own set of problems and nothing comes close to the ipod.  The iRiver I own has inferior sound quality, the RCA Lyra locks up frequently, and I don't even want to get started on the Zen Micro.  It froze up so many times I returned it to Amazon within 2 days.  I thought it would be an ipod competitor since it came with an FM radio and a removeable battery.  But, oh man, what a piece of junk!  I'm just hoping Apple will one day put an FM tuner in their ipods. I think if they do, everyone else can just close shop.  I could care less about a removeable battery because there are always new players coming out so frequently, I usually purchase the latest one.  The only small beef I have, which almost made me give it 4 stars, is that they took away something that used to shipped with the previous ipods.  A "wall outlet" charging cord.  The only accessories that ship with this new mini are: a USB cord that goes from the player to a USB port, headphones, a carrying case/clip, and the documentation/CD.  That's it.  No charging dock or wall plug.  The only way you can charge this player, with what ships, is to connect it to a USB port on your computer. On the Apple website, the wall "power adapter" is $29.00.  Personally, I think they should just scrap the crappy headphones that most mp3 players ship with, and include the power adapter.  This new 6 gb is just another fine example why Apple has over 90% of the portable player market.  I just can't wait to see what they come up with next!

<Title>Apple Deserve a GOLD for their Mini-Silver iPod! A Great Buy
<Date>Sat Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't know a great deal about everything, however I've been a huge fan of every iPod model since my very first purchase. I kept notes from that first purchase and every upgrade purchase I've made since then. After finally getting my Apple 4GB iPod Mini Silver M9160LL/A, I decided I would take the time to pass on my thoughts in the form of a review on Amazon.com.  I didn't ever think I would become a member of this sort of "technology cult", however Apple has just blown my mind away with their ability to consistently improve quality and impress me with style and functionality. Apple really pushed the envelope with their design and choice of color schemes.  Perfect? Not perfect, but pretty close considering I've only had a few problems with it-all of which can be taken care of with a sort of "Re-Boot"-all you need to remember is to hold down the SELECT and MENU buttons for just under 10 seconds. It seems to take care of any small issues I've had. I'll bet that most people don't put their machines through the sort of consumer testing that I do. But if you ever DO run into any problems, you can "Re-Boot" or go to the Apple website and locate your particular situation and they've convered all basis with great responses. If for any reason at all you can't locate your problem ,or if a "fix" doesn't work, simply email Apple and you'll likely have an educated response within just a few hours or less.  You will be extremely impressed with the quality of sound you'll hear on your iPod Mini. You will also notice an increase in volume as well. A salesman told me that I could expect a difference in sound but Apple wasn't really advertising each facet of this great device. He also informed me that this model will not likely have problems jumping around or skipping-improvements were definitely made and I can't imagine what any future models will have to offer!  Remember to enjoy your iPod and to not worry about anything going wrong. It's likely that you'll never run into a problem. Be certain to follow the instructions and charge for 4 hours. The rest is all about enjoying great music and being able to depend on awesome sound quality and volume improvements.  I hope this review helped and I'll be sure to keep in touch with any future developments along the iPod line. It's hard to believe all of this coming from a PURE-PC Person. That was before I discovered Apple and especially the iPods!! The truth is that I've been converted! Thanks APPLE!  Enjoy!   Pete Cannice from Scottsdale, Arizona Email: Horsepete@aol.com

<Title>Good Things Come in Small Packages
<Date>Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had long wished for my own Mp3 player, and my wish was granted last summer. As soon as I saw the iPod mini, I knew that that was the one I wanted. I got my iPod and spent many hours listening to my tunes and buying songs off the iTunes Music Store. However, my happy and perfect time with my iPod mini did not last long when I was pummelled by one of my friends while I had my iPod in my pocket in a tarmac parking lot. My precious iPod was flung to the ground and got stepped on by accident and now has about ten scratches on it (thankfully on the back). I had read in a review of the iPod mini that it was scratch-proof "even if it was placed face-down on a rough surface;" I have now cleanly disproven this statement.  Besides that, the iPod is the ultimate pocket companion for the road. I took my iPod with me on vacation and helped me get through the long hours on the plane. The "Music" section sorts songs by artist, album, genre, composer, and audiobook. My favorite part of the iPod mini is the On-the-Go playlist feature, that allows you to create your own playlist, well, on the go, so you can play your favorite songs continuously without looking for them, and then clearing it again the next minute. The Click Wheel is totally functional and a lot better than the touch wheel and buttons on the old models of the iPods.  Overall, the iPod mini is fun, innovative, and the ultimate Mp3 player!

<Title>Great mp3 player
<Date>Tue Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've listened to several different mp3 players, including the Dell Jukebox. The Jukebox sound cannot compete with the iPod minis. The colors are fun, and you can customize your equalizer settings to get the sound you want. It holds a lot more songs that it seems and has games to play while waiting in Restaurants. (seriously)

<Title>Poor battery: approx 5.5 hours
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't usually write reviews but I was so badly treated (or rather: ignored) by Apple's service that I felt I should warn others.  Beware of the battery rating.  "8 hours" means one song played over and over.  Under ordinary circumstances you will average about 5.5 hours.  And, heaven forbid, you should skip to the next song, you can drive the battery down to 4 hours or less. On the positive side: the wheel interface is very good.

<Title>A few flaws, but overall excellent
<Date>Sun Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After some deliberation, I decided to buy an iPod mini. The price was a bit prohibitive ($380 Canadian with tax...ouch), but the iPod mini's ease of use, superb sound quality, and stylish look are worth crowing about. A lot of people have complained about the iPod mini's relative lack of storage space compared to its older brothers, but I consider myself a pretty hardcore music fan, with my fingers in all different genres, and I only have 556 songs on my Mac. That's a lot of music, people. And I still have 1.3 gigs left over! So don't be afraid that the mini has "only" 4 gigs of storage space. You'd be suprised how much you can fit on there.  Now for the bad stuff: The battery life is disappointing. Sure, most of us won't need to go for eight straight hours without a recharge, but if you listen to your mini a lot (as I do), you might be suprised at how quickly the battery drains. Apple's advertised 8 hours, in reality, is more like 5-6.  Also, don't be fooled by everyone around you wearing those white Apple earbuds - they're just trying to look trendy. The earbuds (included in the box, along with a belt clip) are okay, but have a weak lower end (bass) and are a bit tinny. Most earbuds are, though. Pick up a better pair of headphones - I use Panasonic Shockwaves, which get nice bass and aren't expensive at all. Still, if you really want to draw those stares, use the earbuds. Whatever floats your boat.  Another thing: Check out the iPod mini in real life if you can. It's actually much smaller than it looks in pictures (that's a good thing). And a note for PC users: You'll probably have a few glitches setting up the iPod. Such is the nature of the PC. Mac users, of course, could be brain damaged and still get the iPod up and running in a matter of minutes.  Overall, I'm hugely impressed with the iPod mini. It's ridiculously easy to use, it looks great, and having a thousand songs in your pocket at any given time will blow your mind. No more skipping, no more changing CDs...it's golden. Definitely check out the mini if you're in the market for a good MP3 player.

<Title>Mini vs. Standard
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My 3G 40 GB froze and went into Apple Care. So I bought a Silver Mini. Maybe it is my current infatuation, maybe I'm just glad to be back in the Ipods. But this is a superior unit. Much more solid. Love how I can put it in the front pocket of my jeans. My old pod felt like a brick in comparison. As far as storage goes, one really should store their music collection on a computer or external hard drive and off-load onto the pod. A Thousand songs should be plenty. Of course, if you have songs and audiobooks on there, you might start to get space conscious. The ergonomics of this unit are so far superior....its similar to the difference between one of those 5 year old cell phones compared and a sleek and sweet Samsung. My point deduction is for those Apple earbuds. They irritate my ears and basically suck. They really should be wireless. In any event, they should be much more comfortable and have better sound. The shuffle is a toy. The standard is a brick. The Mini is mine.

<Title>Colorful, Efficent, and very small!!
<Date>Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my pink mini ipod a week ago and I love it. Just one thing to know before you buy the ipod- you need Windows 2000 or Windows XP to download itunes to it. If you dont you can always download XPlay to your Windows 1998 or ME. Even though the ipod is kind of on the expensive side, it is worth it. It can hold up to 1000 4 minute songs!! It has excellent sound quality and is tinier than your walkman or diskman. They are very stylish too- they come in blue, lime green, pink, silver, and gold. I can take my ipod anywhere!! You can take your ipod almost anywhere, except in the water. You can take it jogging, to the office, in your house, etc. You can shuffle all your songs up and discover the songs you never knew about. The ipod also come with 4 fun games that you can play while your listening to music. They are Brick, Parachute, Solitare, and Music quiz. My personal favorite is the Music Quiz because it plays a song and you have to hurry and say what song it is before time runs out. The faster you know it, the more points you get. The only thing you will get frusterated on is downloading the songs. This process may take a while and you will sit for hours downloading music into your ipod. The best way to do it is to do a little bit a day or else you will get totally burned out!!  The ipod comes with a firewire, 2.0 wire, a plug adaptor, itunes cd, the ipod itself (duh!), earbuds, and an instruction booklet. The hardest thing I had trouble finding out was how to turn the ipod off. You dont switch hold, you have to hold the >// button on the bottom for at least 6 seconds. Then it switches out and you can switch it to hold.

<Title>Great product, poor service from Apple direct - Use Amazon!
<Date>Sat Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Hi,  I experienced really poor service ordering from Apple direct.  I first placed an order for a personalised ipod mini and the lead time on delivery was set at almost a month later from order placement.  I needed the ipod sooner as it was a gift, and I contacted Apple and I suggested changing my order to a standard ipod mini rather than personalized in the hope this would improve delivery.  They told me that the engraving process only took 5 minutes and it wouldnt improve delivery at all.  A few days later I contacted them again in the hope they could improve the delivery and was told by a different sales contact that by changing to a standard ipod this would improve delivery greatly.  I changed the order and the delivery did improve to ship in a couple of days. The day passed and the shipment hadnt been made, and the lead time had gone back out to the same time as the original personalised ipod mini. I contacted them again, and after holding for 30 mins was told that that was just what the lead times could do - just change at any given moment!  I promptly cancelled my order, and ordered with Amazon.  Sorry, Apple, fantastic product, rubbish service.

<Title>The more competition there is, the less great it seems
<Date>Tue Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>A lot of what you pay for with the iPod of any sort is the name, and the design.  Apple is excellent at making a streamlined design, and if that's what you're looking for, they've got you covered.  So far as features to price ratio, however, they're not really that great.  I have had four or five iPods in the last few years, so I'm hardly one to say they're not worth the price.  While I do love my iPods, I realize they're not really for everyone.  I got the mini for working out -- the armband that you can get for it fit my arm a lot better then the behemeth sized one for the regular iPod.  They minis are only about 4 gigs in size.  When I say "only", I mean in relation to other MP3 players.  4 gigs is actually enough room for just about anyone.  After all, not many people listen to every track of every CD they own.  However, if you do, the mini probably is not for you.  For me, personally, it's fine, because the music I listen to is dependent on my general mood -- I'll listen to the same "set" of songs over and over for a week or three, then I'll cycle it out for something new, but I *never* listen to all my music at once.  The mini, in addition to just playing your music (but not your WMAs!), will also do some basic calendar, contact, and notes functionality, along with a couple of games.  It sort of wants to be a PDA, but it doesn't really cut it.  I'll stick to carrying around an extra device for that functionality, so for me those are more "throw away" features.  I don't like the new click wheel.  I find myself, more often then not, changing my selection right before I click, so I end up with the wrong song, or menu item.  It often takes me two or three tries.  I'm not sure if it's because the wheel is overly sensitive, or maybe my nails make it harder to operate (and my nails are not terribly long, especially for a girl).  I've also had a problem with the iPod Mini locking up on me, usually after I've used it in my car.  I will unplug it from the audio jack in my car (not the power adapter) and bring it inside, and it will no longer power on.  I'll have to press some combination of play and menu, hold for 10 seconds, before it will come back to life.  In fact, I returned a previous Mini because of this problem and the new one seems to suffer the same issue.  On the other hand, all the iPod's I have had have stood up very well to the tests I've put them through.  I've kept my iPod Mini in an "iSkin" in the entire time I've had it, which may help, but either way, it has taken a beating in my purse, at the gym, and dropping off the treadmill.  Definitely well built in that way.  For me, the positives outweigh the negatives, mostly due to the fact that it takes a beating and is small but not too tiny.  However, it's probably not the best choice for everyone.

<Content>This is a really great player, but don't get this, apple just came out with a new player that is the exact same thing with extended battery life and is 50 dollars cheaper. Or, if you're willing to pay the full 250, get the apple ipod mini 6GB, which stores 1500 songs. For more info, go to www.apple.com. Thanx

<Title>ipod mini review
<Date>Thu Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my ipod mini for 3 months & I have found it to be one of the best things I have ever bought.It is well designed easy to operate the instruction book is in plain English & the software easy to install even for a 50 year old former Ludite.My only small criticism is that no carrying case is included otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.So for all those people who spend endless hours travelling I would recommend you buy an ipod as it is much better to be able to listen to Bach or Charlie Parker than have to put up with the music provided by the airlines.I also find it good when reading or at the gym.In fact I am so impressed with my ipod that I am thinking of buying an Apple laptop computer just like Steve Jobs planned ( I hope I got his name right)!!!!!

<Title>Not bad after initial panic
<Date>Sat Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod took me more than 4 hours setup with my Windows XP.  The formatting process took more than 2 hours and appeared to hang.  The iPod screen and the manual warned me not to disconnect, and I wasn't sure whether I should terminate the process in the middle of formatting.  I began to search google and Apple's support web site. It turned out this happened to other people as well. I was told to terminate the formatting screen because the software would get stuck and need a kick.  The registration process then continues.  But after I started iTune, iTune told me that the drive was not formatted and gave me a choice to restore to factory default, which I did.  After some more work (it took so long that I couldn't remember what followed afterwards), I seemed to be able to connect to iTune.  But the iTune software is not intuitive to Windows users.  It took me a while to read the user manual online and figured out how to transfer the Playlists onto iPod.  It would not take drag-and-drop from Windows Explorer like other MP3 players would. It also took some time to find out how to make the proper eject icon show up in order to disconnect the iPod properly. The whole iTune learning must have taken another hour.   The battery didn't seem to last too long.  play for about 4 hours and I need to re-charge.  Nevertheless, all is well after this. The iPod itself was tuitive and easy to navigate.  I learned to use podcast to download my favorite radio show to iPod as well.  It has been fun so far.

<Title>iPOD IS AND iFRAUD!
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I received an ipod for Christmas and still cannot get it to work with my Windows XP. I have spoken to the customer service support people over the phone 5 times and they cannot help me. When I went to my local Apple store at Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton, California the "Geniuses" at the Genius Bar were far from being a Genius. Especially when they said, "We had a lady come in here the other day and we just couldn't get the thing to work on her Windows laptop. Oh well." They refused to take give me my money back even though they admitted that my computer just might not be able to support the ipod.   You call that customer service? I have learned more on the Amazon reviews of ipods about how to get this thing to work than from the *#@%ing Geniuses at Apple. THIS IPOD IS AN IFRAUD!

<Content>First of all I have Windows XP and install was a breeze....basically just put the CD in and it will prompt you what to do.  itunes was simple and easy to use as well.  Within 3 hours of purchasing the ipod I was able to download almost 200 songs.  The longest part was downloading all my CD's on itunes.  The sound quality is excellent and I love everything about it (although I wish the battery lasted longer- it's about 4 hours).  I bought the pink and it is sooooo cute.  For the guys out there- if you are thinking about getting this for your girlfriend/wife you will make her very happy! My boyfriend blew it and bought me a RIO which I quickly exchanged for the mini ipod.  This thing is awesome!

<Title>8-hour battery life?
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Why does Apple insist on lying to its customers?  Maybe an 8-hour battery life would be possible if one listened to the Ipod on very low volume, without touching the dial.  But, isn't the joy of the Ipod that you're supposed to be able to skip over songs, mix up the order of your music... listen to What you want, When you want it?  If you're like me, and using your Ipod as the Good Lord meant it to be used, you'll be lucky if your battery lasts 3 hours.  Which means, almost every time I use my Ipod, the battery dies before I return home.  So uncool.  Especially since Apple promised otherwise.

<Title>In the end it depends on YOU
<Date>Thu Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I see the iPod Mini as the perfect MP3 player for ME, I am not sure about other people, but 4 GB is more then enough for my music library. I mean, how many songs do you want? And if you do fill up 4 GB chances are that half the songs are ones that you don't listen to or put on just for the sake of filling the iPod Mini. Besides, every time I look at a bigger iPod, I cannot get over the fact that it scratches way too easily, and a grey touchwheel does not go with a white casing. In the end, if you are the kind of person that packs there iPod with their favorite songs, not the history of every rock band, then this is the one for you. If you are a kind of person that does not mind scratches, and has a HUGE music library, and I mean HUGE, then go ahead and get that white and grey reflector. By the way, how can you people resist the cool alumininum and smooth casing with the discreet iPod logo on the back, with a white touch wheel and a blue cover?

<Title>GREAT- with a few exceptions...
<Date>Fri Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got my iPod Mini on December 10th so I've had it for about 2 months. I have about 45 songs. I have a capacity of 1,000 songs and I only filled in 45!!! The good thing is that you can put your whole collection on it for FREE!!! Since you just insert the CD into iTunes, it doesn't cost you anything. Not even a penny. The iPod mini tends to get dirty if you touch the click-wheel too much, or if you touch the screen. Even if you have clean hands, you smudge hand oils on the screen. It's a good idea to get an iSkin because it protects it from dirt, dust and scratches! (I'm thinking of getting that soon).  You can also have several problems with iTunes and Apple's Support Service. If you write a problem they might answer it or not. When I had a problem with iTunes, I wrote to them and they told me what to do to fix my problem. But when I had a problem with the headphones last week, they CANCELED my request. It's kind of confusing if you think of all the problems you could have, but if you ignore that fact, it's a GREAT PRODUCT and I advise EVERYONE TO BUY ONE so everybody can have one (who wants one), so everyone can be HAPPY!!!

<Title>Veteran Owner-Has worked perfectly-Tired of negative reviews
<Date>Sat Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I am so tired of all the negative reviews, of people who don't know how to work it (its so easy to use! omg), of the people who give up and return it, and of people who have never even had one and say bad things about it.  I've had my ipod since April 2004 (10 months) Woot woot! So I am more experienced than all of you and have something very important to tell you.  The iPod mini is great, and THE easiest music player to learn to use and navigate through.  Besides that it scores major points for popularity, it is practical. A while ago, it actually malfunctioned (because I had it so long, and thats cool you know), and I had to send it in to Apple Repair Service for a new iPod mini.  The service was great beyond belief! I got the iPod back in 2 days after I sent it, only paying shipping charge. So that turned out really well actually, where I was scared it was over. Oh BTW, battery life is fine, 8 hours is really a lot if you think about it. And 4 gigs is plenty. So as far as specs go, the iPod mini passes the test.  I also bought my mom one for Christmas, and set it up for her too.  She loves it too. Even an old lady like her can use it.   So in essence I've set up 3 ipods (2 of mine cause I got a new one after I sent it in, and my mothers). All times- no problems. Those Christmas recipients who had problems setting it up have no excuses, you probably did something wrong.   Its really easy to use and I recommend this 150%  You truly get what you pay for.  iPod mini is worth every penny. If you're thinking of getting a portable music device, you should really get the iPod mini. Don't let the negative reviews scare you; I know they are potent, but false.  The sense of you joy you get from it is priceless.

<Title>Long Story, Bad Conclusion
<Date>Fri Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If I could give it zero stars, I would.  First off, I took a chance on it because I thought that it would be a great way to carry all my music in one place.  In the end, I went through four ipods and I'm probably out at least fifty bucks once I finish selling it on ebay.  The first one had problems with the sound, so it was exchanged after less than three months.  Then, it got replaced again for the same problem less than three months later.  I thought my problems were gone, but the next one they gave me had a battery that would only run for half an hour, which eventually dwindled down to a mere fifteen minutes.  They sent me a new one, and I decided that was it and to sell it.  The other thing that most people don't know is that their "protection plans" sounds like something the Mafia would offer. They are just a way to squeeze more money out of you and you'll need them because they don't build their products that well.  I saw all kinds of people in the Genius Bar who had lots of problems with their stuff.  After the last phone call I had with the customer service, they told me that after that call, the next one would be $50.  The protection plan for the ipods runs at about $60.  It's got to make you think, why have such expensive protection plans?  Because Apple has made it so that they're stuff will break so you'll need them.  I'm out of the Mac Cult.   Get an iriver, a sandisk, or a creative muvo.  Just don't bother with this.

<Content>First of all, I am looking into buying an MP3 player, I automatically thought Ipod and I had my heart set on the mini. I am 13 and you see, 250 is a lot to save up at an occasional babysitting job. So, I looked for better deals. I saw the review about the Dell pocket DJ. It seemed like a good deal. But, comparing it to the ipod, you get 1500 more songs in 1GB more space, something's fishy. do they compress the songs or have lower sound quality? If you know, please tell me.  Thanx

<Content>I heard some reviews saying that it was "style over quantity". Duh, do you think we can't see? I'm 13 trying to save for an ipod mini. I have to make charts to try and convince mom and dad that it's a good way to waste my money. It's obvious that the 20GB is a better deal. But it IS style over amount of songs. It's a marketing technique. Apple has figured out a way to get MOST of us to buy something for more than it's worth. But, honestly, I think though it is expensive; the ipod mini has a lot of good features that most others on the market don't. They have made it so we can have access to a slightly less expensive alternative to the 20GB without going to a different company.though an improvement that they could make is to have a voice recorder to compete a little with the Dell DJ. All in all, a great toy for those with the money!  Thanx

<Title>Great, but could be even better. 3.5 stars actually
<Date>Sat Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'll give it five stars for style, software, and versatility, but I've got some issues with the player.  First and foremost, batteries. I prefer disposable and longer lasting like the Rio Forge. When I'm walking and 3 miles from home, if the batteries go, I'm alone with just my thoughts for 3 miles, and my thoughts are usually about disposable batteries.  Second, the batteries last about 4 hours, not 8 or 10 as I've seen "advertised."  Third, the earphones are terrible compared to Sony MDR-EX51LP earbuds. Even the venerable Wall Street Journal rated the Sony as far superior to Apple's. Fourth, I love the wheel except for volume control. When walking, I wan't to be able to get to the volume without looking, and that's really difficult with the Mini in your pocket and the wheel flat against the I-Pod, so flat you can't tell front from back. Yes, you can lock it, but then when road noise gets bad, you still have to adjust the volume which means unlocking and feeling for the wheel. I think a small thumb wheel at the top would have been much better. Other than that - and the fact that it was a gift - I really like the thing.  I still use my Rio when it's raining, when I have to fly someplace, or when I'm otherwise not sure about battery life, but the Mini's playlists etc. make it a joy. (I still give my Rio with 1 gig 4 stars. It's lightweight and uses one AAA battery which lasts for 12 hours. It only holds 350 songs, but I keep thinking about my cassette days.)  I don't use the Ipod for notes etc. That's just too much trouble, but for something to carry around 1,283 songs - that's my "personal best" - wow, that's 100 albums!

<Title>Apple iPod Mini
<Date>Sun Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really don't like this iPod. The normal version of the iPod is the best you can find. The iPod Mini as gotten very unpopular in 2005. Most people now are buying the 20GB or the 40GB iPods. If you want to buy this iPod the only reason is you want to jog and run with it. You shouldn't care about not holding much songs either because this is only 4GB which only holds 1,000 songs. The 20GB iPod which is only $50.00 more can hold five times more than that! I think the iPod mini colors are really stupid too. I don't know why people like to have colored MP3 Players. You're supposed to use MP3 Players to play music and maybe games but it doesn't matter what it looks like on the outside. All I care about is how much gigabytes it has and if it has a simple but very advanced design. The 4th Generation iPod now almost beats the mini's size. It's really small but the regular iPod is catching up to it. Soon no one is going to want this iPod and they will switch to the fifth generation iPod (which is supposed to have a 80 GB Storage Capacity!)

<Content>I got the mini iPOD for my wife last christmas. My wife never got exited about a gift as much as she did for this one. She can not live without it now. In the car, in the house, and most important when she works out (Arm band is a must which I got too). I am an old iPOD user, and she used my iPOD many times where I thought she needed hers. Our music doesn't come up to more than 5 GB so far. so with this mini iPOD she was very happy and had all her music in it. My 15 GB iPOD was and still is an over kill. I don't think I will ever have this much music. Any how it works fine, I can hook both to my computer (win Xp) and with iTunes I can see both, and transfer music to them. You don't need to buy the base charger, but I just got it for looks ;) I can't imagine anyone give this product anything less than a 5 star.

<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>those apple bastards have rounded up the total storage capacity to 4 gigabytes, when really there are only 3.7 gigabytes. bastards. anyway... this ipod mini is a good little toy, but when you get down to it, there just isnt enough room on there... and besides, it really isnt that small. sure, if this had 20 gigs, i would take it over the current 20 gig ipods any day. its got the cool color and the small size, but what is that really worth. the current regular ipods are still small enough to hold in one hand and use just the thumb and are still quite light.  by the way, the battery life on the ipod mini is totally horrible. if i were to take a 4 hour long car drive, this thing would die, and without the addition of a carcharger, your pretty much screwed.  if the ipod mini costed about, say, 150 to 200 dollars, maybe itd be worth the money.. but at a whopping 250 dollars, it just isnt worth it, seeing as how you can get a 20 gig for just 50 bucks more.  my advice: go for the 20 (which i believe holds like 18.6 gigs or something). only get this 3.7 gig if you, well... uhh... dont get it, that should be enough

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS
<Date>Wed Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this ipod in February of 2004. It was great, but then about 2 or 3 months later, it stopped working. All I got was static. At first I thought it was the headphones, but after testing my $130 sony's on it, and they didn't work, I knew it was broken. I sent it back, and I'll give the store credit, I got a new one in a few days. But guess what, 9 months later, I'm having the same problem. Luckily, there are still 19 days in my warrenty, but I'm 100% positive that it will happen again. And when it does, the ipod won't be under warrenty. Then I'll have to buy a new one, because Apple charges $250 to fix broken ipods not under warrenty. I'll deffintly go for the 20 gig then. Bottom line, DO NOT BUY THIS. It works great at first, but it breaks easily. And by the way, it's not just an unlucky coincidence that both of them broke. I've talked to other people who had the same problem. DO NOT BUY THIS.

I recommend it to anyone who hasn't really explored all the musical options of the world (teenagers) or someone who loves their music, but has a small music collection. I love it, the design, the colors but the only disappointment was that the battery life is like more 6 and a half hours rather than 8. When they say 8 hours, they mean 8 hours of continuous music, if you turn it on and off alot,use the scroll wheel constantly or use the backlight you have alot less time.

<Content>The sound is wonderful.  Setup is easy.  Unfortunately, batterly life is really, really bad.  If you charge it and start playing, you may get up to 2 hours of listening time.  Unfortunately the battery runs down when you AREN'T listening, too.  So, when I listened for an hour and then did not recharge overnight, by the next morning the battery was out.  And it does not recharge quickly, it takes 3-4 hours.  This has made me disinclined to use it or carry it around -- it basically only works if I have JUST recharged it.

<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod mini (silver) for Christmas. It is a very good product. I highly recommend this product for anyone who loves music.   People are always saying..."why buy the iPod mini when you can buy the 20 GB for only $50 more?" Well....the reason that I bought the iPod mini is cause i wanted a smaller MP3 player than the regular size iPods. And...will you ever fill up the iPod mini? 1,000 songs is a lot of songs and even if you would...you cant even listen to them all without having to charge the iPod...so why would you want that many?   The only problem that i have had w/ this MP3 player....is that it froze once and i had no clue how to un-freeze it. And i had the backlight on and the battery almost went out. Then i finally found out how to un-freeze it.   Thats the only problem that i have had with it. Besides that....it hasnt giving me anymore problems yet.   ~Nick

<Title>great for the gym
<Date>Tue Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didn't buy it at amazon, but  i thought i'd leave a review any way. I mainly use this thing at the gym so battery life and storage space aren't issues to me. The only thing that stops me from giving this player 4 stars are the earphones. They suck and there always falling out. I use a pair of panasonic earphones that I bought for about five bucks and they work much better. The playback sounds good to me and it can go loud enough to cover up that annoying aerobics music my gym plays in the area I stretch in.

<Title>Ifs and Buts, mar this nice device. 
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Apple as always makes great looking devices, aesthetically. Be it Laptops to the MP3 players. The concept is great, it is compact, sounds great. The problem is what is inside it. I know we bitch a lot about Microsoft, but they have set the standard for software capabilities & usability, that you can't expect with others. No wonder Microsoft rules the markets.   Now just imagine, you load your iPod with 1000s of songs, from so many computers and Disks. You cant get them out of it if you lose your hard disk on the computer that has the library. iTunes that comes along with your iPod is quite primative, please use RealPlayer 10. iTunes seems to have a buncha installation and compatibility problems too. They have been in the market for decades, they are stable and the software is available for free download.Does the same thing with a lot more control and capabilities. RealPlayer is made for iPod. Cleaning up the disk on your iPod? Forget it. If you use the Windows Format utility, it is dead. You have to download a 30MB iPod restore software to wipe it clean. Thanks to RealPlayer 10, it will do it for you. Much more clean and easy.   That having said, sans all these, it is a cool, sleek, nice sounding device. Hope you enjoy!!

<Title>Rockin' my face off
<Date>Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife gave this to me as a gift about 3 weeks ago and I love it. We had our Mini with us during a recent trip to Mexico, and it proved itself with wonderful sound quality, an admirable battery life, and great options. It was a great asset to have during a cumulative 10-12 hours of travel time.  The mini itself is easy to navigate and understand. She essentially told me how to work it, and the ease in which I have been able to use it has been wonderful. At first, I didn't think much of the 4GB amount of space, but it's been great for me as a person who never transports graphic or movie files.   I found the headphones they provided to be more than acceptable and the sound quality I've experienced has been great. At this point, I normally use my Mini while at a desk (while working) and (wonderfully) the mini never gets in the way of any of the work that I have to do. Even better, the mini isn't any sort of hindrance to my coworkers. If I were to ever work in the dark, I know that the beautiful blue hue of a lighted screen would work to light my way (used it on the plane).   My only discrepancies are minor - the Mini is seemingly easy to scratch. I looked at mine yesterday and noticed a few gashes in it whose origin I know not. Further, any sort of accessory for the device seems to be kind of pricey after you spend $250 on it.   The bottom line: This is a great toy to have, albeit expensive. Tons of options and features make for a wonderfully diverse product. Works as a well-received gift or a smart personal purchase. Don't be rough with it, travel a lot with it, and enjoy.

<Title>good investment
<Date>Thu Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got some Christmas money and had a little more lying around and had my heart set on the iPod mini, especially after one of my roommates got one for Christmas and a guy I know from church wouldn't stop bragging about his.  Both of them said that the iPod was the "best MP3 player" out there.  So I looked further into it and decided to get the blue mini.  I got mine with the three-year warranty, and I have not had any huge problems with it.  I downloaded the iTunes store to my Mom's computer (since I was home during Christmas break) and it automatically asked if I wanted to transfer all existing Windows Media Player files into the iTunes format, so that I could use them in iTunes.  Media Player wouldn't let me download everything-iTunes informed me that Media Player had "copy protected" some of the files in Media Player, so my mom and I are still in the process of re-downloading her Japanese Anime music into iTunes.  But for the most part, my mom is hooked on the iTunes store and the quality of iTunes player itself.  And she doesn't have an iPod or iPod mini yet.  It took me several days to get a good chunk of music into the iTunes player, because I could only work on it in two hour stretches, what with my getting ready for school and all. Once I finally figured out how to use my blue mini, I got hooked on it.  I bought a few accessories, including a cassette tape like thing that allows me to play my iPod mini using my car's stereo.  When I went back to school, I decided to download the iTunes player/store to my computer.  It wiped my iPod clean while it was configuring it (again).  My roommate also had the same problem.  Not all the CD's I have access to are on my computer-some of them belong to my parents and brother, who are a good two hours away.  So not everything I want is on my mini, but I still have around 200 or so songs.  Other than that snag, I have one other problem-the battery.  Every night I have to recharge the mini because in the course of six hours I have an empty battery.  The battery dies faster than the one in my cell phone, and my cell phone is older than the mini.  For the most part, I have liked the mini, though.  The belt clip is nice, so is the sound quality, I liked the ear buds (they actually fit my ears), and the color is nice, although mine has gotten dinged a few times even though I take pretty good care of it.  It works very nicely-and is a good replacement for my discman.  The iPod mini is a pretty good MP3 player, and I like how I don't have to cart around CD's anymore, and it fits in my pocket.  Oh, and I would also like to point out that you do not have to have a high-speed USB port for the iPod to work.  I only have a regular, non-high speed one on my computer, and it works just fine, just a little slower.

<Title>everything is great except the battery life
<Date>Mon Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>first i should start by saying the iPod Mini is my first MP3 player. i've never used any other MP3 players, so i'm not sure how the iPod is in comparison. i chose the iPod after doing a lot of online research. i had friends that had iPods and loved them. so i finally decided on a mini.   it took a while to set up and configure, but i read through the manual and everything was fine. i do like the iTunes software, and found it pretty easy to import my CDs. the design is nice and fairly simple to navigate. the mini holds about 1000 songs which is fine if you have a moderately sized music collection. i have about 300 songs so far and will probably get another 500 to fit on there.   however, after charging the iPod overnight, i discovered that i only get about 2 hours of battery life. what i was not aware of is that the iPod drains the battery even when it's turned off. after a few days the battery is completely drained, even if i only listen to it for an hour total. i tried to find out if this was normal, and found nothing of help on their support website (which was pretty difficult to navigate). i finally went to an Apple store and left it with them overnight. they said that it got the average amount of battery life when they ran it and that it's normal for it to use up the battery even when it's turned off.   so overall, i gave the iPod 3 stars because it's a good product if you don't need a lot of battery life. i would recommend considering other options before deciding on an iPod.

<Title>Complements its big brother beautifully
<Date>Tue Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After the joy of getting 5283 tracks (some 27 minutes long) on my (relatively) new iPod 40GB, I could not resist the green mini iPod for those special occasions and short bicycle trips but mainly because it is a VERY sexy, sleek little lady which is a wonder of modern design and technology.  Don't get me wrong. I adore my wife and children and get all human pleasure I need from them but for my passion in music, my collection has received the justice it deserves. On it I have reserved only the very best tracks from the best music - such as John Coltane's CRESCENT, Anita O'Day singing SWEET GEORGIA BROWN, Miles Davis playing MILESTONES, Beethoven, Haydn Trios, etc  As grandfather three times over, this little green mini has just added more joy to my autumn.

<Title>I love my ipod mini
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the best little device I have ever seen.  It has made my life so much easier - no more cd's littering my car, and only my favorite songs so no having to fast-forward past songs I don't like on cd's.  Playlists allow me to have certain songs for driving or working out or winding down at night (it's so small it's easy to jog or wear while working out).  The cassette adapter is best for the car in my opinion.  It's so easy to uplosd songs from cd's or to buy music from iTunes.  I encourage anyone to get this.  I belive it's the future and eventually we will all have one.

<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've owned my iPod mini for 5 months nows and continue to enjoy using it as much as I did the first week I owned it.  A few notes:  PROS: - easy to navigate controls & intuitive programming; my sister tried mine out and exclaimed several times, "it's so smart!"  Doesn't take much time to get the hang of how it works. - excellent sound - eyecatching exterior - comes with iTunes, a straightforward, easy to use program for organizing your music.  From here you can purchase music online or upload your own CDs.   - comes with a sturdy beltclip, which is handy when you're at the gym or engaged in outdoor activities  - comprehensive user manual   CONS: - a little pricey - stock earbuds get uncomfortable after more than an hour of use - my iPod mini froze once after siblings tweaked with it; however, the user manual provided instructions on how to reset it & the issue resolved - though you can browse through music available in other iTune stores (e.g., the Canadian or Belgian stores), if the song is not also in the American store you will not be able to download it.  I'm still waiting for the Tragically Hip's "Phantom Power" CD to come to the US!  Final Verdict: worth the pretty penny it costs

<Title>Great, Product, but Expensive
<Date>Fri Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Battery Life- Battery life is an issue, but I can get a solid 4-6 hours of straight music playing time per fully charged battery. It does drain the battery when it is off, because it keeps the time loaded and other data that you can save on the mini such a dates, notes, and etc.  But it charges 80 percent in the first hour and charges when it is hooked up into your computer through the USB cord.   Other then that I think it is a great product. I was not a fan of Itunes, but it is alright for transferring your songs and is easier to organize your online library.   Some other things to note is that if you are a college student you get a discount, 20 bucks off. Also if you are someone that has a lot of music consider the normal Ipod, because it is only 50 dollars more for a 20 G instead of 5 G memory.  I love my ipod mini, it definitely catches the eyes of people walking down the street. The headphones are okay, but invest in better ones since you are paying for so much anyways for the Ipod might as well get the best.

<Title>Ipod Mini is at the front of the digital music revolution
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love MP3 players, and I have practically traveled across the entire industry to find one the perfect one.  I think I may have finally found it.  The Ipod Mini (Silver) seems to be everything I could have ever wanted in a music player.  It's compact; it has an intuitive design for navigating the player (the revolutionary `click-wheel' technology); it's light (which makes it perfect for workout); it has an amazing capacity for songs (4GB; approx 1000 songs) for a player so small; and, it just plain looks cool.   My Ipod Mini was a birthday gift, and certainly one of the best I've ever gotten.  The sound quality that this player provides is nothing short of amazing.  While listening to my Ipod Mini, I've listened to songs that have been favorites of mine for years and I have heard hundreds (maybe thousands) of times.  Yet, when I hear them on this player, there are layers of sound that are new to me, and the songs all have a richness to them that I have never experienced before.  The sound quality alone is reason enough to get an Ipod Mini (or any Ipod for that matter).  Its capacity of 4GB (approx 1000 songs) may seem low in comparison with its larger (in actually size and song capacity) cousins: the 20GB and 40 GB Ipods.  Yet, unless your goal is to put your entire CD collection on the player, the 4GB size is more than enough.  You must also consider the fact that this player is smaller in overall size, meaning the technology inside is miniaturized and there are fewer moving parts (a definite plus when working out).  I've had this player for over three months and between songs I have downloaded, select songs from CDs that I want, and complete albums that I've put on the player, I've barely exceeded 500 songs.  Thus, I have nearly half the player's capacity left.  Since the Ipod Mini can also act like a portable hard drive and hold text documents and contact information, I will have plenty of space to put those files, too.  The navigation of the Ipod Mini is pretty impressive.  Its `click-wheel' technology lets you scroll through your entire library of songs with just the lightest touch of the device.  While on a song, you can use the middle button to scroll through play/volume mode, play/song length mode, and `rate the song' mode, using the `click-wheel' scroll to adjust the volume, advance or rewind the song, or give it a rating based on a 5-star scale.  The actually click icons on the wheel allow you pause/play a song, advance to a new song or return to a previous track, or go back to the previous menu.  The menu structure is very consumer-friendly.  It starts at the very top with access to the Ipod Mini's different features and then moves down to different ways of navigating those features.  The music menu allows you to access your songs by album, artist, song title, genres, composers, and playlists.   The Playlist is an ingenious feature that allows you organize your songs in any manner you see fit.  You could create one playlist of, say, 50 songs to listen to while working, while having another playlist of 100 completely different songs that you like to listen to on the job.  There's even an `on-the-go' playlist feature that lets you just add songs to the on-the-go playlist as you listen.  The only aspect that I find less than stellar is the iTunes software interface.  This is not a problem with the player. It is just that the iTunes software, which enables the upload of songs from the computer to the player, is not nearly as intuitive to work with as the Ipod Mini is.  This is a minor concern, however.  You adapt quickly to using iTunes and then it's just another extension of this great player. Other than that, the battery life is pretty solid and the built-in battery recharges fairly fast.  Plus, there are also a plethora of accessories to enhance the Ipod Mini experience.  This player comes in 5 separate colors (Gold, Pink, Blue, and Green, in addition to Silver), and each one has its own personality to match that of its owner.   This is a fantastic MP3 player and is at the very topic of the digital music food chain.  For anyone looking for a top of the line music player, look no further.  Your journey has ended.

<Title>Very Good - Better than a Portable CD Player !
<Date>Sun Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Apple iPod mini is a very good MP3 player for the person who has a fair to medium size CD collection, and wants to create a greatest hits compilation for travel purposes. The iPod mini is easy to stuff into your pocket without having to carry dozens of CD's in cumbersome cases. I have taken all of my Boston Pops albums, movie themes, 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's music and collected the best hits to store on the iPod for future airplane trips and vacations. So far 750 tunes have been stored on this neat little gadget (over two days of music) and there is still room left for more songs. To buy a larger iPod means paying for meaningless memory storage for which I will most likely not use. The software was easy to download, but you must have the latest Windows XP programs, a 500 mghz processor, and a broadband internet connection to make it work correctly and reap the full benefits of iTunes.   Most other reviewers have hit on iPod's biggest negative - battery power and battery replacement. According to Apple's website they have an external, commercial battery support system for regular iPods. They need to do something similar with power storage for the iPod mini. Paying $100 for a new battery after it wears out is gouging the consumer, and the mail-in exchange process for a new battery is silly. Apple could also work on creating a fade feature to soften the rough edges of music changes. However, the overall sound the iPod mini reproduces is excellent, especially with Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones. The people at Apple have done a great job with the iPod mini, just continue to look for improved battery life and power beyond an eight hour charge, and more convenient features and accessories.

<Content>I'm a complete Mac addict. As soon as I saw the ipod, i fell in love. Waiting for a cheaper alternative to the 400 dollar 5GB version, I meant to get the 10GB, then the 15, then the 30, but I was extra cautious about how much I was spending. Then I saw the 4GB ipod mini. Perfect!!!!  This is excellently engineered like all ipods, it's smaller. And you can pick your color instead of spending the extra $15 on iskin. Brilliant sound quailty. This combined with Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2 is the best stereo system I have ever used and heard.  I also noticed the mini is faster than the 20GB click wheel version. Also check my review on the Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2.
