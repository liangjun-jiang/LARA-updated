<Title>Tunes and Photos on the GO-GO-GO

<Content>Love it- need it- you must have it  - a must for people that love thier music want to share photos and present a slide show with family and friends. The 30GB is large enough to accomodate lots of images and tunes. The controls and navigation is simple - build quality is excellent - the color screen is clear and beautiful - well worth every penny.

<Title>Love it!!!
<Date>Mon Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It stores a lot of music and photos, and fits in your pocket.  I'm a musician, so I can't live without my music; however, anyone who loves listening to music will enjoy it.  As with any other iPod, you can have everything you want to hear, whenever you want it, without carrying CDs.  The photo feature is also really cool.  I've had it for over a year and it's been working flawlessly!!!

<Title>great product, but.....i'm still trying to get mine to turn on....
<Date>Sun Aug 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Ipod is an amazing device that eliminates the need to carry around thousands of CD's, and allows one to create master mixes of their favorite music. The Ipod Photo even lets you at 25,000 of your favorite photos and place them in a nifty slide show viewer. yes, that's all wonderful and great, but there are some buyer beware issues with the Apple Ipod. First of all, sometimes the Ipod will "decide" to not work properly, i.e the turn dial will not turn, the Ipod will die on its own, the battery won't last that long. I have owned my 30 gig pod for about eight months now and it has acted funny since I got it. I try to take care of it the best that I can, but sometimes it seems that the IPod has a life of its own and can decide when it wants to work and when it wants to take a day off. Still, it's a remarkable piece of electronics and I highly recommend purchasing some kind of MP3 player if you are a jogger, biker or a music collector/lover.

<Title>There is an iPod killer out there
<Date>Tue Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had my ipod for 2 months and everything went wrong...Let me start with the: 1) Battery- u need to buy at least 2 more batteries because the battery completeyl drains to where you can't listen to anything anymore. When that happens, all of that precious music that you spent 2 weeks or 2 months downloading is nonexistent, it deletes everything 2) A 30GB holds 7500 songs...I am a proud owner of the Sony NW-A3000 (20GB) it holds almost 15000 songs, that's right, 15000 songs 3) Trying to get support from apple is like being on life support and someone pulls the plug...enough said 4)Using itunes almost made me break my ipod from all the frustration. Sony uses sonicstage and it can be a royal pain to use, but that software compresses the files which give you more space on your player. A LOT MORE SPACE!!!  My Sony HW-A3000 may not hold videos (Which I never watched on my ipod anyway because I work out) or photos (for the same resason) but I've had it for 4 months and only had to recharge the battery completey 10 TIMES! SONY actually got it right this time There is an ipod killer, it's name is Sony NW-A3000

<Title>Thinking different is cool, Apple iPod is not.
<Date>Fri Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought a 30G iPod Photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently, outside the warranty (which of course goes from original purchase date, not replacement date), it's kaput again. Now if I have to pay $275 for Apple to fix or replace a three month old player! No way. THREE players on the blink, each after a few months - that isn't just bad luck.   That isn't even mentioning the difficulties with the iTunes software or if you change computers. I get a new PC and have to re-transfer 100s of CDs! How lame. That negates all the convenience of the large capacity (I wish other MP3 players had the storage space the iPods have).   I just can't justify spending more money to replace this limited, inferior POS again. So essentially over the last year I have spent about $1 a day to have a player and now I'm left with nothing. I will be buying a different player. I will spend far less than $275 and get something that will last more than three months, is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use - obviously not an iPod! Unfortunately I can't transfer the music I spend hours and hours loading up (over and over). What a waste of money and time.

<Title>A Good Product Worth Considering if in the MP3 Player Market
<Date>Tue Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Its true, the 4th generation 30 gig Apple Ipod is a very good product.  Is it great?  Well, maybe not.  But its not that this 4G model does not have every thing that some body wants out of an MP3 player, including video, the ability to hold and show pictures (about 25,000 of them), music (7,500 songs) and a pretty good battery life when listening to music of at least 10-15 hours per charge.  When writing a review of any Ipod I believe that you must mention Apple's Itunes software, which make is very easy to buy and download music to your Ipod, that is why it is the industry leader this in regard.  Also, the body of the Ipod is very slim, the menu of the device is very easy to figure out even if you have never used one before.  Within minutes of turning it on you will be able to understand how to download music, create play lists and arrange your music just the way that you want it.  Whether you like the Apple Ipod or not as an electronic device you have to give Apple credit for the fact that it is very easy to use, all the way around.    So, what's wrong with the Ipod?  Well, the fact that the battery life on this particular model is very limited when you are watching video on it, about two hours.  Also, while the screen of the 4G Ipod is very crisp and clean, it is just hard to view.  But then again, a small MP3 player like the Ipod is naturally going to have a small screen, there is really nothing you can do about that, it does though strain your eyes to view the screen for long periods of time. Also, the screen does scratch very, very, very easily.  Any thing will do it and I think that it is real down side to this product, it should have made so that any body could be able to carry it in their pocket without worrying about whether the screen is going to scratch or not.  That would resemble to me at least that it is a product that is made to last, instead of one that is made to last until next Ipod comes out so that maybe you have to buy another one.  I would really recommend that you purchase a protective case for any Ipod that you buy because they all seem to scratch pretty easy.  Having been a fan of Apple products throughout the years I would say that this product is worth a four out of five.  I wish that all Ipod came with a home docking station instead of just the USB cable to charge and download music.  I think they sell those docks for 20 bucks, but they make them for only 5 in China and it would great if they included that in the package.  The sound quality of the Ipod is very good, and it should be for a couple of hundred bucks but if Apple doesn't make some changes to the 6G Ipod which is probably due out right before Christmas 2006 I believe that other players could offer some resistance to Apple's market share.  This includes adding wi-fi, maybe a built in satellite radio function, perhaps different colors for the Ipod, touch face design, maybe a wide screen, it has to be some thing to set the Ipod a part from every other MP3 player out there.  All coupled with at least 20 hour battery life with music and 10 hour battery life with video, I think that is one thing that every body can agree on.

<Content>I've owned my ipod Photo 30 GB for three years now, and the only problem I've really had has been with the original ear buds wearing out. I found OEM replacements on EBay for cheap:  they're good enough for me right now.  I am glad I purchased a neoprene case to protect the fragile little whizzer from the get go.  I have dropped it a few times, and the case saved its life.

<Title>awful investment
<Date>Tue Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought the ipod photo and I was extremely excited. I brought it home and installed the software and everything looked good to go. I had to change all of my wma audio files to mp3 to put on itunes and that was a horrible pain. I have over 500 albums and I had maybe 12 done after over 3 hours. Anyway after just a bit the ipod started saying do not disconnect. This would not leave the screen. I tried turning it on and off, ejecting from comp, etc. I troubleshot for over 5 hours to no avail, I reinstalled it 5 times. No go. What a piece of crap. Apple prides itself on the ipod but it is a bunch of conformist garbage and I would never wish my grief on anyone. I'm gonna buy an iriver. Screw ipod. Ifthat stupid U2 commercial doesn't turn you off I hope this review will DO NOT BUY ONE!!! (...)

<Title>Totally stoked on my brand new 30 gig photo!!!
<Date>Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had a really hard time choosing between the 20 gig iPod and the 30 gig photo but I definitely made the right decision in the end. It is DEFINITELY worth the extra $50, don't kid yourselves. You're getting another 10 gigs, the awesome color screen (some of you may not care about this feature, but I love it and it's so much more fun and bright than the b/w models), the photo capability (I enjoy this, too!) and some other stuff. Like they say, everything looks better in color! I got all geeky on my iTunes library and tracked down all the album covers I could find so I could see them when the songs play.  Now, for those of you who don't have USB 2.0 or Firewire, like me a while ago, a company called TechGear makes a nifty little device that looks like a pen drive called the USB 2.0 2-port transfer hub. It's compatible with USB 1.1 and you can plug it right in your USB 1.1 port and then you've got two 2.0 ports. It's about 15 dollars, I'm sure you can find it on Amazon (I got it at Circuit City).   For those with Windows XP worried about having to install Service Pack 2 (or rip your hair out trying to get it because you don't actually own a copy of Windows XP, like me), don't bother. This didn't cause me one problem and I was installing the software and listening to songs on my iPod in minutes. I don't know about other version of Windows, though. This was a huge relief. SP2 is nothing but problems and I don't want them on my computer.  One of my favorite things about the iPod would have to be how freaking loud it can go. I like my music nice and loud and this more than quenches my thirst for that. Especially in the mornings, I usually put on something heavy and loud to keep me awake (and everyone else around me on the subway). Seriously everyone, this thing can go ridiculously loud.   Anyways, put a b/w and a color iPod next to one another (I did so at BestBuy with some demo versions the day I purchased mine) and if you are going to look at both and buy the 20 gig you are cheating yourself. Splurge a bit! You deserve it! Like I said, the extra $50 is worth it and than some. Don't make the wrong decision, 30 gig photo all the way. I highly recommend!!!!!!

<Title>PERFECTION!
<Date>Sun Apr 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As I recieved the 30GB Apple iPod for a gift I was thrilled.  I had been wanting to get one for a long time and finally had one in my hands.  Man, was I excited.  There are many things that make the iPod Photo VERY different from the 20GB iPod and the 60GB iPod Photo.  I will compare the Apple iPod 30GB to each of it's competitors that most buy may buy instead.  Apple iPod Photo 30GB vs. Apple iPod Photo 60GB  You may think: "Wow, 60GB is a lot of memory and it can't be much more bigger than the 30GB, right?" Wrong.  You will NEVER use all of the 60GB unless you have the enourmously large music collection of somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 songs.  If you just so happen to have 15,000 songs waiting to be put in an iPod, knock yourself out and go for the 60GB.  7,500 songs is still a great deal of songs, and if each album has 20 songs, then it would fit 375 Albums.  The main thing that comes to mind is that the 30GB is WAY lighter than the 60GB model.  I messed around with my Uncle's 60GB and it was very heavy. It was also very thick, also. When I opened the 30GB, it was as light as a feather, and extremely thin compared to the 60GB.  Also, my Uncle was having all sorts of problems with his 60GB iPod, and I have yet to have one single problem with mine.  Apple iPod Photo 30GB vs. Apple iPod 20GB  There really isnt any contest here.  The overly priced 20GB comes  in black and white while the 30GB comes in color.  Also, you can see the album cover on the 30GB and nothing on the 20GB.  You may not really need the Photo feature, but if you do, the 30GB holds a ton of photos, where the 20GB does not have the capability to store photos.  Basically for only $50 more, you get many excellent features that make the iPod much more fun.  The color screen, photo storing, album cover viewing, 10 more gigs(2,500 more songs), AND more battery life.  The 30GB has a 15 hour battery life while the 20GB only has 12 hours.  If you ask me, that's well worth a 50 Bucks.  Overall, I Highly reccomend the Apple 30GB iPod Photo. I love it and wouldn't change anything about it!

<Title>Undeniably great, MP3s and a photo album too.
<Date>Fri Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I must preface this review with a confession.  I am *NOT* an Apple fan, but I'm slowing beginning to see the merit in many of the Apple products today.  My first computer was an Apple //e, and then I just moved on...  ...Twenty years later, I found myself looking for a birthday gift for The Wife.  I decided to get her something she could use to store the hundreds of pictures we have taken of our son.  I'm a believer of convergence, so I wanted to also put her music collection in the same device.  I immediately looked at Archos, iRiver, and Creative for their solutions.  Each one in turn was compared to the Apple iPod Photo.  Each one fell short.  Some had more storage but less battery life.  Some had difficult UI issues, others had navigation that was less than intuitive.  If the thing was for me, I'd have gone with the Archos for the storage size.  But The Wife doesn't need to be confused or annoyed with UI choices and over-capability.  Simple, direct, useful.  It doesn't hurt that the iPod is stylish, either.  I ordered one, and the optional dock, and the Griffin iTrip.  Took delivery quickly, opened up the well-designed packing, and was suprised at how small the iPod was.  Also, Apple will engrave a few sentences for free if you order directly.  Since this was a gift, that was the route I took.  Some things I didn't like?  Price.  The dock being made optional in this iteration of the iPod.  The lack of a Firewire cable, or AV cables.  Apple should be bundling these items with the iPod; breaking them out to soak customers will likely hurt them later.  If you accept the pricing and grab the optional items, you're in for a treat.  It worked perfectly out of the box.  Install the software, install the dock, dock the iPod.  I had her songs transferred over in less than an hour, her photos of our boy in less than ten minutes.  All 30 gigabytes were filled, too.  Now she has Axe from Brazil, Depeche Mode, and Metallica to get her to work and back; and now she can show off all 600 pictures of The Boy wherever she goes.    And she can finally stop asking me where all the pictures of The Boy are, because they will always be synchronized to the iPod.  And when she wants to hear her music, the iTrip will transmit on any free FM frequency to her car radio, or the kitchen radio, or wherever... and hopefully, she likes her birthday present.  Fred

<Content>The iPod photo is without a qualm the most prevailing mp3 player on the bazaar. This apparatus is exceedingly astounding. Occasionally, I have thus had a intricate time figuring out how they essentially prepared such a device as grand as this. The sound quality is dazzling. The look is outstanding. The grip is exceptional. And if you're as near as rich as Nick Manos, the price is stupendous. Overall I bestow this item vast praise. Do yourself a favor and acquire one now!

<Title>Thousands of Songs in Your Pocket! Does it get any better?
<Date>Wed May 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you're like me, you see a new product like the iPod Photo and the techno-lust starts to kick in. The price of the new have-to-have gadget gives you pause, so you read online reviews and start to save your soda cans. Then the day comes. You shell out your hard-earned dollars, and you now have that cool gadget in your hands. Then after a few weeks or months, that had-to-have gadget sits on your desk collecting dust. All the fun was in the wanting, and the product never really lived up to the hype.  Well, let me be the first to tell you... This was not the case with the iPod Photo. I love this thing!  All Your Music - Everywhere You Go: My entire CD collection fits on this thing with plenty of room to spare. Did I mention that this device is smaller than a deck of cards? No more lugging around a handful of CDs wishing that you remembered to grab that other CD on the way into work. Not to mention that with the iPod Photo I can grab the album art from somewhere like say ... Amazon.com, and it displays when I play a track from the CD. You can't do that with the standard iPods as far as I know. The battery life is great. After charging all night, I listen to music on my one hour commute into work, eight hours at work (some days), and then an hour on the way home again. Not even close to running out of power. The sound quality is great, and for headphone listening there's more than enough power to make your ears bleed ... this is a good thing in my opinion.  So if you've never owned an iPod before, what makes this thing so great?  Discover New Music: The iTunes Store offers more than 1 million songs, some of which you may have never heard of for only 99 cents a song, and sometimes even for free. That's FREE as in Beer (and that's always a great thing).  Discover Podcasts: What are podcast? Think of them as talk radio broadcasts that you can listen to whenever you want. There are podcasts on just about any topic you can think of:  sports talk, political opinion, tech-geek news, movie and music reviews, and my favorite "The Dawn and Drew Show" (which defies definition ... think ADHD Seinfeld with an R rating).  Audio Books: Listen to those books you've been meaning to read, but never have the time. One Minute Manager, Seven Habits, etc ...  Carry Your Contact List: Now I've ditched my (dusty) PDA since my contact list was really the main reason I had to carry one. You can upload your entire contact list to your iPod, and phone numbers, email addresses, everything is right there with you.  Photos on your iPod: Aside from the CD cover art, this is not a feature I've played with yet ... what can I say ... I have to sleep sometime.  My advice is buy the 60GB if you can afford it, but my 30GB is not even half full yet. Either way... Give in to your techno-lust and BUY ONE!

<Title>Best MP3 Player By Far
<Date>Wed May 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was holding out on purchasing an apple iPod photo. I didn't want to give into the hype, i was waiting for the perfect mp3 player, but the bottom line is that there is none. I was either going to purchase this or a creative zen touch 40gb. I opted to go with the iPod photo. I'm not a supporter of mac whatsoever, but the iPod impressed me. 30gb is more than ample room for those musid hoarders like myself. Apple says 30 gb of music but 5gb itself is taken up already, due to the awesome programs such as games, contacts, calendars, etc. that apple pre-installed. I'll give my pros and cons below, but overall this is an awesome product, no mp3 player out there is a match. DON'T PURCHASE creative mp3 hd based mp3 players. The hd usually freezes up within 6 months of use even less and you have to send it back to creative for a hd repair, but the customer service is crap to say the least.  Pro: - 3o gb of space plenty of room - album art capabilities - easy user interface in iPod as well as program supplied to transfer music. iTunes   Cons: - although it shows album art the downfall of it is you have to manually upload those album arts. Typically it shows if u have purchased the dl through iTunes, but like me i download music from another source, there are already album art included with the music, but iTunes does not transfer the art into the iPod. You have to purchase a separte program such as iart to make it easier on yourself  - low sound. As compared to the creative i purchased the sound on the iPod is not impressive. You would think with the amount you're paying it would. I suggest getting better earphones which boosts the sound quality   Overall iPod photo 30gb is well worth the money

<Title>(Quite) A Few Quibbles
<Date>Fri May 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, let me start by saying that this is a very good product. But it is FAR from perfect. I have many complaints, often quite petty (after all, this is my first iPod), but for the $300 or so price tag I expect CLOSE to perfect...   Quibbles:  1. You can't load pictures directly from the camera/memory card onto the iPod. Or, rather, you can't view photos loaded directly. In order to view photos, they must be moved to your computer and loaded through the iPhoto software. This is a MAJOR dissapointment for anyone travelling with their iPod and camera.   2. The (necessary) iTunes software is not compatible with Windows 98 or ME. Devastating to those of us with older computers full of MP3s.   3. The iTunes software is constantly redirecting me to their store. Very obnoxious.   4. I firmly believe that any product that costs me around a week's salary should come with all the necessary accessories. Noticably absent: a carrying case (if you dont want it severely scratched), flash card reader, fire wire, decent headphones, etc. etc. All told, be ready to sink another hundred (or three...) on "fun add-ons".   5. Could they not add some better games?? My cell phone has way better games than this. My TI-83 calculator (yeah, I was a bit of a nerd in high school) had better games than this. What a waste of a color screen...   Complaints aside, the iPod still rocks. The sound quality and design are unsurpassed; the software and database style song sorting are strong - there are clear reasons why the iPod is becoming a cultural icon of the digital age. But, given the price and potential for improvement, I wish I'd waited for a better version.

<Title>BEST MP3 PLAYER ON MARKET!!!
<Date>Fri Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This is the best MP3 player on the martket. It beats others hands-down. 15 hour battery life, 7,500 songs, and pictures. What else could you ask for. So simple to use, easily to navigate and find your songs, and automatically syncs with your computer every time you hook it up. Even better, it's in color. Think of it as a digital photo album. Much smaller and easier to carry than 750+ Cds that you would have to carry around. With all the accesories there is so much possibilities. I would definately recomend the iTrip. Great addition because you have the ability to play in any stereo that has FM. Not any drawbacks unless you are really really picky.

<Title>Incredibly Nice Change
<Date>Sun Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I wrote in my previous iPod photo review that it was horrible. Now I think this is the iPod to go with. This 30 gigabyte version is only $349.99 which is only fifty bucks more than the normal 20 gigabyte version. They have this 30 GB version and the 60 GB version. The discontinued the 40 GB version. This holds 7,500 songs and 25,000 pictures. It's only .62 inches in depth which is extremely thin compared to the .75" for the 60 GB. I still do think that the color screen is a waste but ever since they discontinued the 40 GB normal iPod and the 40 GB photo iPod I really have nothing to complain about (price wise). Even the 60 gigabyte is only $449.99. Now the iPod Photo is really going to sell. I would no doubt look into this. If Apple proved me wrong on the iPod Photo and you are having doubts just read this review and you might want to get one for yourself!

Like if you play "american idiot" on the ipod photo, the infamous heart grenade appears left of the song title.  Big screen not much thicker than 20 gig.  I am glad they discontinued all the 40gig models.  This is definately the #1 mp3 player on the market.  the only thing better is the 60 gig.  ipod photo for 100 bucks more.  I recommend the 30 if you want the ipod to fit in your pocket.

<Product Name>Apple iPod 30 GB Photo White M9829LL/A (4th Generation)
<Title>Incredible, Simply Incredible
<Date>Wed Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I do not own a 30 gig model.  I actually was able to get a 40 gig on closeout.  Although the 30 gig is a little smaller and lighter, it has the same features as the 40.  I have never been so impressed with a product before.  I have it to where when a song begins to play, it also shows the album cover.  When friends view my iPod this helps them discern which cd to buy.  It is also just cool.  Another benefit would be the photo's features.  My family and friends are photo fanatics and this product allows me to carry around all of my favorite pictures and produce them for friends immediately.  The small two inch screen does and incredible job with the photos when viewing.  Now the 40 gig came with a docking station, fire wire cable, USB 2.0 cable, adaptor, carrying case, and cords that allow you to plug the photo into a television.  I do highly suggest the purchase of these accessories.  They simply make life much easier.  Battery life on the iPod photo is not dazzling but not bad.  The weight of this player, although heavier than most, is still not really an issue.  The sound quality is remarkable.  Whether I am playing music through a television, the ear buds, or in the car, the sound is just as good as if it was from a perfect cd.  The only gripe that I have is that it is terribly easy to scratch which really does not affect the performance of the player.  As I have said from the beginning, for the price and the features, you simply cannot go wrong.  I have muddled with other mp3 players, but iPod is simply the best and this is the premier of their line.  With many other products you feel as if you are settling for the product.  You will never have this feeling with the iPod photo, it knows it is the best and illustrates that to you every time you turn it on.  It is incredible, simply incredible.

<Title>30gig color VS. 20gig B&W
<Date>Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>SCOPE: Because of the price drop on the color models, this review will be targeted to those struggling over a 20gig b&w screen vs. the 30gig color iPod decision.   BACKGROUND: I own both the 40gig iPod Photo and the new 30gig iPod Photo, and have owned a 15gig regular 4G iPod in the past and I also own a 512mb Shuffle. I use both PC and Mac formats.  Note, I am not recommending the 60gig variety.   1) BOTTOM LINE: The new 30gig iPod Photo @ $349 is, in my opinion, the *perfect* iPod.  My main complaint with the 40gig iPod photo was its price and size/weight (i gave it 4 stars).  The new 30gig is roughly the same size/weight as the b&w 20gig and has all the features of the Photo family --> and for just $50 more, you get another 10 gigs, 3 more hours of battery time and a color screen!!!  This price/feature tradeoff is one of the best you'll find anywhere in the Apple product suite.  Frankly, the 20gig b&w is currently mis-priced @ $299, i would expect this price to drop very soon.   NOTE:  30gig iPod Photo = $11.63 /per gig -- $23.26 /per hour battery time 20gig iPod b&w = $14.95 /per gig -- $24.91 /per hour battery time  2) PHOTO QUALITY: Good to "pretty good".. but not excellent (no improvement since the first iPod Photos were released in 10/04)... I do realize the size of the screen is only 2 inches, but photos tend to be slightly pixilated, even the full resolution ones that are over 2mb (though you stop noticing after a minute) and color reproduction is not all that great on skin tones and deep reds, but very good w/ greens&blues... which make pics of landscapes quite nice!   3) PHOTOS ON MY TV: Now this is where this thing shines... this is a really cool feature... however you MUST BUY the mini-plug-to-RCA-out (headphone to 3 pronged yellow/white/red) for another $20, which in my opinion is worth it.. you can scroll through your photos on your big (or at least bigger than your computer screen) TV screen.   4) MUSIC: Biggest change here is you can now see the album art... sounds like a tiny feature, but after you get tired of showing off your photo albums, this is probably the single most useful feature.  When before you had no incentive to look down at your ipod screen, now you'll find yourself looking at it all the time... In terms of music playback, it's the same as any click-wheel, 4G iPod.   5) SIZE/WEIGHT: Its great!, I cannot physically tell the difference in size and weight between the 20gig b&w and the 30gig iPod Photo... this was my #1 complaint about the iPod Photo 40gig -> it was simply too big and heavy to be practical... that's why I was forced to buy the Shuffle!  6) COSMETIC CHANGES: None on the outside, still scratches as easily as the rest, but has a color screen w/ a new font and screen looks very dark w/out the backlight.   7) BATTERY LIFE: Conditional based on the user... However, so far it seems to run above spec during mixed use = 16hours.   8) STORAGE: Disk access time for photos do have a lag (on both my 40gig and 30gig), and the unit tends to freeze from time to time, but I would consider the severity and frequency of this event to be insignificant to the overall functionality.  In terms of size -> i think audio books, photos, and Podcast Radio programs have made -for the first time- the ridiculous size of the hard drives actually justifiable... in my 40gig photo, i used 15gigs due to my podcasts and audio books and would expect to reach 30gigs in 3-4 years of use... I still feel the 60gig to be not very practical... i suggest you stick with the smaller size.   == SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX==   A) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE: In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing albums automatically, etc..., you need to purchase or own iLife (iPhoto specifically) 4.03 or better (if you are the rare few that bought your computer in the last few months w/ 4.0, you still have to download an upgrade to 4.03) ... Now I bought my iMac from the Apple website last Christmas and it still shipped w/ iLife 2.0... so I had to purchase iLife 4.0 (according to several company reps, there is no free upgrade from the jump from 2.0 to 4.0)...which took me an additional day to figure out... Yes, you can assign folders and such to sync to your photos to your iPod, BUT having an album editor enables full control of changes and what changes I'm making, to the entire process. Oh Yeah, you need a high version of iTunes as well; my pod came w/ ver. 4.7... IMHO, you \need\ the iPhoto upgrade to enjoy this purchase.  If you have PC, you have to buy Adobe Photoshop Elements.   B) TRANSITIONS: Only the "wipe" from right-to-left is included, however, I heard a firmware upgrade with more transitions would be out later this year.   C) SLIDESHOWS: You cannot assign multiple music lists in iTunes to specific albums in iPhoto... as of 03/05, you can only assign a SINGLE music list to ALL photo albums when you enable the slideshow feature. Yes, you can change this music list, but need to go back to the menu to do so.   D) COLOR SCREEN: When not backlit, the screen during regular music playback turns \VERY\ dark, much more so than regular B&W iPods... you need a light source reflecting off of the screen in order to see the letters... typeface has changed too, more like "Arial" and slightly smaller. Oh yeah, with the backlight off, the screen still displays in color.   TECHNICAL DETAILS:   A) You cannot adjust the color quality, size, cropping or transitions of the photos when detached from your computer, so don't waste your 1 customer service call credit on it.   B) The 30gig package does not come with the TV-out cable, you have to buy it ($20), and it comes w/ a USB 2.0 based charger, not firewire.    C) If you never upgrade your iTunes due to the hacks you can employ on earlier versions, then you cannot use the photo feature (yes I tried).  D) ALBUM ART: For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, you don't have to purchase a song from iTunes to get album art... just drag and drop an image of the album cover into the window where iTunes usually shows the album art.... plus there are programs out there that auto-download the album art into iTunes if you have the name of the album and the name of the artist...

<Title>Yes, I Made the Upgrade.
<Date>Fri Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My introduction to the iPod world was through the Mini, which I like, but I secretly envied those who own the 20GB or 40GB.  After a few weeks, I grew to hate being limited to only 1,000 songs on the Mini and wanted an iPod that was able to store more music.  So when Apple launched a new line of iPods, I jumped on the first opportunity to make the upgrade.  I didn't quite need an MP3 player that can store photos, but I recommend the 30GB iPod Photo for its color display screen and its ability to save up to 7,500 songs.  That's enough to store my entire collection of Miles Davis, Bob Marley, AC/DC, John Coltrane, and Roxy Music, with plenty of extra space for hundreds more CDs.  If you purchase music through iTunes, you'll also be able to view the album artwork on the iPod screen (this feature SOMETIMES works for music not purchased on iTunes).  Very cool.  I didn't buy this player for its photo feature, but I was able to transfer a few family photos just to test the picture quality.  The images are fairly clear for an MP3 player, but in no way can they replace a traditional camera.  While I'm happy I got the 30GB, I do have one axe to grind with Apple.  The headphones, while stylish in their white design, are weak and flimsy.  Within a month's worth of use, the right ear started to give out.  Of all the headphones I've used in the last 15 years, Apple's are by far the worst.  Audio snobs will most likely throw these out the nearest window and get something else.  Beyond that, I highly recommend this bad boy.  Those who own the Mini or Shuffle and want to upgrade should skip the 20GB and pay just a few dollars more for the 30GB iPod photo.  One final comment: it is absolutely critical that you get a protective case for your iPod, regardless of which model you purchase.  The display screen scratches VERY easily.  Cases are available on this website, your local Apple store, and at other retailers.  Protect your investment.  Would you like to see a few hundred dollars of your money go down the drain in a matter of days?  I, for one, wouldn't.

<Content>Let's face it, you can't get something for nothing!  The San Francisco Chronicle recently exposed the real story behind the so-called "offers" that are continually being posted here.  Do a search on Google or on sfgate.com for "iPod not really free David Lazarus" and you will see what the con artists running these programs are really up to.  In a nutshell, it's just another way for spammers and other sleazy people to steal your personal information.

<Content>I was thinking of getting this or the Sony Vaio Pocket VGF-AP1L digital music player(I love Sony) but in all, I decided on this. There is no other word to describe it but amazing. It holds a ton of pictures, it shows album art, and you can get a cable extra(which I did) which lets you put the photos you have on the little color screen onto the TV for a slideshow, and you can use music on your iPod for background music. Anyways, I have no complaints, it is great!

<Title>to the obsessive-compulsive: beware
<Date>Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>i agonized for many months before getting one of these.  for one thing, i'm a pc user, so i looked at all of the imitation players from dell, diamond, creative, etc., and even among the ipod's i was torn between the 20G model and this 30G model.    but i really believe this ipod -- compared to all of the imitation players out there and all of the other ipod's -- really hits a sweet spot in terms of physical size, hard disk capacity, features, and price (well, maybe not price :).  compared to the 20G model, the 30G has the following advantages: it's about the same size, has a color screen, holds 10G more for $50 extra, can show the album art (very fun), and has a slightly longer battery life (12 hours compared to approx. 8-10).  if you're still wondering whether you should get an ipod in the first place, here's my number one bit of advice: itunes is an outstanding program and it blows other music-management programs out of the water.  you might not think about the software much when buying a player, but you really should.    consider that you have 100's of cd's you'd like to add to your digital collection.  you need a really well-engineered program that can handle your collection now, and possibly 5-10 years from now.    itunes rocks.  it's the kind of program that understands that your needs will grow over time.  certainly you'll add more music, but what if you hook up your computer to a hi-fi stereo and suddenly it becomes more than just an mp3-generator?  you might want higher quality recordings on there.  or what if a new compressed format comes out a few years from now and blows aac and mp3 out of the water?  suddenly you might want to convert all of your music to the new format.  or maybe you just don't give a damn and just want to easily convert all of your files quickly.  the best way i've discovered to allow your collection to grow over time is to first rip all of your cd's using apple's lossless format.  once this is done, you change the import setting in the preferences to a compressed format (mp3, aac, etc.).  i personally like using mp3 192 (VBR).  then you simply right click on all of the files you generated using apple lossless format, and click 'convert to mp3'.  go have a cup of coffee while itunes converts all of your lossless files to mp3.  so what you end up with is 2 files for each song -- a perfect lossless version AND a compressed version that will go on your ipod.  to ensure that only the mp3's go on the ipod create a playlist out of them and have itunes only sync your ipod with that mp3 playlist.  what's the advantage of all of this?  well, if you decide that mp3's stink and you want to convert your collection to some other format, you simply change the import setting and right click on all of your lossless files again.  no need to import from cd ever again.  yes, it requires more disk space, but that's cheap compared to your time.  but, of course, if you're not as obsessive, you can simply import all of your music using the default settings and be done with it :)

<Title>It's a masterpiece!
<Date>Fri Apr 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love my new iPod. It's really cool and especially helps me because I travel a lot and all my music is now in one place. Please note that you will need very specific MAC OS or Windows OS versions to make it work perfectly with iTunes. I have Win XP SP1 version (which is not that old) and iTunes doesn't work correctly all the time. In my third call to Apple, one rep told me to upgrade to XPSP2 (which, by the way, my company doesn't allow because there are lots of issues with it). So, please read the technical requirements for your computer because you will need to latest and greatest versions to make iTunes work.  Other than this, the iPod Photo is a very sleek thing - great sound, great design -- you'll love it the moment you start using it. In my research, no other MP3 came even close to it. Kudos to Apple!  P.S. I also bought Belkin TuneCast to use the iPod in my car and it works very well too! If you buy TuneCast, be sure you buy the version that comes with the car adapter otherwise you will spend a lot of money on AAA batteries.

<Content>Although I'm a PC geek, I have secretly lusted after an iPod for years, since they first came out! A: I had a PC and B: I considered it to be too expensive, then they came out w/ PC models and this weekend, I got a good price and bought it. Cool, fun! Sleek, stylish and cool. Great interface and design. I don't like the earbud thingees... alreay, inside of 24hours lost one of the pads and they are a bit uncomfortable -- am going to look for aftermarket ones. Also, bought a case and dock (both very needed and SHOULD be included with)  Already had iTunes on the comp. Have had some trouble moving my wife's purchased music, but I'm sure it will be something dumb I missed. It's a pretty good program and I like it's interface.  As for whole iPod experience, I am quite happy w/ it!!!

<Title>Beware of  iTunes - Poor Quality and locks you to Apple
<Date>Tue May 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Previous reviews describes the HW. Not much to add here: Slick design, easy to understand, undersized screen for photo but the colors are nice. The problem with Apple is the iTunes SW. Unlike other MP3 software I have seen, this one works only with iPod which gives you two problems: You will be locked to iPod and it may not work.  - If you have loaded 10.000 songs (no small task)onto iTunes and want to use it with another player then it's back to reloading. It will not work with other players. Also, Playlists are to be maintained multiple places etc. - iTunes has sigificant quality problems so your perfectly working computer may not work with it. Go to http://discussions.info.apple.com and check it out - and note how many problems are unsolved so folks are sitting there unable to load, burn and play and the proprietary nature of iTunes means that there are no alternatives. Customer support is at best random I got one iPod. My last.

<Title>iPod Photo: near perfect
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have used three different iPod models since they were released a few years ago. They keep improving with age and iPod Photo is almost flawless. What's great about this model: 1. previously, I had problems with battery life dissipating after a month or so of use (and I use mine hard; it's on at least six hours a day), but that hasn't happened with this one. I find that I get right around 18--eighteen!--hours of battery life on a charge. However, if I go two or more days between use, the battery runs itself down to almost nothing; 2. the vibrant colors are a wonderful change. Compared to the iPod Photo, the old black-and-white models look positively antiquated. The font on the Photo is updated as well;   3. to my untuned ear, I cannot tell the difference between what I hear on my earbuds and the CD the music came from. Sound quality is, as always, excellent; 4. the price drop. I paid $399 for my last 40g model and $349 for this 30g iPod Photo, a superior product; and 5. picture quality on the iPod is quite (surprisingly) good. It's like carrying an entire photo album with me. I have over 2,200 songs and 1,300 photos stored on my machine and it's still more than half empty.   What I'm not crazy about: 1. I'm not sure how the album art is stored; namely, why some have it and others don't. Anything downloaded from iTunes will have it, and some stuff from my own music collection does, too, but I can't figure out a pattern and have been too lazy to research it. Less than half of my music has album art to display; 2. I know that the "random" feature is the result of a complex algorithm and has, in fact, been proven to be truly random, but my iPod has a propensity for picking certain tracks while never playing others; 3. to lower the price, Apple's skimped on the accessories that come included with the iPods. In this model, no dock or case as were provided as when I bought my 40g b-&-w model; 4. the display on iPods scratch ridiculously easily. I recommend picking up an iSkin which is a colorful jacket that fits over the iPod and comes with a screen protector that works really well. Apple sells these for about $30 but they can be had on eBay for a third of the cost; and  5. no way to delete songs directly from the iPod and no way to load photos onto the machine. Both of these things must be done from a computer.   A quick word on Apple's customer service: if you register your iPod with them, you can request repairs or replacement parts for accessories at (usually) no charge within a year of purchase. So when your earbuds begin to fray (and they will), you can get a new pair simply for asking. I've done this four times with no problems, free of charge. They even ship new parts for free via FedEx. Whoa.   I love my iPod Photo and am seldom without it.

<Content>I have wanted an iPod for a long time, and was planning on getting the 20gig B&W.  Not that there's anything wrong withthe 20gig version, but for just a few dollars more, you can get the 30gig version.  I have not put any pictures on the iPod, but its nice to know you have the capability of doing so.  I apprecite the color screen, even if it is just for making the music slelection.  The include iTunes software is pretty awesome.  It took a little time to copy almost 300 CD's to my computer, but the iTunes interface between the computer and the iPod always updates the iPod with no hassles.  I have used about 17gog, so, with the 30gig iPod, I will never have to worry about running out of space.  The iPod is also very versatile.  I hav an adaptor to play it through my boom box, and an adaptor to play it through my car's cassette player.  It makes long drives very bearable.  Finally, I like the way the iPod autmatically organizes all of your music, by artist, composer, genre, album, etc......  The shuffle function, and the playlists are also great.  This is one of my best purchases.

<Content>I have a first generation Ipod, and decided it was time to upgrade.  The ability to save photo's without a PC was key.  the Ipod ships with a USB cable.  Now, I have friends using the USB cable with no problem, but, the ipod would not recognize for me (I use a Belkin USB/firewire card).  It would recognize in another PC using Usb 1.1.  In looking at Apple's discussion forums, I wasn't the only one with USB issues.  I went to the Apple store, picked up a Firewire cable, and it worked like a champ.  I wish Apple wouldn't even bundle a cable, and let the user pick up the cable they need.  I now have a USB cable that is useless for me.  Other than that, this thing ROCKS!

<Date>Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>What do you say for one of the most popular products on the planet? You can't but fall in love with it.   I had bought a iPod mini thinking 4GB is all that I want to store my music. With a few hours, I had used up more than 30% of the space! I decided to exchange the mini for a 20 GB iPod ($299). At the store, I saw that you get an extra 10GB and photo-storing/viewing abilities for $50 extra. I don't regret that decision.  There are many credible reviews that compare the features of the flavors of the iPod and I am not going to do that here. This is my first impressions, much like 'Love at first sight'.  Most of us know the iPods to be a MP3 player. The iPod Photo variety isn't as much familiar or advertised. The color screen is extra sweet compared to the B&W regulars. You can transfer your digital photo images to the iPod Photo using the same iTunes software but setting some additional options - it is pretty straight forward. The photos appears delightful on the 2 inch screen. It is a great pleasure to carry around all your photos in your pocket. Next time I visit my grandmother, she can look at all the photos I have without having to use a computer.  The photos can be viewed as a slide show. As with the music, the photos can be displayed in a random order. Different transition effects while switching between photos makes the viewing interesting. Coolest thing is that you can connect the iPod to a TV using an optional Audio/video cable and play as background music one of your playlists.  The color screen makes a lot of difference when you use the other features of the iPod Photo - calendar, contacts, games, etc. With 30 GB space there is plenty to store music and photos and data. I wish all iPods were compatible with earlier versions of USB ports. It comes with earphones, a firewire to USB 2.0 connector and an adapter for charging. The product description gives you a thorough description of the accompanying parts, so I won't re-describe them.   Apart from the A/V cable, you will want to buy a sleeve for the iPod and preferably a scratch protectant for the screen as you will be using the iPod to view your photos quite a bit.  Music and photos to carry along wherever you go - yummy! Now what can we expect more from Apple? An iPod Photo that is a cell phone too and cool like nothing else but an Apple! Just Love it.

<Content>I upgraded to this from the ipod 20gb black and white and the difference is staggering! the recent lowering in prices for IPod technology makes this a price within many peoples budgets. I have filled mine in 2 hours with 11gb of photos and 7gb of music. I also got the Itrip and can broadcast signal throughout the house! amazing. i recomend a good ipod skin cover because the ipod screen scratches as easily as tin foil. protect your investment so that it can be used! bravo apple!

<Title>I-pod more like I-dud
<Date>Mon Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I guess I bought into the hype of the apple I-pod and having had many various MP3 players over the years from creative to i-river I decided to take the plunge. Little did I know this was going to be a big mistake. First of all, I-tunes software is not the gem that many people make it out to be. I could rip my cd's much quicker and with better quality through media player than I-tunes offered. All too often I get skips, pops, hissing and chattering in my music when ripped through I-tunes. Also, the interface is not intuitive at all. I have had it lock up Windows XP on more than one occasion when I have never had any other program do so. Some people claim this is a Microsoft issue with an Apple product, but I do not buy that. Why would HP produce the Ipod under their name if it would not work with PC's? For that matter, what about Apple switching to Intel processors and going towards PC compatibility in OS-X? I bought the 30GB photo version, and now I understand why the 30GB was discontinued for the 20GB and 40GB production. The 30GB has way too many flaws and bugs. The click wheel is a nice feature, but it started sticking in the lower right corner approximately 3 months into having it and then rarely worked except at the other corners at the time I sold it. Sound quality leaves something to be desired. The EQ did not seem to make much of a difference between the modes, I typically just left it off and set my songs before transfer. The worst thing that plagues the I-pod is the battery life. I know I never once got the 14hours life even apple claims. I even set my backlight to turn off after 5 seconds. And what is it with having a batter that is not removable? Apple knows these batteries must be built by the lowest bidder and they fail quickly, so why should we have to pay $69.99 to get them replaced plus shipping and handling? This was a fourth generation I-pod, I mean does apple not listen to the complaints of their customers? Speaking of complaints with the I-pod, check internet forums and see how many people complain about having to reset or update their firmware all the time just to keep it working. I have had the I-pod update software kill my I-pod requiring me to go back to an earlier firmware and then re-install again. I have had to restore the thing at least 4 times, in the process losing every song on the ipod. What is more disappointing is the fact I get a folder displaying an exclamation point on the display every now and then. This usually results in another firmware update which also results in loss of data. After less than two months the hard drive died. Thank god it was inside the 90 day no shipping charge warranty. What a waste of money. Got the refurbished ipod back and two months later I got approximately 10GB of music on it and it decided it would not take any more. Reformatted with the Ipod updater and reinstalled my music and again it would not take any more than 10GB. After running scandisk on the drive I found bad sectors all over the drive. My answer from Apple, I will have to pay 29.95 shipping and handling to return the ipod once again. Sounds like a scam to me. Decided to sell it and now I am looking for another MP3, looking towards the Toshiba Gigabeat or Sony. If you have the opportunity to see the insides of the ipod versus other MP3 players you will realize the low quality control that goes into them. Toshiba manufactures the 1.8mm drives for all of them, and they offer a 3 year warranty for the drives straight from toshiba. Why can apple not extend this same offer onto its customers. Once apple sticks that little apple logo on the drive toshiba claims no warranty. Hope if you do opt to get the I-pod you have better luck, but there are much better options out there.

<Title>Leaves a lot to be desired
<Date>Mon Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I had researched all mp3 players before deciding on iPod. I really like the way it looks, and the storage space is remarkable. However, from the first day I started using it, I've had problems with the software. It makes my computer "freeze" and like others have said, it continuously states "do not disconnect". I have very mixed feelings with this product especially considering the price tag. I hope Apple representatives read these reviews and get to work to fix the problems that a lot of people are encountering. C'mon Apple, you can do it! I do not recommend buying this product.

<Title>Why is it not compatible with macs?!
<Date>Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this ipod after ruining another one by letting it fall, so this time i took care of it, bought a $40 apple case for it and never even left it in the car because i was afraid of the heat screwing it up. The thing is, every once in a while when i connected it to my computer (i own a G4 mac with OSX) it would get jammed and i forcefully had to remove it without ejecting it first; as the months passed, it started getting frozen while i was listening music. Now it's dead and apple says the hard drive is damaged and i might as well buy another one. Hell, I am never buying an ipod again. I guess not everyone gets the mp3 player ipod dream of the commercials. Apple: You suck! Start making compatible devices with your own hardware!

<Title>Good if you're an Apple Customer I guess
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just recently received this 30GB M9829LL/A and were very happy with the color and its navigation. Everything is plain and simple to use. I had a some difficulty playing videos after converting them to MP4 formats, but after a few attempts and messing with the settings, the thing finally worked. The big catch is you may have buy some software such as Quicktime Pro to convert your MPEG videos and any other format you might have under windows into an apple format that only iTunes can read and of course apple's Quicktime. And if you would rather not buy Quicktime pro then you can always purchase your music or videos from Apple's iTunes.    Apple is obviously trying to take some of Window's customers by making it difficult to use Window's files on its products. However because the use of MP3's is used so worldwide, it would be difficult to sale their iPods if we were also forced to buy software to convert MP3s as well. Apple can easily make their products capable of playing MPEGs as well yet they don't just so they can take a chunk of WINDOWS' customers profits.    So if you are an Apple customer, then you may not be as bothered and this is the product for you. However if you're a Windows customer then,,,, its up to you if you are willing to. As far as the quality, it hasnt let me down, yet.

<Title>Buyer beware: Don't buy this product without extended warranty
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The 40GB click wheel iPod I bought for my husband for Christmas last year died (hard drive fried) 360 days after he opened the box but one year and 3 weeks past when I bought it.  Appeals to an Apple Store and the "Apple Cares" (how's that for an oxymoron?) phone line fell on deaf ears.  They were unwilling to make any exception or provide discounts on a replacement, "...our warranty clearly states...from the date of purchase...".  So, in all caps, if you must buy an iPod, BUYER BEWARE! Think of this as a disposable purchase that will only last as long as the warranty.

<Title>Screen cracked in less than a month
<Date>Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My daughter got this for Christmas and the screen cracked after one month.  It wasn't dropped, or damaged in any way.  I called Apple & they basically told me it was our fault and too bad.  I won't buy any Apple product again.  That's the quickest $300 I've ever wasted.  Buyer beware!

<Title>shoddy materials used to get that look - buyers should read
<Date>Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My teenaged son took his hard earned $$ and bought an iPod video. He ordered it from MacMall on Jan 1, 2006. In about 20 days, with the iPod being used in a case, the iPod frontface was sratched severely -- dirt got under the case. In addition, the LCD has a blurred sweep scratch across it from being in my son's pocket.  We were not expecting this kind of wear in 20 days for something that cost him (with accessories) $400.00. I think that the front plastic material is shoddy and is not suited to normal use by a teen.  Calls to Apple were long and frustrating. No one wanted to talk to me (I was being firm, but reasonable). I was sent from Tech Support to Sales to Tech Support and finally landed with a support person from "The iPod Team." The same answer -- "There's nothing we can do." Calls to MacMall made us vow not to ever order there again. There is a "no return" policy.  I now know that we should have wrapped this precious baby up in all the 3rd party stuff that they make to protect it, but I had no idea that normal use in 20 days would render it looking like my son had owned it for a year and had rolled down a huge pile of dirt & rocks with it clipped to his belt.  AT A MINIMUM, Apple should package the iPods with all the screen and protectors that will make it last. They could put a note in their packaging saying that if you don't use these materials to protect the shoddy casing, it WILL look like a piece of crap in a matter of days and it can't be returned.  Live and learn. There are a lot of other good players out there for a fraction of the cost of the iPod. But, alas, we couldn't convince my son to choose a less sleek and fragile player. Perhaps he has learned a $400.00 lesson so it's not the end of the world.  Any potential buyers out there -- get a good case with a hard plastic square to fit over the LCD screen. And, DO get the film as well because dirt can get under the aforementioned items and wreak havoc. This double protection approach should keep your iPod *relatively* scratch-free.

<Title>Works ok(sometimes) but itunes is terrible
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Ive got the Ipod for about 7 months now.  Havent had any major problems, but a lot of minor ones.  The menu button stops working whenever it pleases and works again spontaneously(after a while though).  There have been a couple of times that i just cant turn it off.(of course the hold switch was disabled) no matter what I do.  And for the worse part......... Itunes.  I cant beleive Apple hasnt come up with a windows explorer type of interphase or anything easier than Itunes.  Adding or removing songs is a hassle, not to mention that if you make a mistake in adding files or folders to your library youll end up with thousands of repeated songs.    The Ipod does what its supposed to do but it is definetely not the easiest most intuitive piece of hardware out there.

<Title>iPod - Great toy - Horrible customer service/support
<Date>Tue Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The iPod is cool but ours ... as we've found has happened to many other owners ... went on the fritz and our nightmare began. Apple's customer service is the worst CS that we've ever experienced regardless of the product or service supported. I could write for days about the awful experience but I've wasted so much time with them already ... I can't bear to waste more. The most notable point is that the iPod CS folks repeatedly stated that iPods are more or less disposable, commodity items and "breakdowns" were common. Wow!! .. $400 Bucks of throw away!?!?!? We still haven't recieved the return box for replacement/repair after several days even though it was promised in 24-48 hours. We also own an MP3 player that we refer to as a "Dell-Pod" from Dell Computer and have had to use their customer service as well. Dell's CS support was awesome. Based on our experience with Apple/iPod CS support ... this is the first and LAST Apple product that will be owned in our household.

<Title>BUYER BEWARE: these don't last after the arranty expires...
<Date>Wed Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My iPod 40GB died within TWO MONTHS of its initial use as Christmas present.  The hard drive quit working and just makes little clicking sounds.    My husband's 20GB iPod died within SIX months of purchase.  His locks up his computer and won't hold files or play music.  He has been sent to "email support" but reformatting the hard drive and reinstalling the operating system hasn't helped, so we don't expect much good from that.   Our father in law went through 3 iPods within a year.  Similar issues.    These are lovely and useful devices, but TERRIBLE PRODUCT RELIABILITY.  None of us used the product while jogging or doing anything else strenuous to the devices.    Two of these iPods were refurbished by HP.  That was a terrible product support experience, too.   A tech industry insider suggested that we replace our iPods with the disposable Shuffle - not much functionality, but at least it's just $100 down the drain every year or so -- rather than $200 to $500!  We'll also look into the extended warranty... unless we switch away from Apple entirely and re-scan our entire music inventory.  (Another recommendation:  don't use the Apple proprietary music format in case you experience what we did and don't want to give Apple a second chance afterward.  Buyer beware.  These are disposable devices.  Handle like glass and don't expect them to last.
