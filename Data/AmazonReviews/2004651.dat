<Content>Works great but one problem. The manufacturer forgot to add a charger. You need to keep replacing the battery.

<Title>Amazing little device
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've used this device for about 2 weeks now and so far it has been wonderful. Sound quality is excellent, FM tuner works extremely well, and the storage capacity (1GB) was exactly what I needed. And I must also say that it is a beautiful looking piece of electronics.   When deciding to buy this player, I was concerned by some of the reviews that say it is unreliable. I figured that getting all these features for 30 bucks was worth a shot. So far I have been extremely pleased, but if I do have any problems with this player I will be sure to update this review.

<Title>Junk
<Date>Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this product just a little over 3 weeks ago and it has already given me problems. One of the selector buttons doesn't always respond and I don't think it worth the time or money to send back to get this reoccuring problem fixed. I don't recommend this product to anyone.

<Title>A good buy for pennies
<Date>Sat Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>With the 1 GB memory capacity of my Coby MP3 player I've had just enough to put all my favorites songs and play them over and over. The size of this MP3 player is such that it is quite easy to hide it away, in case you want to enjoy it while attending important ceremonies. And if you want more variety, you can always put your favorite radio station on it. You can also record your own messages to use it as the best way to help you remember things you may otherwise forget (such as getting milk on your way home).

<Title>Difficult to navigate
<Date>Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I liked the compact size, easy download capability, the 2G memory and the price however it was difficult to store and then retrieve the files once they were on the device.  Obvious you lose some functionality when you pay less than $30 for a storage device.  All the files need to be set up before you download the them, i.e. playlists, favorites, etc. becuase once the items are stored it is not 'one button' friendly to scroll through the stored files.  I have a Toshiba Gigabeat and love the ease of use, simple buttons located conveniently when walking or running and even driving.  I bought the Coby as a gift for my sweetie who is a runner. I know we will be replacing the Coby for a device that is easy to use in the near future and use this as a data memory stick only and not for music.  If you don't mind spending hours trying to figure this out and don't want to scroll through music files while being active, it would be a great buy.  Also, managing your files requires you to have ready access to a computer since you can't sort once files are stored on the device.

<Title>For the Price - Great

<Content>Menus area  little tricky, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.  Music sounds GREAT, even with a radio converter for the car, and I'm pretty familiar with audio systems.  For the price, it can't be beat.  Highly Recommended.

<Title>Slick, small and infinitely capable
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Allow me to explain my experience with this style of MP3 players: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PQQ9U/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5192814-2842307">Mac Vision MA833A 128 MB MP3 Player</a> This was my first MP3 player, the Macvision 256mb. Slick, black and small, this simple little device lasted me three whole years and would still be alive and kicking if I hadn't dropped it off of my rooftop one too many times. A remarkable piece of technology, it simply played MP3's, easily and without fuss. The transfer system was simple and easy to navigate, and the player worked through rain, snow, being stepped upon and drowned in water.  After that finally gave up the ghost, and believe me it took a looong time, I picked up this:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EG5UAK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5192814-2842307">Nextar MA933A-B 128 MB Digital MP3 Player (Blue)</a> The Nextar 512mb 'blue' This was not up to par with its predecessor, despite being of the same design, just manufactured by a different company, this device was inferior in many ways. Nextar re-designed the device's program and tranfer capability, forcing you to use Windows Media to sync your files, and they would appear in no particular order, and you had no control over where they ended up in relation to the other files. This MP3 player was definitely not as sturdy as the original, it broke within two weeks after I pressed the play button a tad bit harder than it was apparently made for. So, frustrated, I bought this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BWZGIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5192814-2842307">COBY MP3 Player with 256 MB Flash Memory & USB Drive</a> Coby had finally gotten the patents to this design, so I hoped things would improve. This little device was certainly a bit hardier than its predecessor, and it survived for some time, but its program was just as frustrating as the last one, once again forcing you to sync with Windows Media and randomizing your files on you. The glass screen was very fragile and broke within the first month I owned it, making it difficult to see the text. So, finally after putting up with it for a while, I succumbed to trying out yet another of these devices. I bought this, the Coby C885 1GB MP3 player.  Hallelujah!  This device not only stronger and more durable than the nextar or earlier coby model, also allowed you to return its program to the original Macvision style, allowing me to finally order my files the way I wanted! I have had this now for about three weeks, and it has served me well. The buttons take a little while to adjust to, but after you do, its smooth sailing. Its as if I have my old Macvision back, with an upgrade in style and funcion! If you're looking for something sleek and simple, without paying out the big bucks go for this!

<Title>Just what I needed
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just wanted something small and able to hold just enough music for gym time.  I use the FM radio option a lot also.  However within the first week I received this item, it developed a little invisible line through the words on the screen.  Maybe I dropped it or it got bumped in my backpack.

<Title>Nice product at a good price point.
<Date>Sun Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought as a gift for my daughter.  she loves it!  Easy to use, nice geatures and a good price point too! Prayers of Meditation  Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

<Title>Multiple non-functioning items
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We ordered 2 of these and had to send one back as it didn't work.  Ordered a replacement and had to send it back - same problem. Item comes with a special sheet in the box stating "before returning call customer service" so I think they know there's a problem.  Called customer service before returning the 2nd one - they were clueless and not helpful. The one that works is cute, but we have 1 twin boy not happy about not receiving his. Disappointing. Amazon should discontinue offering this product.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NREQFK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-5192814-2842307">Coby MP-C885 1 GB Flash MP3 Player with FM Tuner and Direct USB Drive (Black)</a>

<Title>Not an 1GB MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>One of my friend got this Coby 1GB MP3 player, the package and the player did say that it is a 1 GB player. But in the system it showed the total capacity as 459 MB. Everyone knows that the capacity displayed is little less but not as much as >500 MB. We tried formatting the drive and making it fresh, but of no use. There are no CDs, softwares, tools provided to diagnose the player.   We tried calling up the number in the package which said "Call this Number before considering returning the product" !! The person on the other side could not understand our problem, he kept telling us (threatening) about where we got our MP3s, DRM stuff. CRAZY !! Seems like he was reading from the papers provided to him. Useless Customer Service. They said it, we returned the product that very moment.  Do not buy anything Coby. There are better MP3 players that are worth the buck you pay for.

<Content>This is a great little product for the price.  It has an FM radio reciever as well s the mp3/WMA player.  Most IPods will not play WMA files so in my opinion this is better than an IPod. It also records voice and stores data files.  Now if you are looking for all kinds of bells & whistles go with the Ipod but if not you can get a good buy for the money with this product.
