<Content>I bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas and he hasn't stopped using it yet.  He has all his favorite cd's downloaded on it and it holds more than 30 songs like someone stated before on another one of these reviews.  He has 5 full cd's with 13 songs on each one plus others from other cds.  We will be purchasing one for our 5 year olds birthday coming up because he has learned how to use this one so quickly.  Great introduction mp3 player for kids.  
<Overall>5
