<Title>A fantastic Player - 1 year ago
<Date>Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I purchased my zen over a year ago I thought it was the greatest thing out there. It had so much potential and the abilities is had were up there with the best.... and then Creative pretty much abandoned the product. There hasn't been a firmware upgrade in over a year, all the accessories that were supposed to come out never did. (No Docking station, no case, etc.) The problems with the interface that were promised to be fixed weren't and the product has just slowly become obsolete.  I would look at some of the other players out there before purchasing this player and at least look to a product that is being supported and not just being sold.

<Title>THE BEST MULTIMEDIA PLAYER SO FAR!
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this product for a year now and I have to say I am extremely satisfied.  It performed all the features flawlessly and then some.  I even dropped this player couple of time but had no malfunction or problem.  This is even better than iPod when it comes to ease of use and features.  I'm glad I chose this instead of iCrap.  The best feature about this product is when I get tired of looking at small screen I could hook it up to TV & watch how cool is that.  Hopefully creative will come up with thinner version of this in future.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHBZHC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6838194-5494265">Creative Zen Vision W 60 GB Widescreen Multimedia Player (Black)</a>

<Title>Will never own an Apple product again, EVER!
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Until you try a player like the Zen Vision W, you don't really realize how much of a garbage product the Ipod is. OMG! The only thing that the iPod has going for it is design and size, that's it!  About the Zen - I discovered on my own that you don't need Windows Media Player, Winamp or the included software to sort out your music. You open it as a hard drive, all your folders are listed in there, just drop your MP3s in there and start listening. There's no renaming like in the Ipod, no moving, scrambling, no third party software, nothing. It is a portable hard drive, so you use it as one. No, I tunes, no account set up, no restrictions on how many computers you can hook up your device to, full freedom to use it as you please. You take out and you ad music when you want and share it with whoever you want. As simple as it gets. Video? Awesome. Had some movies on my hard drive sitting around, just opened the movie folder in the Vision W and pasted them in there, all play perfect. Didn't have to resize, compress, nothing. Everything about this player is well though out. You can tell that they put some effort into it to make it easy to use. The battery? Detachable! When it wears out, you take it out and put a new one in. No need to send it in to Apple to have them open your device to change it for you and charge you an arm and a leg for it. Another thing about the battery is that it lasts. I charged it last night, started using it this morning at 7:30Am It is 2 pm right now and the battery is full!!! If this was an Ipod, it'd be at 50% if that. It has a speaker so you don't HAVE to have earphones to listen to it, it has radio as well. You have a Digital SLR camera with a CF card? Use it to back up your pictures with the CF slot built into the Vision W. What more can I say. It is large compared to the iPod, yes but so is the screen. I just can't believe I ever purchased an iPod when there are devices available out there that make so much more sense. Never an Apple product AGAIN!

<Title>We Love Them!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My husband and I bought each other these for Christmas...They are great!  Lots of storage (I've got ALL of our digital pics on mine), plus we've moved various tv shows we've recorded to them to have them portable for viewing (either in bed, in the car, etc.).  The jack it comes with knows if it's connecting to a tv (and therefore sends video) or a stereo (and therefore just sends audio), and the sound through real speakers is awesome.  (The sound through the built in speaker leaves something to be desired, but even computer speakers work well.)  Friends of ours have already said that when the next version comes out, they are sure we will get new ones and our boys will get these...  Louise

<Title>Beats IPOD Hands Down!
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I own an IPOD and it is a good unit once you get by the ACC file conversions. However, if you are looking for great video and music with a picture that you don't have to magnify to watch then the Zen is for you. It will do just about any thing you want to. The size of the unit is a little big but then I am not running with the unit. It has a removable battery which is great too. If you have a really good ear I would recommend a BOSE headset instead of the ear buds.

<Title>Excellent fix for the media addict
<Date>Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, why don't places like Best Buy and Circuit City sell more goodies like this?.. This product is superb... excellent compatability as media player, or as removable hard drive, and the OS is set up quite nicely. Great battery life, and I truly was impressed with the clarity of the screen when watching higher-resolution videos.   The size may deter some folks away, but this thing fits in my inner jacket pocket, so there shouldn't be any troubles keeping comfortably at-hand while flying, etc.   One last thing that impressed me is Creative's extra effort to increase compatibility... When you upload a non-compatible video to your ipod, you are out of luck. Buy the software for conversions, and you might get lucky. With Creative, however, any incompatible format will be converted automatically when you try to upload it to the Zen W.   I have a total of 7 mp3 players and/or media players, and I couldn't have asked for anything more in my newest toy, the Creative Zen W. Thanks for such an excellent product!

<Content>The Zen Vision W fulfills every need for a portable entertainment device.  If battery life was just a little longer it would be perfect. I know others might criticize the size and weight,but how else are you going to have decent sized wide screen?  The device has to be at least as big as the screen.  If you want small then buy a smaller device.  Beautiful!

<Title>A Zen a day keeps the Apple away ! ! !
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Well our household purchased 2 Zen Vision W's for Christmas 2006. To date we have been extremely happy with this multi media machine. The screen, colour, clarity has NO equal. The storage of musical tracks is awesome and so many playback features that are really, really cool. The computer software interface is very user friendly and ables you to set up everything within minutes, easy editing makes this a ongoing delight to work with. The only negatives would be the lack of accessories currently available but some research at creative, ebay and other sites things slowly coming on strong. I read hundreds of reviews before purchasing this product, I sampled and looked at the competition  - Hmmm there is none that packs so much into one extremely versatile machine. Top marks Creative, thank-you for an awesome Christmas and beyond!

<Title>The Creative Zen Vision W  Is Incredible!
<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Let me first say that I am so glad that I did not go the IPOD route because of it's MANY limitations.  This player is amazing.  It will take SO many different types of music or video files which makes it far superior to IPOD.   Screen clarity is great for videos, love the EQ options and the ability to customize your own.  I have the 60GB Zen W model(it's been out about 3 months now) which has currently about 2000 songs and close to 125 hrs of vidoe on it, and I still have 20 gigs to go.  Have fun filling it up, it's taken me almost 3 weeks of nonstop work.  Rips a song in about 20 secs from CD, and a 2 hr video in 90 secs (using Video Vault after conversion for Vids).   I bought the wireless remote, and the buttons vs. touch pad is no big deal.  Earbuds are good but I upgraded to Creative's $99 in ear phones which are AWESOME (I also have Shure's comparible in ear model and Creative's is far superior).  I also purchased a spare battery which is easily interchangeable and relatively cheap. Avg batt life so far is about 2 1/2 hrs for video, and who knows for audio b/c I've let it play all day on audio w/ a full charge and it didn't die, however that is with the switch in lock mode which turns off the screen. Player charges with USB cable (included) or AC adapter (included).   The out options are incredible, I can hook it to any TV or projector and surprisingly the picture is pretty good using full screen mode. (3 way Cable is included)  It also has an external speaker which works pretty good.  When it comes to you it has a protective plastic over the screen DO NOT THROW IT AWAY it keeps your screen from scratching and works well. (A replacement costs about 14 bucks)  So what are the cons?    1.  It doesn't handle static well and rebuilds the drive every time you pop it so I recommend purchasing the SKIN which is made of silicone from Creative it totally eliminates static and is great for protecting your player from accidental drops.    2.  It is pretty big so don't look to use it on your person while aggressively excercising (just for walking)  It does however fit in a suit coat inner pocket with SKIN on and in it's velvet pouch (included).  3.  It doesn't have all of the IPOD gimmick options yet (it's not been out long and Creative assures that more options are coming)but for around $25 you can purchase a Belkin FM digital transmitter which will allow you to listen to it anywhere that has FM. (GREAT OPTION)  So far that's all I find, mabye because I'm very pleased.  Overall, it's durable, well made, and very easy to use even if you are somewhat computer illiterate.  Again let me stress that IPODS confine you to Itunes or Ivideo.  If you want freedom buy this player, you won't be sorry! And if a larger video screen is important to you the Zen Vision W is the player for you.  It is worth every dime I paid for it, and more!!

<Date>Thu Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my first portable media techno gadget. My spouse offered to buy me an ipod for Christmas, but after reading the review of this in Wired and the on-line reviews of the Vision W, I begged for this instead.  So glad I did.  It is as nice as the reviews state it is. It is easy to use if you have basic knowledge of file transfer and the picture clarity is unbelievable.  I purchased the max. memory storage with visions of using it for movie watching, listening to audio books and music during travel. I certainly would recommend this product if you want to go beyond just MP3 files without taking more equipment with you!

<Title>Zen Vision W 60
<Date>Fri Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received the Zen Vision W 60 a little over a month ago.  It took me awhile to figure out how to download music (the best format) and movies because I am not savvy in this area.  Trying to find and download movies in a safe manner was especially challenging for me.  But once I figured everything out, I downloaded music, pictures and movies like crazy.  The Creative Media Source Organizer and Zen Vision W Media Explorer made ripping and organizing easy.  Creative also provides hundreds of free Zen Cast (pod cast) downloads.  The picture quality is fantastic.  The navigation buttons situated on the right side of the unit were easier to use than I anticipated.  Although, I think I still like iPOD's navigation method better.  It is loaded with features and came supplied with almost everything I need.  I appreciate that the battery is replaceable and that the unit supports downloads in several formats.  I did experience static in the earphones supplied with the unit so I contacted Creative and they quickly sent me a new pair.  I also found the unit to be a bit large to carry but I manage to fit it in the glove/mp3 pocket of my fleece jacket.  I would not recommend it for use during vigorous activity.  If you want a unit loaded with features and a large, sharp picture, I would not let the size turn you away.  Overall, I recommend this product.

<Content>What an excellent device.  I can't believe I have waited this long to purchase this media player.  I have been using a 60 GB video iPod for the past year and this thing blows it out of the water.  The screen is crisp, bright and gorgeous.    Pros: Screen Sound Screen Ease of use Screen Ease of loading music and videos Battery Life Standard USB 2.0 cable to sync CF Card reader  Cons: Size, but it's understandable....The screen makes up for the size. Very little accessories (Hard to find a good case)   I will never go back to Apple.  Unless they have a touchscreen 16:9 80gb with a CF reader.

<Content>This player is a great player. It plays most formats that are common available and has a large memory so you can store all your music and pictures  and some video. The software is pretty good too. Great color screen and compatible with your TiVoToGo feature. It's screen is so good looking it shows the lack of compression in certain video features (like TiVo). Bulky to use as just an MP3 player but fantastic sounding too with my Sennheiser PX-100. Try higher compression for best sound. Don't worry you have the memory room for it.

<Title>Love the big screen & features!
<Date>Wed Aug 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had this player for about a month, and am really enjoying it. I was in a store recently looking at other brands, and after seeing the tiny screens on other brands, I was so glad I'd splurged & bought the widescreen Creative--players with smaller screens look puny in comparison. Yes, it's expensive & bigger in size, but it is still very portable. My previous MP3 players have all been Creative brand, and I'm also very happy with this one. Software is easy to use and I've easily transferred my music files onto it. It's also easy to transfer home videos taken with a digital camera onto the player, since the player accepts many formats. My only suggestion for improvement would be bigger selection buttons on the player, nevertheless I prefer the buttons to the hypersensitive touch pad on Creative's previous MP3 player. Battery life is great, but I'm still keeping my old Creative MP3 player for playing music (it has a very long battery life for music). I'm using this one just to play video. Please be aware that you may need some sort of video conversion software if your home movies aren't in a format the player accepts.

<Title>Great Digital Media Player, but need improvement
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great digital media player, particularly if you connect it with your home entertainment center.  The big hard-drive makes it possible to keep all your music and picture on this device.  Also love the screen: high quality.  If you are like me, who hates anything proprietary, like Apple's family of media players, i.e., the iPod, then Zen is a great alternative.  Some shortcomings: 1) Once you connect to A/V out, the screen blanks out.  This means you have to connect this to a TV/Monitor, to navigate the menu.  If you only want to connect to your stereo, you can only use the headphone jack.  The output from this jack noticeably produce an inferior sound, probably because the headphone jack is subject to the volume control--I am not an electronics expert, so I don't know if this is the cause.  But it seems that this problem can easily be resolved if the screen stays on when you connect through A/V output.  2) Infra-red remote does not work on power on when the player has been turned off for overnight.  This seems silly, as you wouldn't expect to have to walk over to push the power button on your TV the next day, so why shouldn't I be able to turn on the Zen using the remote control.  3) The video format support is very limitted.  It does not support the latest DivX format.  I e-mailed Zen.  They have no plan to release a firmware to support DivX 6.0.  Also, even a lot of windows media video files have to go through lengthy conversion (longer than the video itself) before they can be synced to the player.

<Title>Great product, just hate wasting time converting.
<Date>Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved using this product, especially the fact that I can plug this into the TV and watch movies, listen to music, and view photos. I just hate the fact that not all video files are acceptable and need to be converted.  AVI files are said to be supported, but I had to convert most of my AVI files via Creative Zen converter. It took me at least 8hrs per file because I wanted the files converted to the best possible quality. Thats about 3 files a day! After a week and a half of conversion, I had 15 gigs of space left.  So WARNING to all you people who are looking at multimedia players, if you dont mind waiting for your files to be converted, this is a Great media Player.  Battery life is good, video quality is great, and its definately portable and could be plugged into TV whereever you want to take your media.

<Title>Complete music and photo library to go
<Date>Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this Zen to carry my entire music library so I wouldn't have to decide what to put on a smaller mp3 player. It also has every photo I've ever taken and the hard drive is only half full. Of course, I can't put the video library on there. That would take terabytes. It's nice to be able to show photos to the grandparents and they can pick and choose what to copy onto their computer. The compact flash slot is great for dumping camera cards when they are full, and the screen is big enough to actually see which photos are worth keeping and which to delete. I also bought the CF adaptor to plug in the XD cards from my Fuji camera. Works great. The FM radio was also a deciding factor in this purchase, although 32 presets is overkill. I haven't tried syncing the organizer with Outlook yet.

<Title>not happy
<Date>Fri Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>sure this product is great for storing tons of music files plus photos and even a few video files and when it is working it really works well.  However, this product is not everyday life friendly.  I droped this thing once and the screen broke which of course it to be expected (that can be fixed) but the short fall also totally killed the hard drive and now I have 400 bucks worth of junk.  My next thought was well I have a 1 year warranty so lets contact creative. Not so easy, it took me quite some to to find a number for customer service and when I did they basically told me that my 1 year warranty was worth as much as my 400 dollar piece of junk.  I would have to pay another 266 bucks to get a referbished one.  My opinion would be to consider all other models before settling with this one. and if you are a busy mom, dad or normal human being this product is not for you it does not hold up to ware and tear.  I have had several other mp3 players that have gone through a lot worse and are still ticking.

<Title>Great video capability, but not as good as the Nomad for Music
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I use this player for my Jazzercise class. It sits on a table, connected to a PA system. I bought it, because my Nomad was stolen.  There are virtually no instructions with this player on how to use the software. If you've used Creative Mediasource Organizer before, you will have come to appreciate the ease of just dragging and dropping songs from your library to your player and/or into playlists. The new version of CMO that comes with this player won't let you do that. You have to slowly transfer everything. It didn't work for me until I contacted customer support several times. The program response is annoyingly slow, and it freezes up a lot. My computer is not the problem, since all other programs run fine. All in all I would say that once you know how to use the software this player works fine. I like that it has a speaker and the sound is very good. My daughter enjoys watching movies on it, which has been a life saver a few times already. Don't expect convenience and ease as with a Nomad, though. If it had that, this would be the most awesome MP3 player around. Maybe it is anyway, but the software to run it lacks, and that's why it only got 4 stars.

<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have used this player for 6 months now, mainly for commuting on the bus but I've also used it to output to a TV and also on flights.  It's a pretty player, and fits my needs perfectly.  I mostly use it to watch videos, but also listen to podcasts.  The video playback is great, I have no complaints about the picture.  I can't speak to the FM tuner or picture gallery because I don't use those.  Pros: -Big hard drive, I haven't had any space issues, I got the 60 GB version -Plays a large number of formats flawlessly -Intuitive user interface, I never read the directions and haven't had any problems. -Output to TV works very well -Good battery life  Cons: -Kinda heavy, doesn't bother wme but my wife can't/won't hold it up for very long -Can't bookmark video, it keeps the place of the last video you watched, but can be annoying if you watch many videos not in succession.  You can bookmark audio though. -No remote -Software can't convert all formats, and doesn't provide helpful error messages  All in all, I'd definitely recomend it if you don't mind the heavier unit.  Fits well in my shirt pockets while walking to/from the bus stop.  Pick up an extra battery for long flights, I get around 5 hours of video playback if I turn the lock on while watching.

<Content>Screen size is just right.  Really like the wide screen.  Movies and Pictures are sharp and crisp.  Audio is really nice with unexpected bass depth.  Not 5k to 25k but still good sound.  Navigation is smooth and easy.  Just wish it had the ability to use eBooks in .lit format.

<Title>It is AMAZING, it is THICK, and it is LINUX compatible!
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this media player.  It does everything I need and want it to do.  I mostly listen to music in my car and most of the time I'm listening to my Sirius Radio.  I plug in the Zen when I want to listen to something specific or to podcasts in my car.   I play the guitar and when I get music instruction CDs or DVDs I use this player to capture them so I can take my lessons with me. I mostly purchased this over the regular Zen Vision M because I wanted it for movies. The larger screen is great.  I was showing video clips to family and it was easy for everyone to see the screen.  You can also connect this player to an external video source which nice if you want to share.  I run linux on my laptop and I am able to manage my media on this player using libmtp, libnjb, and gnomad.  I've had this player since before Christmas 2006.  The only things I don't like about this player is that it is very thick and is not comfortably controlled by one hand.  I almost wish I had gotten the Vision M just because of the difference in navigation (the large screen won though). It only comes with a thin draw string case.  As expensive as this thing is you think that it would come with better protection. Most cases for the Nintendo DS will fit this player.  The screen guards for the Sony PS2 will fit the screen.

<Title>Needs some work.
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player itself is absolutely amazing.  Easily the top PMP out there as far as design and function.  It's no wonder Apple copied Creative's navigation system for their iPod (and was subsequently sued)- it's pure genious.  Where this player (and all Creative players, from what I've read) fails is in connectivity.  Do a search on Creative's website forums for the word "freeze" and you'll be bombarded by hundreds of complaints about media players freezing up when connected to a computer via USB (the only way you can get media onto it).  As other reviewers here have said, make sure you're somewhat computer savvy or be prepared to spend hours learning about USB, Firmware, Windows Service Packs, and more just to get this player to function properly.  It's really a shame, because the player itself is just gorgeous.  I'm returning this player and sitting out of the PMP market for a while. I'll watch Creative's website and message boards for the next generation of players that they put out and hope that they can get their act together next time around.

<Title>Sublime Media Player
<Date>Fri Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned Creative MP3 players for about 7 years now, and they haven't been without their flaws.  Typically, Creative has put out solid technology that outperforms Apple's ipods for less money.  Heck, even the ipod's scroll wheel technology was "stolen" from Creative if you believe the lawsuits.  The rather ironic downside is that most creative MP3 players have featured terrible controls and touch pads, making navigation a chore.  Thankfully, the  Vision W features a clickable button, not unlike a gamepad.  Navigation is easy and precise, though those with huge hands may have a problem with the little buttons.  The sound and storage are terrific (especially for the money), and the visual capabilities put just about everything to shame, including the PSP.  The screen is vibrant and high-resolution, and the high storage capacity means that entire DVDs can be watched uncompressed, if you should so desire.  The FM tuner is a huge plus, as is the recording option.  The only downside is that the thing is large, though not so unwieldy that you can't take it with you.  It is still smaller than a PSP.  Battery life has always been one of creative's strong suits, and it doesn't disappoint here, either.  Another plus (and advantage over Apple) is the WIDE range of audiovisual formats supported.  I highly recommend this unit.

<Title>Creative Delivers!
<Date>Sat Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I easily spent 20 hours researching the various PMP's and MP3 players on the market. I had printed out lists of attributes and capabilities. I started with what I needed and worked my way into everything I wanted as well. It very quickly became apparent that the product to satisfy my needs and wants was the Zen Vision W. I use the unit primarily for my business to record meetings, and to play video taken by my camera. (I conduct mock disasters for various companies) Immediately upon receiving this unit; I transferred all my music, pictures, podcasts, and home videos onto it; AND set aside several gigabytes for hard-drive storage and I still have half the memory capability available. All the software came with the unit; and once it was installed; the transfer was so easy - I wish all programs were this simple (even if you just scan the instructions, instead of spending two hours poring over them!).  I used the unit to record a teleconference and later used it to transcribe the conversation into a report. I found you can "bookmark" where you last left off; instead of having to scroll through the whole menu again. (When you shut the unit off; whatever you were playing is the first thing to come back up - nice!) There was a full ten hours of recording time available; and thankfully I only needed to use one hour. But the units built-in microphone picked up even the most quiet parts of the conversation. There are so many nice features - you can use your favorite photo for a background; you can change how quickly the screen goes into energy saving mode and the screen brightness; you can synchronize your calendar onto the unit very simply; for someone who has big hands, I have yet to find the interface button size a problem; very long battery life for playing audio files and viewing photos; if you are scrolling through the unit and stop, the unit will automatically go back to the file you were playing/viewing; the unit will shut-off automatically after a few minutes if you have it on pause, but starts in the same place when you turn the unit back on; and the transfer of media is really quick and easy! With a stretch, you could consider the following to be cons: To view MP4 videos I had to download Quicktime 7, and then all the MP4's had to be converted (the conversion and transfer was quick, however). To download DVD's onto the unit, you need to use another piece of software (vault360 for PMP's is what I use; I'm still using the evaluation software and so far it works okay; but it does take awhile). There was one review that said you needed to compress the video first; I don't know about that, but what you get is a much bigger file as DVD's have all the special features, titling, and subtitles etc. You can use DVD Shrink freeware to compress the video. Overall; this unit has been WELL worth the price and the research put into it. I use it all the time and love it. No problems with the unit what-so-ever!

<Content>This is my 3rd creative mp3 player, first multimedia player and this one is perfect. It's larger than most MP3 players but for video it's the perfect size, anything smaller for video would be a waste. Video quality is awesome, movies and video podcasts look great.  I have about 1500 songs and 2500 photos and various movies and video podcasts and I still have about 40gb left.  They only thing they could improve would be to make is thinner.  If your looking for a multimedia player stop looking because you found it.

<Title>An awesome player, worth it for me
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've read review after review on Amazon and other web sites selling the Creative Zen Vision W.  I looked at the 30GB but I wanted more space.  I was thinking about the 80GB iPod but I really didn't want to be tied to iTunes.  Although I think the 80GB iPod would have been a little smaller in size than this player, I couldn't see spending just as much money or more for less functionality.  The video on this is awesome.  Like others mentioned, it will convert the files, if need be, to a format that will work on the Vision W.  The photos are shown awesomely as well.  You can rotate on the player any pictures that need be for whatever reason which is a plus.  The small external speaker on the Vision W is adequate in places that are not overwhelmed with other audible sounds although I did not buy this to be a stand alone "boom box" of a sort.  The sound quality with the factory ear bud is quite good.  For those that complain, c'mon, did you really buy any MP3 player to get that Bose-quality sound?  The drawback to this baby is its size.  It's not overly huge but it's definitely bigger than I would have like but I believe the 80GB iPod would not have been a "jogger's player" either.  Luckily for me, I don't jog.  I cycle and this is just fine to carry in a backpack or a pack of some kind on the handle bars or a pocket of a pair of shorts.  The size is about the same as the PSP but it's not too heavy.  If they could come up with a large capacity (60+) MP3 player that is the size of the 4GB nano, I would buy it in a heartbeat whether it was Apple or Creative.  I haven't tested out the compact flash slot yet but it was another reason why I purchased this player as I am a amateur (sort of) photographer and this would be convenient to dump photos without a computer.  The FM player and voice recorder are a plus but not a big reason of why I bought it.  Again, nice features but if I wanted to listen to radio, I would by a walkman.  Anyway, if you want a large-capacity MP3 player and don't need it for listening to while jogging, this is definitely a worthy purchase. I've had mine for about three weeks and have enjoyed every minute of it so far.

<Title>Excellent Player...
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I also read reviews on this and CNET.  I travel 80% of the month and wanted something that I could not only listen to music, watch movies but also show technique videos.  I originally bought the M but the screen was very nice but to small.  So I went with the W.  I have had it for 4 weeks now and love it.  The only negatives I have are: -The size -The ability to manage the files on the unit via the PC (can create folders but not move items into it easily)  If you can get over the size of the unit than the W is awesome.  I just got back from a Jacksonville to San Diego trip and I watched 2 movies and 2 episodes of 24.    If you are going to buy one I would suggest buying the following: -Extended Battery -MisticAudio Case with stand (works great) -Wireless Headset (have not found one I like yet)  I am still researching wireless headsets but if you travel a lot I think this is a must.  With the size of the unit you can keep the W in your bag and walk through the airport without having to carry or put it in your pocket.  Good luck.

<Title>It may not be perfect. but
<Date>Sat May 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It may not be perfect, but it's a whole bunch more than I expected. I gave an Ipod away a couple years ago because I had to get all squinty-eyed to see the tiny stuff on its screen, and that wheel with a button in it started off as my enemy and got worse as time went by. The folks at Creative Zen have done a much better job with their display and controls.  The directions are pretty skimpy, but after fiddling around with it for a bit I got the hang of it. Being able to read the words on the menu helps a whole lot. The controls are easy to manipulate.   My motives for buying it were to have something that would serve as another backup for my pictures, and a means of showing them either away from, or without the computer. I also wanted to store my collection of over a hundred complete operas (some over 4 hours) so I could make room by storing all those CDs in a closet. And, since I am addicted to audible books, and since Audible would give me a certificate for a hundred bucks to apply to the machine, what the heck?  So far I have loaded a bit over a thousand pictures into six albums. The pictures are easy to find with the system's navigation devices. Some editing of pictures can be done with the device, but I choose to do that before loading it into the Zen machine. Haven't tried viewing them on my TV, but on the Zen's screen they look bright, sharp and clear.  It only takes a few minutes to load a complete CD into the machine. The structure for denoting albums is easy to use. For instance, Wagner's Der Meistersinger is on 4 CDs, and without any effort on my part the albums Der Meistersinger 1, 2, 3 and four end up on the menu clearly labled and in proper order. The sound using earphones is very good. There is, however an occasional faint click which is apparently made when the machine changes a track, or something like that. I can live with that.  Haven't tried downloading an audible book to it yet, but am confident that it will work fine.  So far, have completely "ripped" all that is on 24 CDs and loaded over a thousand pictures. When I started doing this the machine had 55 Gb of usable memory space, and now it is all the way down to 54 Gb. Somehow I don't reckon I will be running short of space.  I followed the directions and charged the unit's battery before using it. Four hours seemed to be all that it needed, but I let it go on charging overnight. With all this fooling around, downloading, viewing and listening the machine's battery indicator still looks like it did when it had a full charge. Of course, it does get charged some when hooked to the computer, but even with that, the battery life seems to be very good.

<Title>Lots of Bang For Your Buck
<Date>Sat May 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The 4" wide screen is clear and 100% pure color. Radio reception is sweet. Music downloads are a breeze and the sound is perfect. The built in microphone records crisp and clear. The photo album display is pixel perfect. As is the usual practice with any pricey toy it is accompanied with the standard cheesy head set and a so-so product info manual. Battery life is nothing to write home about but not bad if you are like me and are in a routine of recharging your toys at the end of the day. Definite accessories are the Zen Vision 5-in-1 flash card adapter and the Zen W60 skin. All in all, a lot of bang for the buck (AS IT SHOULD BE FOR THE PRICE)and it is without a doubt, the best system out there. For now.

These are few things that make this device stand up: 1- perfect screen size.  2- build in speaker. (ipod does not have speaker) 3. AV connection: I can connect this device to my tv and watch my downlaoded movies. the cable came with the player. (for ipod you need to buy an exta device to be able to do that) 4. very easy to use software. (way easier than itune) 5- great sound quality. 6- bluid in fm and voice recorder. 7- support wild range of video and music files (comparing to ipod) 8- 60 gb is great if you are planing to store all your media files including movies and photos  Please note: this not the kind of mp3 player that u can take to the gym and  for sure u don't need it if you are just planing to use it to listen to music.

<Title>very disappointing
<Date>Wed Jun 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After doing much research, I finally decided to purchase the Zen Vision W 60 GB and I must say that it has been very disappointing and frustrating.  I have 17 GB of music on it and can't listen to it unless it is sitting still.  Whenever the headphone jack is moved slightly, it shuts off and when I turn it back on it has to rebuild.  It did this intermittently when I first got it, but now it does it more and more.  The rebuild takes a few minutes.  I just went outside to do some lawn work and tried to use it over and over again.  Listen to a few notes of music, try to put it in my back pocket and off it goes - have to rebuild.  Set it down, let it rebuild while I do more lawn work, go back and try it again and the same thing happens.   The only reason it did not get one star is the screen is nice for pics and when it works, it is easy to use, but it is just rare for it to work for me.   As much as I hate to say it, I might have to get an ipod.

<Title>Great Device
<Date>Tue Jun 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this device so I could leave my laptop at home during trips.  The built in CF card reader was the main selling point for me and it was a lot cheaper than the Epson P-5000.  The downside compared to the Epson was the inability to see RAW files imported from a CF card.  It will allow you to import them, but there is no sign of them on the drive unless you hook it up to a computer.  I usually shoot in large JPEGs when I am on trips, but it would be nice to have RAW.  When I do want RAW, I have chosen to shoot in RAW+Jpeg to at least feel secure that I have something when I get home.  The music playing ability is another thing I like about it.  It supports "Playforsure" tracks, so I have a choice of 2 million+ songs (via Yahoo Music Unlimited to Go) to load on it at any given time.  It will also play my mp3s without a problem. My main problem with the music feature is the lack of support for any compressed lossless formats.  I would love to see FLAC or WMA Lossless added in the future.  With 60GBs of space, there is enough room for more than a few FlAC files.  The video is a great feature, too.  Using the Zen software, it will actually convert unsupported formats to a format that it can read.  I have not had any stuttering with video that was mentioned by another reviewer, so their problem may have something to do with encoding.  Photos load a little slower than I would like.  This is not a huge problem, but it takes time for it to read each thumbnail in the folder.  It is very slow compared to the Epson that I mentioned above.  I do like the fact that you can play music while looking at photos.  This makes the  wait a little less painful!  The size is actually not too bad.  I think a slimmer version may be coming out that would get rid of some of the thickness.  However, it is shorter than a Sony PSP and thinner than the Epson (80GB) player.

<Title>A Huge, Horrible Piece of Garbage ... But What Are You Gonna Do?
<Date>Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Forty-eight hours after purchasing Creative's Zen Vision W, I'm convinced this modestly sized personal media device suffers from the too-much-too-soon syndrome associated to most personal media devices available on the market today.  Personally, the only Zen product I've owned that I've been completed satisfied (and almost trouble-free with) has been the Zen Nomad, one of Creative's earliest MP3 players but limited only to music files.  However, based on my tremendous happiness with the device, I bought my wife a 4GB Zen player which seizes up almost every time you turn the thing on; the replacement -- provided directly from Creative -- did the same, and the second replacement does much of the same.  The Zen Vision W suffers from the same ill-conceived software platform (Creative MediaSource) which is painfully slow in transferring even the smallest music files, while the Zen Vision W Media Explorer seemingly is only intent upon seizing up either the player OR the PC ... whichever comes first.  Warning messages come in handy; however, these same messages place you in an endless series of loops wherein the software is telling you that your device is currently busy and asks for you to switch to ANOTHER software (an action that makes no sense) while (yet again) seizing up the player.  The only way to seemingly reset the player is to disconnect the battery once the device has been effectively seized, and, each time, there's a modest delay in start-up allowing for the device to rebuild the portable library.  My experience with Creative has been terrible.  My first two email submissions went unanswered, and, unfortunately, the only way to get a live person is to essentially not have a job during the normal business hours as their "customer focus call center" only answers telephones between 9 am and 6 pm, which must be Eastern time b/c my call at 4:45 pm (Pacific time) only met with a voice message saying that the facility was now closed.  When I did finally speak with a technical representative, I was informed that the software drivers were outdated (that the package showed a packaging date of just over 30 days ago), and he suggested that I log on to the Creative website for the necessary upgrades ... all of which have only now seized up the Zen Vision with greater frequency.  Essentially, I wanted a handheld player for hauling around videos.  I and my wife travel frequently for business, and I've yet to be completely satisfied with either laptop computers or portable DVD players, so the Zen Vision seemed like a dream come true: acceptable screen size with Creative's industry reputation for great sound.  The single movie I've been able to "convert" to WMA format AND successfully load to the Zen Vision does look great, though I'm none too thrilled with the nine hours and seven steps required to get the movie into a loadable format ONLY to find that it still won't load onto the player for reasons that even the technical service representative couldn't understand.  I'm all in favor of seven steps when it comes to recovery from addiction, NOT in converting video to a format that even the Zen Vision doesn't seem to like.  In conclusion, I purchased this device off the glowing reviews of others here, no doubt good souls who have either have much better luck with portable media devices (though I own five for varying reasons associated to my work-life, I've never experienced this level of frustration with any of them) OR a regular paycheck from the kind folks at Creative.

<Title>good thing
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had never used an  mp3 player before this. I got the 60W because I was going on a trip with my camera, and didn't want to buy ten 1GB cards for it. This item performed admirably. At the end of every day I'd transfer the pictures and clear my card. And then I could get a better look at the pics (except the RAW ones), either on the nice big display screen or a TV. The screen is bright and clear, visible in daylight. Two people can easily watch the screen without the viewing angle problem.  Currently, I've got 1600 songs and 1400 photos on it. 60 gig (or is it 40 usable?) is an awful lot of space. But then I haven't tried any video on it. Then menus are easy to use, though I haven't done much with the music controls. I just put it on shuffle. I carry little plug-in computer speakers for hotel rooms, and earphones for airplanes or wherever. I haven't had any trouble with battery life. I just bought a new camera, which uses an SD card, so I need to find out if there's some kind of adapter.   I wanted to create a slideshow with pictures from my trip. It's great that I can take a slideshow wherever I go, and show people - even better if they own a TV! The problem is that creating the slideshow is a horrible ordeal. It's drag-and-drop on my computer, and each drag took about a 45 seconds! The more pictures in your show, the longer it takes. I was doing a show of about 100 pictures, so not only did each drag take longer, but I had more of them to do. It took me over two hours. This problem alone sucked one star out of my rating. I don't know if a music playlist suffers from the same problem. Another negative is that the colors don't show on TV's very well. The oranges are way too bright.  Overall, I'm very happy with this product.

<Title>I sold two iPods for this, and I am very happy!
<Date>Wed Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I sold two iPods - a 30GB and an 80GB - and used the cash to buy the Zen Vision W.  I just got it yesterday and I am glad I finally broke loose of the Apple/iTunes monopoly.  Main reasons to sell your iPod and buy a Vision W instead?  1. iTunes/iPod is a CLOSED system - you can only buy music from iTunes, not from any other subscription service.  The Vision W allows you to use any of the PlaysForSure music services.  My favorites are Napster and Yahoo Music.  2. iTunes does not have a "To Go" option where you can pay a single monthly fee and download unlimited entire albums.  Napster and Yahoo Music have amazing services that allow this.  3. The Vision's screen is almost twice as big as the iPod, and MUCH higher quality.  If you are really into watching movies, PLEASE get the Vision or you will be disappointed with iPod video.  4. The Vision has Outlook sync for your contacts, tasks, and calendar!  5. The Vision has alarms that are actually useful, since there is an external speaker!  6. The external speaker is very nice to have so you aren't always tied to headphones.  7.  I am personally tired of spinning my finger around and around on the iPod wheel.  The Vision's buttons are more natural to me.  The iPod wheel is oversensitive sometimes and it can be hard to select what you want.  8. CF cards!  You can plug in CF cards to carry around more stuff, or to help load your photos or music onto the player!  The iPod has no card slots at all.  9.  You can connect the Vision to a TV and view your stuff on the big screen.  10.  Removable battery!  If you need to, you can swap batteries and never run out of power while you are on the go.  The iPod has no removable battery.  11. You can allocate up to 32GB of your player's hard drive as a removable disk, so it's basically acting as a portable hard drive and backup system!  Well, that is all I have so far, and it's only my second day with the Vision.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone instead of an iPod UNLESS you prefer a smaller player and don't really care about quality as much, or if you never watch videos.

The picture quality of films and pictures is brilliant, though blacks do merge and become a little blocky. Audio quality via the built in speaker is good and via headphones is second to none, there's even a equaliser you can use with lots of presets. Navigation of the players functions is simple. I have been using AoA DVD Ripper to convert DVD's to avi format as this requires no further conversion for the players standard formats. The PC software is simple to use and transfer time of a 2 hour film is a matter of seconds. Battery life is excellent and charging time from the mains is quick though via USB does take longer. I currently have 68 films on the hard drive and I've still got 30 Gb left! The player can also be used to synchronise organiser data and used as a hard drive for file storage if you really want to.   If you travel a lot or have kids this is definately the player to buy as you can keep an entire film and CD collection on it.

<Title>NOT ALL AS IT SEEMS WITH THIS PLAYER

<Content>Well what can I say. Recieved what I thought was a cool player for my media files of over 100 titles. Let start at the begining....|  Opening the box was all exciting but it quickly went down hill form there. Plugged in the ac adaptor and plugged into the Zen unit and hey the thing powered up saying charging. I went to install the software and that went ok. Connecteted the unit to the PC and hey it didnt want to be recognised. I tried a reeboot of four times to get this thing to recognise with Windows XP Pro SP2.  Once I got it working after much frustration I tried to copy some media files such as MP3`s and Video files encoded in WMV format. The unit does not like generic mp3`s and certainly is not compliant with the standard WMV windows media video format.  To cut to the long and short of it you have to rencode with Creatives own software to get your media files to work in Creatives own native wmv and mp3 format. This is a long winded process if you already have a huge collection of material you wnat to use.  DONT BNUY THIS PLAYER ITS NOT AS ALL SEEMS ON THE BOX AND CERTAINLY HAS NOT GOT THE RANGE OF MEDIA FILE ACCESS AS IT SAYS IT HAS..  VERY VERY DISAPOINTED SO SENDING IT BACK SMAE DAY I GOT IT.... \
