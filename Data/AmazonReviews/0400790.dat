<Title>Fussy Player 
<Date>Sat Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had this little Rio over 2 years now, but have decided to move on.  The FM has never been good. Even in flat Chicago with powerful signals, the stations never came in well. The software interface is clunky - however the update I found on RIO's website is much better.  After it froze up recently, I called tech support and was recommended to purchase a "reconfiguered" replacement for half the price of a new one. No way. While the tech guy was reading through his manual, I ended up solving the problem myself. Don't look for help there. It's been spotty ever since.  It often stops and tries to "connect" to the computer - even when I'm miles away on a run. The headphones now only play out of one channel.  You've been OK for a little while, but never perfect. Time to move on, little RIO.

<Title>A must before you use the player
<Date>Mon Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I just received this player as a christmas gift. I found the sound is amazingly well for this small size gadget. It also has an equalizer to change the music settings. I strongly recommend you to visit www.digitalnetworksna.com/support/rio/ to upgrade the player firmware and the RIO Music Manager.   After the firmware upgrade, it will let you upgrade up to 1G of memory (SD or MMC memory card). I believe 512M is a basic necessity. It also let me play by my own playlist rather than all the songs I have in my player. I find this very useful, because I can organize the songs by album.  I love the sound quality and the small size. It is a good quality product.

<Title>There are better choices
<Date>Wed Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>As my third MP3 player, I chose carefully, looking for excellent features on my runs. Unfortunately, I chose poorly. The clip broke quickly, making the poor-fitting case a moot point. Rio will not replace the case or the clip and you cannot buy a replacement. The capacity is excellent with the option of adding more memory a real plus. Battery life was reasonable. Sadly, the played completely stopped working after a few months. In a world where many companies have difficult customer relations, Rio stands out from the crowd in being particularly unhelpful. Though this player had promise, there are better choices. (I will be looking at a different company's players this time.)

<Title>Works Great Til It Doesn't...
<Date>Sun Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>...then you are doinked BIG TIME. My S35S worked great for about the first six months; I had some of the same clip holder issues that others mention but I could live with those problems. What I could not live with was the unit's death and Rio's Customer DisService. I called and talked to someone who was pleasant enough and gave me a case number to fax along with the unit's serial number and copy of proof of purchase. This I did  according to their instructions. Waiting a couple of weeks I then called to get an update and was informed how busy they were and told to give them a couple of more weeks. A couple of months later I e-mailed them and received a reply explaining they were in the process of moving their warehouse and this resulted in the delay(???). Six months after sending them the information requested to implement repair or replacement I have nothing to show for my original purchase but a dead Rio and a worthless warranty. Ri(o)p-off. No more Rio in this household, period.

<Title>Does the job around the gym and outside
<Date>Wed Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Durable, light weight MP3 Player. (I must have dropped it around a dozen times in the gym, keeps working)  Good sound, after you replace the headphones that come with the unit.  To  enjoy the good sound you will need to get another headphone, (Sony and Panasonic have decent units for around $20.)    Poor FM receiption, limited playlist managment.  Volume not as lound if you plan to use them in the plane.  Could use a couple more dBs to be near perfection. Overall a basic, no nonsense,  durable unit to bring your tunes to the gym or outside.

<Title>Great little mp3 player
<Date>Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I used mine over 8 hours a week for over two years in a gym.  It took many hard hits and continued to work.  It worked for 6 months even after the plastic case was cracked.  But the internal memory is starting to fail.  Perhaps using it in a steam room was just too much for it.  Very well made!

<Title>Great, But It Has a Few Flaws
<Date>Sat Mar 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Rio Sport is an excellent little mp3 player.  The sound quality is great as is the display. While, the original model came with only 128MB of internal memory, it has an SD slot making expansion fairly inexpensive, especially in 2005 when 512MB is available for $50.   In general, the construction is rugged with a rubberized enclosure apparently meant to reduce the affects of impact from dropping. It is also has a rather compact, odd shape that is probably less than ideal for someone wanting to store it in his pocket.    While there are a handful of small design flaws, two features that are particularly annoying.  First, it has a four position concave rocker switch that is extremely sensitive.  While this is great to use blindly with your thumb, it creates a real problem when placing the unit in a pocket as switch easily depresses, causing the RIO to change songs, stop, or pause.   In short, the Rio Sport is a decent mp3 player that could use a couple of minor interface modifications and feature enhancements  Pros Excellent sound quality Good battery life Rugged Compact  Cons Main concave control button very sensitive, too easily depressed  Plastic bracket interferes with buttons and jack Uses AAA batteries instead of AA    ****  Note that the technical description in Amazon is incorrect regarding the memory type and expandability.  It uses and SD card and can go over 128 MB in total.  My 512 MB card is working fine.

<Title>So far so good
<Date>Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my Rio for a couple of days now. It's been working great. The bundled software is not all that great, but if you have Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10 then you can use that. The player has good sound and is really durable. The armband took me a minute to figure out but everything works great. The internal memory is a nice starting size. I was able to fit 54 tracks on my internal memory (64Kbps - WMA format). I bought a 128MB card for $18 and that works perfect and now I have over 100 tracks on my player. I've been hearing that the player can handle cards up to 512MB despite what the specs say. I haven't tested it so it's still a rumor to me.   In conclusion, for the price this player is a very good buy. I use it when i work out and the armband is a nifty way to keep the player close but out of the way. I'm not sure is the USB interface is version 1 or 2 but the interface is really quick. When I update my track listing it takes about 1 minute and a half to transfer 54 tracks to my player. Check the Rio site frequently for firmware upgrades. When I got mine i had to upgrade the firmware which is a sinch and take about 30 seconds to do.   Just to add, many have complained about how the player tends to slip out of the armband when you move excessively (ex. Running or jogging). I have to say that I use my Rio everyday while running and have yet to have it slip out of the armband. I run just like everyone else, and wear it while playing basketball also and it has not fallen once.

<Content>Rio no longer supports this model and the Sports case is cheap and breaks easily. Once it breaks, you are out of luck because Rio only carries replacement parts for their newest models. Do yourself a favor and buy something dependable with good product support such as Ipod, Iriver, or CreativeLabs..Leave Rio alone.

<Title>Amazing lil device
<Date>Fri Dec 20 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I was getting fed up of the talkshows in the morning and the advertising tirades in the evening on my sony tuner while working-out. I depend on music quite a lot for my running, so finally had to break down and buy an mp3 player. I am so glad I chose S35S, because it fits everything I had in mind. Light, tough, efficient and trendy. I upgraded to 256MB about a day after the purchase. The 128MB MMC (card) is about 80 bucks, but a good investment as it doubles the song numbers. I have about 100 songs in .WMA(the only way to go, since mp3 is usually about double the file size as wma) saved with some space left over, and with the shuffle mode on, working out to music is a breeze. Battery life is very good, about 10-12 hours on 1 AAA. I also upgraded to a Sony streetstyle (MDR57 ??) headphones which are much better than the supplied ones. The back-lit display and menu options are very easy to learn and operate.<p>The set up software couldn't be easier to use, with downloading and managing the songs the fastest I have seen.<p>There is a mail-in rebate offered by SonicBlue till January 03, so go for it right now, if you're in the market for a mp3 player for the fitness minded folks, or anyone for that matter. <p>The only negative is an abysmal tuner that fails to do anything, and will probably recieve a signal if you operate this inside a radio station. So that is a waste. And hence the 4 stars.<p>Counting that out, this is a great product, and since I am not missing the tuner at all, I would highly recommend this product.<p>An Update: After about a couple of months, I managed to crush my precious lil mp3 player under my truck tires in a freak accident. May be this would be an attestment to it's toughness, the display was broken, but the lil thing has refused to quit playing..Lets see your cd player beat that.

<Title>Finally a good sport MP3 player
<Date>Sun Dec 22 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've been watching the roles of MP3 players for about 4 years now, waiting for a good one in the application for which MP3 was conceived:  sport.  Requirements:  decent resistance to the elements/sweat, high memory capacity, immunity to shock, light-weight, decent sound, decent comfort.  The RIO S35S meets or exceeds all of these.<p>128MB built-in has me covered for 1.5+ hours of activity; plenty for most people.  I'll get an expansion card anyways, just to have the option of more.  It's light enough that I don't even notice it on my arm when running.  The headphones are extremely comfortable and, surpisingly, I don't even notice them when running either.  It's case provides ample protection from my prolific sweat.  The sound, while not audiophile quality, is perfectly good for exercise.  I've been using a NiMH battery with no problem (it worked even better once I found the battery setting in the menues and switched it from alkaline to NiMH  ;-P).  <p>The radio reception is poor.  I didn't get it to listen to the radio.  If I wanted to listen to the radio, the are many sport models available at far less expense.  For me, the radio is just a last resort if the battery gets too low to play MP3s.<p>In all a very good player.  Maybe a little expensive, but less than competing models like the Nike, which doesn't even have the option of a tuner.  Enjoy!

<Title>Review for XP users
<Date>Wed Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S with some reservations after reading a few reviews mentioning problems with the diver installation on PCs running XP.  I just installed the driver and music transfer software on my PC (running XP) and had no problem at all.  If you just pug in the device and let XP detect and install the driver automatically it will NOT work, because Sonicblue is in the process of certifying the Rio S35S driver for Windows XP.  Since this certification is currently only in process the diver will not be automatically detected.  What did work is to first install the music transfer software from the supplied installation CD (the music transfer software is a different piece of software than the driver), restart the PC after the installation of the music transfer software, leave the installation CD in the PC, connect the player to the PC, turn the player on, XP will tell you that an new device was found, select the detect automatically option and click next (or continue), XP will search the and find the driver on the installation CD (which you left in the PC as mentioned above).  After the installation of the driver is complete, XP will tell you that the driver was installed and that the device is ready to be used.  Launch the installed music transfer software and you are ready to roll...have fun!!

The memory is nice, the FM radio is bad bad bad unusable-it is a non feature and shouldn't be advertsided (really it's false advertising to say it has such a feature and it doesn't work), the headphones are average, the music quality playback ok, I miss the ability to replay over and over a song, the rio manager software is ok. The size is 2.5 times bigger than i thought. I should of checked out the specs better. But for [the money] I paid  a more accurate rating would be 2.5 stars. Very average at best for the price.

<Title>Rio S35S
<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>SONICblue Rio S35S Sport physical construction is ergonomic, nice looking and appears to be rugged. Exterior, made of a &quot;rubbery&quot; material, has a good feel and allows for a good grip when holding the unit. Lighted display is excellent and fairly easy to navigate through the menus. Joggers will have to stop and navigate through the menus to switch from player to radio (or vice vera) since there is no radio/player hardware button. Sound of audio player is decent.<p>Unfortunately, radio reception is poor. Earphone wires which serves as the antenna is sensitive to movement and the position of the device. S35S has a bass/treble equalizer but loses its settings in radio mode once the unit is turned off. Unit does not have much bass. When S35S is turned on, you may experience distortion for a few seconds, depending on settings. When unit is turned off in radio mode at a low volume setting, there is an annoying power/volume surge.<p>People considering purchasing the S35S will want this product because of its small size, nice exterior features and expandable player capabilities but will pass if an FM radio is important.

<Date>Sat Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>If you're looking for a little MP3 player for the gym, or running, etc., the Rio is perfect.  The only problem I've really had with it is that the radio isn't very strong.  That is, the stations don't come in very well.  Also, there's no &quot;hold&quot; button, so if you acidentally hit a button, you may skip a track or change the radio station, etc.  In terms of functionality and usefulness though, it's been great!

<Title>Rugged little unit
<Date>Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought the Rio S35S for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. After much research (and knowing what she really wanted to do with it -- listen to music while working out) it appeared that this Rio model, although new, was the best fit.<p>My only beefs are with the included software. We should have been filmed by Apple as we were trying to install the software and connect the Rio to my wife's ThinkPad with Windows 2000. After about 20 minutes, I got so frustrated that I just plugged the thing into my PowerBook G4, downloaded the iTunes driver and let her load it up with songs from my MP3 library while I installed the various bits of Windows software.<p>The sound quality is great, the integrated radio tuner works well and its rugged design seems to be pretty, well, rugged. A good purchase!

The sound from the 35S was really annoying based based on the Real Jukebox files.  When I recreated the files using the Real 1 software supplied with the 35S, the sound quality out of the 35S improved dramatically!  All in all, the software package is is easy to install and use.  I use the player now have to admit it's a great unit for workouts.  If I were to suggest an improvement it would be to replace the headphones.

<Title>Extremely User Friendly
<Date>Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I transferred music to the player last night and it was extremely user friendly.  Anyone who has owned an MP3 player in the past knows that compatibility with your computer can make or break the performance of the player.  The box lists a minimum 64MB of RAM as a system requirement for this item, but I have an older laptop with only 32MB of RAM, and I still got the player to transfer music.  The only limitation was that I couldn't download the entire capacity of the player at once.  This is an issue that I believe would be resolved had my computer possessed the minimum system requirements. Overall, the software is intuitive and very easy to use.<p>The only negative feedback I have so far is that there appeared to be one flaw when I was setting the time and date of the player.  The player clock would not let me set a PM time in the 12 hour clock mode.  I had to change the clock mode to 24 hour (Army Time), and set the time that way.  Once the time was set, I changed the clock mode back to 12 hour and the clock reflected the correct time.  Overall, a very minor inconvenience.   <p>I have yet to use this player in the gym; however, I have found that this compact, light, and sturdy player remains secure when fastened by belt clip or arm band.  I will follow up in a few weaks to review the durability and playback performance of the player.

<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I've owned this little MP3 player for about 3 weeks now and have spent about 15 hours in the gym with it.  It is extremely small and light weight.  It clips securly to my gym clothes (haven't needed the arm band) and doesn't get in the way no matter what excercise I'm doing.  The controls are user friendly enough that I operate it by feel.  The sound is very good and I haven't experienced any problems whatsoever.<p>If it can handle the gym, I should work equally well riding bikes or jogging.  The player itself actually snaps into a soft, shock absorbent housing that protects the player and provides the belt clip.<p>Downloads have gone off without a hitch and the process is typical of a Windows application making it pretty intuitive.<p>If I lost this player, I would replace it in kind without hesitation.

<Title>A great mp3 Player!
<Date>Sun Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this mp3 player and I am extremely satisfied with it. The player has a lot of functions including a stopwatch, FM radio, equalizer, etc... There are definitly no bugs in the program and very easy to use. <p>PROS:<br>1. Small (very small!!!), durable and handy<br>2. The software was excellent, no crashing, no stalling, and a fast transfer too! The program split the window into two parts, one is my library and the other is the files on the player. All the ID3 tags (tags that display the name, author, etc of a song)should be automatically added if you label them in Musicmatch, Real jukebox, or any other player. <br>3. Water and compact resistant (extremely durable, i even dropped it a few times on concrete and it still worked!)I ran in the rain once, it was working perfectly<br>4. Big LCD screen to display time, battery level, song title, song artist, album, a location thingy to display how far u are into the song, volume indicator, how much time left, how much time already past, and date. The resolution is very fine so the date and the time is not all distorted. <br>5. There are amazing functions including a treble/bass equalizer that doesn't distort the quality of the sound<br>6. The stopwatch includes laps, an average time, and the difference between each lap<br>7. The radio has a search option with 3 savable channels<br>8. A power saving capability to save power (cutting off backlight time and a saving power mode that acts like a screen saver)<br>9. A menu option to browse all the songs<br>10. Light and handy, i ran with it and almost forgot it was still clipped on my shorts<br>11. The cd also comes with iTunes and RealOne, both really nice music managing programs<p>CONS:<br>1. The big round set that has the Play, FF, RW, and Stop is easy to hit so you can't walk around with it in your pockets, on the other hand it is a good thing for running because no one would like to struggle pressing the FF button while keeping a even pace =)<br>2. The earphones aren't as comfortable<br>3. There is no remote control...<br>4. It uses an MMC card for expansion and MMC cards are usually 10 more bucks than Smart Media<br>5. It's a little thicker than most mp3's players (u can check up the dimensions) and its round shape looks a little babyish & toyish...<br>6. SONICblue boasts up to 10 hrs on one AAA battery, I only get around 5 hours....<br>7. no microphone...<br>8. there are no detailed instructions, just a quick start. The detailed instructions are found in the CD program<p>Overall this player is outstanding and I think that SONICblue has hit the target. As a runner, no other mp3 player would match this player's size, weight, and ease of use!!! The package comes with an armband, a belt clip, a pair of earphones, a cd software, and of course, the mp3 player! Again I would definitly recommend this for runners, or people who do sports. I would not recommend this for people looking for an mp3 player that is cute and small with advance features.

<Content>This was my first MP3 player.  I bought it for its versatility with fitness activities.  So far, I love it!!  I like the FM radio option- although only stations with strong signals come in.  Most MP3's don't even offer the option.  I also like the stopwatch function.  Sound clarity is excellent, ease of use is great and fast transfer times for songs.  Backlit display is nice.  It is small, compact, securely stays clipped to your clothing (haven't needed the strap, but its nice to have it).  I also like the appearance.  I like the option of adding more memory later.  I'd definitely recommend it.

Outside is better but if you are skating or running expect the signal to fade in and out as you change directions.  As far as MP3 capability it is a terrific little device.  You could not ask for anything easier to download from the pc.  Point and click everything.  Let's you know how close you are to capacity.  If you can live without the radio portion buy this unit.

<Title>Any problems with the integrated DRM so far?
<Date>Mon Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>Hi there!<p>A great player ... but what I'd like to know is, whether anyone out there is having problems with the integrated DRM. <p>In the description of the player is a feature called DRM (Digital Rights Management). Does that mean, that in the future I can only put &quot;legal&quot; MP3's into the player, which I ripped by myself?<p>Thx for answers!

<Title>Great for the gym: sweat-proof with a good battery life
<Date>Mon Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've used this Rio player at the gym for 3 times (1 hour session each) a week for over a year.  It has endured sweat, water and a few drops on the floor with no problem.  The battery life is good enough that I only have to change the battery every few weeks.  The player can fit a good amount of songs on it so I don't have to change them out that often either.  Yes, the holder is a bit cheesy but overall that shouldn't stop you from buying it.  It's so small that you can put it in your pocket if the holder really bugs you.  Great gadget!

<Title>Great little player!
<Date>Wed Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've owned other MP3 players before, but this one is the easiest to use.  The software is great -- just load it up and you're off and running, no instruction required, it's that simple.  The display is outstanding (whatever you do, don't buy one without a backlit display; you'll be sorry!).  The player itself is also intuitive; you don't have to be a mechanical genius to figure it out (yes,some of the other lower-cost players are that complex).  <p>As others have pointed out, the case doens't fit exactly, but it's not THAT bad, and the circular control is a bit sensitive so you'll want to use the lock feature, but everything else about it is so very user friendly.  I like the clip -- mine has held up through a lot of abuse, and it's just as strong as ever.  <p>As for battery life, I'm getting at least 6- 7 hours.  Maybe not as long as the manufacturers tell you it will get, but a lot longer than I got with my MTV player.<p>And, best of all, the sound quality is awesome.  I've had mine for about a year now, and use it for running, the gym, roller blading and yardwork, and have had no real problems whatsoever.

<Title>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE on this terrible product!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Wed Jul 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>DON'T BUY A RIO:  1st things first, if you plan on using the fm tuner, forget it!  It doesn't work at all, even after you upgrade the firmware at Rio.  That was the first problem, after using the player for several months it started going crazy and not working.  I called (not toll free) Rio, spoke to a person who barely spoke any English, spent 25 minutes (on my dime) uprgrading the firmware.  Tried it out, it didn't work.  Called back, on my dime, spent another 20 minutes diagnosing with another non-English speaking person.  I was finally told it was broken.  NO SH*T!  Now I have to fax (on my dime once again) proof of purchase (even thought the serial number proves that the player is in warranty! - now i have to locate the F'ing proof).  After they receive my fax, then they will send me a Return Auth number.  Then I get to send the player across the country (you guessed it, on my dime) back to them before they will replace the unit.  Give me a break.  Time to get into the 21st century of customer service.  DON'T BUY A RIO, YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!!!

<Title>great music, pathetic clip
<Date>Thu Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I should have listened!  I had the MP3 player for 3 days before the clip broke.  I was at the gym, riding the bike and it broke!  I just called for the replacement (which they only sell the whole case).  It's $10.95, plus $6 shipping plus tax AND THEY'RE BACKORDERED!  It sounds like there are a few others in my situation!  That's why I only have it 4 stars.  Other than the clip (you can put the player in your pocket, but many of the gym shorts I have don't have pockets) I LOVE the player!  I haven't had any problems with it--great music!  Do invest in a good pair of earphones, the ones that come with it keep popping out of your ears.

<Title>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, RIO NO LONGER WORKS
<Date>Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>At first I was excited with my new rio mp3 player. I downloaded my favorite songs, upgrade the card, etc. but then I dropped my rio player. And that was the end of it. I called customer service and was sent from one person to the next to the next to the next, none spoke English. I finally found out their customer service phones are answered in a foreign country. Ok, I understand we all need jobs, especially the third world, BUT they don't understand me and can't help me. Then I finally get someone who says I must prove I purchased the rio player to get a customer authorization number to replay my rio because "it can't be repaired and must be replaced." I only dropped it once on my living room rug -- how weak is this device anyway! This happened 5 months ago, I've yet to receive my replacement. I've lost my money. Hold off and save for a better quality player and better customer service. I do not recommend any RIO products because of poor customer service (which you will eventually need).

<Content>Have used this device for about a year now.  One of my highly valued possesions.  Clear sound, very portable.  I am in awe of the technical geniuses that came up with this device.  One of the first things I did with the player is drop it on a brick path while running and having it on my arm.  The player cracked right open on the ground.  I punched it back to gether and it has worked ever since (just lost my songs.)  What more can u ask for in toughness?  I will say that someone using the player will want to reenforce the band.  That way it will not fall of the clip when it is on your arm or something (I use string.)

<Title>Don't waste your money!
<Date>Sun Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had the Rio S35S for about a year, when for no reason it just stopped working while I was running.  The "USB connecting" message comes on and it won't play any songs.  The thing randomly started working again, only to stop again the next time I ran.  Now the bottons won't work at all, and it intermittently stops and starts working for no reason.  Overall this product is very unreliable, and having read other peoples' comments I'm not even going to waste my time calling the useless, non-English speaking Rio tech support.  Don't waste your money!

<Title>Small and durable, great for exercising
<Date>Wed Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had it for 8 months now and ready to upgrade my  memory a bit.  While running, I have yanked the cord by mistake with my arm and the headphones have stayed on my ears while the player hit the pavement.  This has happened a few times and it's still working.  My 140 lb dog has chewed it, only thing that didn't make it was the battery cover.  I'm very happy with it.  Radio doesn't come in that great.  My only complaint is that the cover for armband and waistband wear is difficult to get on and off the unit.

<Title>Durable & User-friendly
<Date>Sun Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Pros:  I've been using this little guy everyday as part of my daily fitness regimen; hiking, mountain biking, running, and into the gym for serious lifting... you name it, it's been there. It's very durable and on a couple of occasions while biking, I've fallen on it with not even a scratch thanks to its protective rubber-coating. I don't know how water-resistant it is, but I've put a good amount of sweat and some drizzle from the rain on it with no problems yet. The menus are very user-friendly and the LCD layout is clean, crisp, and can be read even when you're on the move. The sound output is great; I'd suggest using mp3 at a 96 bit rate to save on storage. The battery life is very dependable; on average I change out batteries once every one and a half to two weeks (I use it aprx. 2 hours a day). As for the software, I had some trouble getting it loaded up on my pc (b/c it's over 5 years old) but on my school's pc, it had no problems. The uploading of songs takes some time (depending on your CPU's speed), but it's not a big issue. The software menu layout is as easy as drag-and-drop and you're ready to go. All in all, I LOVE IT... with this little gizmo by my side, I've been able to lose 45+ pounds. Thank you Rio for an AMAZING product!  Cons:  The radio tuner is non-existant, not a big deal since I don't listen to the radio, but there are downloadable patches on the companies website to upgrade the radio signal. The in-stock earphones aren't that great, it's suggest finding ones that fit more ergonomically to your head anyway. Storage can hold 20 songs at 182 kbs or 40 songs at 96 kbs, although sound quality is still great at 96kbs.  If you need more than that, I'd suggest purchasing an add-on a memory stick.   NOTE: I bought this MP3 player when it originally came out (almost 2 years ago) for full price.  Now, it's less than half the original price and still a better deal than most sport MP3 players today.

<Title>Good Sound - Poorly built
<Date>Thu Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased 2 of these believing that they would be great for working out (one was for my wife).  They sound good and the software is easy to use. However - I would not buy this item again.  The supplied sleeve to carry the player on your belt or in the supplied arm strap is not cut properly to access the buttons properly.  The arm strap is not well designed to hold the player - the player will actually flip out with repeated arm movements(runners beware).  Then, God forbid you drop the thing at all it will fall apart.  It is not durable and the design creates situations where it will fall.  I've had mine less than 6 months and have not used it very much.  After it popped out of it's strap a couple of times, the unit began to separate at it's seem.  There is no way for a consumer to attempt to put it back together properly.  Too bad.  I strongly advise against this item as a sports mp3 player - it is simply not durable at all.

<Title>My first player---a great way to start
<Date>Mon Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2002
<Content>I bought this primarily for my morning run.  It sounds great, and it is light as can be.  Some things to consider:<p>+ size and weight are small and light<br>+ stylish looking<br>+ easy to use. Once you tell it where you store your MP3 files, you just select, click, and you are good to go!<p>- At 128kb--a CD quality MP3--this does not hold four hours worth of music (as SonicBlue claims). It holds about two hours.<p>- Battery life is less than 15 hours, as advertised.  More like 7 - 10, from what I can tell.  To be fair, I've not used it without having it on to download new tunes. I'm sure this drains some battery life.<p>So do a little homework, and if you can live with a couple of hours worth of tunes, this may be a great unit for you!

<Title>Great player! Works fine right out the box.
<Date>Fri Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Opened it up, got the software installed and it worked! I was very skeptical after reading all the reviews on various web sites. The software is a little hokey, could be better. However, I put the disk in, installed the sw and was dropping songs onto the player in under 5 minutes. <p>Menu navigation is very intuitive and the backlit display is a huge plus in my book. Also, you have lots of information in the display(battery life, song title, artist, album, date, track time, bit rate, etc...)Another plus for me is the time is always displayed in the upper left. <p>After I did that, I flashed the firmware. This, too, went smoothly. Now I am running ver. 1.6 with no problems. And-In the README file it says it has been tested with sd512 cards successfully! That means that you could potentially have up to 640MB of storage. Pretty much the size of a cd. I'm very impressed with that feature(this is one of the main reasons I bought it). Between the size of the unit and potential memory capacity, you cannot go wrong. <p>One drawback is I can't figure out how to set FM presets in the radio. This really isn't a problem seeing as I did not intend on even using the radio feature. However, would still be nice to have. Tried tech support and was politely told by a robot to call back later. Oh well, I'm not too disappointed. <p>All in all, a great little unit for the price. If size, weight, large storage capacity, great display features, and upgradeability are a factor then this is the player for you(and me).

<Content>Let me cut through the chase....I installed and transferred my first track to this sporty little player in a whopping 10 minutes (on Windows XP). So for ease of use, can you say "simple"?  As far as the FM radio...it isn't very good. But then again, if I wanted an FM receiver, I would have bought one of those instead.

<Content>Pros:  Great little unit for my morning workout.  Lightweight, great sound, easy to attach to arm or waist, good volume control, easy change in song selection.  Haven't used the radio too much because of the great clarity in downloaded music.  <p>Cons:  Initial EXTREME frustration with software to get my Toshiba PS141U-01F3 Laptop (XP Windows version) to 'communicate' to the Rio S35S.  I had to wait on the telephone and eventually talk to a customer service representative, (2 occassions totalling 2.5 hours) to walk me through the software updates and help me get it to work. The company definitely needs to improve instruction manual that is included in the packaging.  It seems that others have had the same type problems as this.  However, once the computer and unit were compatable, it has worked well. <br>  <br>Would recommend this product.  I will be purchasing the extra MMC card next.

Everything she suggested I had already tried.  She admitted that there is a problem with Windows ME which I have.  It is unable to recognize current driver.  I would appreciate a reply to this if anyone has been able to fix it.  Her only suggestion was to try on a different operating system.  My USB recognizes it as the Sonic but that is as far as it gets.  Then the program stops responding.<p> I will now spend the rest of my time trying to return the product for a refund!

<Title>Excellent MP3 Player with plenty of room to grow!
<Date>Fri Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I bought my S35S because I wanted a small portable device that could hold a lot of data.  The RIO S35S is exactly what I was looking for.  It comes with 128MB intenal memory, and is also expandable through a MMC memory card slot.  The documentation that comes with the player and the box says it is expandable with up to another 128MB of memory, but once you have upgraded the firmware through Sonicblue's website, it can be expanded up to another 512MB! (and potentially even more depending on how large MMC cards get in the future!)  I have a Sandisk 256MB SD memory card in mine, and it works like a charm.  Some SD memory cards require firmware version 1.62 or higher, so make sure you have upgraded if you want to use that type of memory (check out www.rioworld.org if SonicBlue's website only has firmware 1.60.  Sonicblue hadn't updated their website as of this posting.).  Even though the FM tuner doesn't get good reception inside buildings, it works fine outside with local stations.  Also, because this device is firmware upgradable, future enhancements can be easily added as SonicBlue develops them!  I would highly recommend this MP3 player for anyone looking for a very compact and expandable portable music player.

<Content>This player is an incredible piece of machinery, despite the reviews to the contrary.  I run with my on a daily basis and it by far exceeds any CD player I have run with in the past.  The convenience of this MP3 player has made my protable CD players obsolete.<br>The only problem this player has is that there is no radio reception, but as a previous review said, who cares??  If you want a radio then buy a tuner instead.  I found the transition between my computer and the Rio flawless, and a lot faster than burning a cd.  If anyone has a problem using the Rio, then that problem probably lies with a defect in the particular Rio they received, or they own a computer incapable of handling the transition for one reason or another.  I use both the included software and RealOne, both have been equal in performance on my end!!

<Date>Tue Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I had been looking for a mp3 player with a radio for about a year with no success.  So when I saw this model I grabbed it up right away.  After 2 1/2  months of steady use, it has not given me any problems.  The installation went off with out a hitch, and I've had no problems with any of the firmware.  It definitly sucks down batteries (AAA) so I recommend buying a set of rechargable batteries and charger.  Also the radio is not the strongest... it is crackely indoors, but no problem outside even in a modestly sized city like Boston.  It takes a little work to figure out the radio presets but if you read the instructions there shouldn't be any problems.  Have fun and keep running...

<Content>I've owned 2 RIO S35S MP3 players in the past 12 months.  Both of them started behaving poorly within one month of purchase.  The first one would randomly restart itself from the beginning of the playlist, and would occasionally just stop playing altogether, even with new batteries.  After 1 month, the 2nd one began locking up in the middle of music uploads from my PC.  Eventually it just stopped functioning.

It's very easy to trade music in and out -- the supplied software is just fine, and it also works well with the Musicmatch Jukebox package. It's not comparable to a hard-drive player, but it's a good little flash memory machine, with decent battery life. <p>The accessories are, as others have noted, terrible. The case doesn't fit, and the headphones are the worst I've ever come across. I sliced off the top of the case to unblock the buttons and still use the clip part, which I've found sturdy enough, and, with my own decent set of 'phones, it's a good item for the money.

<Title>Great Sound Quality, Wonderful Software & Extremely Durable
<Date>Sun May 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I've had my Rio Sport for about 2 years.  I've taken it across country (from California to South Carolina), I've dropped it, accidently sat on it, gotten it wet & it just keeps coming back for more!  <p>Other reviewers criticize the beltclip, and they're right.  The beltclip is lame.  I just put the Rio in my pocket.  When my wife goes running, it's so small, she just puts it down her sports bra.  No worries.<p>Now the good news!<p>The easily readable, brightly back-lit LCD is reminiscent of the "IndiGlow" wristwatch.  It displays everything you'd expect it to.  Song title and the names of the artist and the album.  <p>If the song title is too long ("Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars" for example) then the title slowly scrolls from Left to Right.  Mighty slick!<p>A small status bar shows how far into each song you are.<p>Pressing the Enter button toggles you through information such as file type (wma, mp3, wav, etc.), time remaining, time elapsed, KBPS Rate (32 Kbs, 64 Kbs or 128 kbs), Date, Pause/Play, Stereo or Mono and track number out of total (e.g. if you've got 100 sound files onboard, and you're listening to song number 38, the it will display "38/100").<p>If its time-of-day clock is too small (which it probably is), then use your wristwatch.<p>An easy-to see battery indicator estimates how much juice you have remaining (with about 6 increments inlcuding a blinking battery to symbolize a sort of "2-minute warning").<p>Battery life: I sometimes advance to the next song, max out the volume (or frequently CHANGE the volume), back up & play songs over and turn it on & off a lot.  <p>With all this activity - I can usually rely on about 8 accumulative hours of operation.<p>I would guess Sony's optimistic assessment of "15 hours on one battery" (or whatever) is based on putting in a fresh alkaline battery and letting the device play over & over until it finally runs out of battery.<p>Buttons are extremely responsive and there's also a "button-lock" (keystroke: MENU+ENTER) which means you need not worry about accidently bumping the advance button when you're right in the middle of something good.<p>This unit comes with good-quality Earbuds.  While there's nothing wrong with them, I personally don't care for the basic design of earbuds in general, even if they're the highest quality.  <p>My wife loves hers, but I'm picky so I bought wrap-around headphones (TDK/$10 such a deal!)  <p>Neato software!  The included "Rio Music Manager" is the main software used to get music FROM your hard drive INTO your MP3 player.  But wait! There's more!<p>If you prefer Windows Media Player, then you don't even NEED Music Manager.  From within Media Player, you just click "Copy To CD or Device."<p>Or by using the "other accessories" button, the Setup Wizard creates a Rio Player icon in your "My Computer" window, which allows you to simply drag music files onto the icon (the one drawback to this is you lose the tag information (Song name, artist, album, etc.)<p>The included software also comes with "RIO Taxi", which enables you to use the Rio Sport as a storage device!<p>For example - say you've got some big ol' 18 MB Powerpoint file you want to take to a friend's house.  Using Rio Taxi, you can put the 18 MB file on your Rio Sport, take the Sport to your friends house, plug it into his computer & download the file from your Rio Sport to your friend's computer!  FREAKY TIKI!<p>The SOUND QUALITY is nothing less than exquisite.  But the actual VOLUME output isn't always as powerful as you might like.  Sometimes ambient sounds (garbage trucks, barking dogs, police sirens) can drown out the MP3 music.  <p>SOLUTION!  An oft-overlooked FREE accessory that comes with the Windows Operating System.  It's called Windows Movie-Maker.  <p>In addition to being a darn fine movie editor, you can also use this Freebie to boost the volume of ANY sound (wma, mp3 or wav) and save it as a regular wma file.  It also allows you to adjust the quality from 16 KBS to 256 KBS!<p>The Drop-Test:  I'm not proud of this, but I am clumsy & subsequently very hard on my toys.  <p>I have accidently dropped the Rio Sport from a height of about 5 feet (chest level).  It has dropped, bounced & tumbled on asphalt, concrete & other hard surfaces.  I even dropped it water once (rescued within 5 seconds).   <p>This has caused a few minor problems.  About ever 3 months, I can't turn it off.  I need to remove & reinsert the AAA battery causing the clock to return to 12:NOON.  But I never lose files, and the sound quality is (& always has been) supurb!<p>In short, this is a wonderful little MP3 player & I strongly recommend it to anyone with an active life!

<Title>Big sound out of a small package
<Date>Fri Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have owned this item for close to a year now and I have been nothing but happy with this device.  <p>I think that this MP3 player is very well laid out.  I run quite a bit and it is very easy for me to skip through songs and adjust the volume while the unit is strapped to my arm.  The arm band that this player comes with holds the MP3 player very well, and leaves all buttons exposed so they are very easy to access.<p>The sound quality it one of the best I've heard from a MP3 player.  I recently purchased an IPOD Mini and I still find myself going back to this Rio to listen to during my workouts.  I feel that the sound quality of this device is steps above the IPOD.<p>The battery life is also impressive.  It takes 1 AAA battery which lasts me a few weeks with moderate use (an hour every other day).  <p>The software it comes with is decent but not the best I've seen, but it gets the job done and it isn't difficult at all to transfer songs to the MP3 player. <p>I only had one issue.  When I first bought the player it would sometimes automatically pause after certain songs were played.  I simply went to Rio's web site and updated the firmware, and I haven't had the problem since. <p>It's been about a year and I still can highly recommend this device.  It's easy to use and sounds great.

<Title>This MP3 Player is awesome
<Date>Wed Jun 30 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>When I bought this MP3 Player i didnt know what to expect.  I had heard from previous reviews that it was an alright gadget but after a few weeks of using the Rio S35S MP3 Player I have figured out that it is a great MP3 Player.  This MP3 Player can withstand any kind of activity whether its working out at the gym or just shootin' hoops in the driveway.  The case and arm-strap are great.  I have never dropped my MP3 Player because its so well supported by the case and armband.  It downloads songs from your computer in seconds.  My MP3 Player came with a 64 MB card which made the total megs 196 MB.  It can hold anywhere from 30 to 35 songs on it.  The songs sound very clear when played on this MP3 Player.  I have had a couple of minor problems.  ONe of the minor problems was that for a week or so my Rio wouldnt fast-forward or rewind any of the songs but that was resolved somehow and now it still works.  Also occasionally the MP3 Player &quot;lags&quot; going from song to song.  Other then that this MP3 Player is of excellent quality.  Because this MP3 Player is an excellentgadget i give it 5 stars because there are many good thkngs about it and almost nothing bad abomut it.

<Title>Great for everything but pockets
<Date>Wed Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Delighted with the Rio - I use it for my daily commute (either on foot, bike or bus) and for running. I had no problems with the software - interfaces very nicely with iTunes and am pleased with sound quality. My sole complaint is that the big round button is too easy to push - when i put the Rio in a pocket (coat or bag) it often get paused or skips a song just from touching the inside of the pocket. not an irredeemable problem since it comes with a nice clip, but i don't like it to be too visible... so: not perfect, but acceptably close.

<Title>No Driver problems here
<Date>Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>So I've noticed a large number of complaints about installing/configuring the drivers for Windows XP.  <p>Let's see, I installed the software, plugged in the device, and the driver was automatically found and installed.  Yes I can see how that would be difficult.<p>Anyway, yeah the radio is kind of pointless, but there's a reason why this is called an MP3 player, not a 'portable radio machine.'  <p>To store more songs, just turn the compression rate on your MP3s down a bit.  The difference between 128 and 112 really isn't noticeable for the most part.  <p>Overall it's a great little unit, perfect for tucking into my pocket while riding my bike indoors.

Two things that would make this product better. 1) Longer Battery life.( use the lithium batteries if possible)  2) A lock for the buttons, if you brush up against something, it may cause your music to stop. <p>Other than that great system.

<Title>Great Purchase
<Date>Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Let me start by saying that this is a FANTASTIC MP3 player!! I did not know too much about MP3 players but I have to say this one is pretty user friendly.  To clear up a few things, you can only get around 2 hours of music in the MP3 format, BUT if you convert all of your music into the WMA format like I did, you get OVER 4 hours of music without the use of a MMC.  The sound is just as good as cd (depending of the quality of your downloads) and the Rio Music Manager Program easily transfers the songs over quickly. A single AAA battery can also last about 10 solid hours, which is really good compared to other MP3 players and is not too costly considering you only use one battery at a time.  The only reason I gave this fabulous MP3 player 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because if its FM tuner, it conveniently can hold up to 8 preset stations, but its reception leaves a bit to be desired and is clearly this players only weak point.  All in all I strongly recommend this product, it is simply awesome and you will not go wrong!!!!

<Title>Could this be any easier???
<Date>Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was extremely concerned with the software issues when I first looked into this player.  If you have ANY computer sense at all, you will have no problem with this device (at least for XP users).  I was transfering music to the player within 15 minutes of putting the cd in the cd-rom drive.  It really isn't anywhere close to as hard as a lot of the reviews make it out to be.  <p>As for the player itself.. Its very easy to use and has all the features I was looking for.  The tuner worked pretty well and I didn't have any static problems (maybe I'm lucky).  I like the compact size while the belt clip and armband are a huge plus (especially for working out).  You never really know its there. One other feature I like is I can plug it into my car cd player (using a cable I already have) and play music that way too.<p>The only drawback I have is the headset.  They really are cheap.<p>Overall I'd highly recommend this player to anyone especially for workouts.

<Content>I bought mine at Costco on impulse and THEN I read the reviews here to see why this sucks. I agree with the bad reviews. The FM stinks, lots of static, the holder doesn't align with the buttons and the songs are played in the wrong order. I have a Nomad II but didn't want to spend the money on a SmartCard to get more songs on it and an arm band and... So I bought the S35S when I saw it starts with 128 had the arm band and was half the size. I kinda liked the headphones, they hold on to me nicely. The only reason I gave it 2 stars.<br>Oh well back to the drawing board. It's going back. Save your money, I'm still reading, maybe I can find a better choice, this time.

<Title>Nice Features and Design
<Date>Wed Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought this for my wife in December and she loves it.  She works out at the gym 4 days a week. this little device is among the upper tier of MP3 players out there.  Yes there are other players, but they all have their own problems as well.<p>The Rio S35S does a great job of getting people who aren't really computer literate.  My wife is not so computer savvy, but she has managed to easily learn how to upload music into the player from our home PC.  The software Rio provides is well designed for novices in mind.  it has never crashed my PC, so anyone here complaining about software bugs may actually have their own unique hardware problems.  The software really makes it simple to add or remove songs from the player.<p>As far as the build quality of the player.. excellent.  All the buttons and casing textures feel very sturdy and well built.  However, the same cannot be said for the headphones (my wife replaced them).  Also, although the device holster looks and feels cool because it is made of a rubberized plastic material, it is a tremendous pain to get off the unit.  And when it is on, it is difficult to get it aligned with some of the side controls.<p>Playback quality is excellent, among the best in the business, and that includes the iPod.  As far as &quot;background noise&quot; with the FM Tuner, I haven't noticed that at all.  Might be a defective unit a user here had.<p>If you are not super-computer savvy and want Lexus-level build quality, this is the player for you.  if you are a computer geek who wants to use your own software like Windows Media Player, iTunes, or Real Player to manage your playlist and see the device as a &quot;hard drive&quot;, I would suggest you shell out the extra $200 for an iPod.

Comes with iTunes software, but isn't compatible with iTunes. And to add insult to injury, you can't return it to the store once you've opened it. You have to jump through hoops to return it directly to the manufacturer.<p>In short, save your money, this thing isn't worth it.

<Title>Lightweight Player, but flimsy, poorly designed - pain in *
<Date>Mon Apr 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I own an iPod. I love it, but I don't like to take it running, too heavy, and if I drop it, oh no! So I bought this hunk of red plastic. It is definitely lightweight. But the buttons activate at the slightest touch, on a Windows machine it randomly connects via the USB cable or doesn't. It *DOES* work with iTunes, but only if you convert your songs to MP3 or WMA (which you cannot do with purchased music - protected AAC). The little carry case that comes with it *SEEMS* like a good idea. However, it's nearly impossible to remove it (I am afraid of tearing the player in half doing so), and it's so poorly desgined that I can't really push the buttons while it's in the case. AND, if I don't use the case, the battery/storage cover keeps falling off. Don't waste your money. If you can afford the iPod mini - go for it. Otherwise look elsewhere for your lightweight and compact sport digital music player.

<Content>After owning this product for about 2 months I feel I know it enough to write a fair review. I'm not too impressed with this MP3 player. This is the first one that I have ever bought and have found a few major things that I don't like about it. First the volume is not nearly loud enough. I'm listening to it in the gym and can hear outside noise even with volume at full on this thing. The plastic case that holds it does not fit the player. That means that the buttons on the thing are barely accesable. The radio part of it is garbage and can't really be used. It's like tuning into a distant AM station.  I ditched the headphones immediately and can't tell you if they are good or not. <br>Do yourself a favor and skip this one, wish I had. Oh yeah and if you buy something take a minute or two and write a quick review about it. It really helps people out.

<Title>Y'all are overreacting
<Date>Mon Apr 26 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After mulling over the mp3 universe I bought this unit at Sam's Club for $89.  It comes with a 32 mmc memory card for a combined memory of 160 rams.  Plus I can use different mmc cards for infinite expansion, so to speak.<p>I knew what I was getting into when I bought this unit.  I decided that there's no way getting around buying 2 mp3 players.  One hd-based for storing large quantities of music, like an ipod, and another cheaper unit for jogging and moving around.  The rio s35s seemed like a good option for exercise.  <p>So far I'm not disappointed.  The sound is fantastic.  I LIKE the included headphones--why is everybody complaining about them?  The radio reception is adequate.  (I tried another pair of headphones laying around and that weakened the radio signal).  When the lcd backlight is on that causes an annoying hum in the radio, but when the light goes off after 5 seconds the hum disappears.  Also the firmware update notes promises to improve the radio quality--maybe that's helping mine. <p>I still might return this unit to the store, but not because of any inherent flaws.  I think it might be worth it to spend a little more to get a player with a voice recorder, like the iRiver or MPIO.  (Last night, I was playing with the unit when my 19-month old daughter started telling stories--it would have been fantastic to just to turn it on and RECORD!)  Also, it would be nice to be able to transfer files directly to the player without the go-between of the proprietary software (which is not as bad as everyone is saying, by the way).  <p>All in all, the player has delivered everything that i expected of it, and it's excellent sound quality has even pleasantly surprised me.  I'm listening to the Clash's "Complete Control" right this instant and I'm amazed at how crisp, clear and LOUD  it is!<p>epilogue: I did take it back and got an MPIO FL100 for about twice the price.  I'll write a new review of this player.

<Title>Surpasses all expectations!
<Date>Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I did a pretty fair amount of research before buying this product.  From what I had been hearing, I was concerned that I would buy a player and it would probably take several hours to install the drivers and get the player itself to work.  I narrowed my choice between the s35s and the Nike player.  I read every review three or four times and finally decided on the s35s.  Total installation time, including loading six songs, was 15 minutes.  I don't know if SonicBlue has made changes to the software or what but I am extremely pleased thus far.  I didn't even really need any of the instructions.  I will offer this up:  Once you get everthing loaded, restart your computer.  I am far from a techie, so I followed all of the on screen instructions and did not have any problems.<p>The radio is ok but that's not why I bought the player.  The sound is not great but better than I expected.  I'm sure this can be improved by upgrading the head phones. <p>Overall, I was a little worried when I started the installation process but as stated above -- 15 minutes.  Now it's time to take the dog for a walk and jam some Black Label Society.

<Content>I was sitting here wondering whether I should rate this a four star product, because while it's an excellent product it isn't mind-blowing, or a five star product because of it's overall great value.  In the end, the proximity of the mere quality of the product to five-star level and the great value swayed me to give it five.  The installation software is easy to use, as is the music transfer program.  The player itself is small and sleek, while the backlight is a fluorescent blue that makes me feel like this was a Christmas gift from Spock.  The accessories are nice: a nifty little carry-clip, a rechargeable battery, nice headphones anda USB cable.  The sound quality is pleasing, but not great, thus the four star rating for the quality.  Still, the sound is more than satisfactory while overall the product was a great, great deal.

<Title>Better than ever thought!
<Date>Sun Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was considering buying a Nomad IIc 128 MP3 Player but, then I saw this I thought it looked so awesome. So I looked at all the features and I decided I'd rather use this because it's made for sports and is so light. I read reviews and some people said it wasn't to good because trouble loading. Don't listen it is very simple and easy. Sure, you have to know a little about computers to do it. If you don't know anything about them it may cause a little problem with everything but, it is the best. The only thing is if the battery isn't over half full the tuner won't work and it will shut down don't worry if it happens. It did it to me in school and I thought it was broke, it's not. Overall, this MP3 player is way greater than I thought and you want to buy this. I love it so much. I've had it about 5 days and has no problems it's the best. You should buy 1 too.

<Title>awesome portable audio system
<Date>Mon Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This unit fits the bill nicely for me as a companion on my frequent cycling jaunts.  The unit was relatively simple to get up and running.  Uploading songs from my computer via Kazaa was a snap annd accomplished quickly.  That would be the preferred way to program music as uploading from audio CD's is time consuming.<p>The sound is reasonably clear although the FM reception isn't the greatest.  The size of the unit and the accessories allow it to be hooked up onto your person in a variety of comfortable locations.<p>Nice birthday present for a person that's hard to shop for.  Thanks sis & brother in law.

<Date>Mon Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I hunted for over a year for a light-weight, high quality MP3 player with plenty of storage to help me train for my next marathon.  After reading the specs and many positive reviews I decided to give the Rio S35S a try.  Having used it for 4 weeks now I can say that I got exactly what I wanted and expected.  The device has phenomenal sound while playing MP3's.  I admit that the radio is just okay, but I didn't buy the thing for a radio.  I wanted to play my music only not the garbage ad filled radio junk.  If you exercise and are looking for an MP3 Player I highly recommend this one.

<Title>RIO not good for me
<Date>Sat Feb 14 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had an intel pocket concert which I thought was great.  My car got stolen and that was the end of MP3 player #1.  After doing research I purchased the Rio R35S.  Sound quality was average (not as good as the older and discontinued Intel Pocket Concert).  The Rio lasted a little over a year then many of the buttons stopped working.  I used it in the gym to work out and was very careful with it.  Was not durable for me.  Maybe this was an isolated problem but it was enough to keep me away from Rio's for good.  My third and current MP3 player is the IRiver 390T with 256mb.  This player is great.  Sound quality is great.  The player is small and user friendly for most people.  Based on my experience I would stay away from the RIO.

<Title>Rio Sport 35S
<Date>Mon Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This was my first MP3 player, although I bought my father the RCA Lyra (128mb) for Christmas.  Although he enjoys it, I felt the battery compartment's door felt flimsy.  I did a lot of research and finally bought the Rio Sport 35S at Sam's Club.  It came with a bonus 32mb chip and an additional 1-year warranty on top of the manufacturer's warranty....$112 total.<p>It's very lightweight and I love the LCD display.  for me, the MP3 had to have an armband and have an expandable memory.  Rio has that.  The plastic case is alright, although I could have designed it a bit better.  I plan to buy some material and make a pouch that completely protects the player AND attaches to the armband.<p>The headphones (ear buds) are not the greatest...one bud keeps wanting to pop out of my ear.  The control buttons are easy to use, but if you bump the control button into something (wall, door) it is easy to fast forward/rewind/stop the player.  This is another eason I think the plastic carrying case could have been improved to add some protection to the face of the player.<p>Sound quality is great and the batteries last several hours at least.  I have only gone through one battery so far and I have owned this two weeks.<p>I would highly recommend this player to anyone.  <p>Plus - style, sound quality, functionality of buttons, display.<br>Minus - earphones, plastic case.

<Content>i've had mine for less than a year, and within the first couple months it started to break.  i've done nothing out of the ordinary with this player.  it shuts off mid-use, it refuses to play certain songs already programmed (that worked when initially downloaded into the player), cuts off in the middle of half of the songs (which were complete when first downloaded into the player), and now thinks that half of the memory is used up when there are NO songs programmed into it!  Oh, and the &quot;stop&quot; button stopped working and now i can't use any other function on the player or change any settings because it is also the &quot;down&quot; function on the menu.

<Content>I've had mine for about 3 months and so far everythings been working good with the exception of the head phones. I just bought new ones, I've dropped mine five or six times on concrete and there has been no change in its perfomance, the only problem is when using the belt clip when i work out, I sometimes bump the mp3 player making the song stop, I guess its because I hit the stop button, but other than that and those annoying head phones , its perfect. When I bought mine it came with a free 32mb memory card, so with out it , it'd probably hold 30 songs give or take a few.

<Title>Not What You Want
<Date>Sun Feb 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have had nothing but trouble with my Rio Sport. First of all the internal memeory dosent really hold that many songs. You might get 33 songs on it and it will be full. I purchased another 128MB stick and that lets me get another 33 songs on it.<p>I have gone through one battery after another it just eats them up. The power button has had a mind of its own and doesn't want to turn on sometimes and other times wont shut off. Then the internal memory just wont play on mine. I have 33 songs on it and it can only find the songs that I have on my memory stick and when I connect it to the software it shows full but no songs on there to delete. So I have an internal memory that is useless.<p>Get a player that costs more and holds more songs because after you get the memory stick to add you will end up spending more and still end up with less music. The headphones that come with it are also worthless and uncomfortable so you will buy new ones of those also.

<Title>Terrible Design...Do Not Buy!
<Date>Mon Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Terrible design, short battery life, the tuner doesn't work, the holding case is awkward, and the headphones are cheap.<p>My wife bought me this player for Christmas.  It is very nice to be able to listen to MP3s (from my copied CDs) as opposed to the endless loop on commercial radio, however, that's the case with all MP3 players.  On the good side, the display is fine and the software is easy to learn.  Now for the long list of problems...<p>1.	Design - For years I've owned a Sony Sport Walkman (you know, they're yellow).  It has served me well, but it only has a radio.  This MP3 player has a raised circular Play-pause/forward/reverse/stop button.  I am constantly bumping it.  It is incredibly frustrating.  Like most people I listen to my "sport" player while I'm on the move (working out, mowing the grass, walking the dog, etc.).  My old Walkman's buttons are recessed and I never accidentally push them.  With the Rio, the slightest bump and the song will start again, stop, or pause.  What's worse is trying press the circle properly without looking at it (like I said, usually it's clipped to my belt and I'm doing something else, hence the "sport" part of this player's description).  No matter if I put it in my pocket, clip it to the front of me, side of me, or back of me I always bump it again and again.  It's so frustrating.  There's a "key protect" in the menus, but navigating to it requires you to stop what you're doing.  Not convenient!  With my old Walkman I could easily press the recessed buttons when I wanted without a key protect.  The design of the buttons makes this player worthless.  But, if that's not enough...<br>2.	Battery life - The player sucks batteries.  In my old Walkman I'd change them every six to eight weeks (two AAA's).  With this player I change the 1 AAA battery every 8 to 10 hours.  What a joke!<br>3.	AM/FM Tuner - It simply doesn't work.  Even the stations that come in crystal clear on my old Walkman don't come in at all.  <br>4.	Holding case - The MP3 player has an awkward plastic case (for clipping to your clothes).  It makes the on/off, volume, and menu buttons hard to push.  It also makes it hard to plug in the headphones.<br>5.	Headphones - Speaking of the headphones...they're complete junk.  You'll need another pair.<br>6.	Software - It was easy to learn at first and transferring files to the player is simple.  However, I can't pull over my play lists from Windows Media Player (maybe I'm just missing something) and each time I copy another CD I need to refresh the music library which takes a bunch of time.<p>In summary, this player is a complete piece of junk.  Avoid it at all costs.

<Title>Buyer beware !!!!!
<Date>Tue Mar 09 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The one good thing about this machine is that when it does work, and if you use a pair of upgraded headphones (not the ones supplied with the player), the sound quality delivered to the listener is quite good - superb in fact.<p>As for the bads, and there are many:<br>1. the plastic clip-on case (not pictured in the on-line advertisement on Amazon or anywhere else) doesn't actually fit the player, so if you want to press buttons during use, you have to stop what you're doing and remove the player to be able to access the buttons - this makes it incredibly impractical as a &quot;sports&quot; music player.<p>2. within 2 weeks the actual waist/belt clip simply snapped (during routine, ordinary use) because it is made of poor quality, thin rigid plastic.  Result: when I use the player now, I have to carry it in my hand or keep it in my shorts pocket.  I have called the company numerous times only to be told that no additional holders are available, they're on back order.  I guess other people have had the same problem as me!!<p>3. battery life is more like 4-5 hours if you use the player in a gym where it is likely to be noisy (often with background music, machines, people yapping) and you need to crank it up.  The advertised 14 hour battery life may be attainable if you are listening in a quiet room and not moving a muscle.<p>4. the headphones supplied with the player stink, don't even try to use them<p>5. the software interface for Windows is a disaster and has crashed several times, requiring time-consuming un-installs and re-installs, ultimately requiring that I ditch the CD supplied with the player and go to the company website, under phone direction from their help line, and download the on-line version.  Song order gets jumbled by the machine during transfer so the coherence of an album becomes unrecognizable.  Finally I learned to bypass the company software altogether - music can be downloaded to it via Windows Media Player, as long as you have the most recent version (which I needed to download for this sole purpose).<p>My verdict is that the device has promise - sound quality itself is great and the price is competitive, but there are so many bugs with the product (hardware and software) that I think the company should be allowed a hiatus to stop and figure out what it is doing, and come back to us 6 months from now with apologies and major upgrades.  They need to realize they can't skimp on the holder for the player.   Had I known all this earlier, I would have spent the extra $100 or so on the smaller iPod.   I have the bitter feeling that this was $118 poorly spent.   My advice to any potential buyer would be to STAY AWAY from this company and product.<p>I could go on but I need to go to work.<p>Good luck!

<Title>It's great but the battery life isn't
<Date>Fri Mar 19 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This MP3 player is about perfect. The interface for adding or removing files is exceptional. A child could set up and operate this thing. The armband is a great addition but the ear buds tend to slip out when you sweat, I recommend getting different headphones. You can upgrade the memory which is a huge addition as it allows you to spend less money than just buying a 40gig I-Pod which is going to die after 6 or 7 months. My only complaint is that they say you have 10 hours of playing time on one AAA battery. Unless there are some nuclear-powered super batteries I am unaware of, that time quote is a farce. You're lucky to get half that play time on one battery. I switched to a new battery yesterday. Used it for 1 1/2 hours at work, 2 hours at home loading music (I'm picky about my arrangements OK, sue me) and the battery is half empty according to the meter on the display. That being the case, it looks like I'll get MAYBE 6 or seven hours..certainly not 10. Other than that fact, this thing is great. I use it for running and if I'm running for more than six hours its from the police, not for leisure so my problems are far beyond the battery life of my equipment if you get my drift.

<Title>Pay proper precaution before buying
<Date>Wed Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Generally, I like the player's size and how well it works while out and about.  But it's in no way perfect.  Here's what I've learned, having very recently received my S35S player.  <p>1.  FM Radio.  Everybody complains about it.  There's some sort of tuning strength function on this device, as when I press play while the tuner is active, a different icon comes up and the signal seems to change.  Hmmm...  <p>2.  Stopwatch.  Hard to get to for being a &quot;sports&quot; device.<p>3.  Battery strength indicator.  A lot of people complain about this one too.  For those people, note there is a battery type setting (Alkaline/NiMH).  Also, with NiMH, also note there's different battery capacities.  I've seen AAA range from 300 ma to over 800 ma, depending on who made them and what you paid.  Battery properties, such as voltage fall off rates in your battery affect how long this player will run on one charge.  <p>4.  Time and date.  Remove the battery and the &quot;tuned&quot; station is remembered.  But...the time and date need to be reset.  This MUST be fixed.  As a side note, the player settings also revert to default after battery removal.  Why don't they just save to onboard memory???  Time I can understand, but the general settings??<p>5. Installation.  I too had problems, which took 45 minutes to finally resolve.  You MUST install the Rio Manager software, which I found disappointing. All I know is that before installing the software the machine didn't recognize it, and after a couple reboots it did.  (As a USB storage device, Windows &quot;should&quot; have assigned it a drive letter automatically.) I use other player software, which may NOW work, but I just haven't tried yet.  Do NOT use Real One player.  It's just a conduit for being spammed with ads.  I used to use it, but found at least Microsoft didn't spam me with ads using Media Player.<p>6.  Menu.  Sometimes setting menu changes don't appear to take effect.  I have to go back in and double check the settings.

<Title>Great Player for Working Out...
<Date>Mon Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I've had this thing for a little over a month now.  The good things are that it holds about 30-35 average length songs, has an external card slot which can use either MMC or SD media, uses a single AAA battery, backlit display (with a lot of information, some of the cheaper MP3 players out there don't even display the song title), small form factor, belt clip, arm band, &quot;FM radio.&quot;<p>Some things that could be improved on are the &quot;FM radio.&quot;  Just like everyone says, reception is still poor, even with firmware 1.60.  The belt clip is cool, but it let the player fly off my sweat pants and hit the sidewalk while jogging (use the arm band).  The ear phone cable could be at least 6-12 inches longer.  The phones are decent, but another pair may be better.  The Rio Music Manager could be improved.  Doesn't display total playlist MB size.<p>Overall, I'm very pleased with this player.  Battery life is good for the battery size (have yet to replace the battery in a month of using it about 2 times a week for an hour).  The player case is nice, I'm glad to see the hold feature added (might be useful to still allow you to adjust the volume even with hold on, but this might make other people mad).

<Title>Coolest unit I could find
<Date>Wed Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have been doing tons of research on various MP3 players, and only about half of them are Mac friendly.  After concluding that this was the right model for me, I was a bit worried about all the reviews stating the reception is poor.  Well let me tell you, I live in Oregon, and I can't even get TV reception with regular or enhanced antennas.  The tuner worked fine from inside my apartment! And as for people stating there is no lock feature, THERE IS. Read the manual.  Press and hold MENU, then hit enter.  It locks the buttons in case of accidental bumps. My only complaint is that sometimes the sound (Bass in particular) during MP3 playback sounds distorted..  Then after playing around with the unit a bit, it starts to come in clear. Anyone else with this problem? Otherwise, I think it's a great, feature-rich, sleek-designed, sporty unit!

<Date>Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I give this little thing a 4.5, actually.  After reading some of the other reviews I ran across when deciding whether or not to buy this, I must point out that I'm probably not the norm.  I'm a licensed driver.  This apparently gives me an advantage with software installation and player operation.  I put the CD in, followed the directions on the screen, copied the songs to my player, and was done.  The longest part was waiting for the Rio manager to sort through my MP3s.  The FM reception picks up the stations I'm interested in, so I'm pleased.  I still haven't upgraded the firmware (the website is a little slow) - but everything works like I hoped it would.  I noticed a bit of the grainy reception in a station, but the tuner was just a bonus, in my mind.  The menu options are easy to use and figure out.  The sound is really good - I think some people expect too much when buying electronics sometimes.  I didn't give it a five because of its downside - requires batteries.  A perfect product would run off of oxygen in the air or something.  The only real difference I noticed between this and the Rio S50 is the included rechargeable batteries ...

<Title>Well Worth It!
<Date>Sat Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I love my new SonicBlue Rio!  After having read every user review ...I had some reservations with the key complaints (which were relatively minor to begin with):  FM radio, software use/compatibility, and headset comfort.  But given Amazon.com's competitively low price by far, I went ahead with the purchase.<p>When I received it (approx. 2 days - using regular shipping), I had prepared myself to encounter problems with the aforementioned.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the FM stereo feature not only works very well, but it did so both at the office (inside a 5-story building) and at the gym (converted industrial steel & concrete building).  While the FM radio feature is usually not the reason one buys an MP3 player, it does come in handy when tuning into the TV monitors at the gym.<p>The software installed quickly and is very user-friendly.  The downloads only take a matter of minutes for an entire playlist.<p>The earphones/headset is not only comfortable, but fits securely in both ears.  The overall quality of sound is quite good, but as other users have mentioned, if you're a real audiophile, simply invest in a better headset that provides the heavy bass, etc.  Otherwise, I doubt one would notice the difference much.<p>The unit itself fits ergonomically in either hand.  The backlighting in the display is very useful, but the text can be too small to read when engaged in rigorous workouts, but that's somewhat expected in such a compact device anyway.  The option to wear it on your arm or use the belt clip is also a big plus.<p>I don't know if it helps to lower one's expectations, but this unit worked out very well for me.  After thoroughly comparing it to others in and out of it's class, I'd highly recommend this product.  It's well worth the small investment!  The only thing missing is a "free set of Ginsu Knives" to accompany it!

Other than that player worked very well and had no problems with downloading music and were very happy with it other than what I thought was a minor problem....UNTIL....I called tech support and after 1/2 hour wait (no 800# so MY dime to boot) they tell me to send it back. That was on Jan 3rd...its now Feb 14th and still nothing! I finally call back on Feb 13 and wait on hold for another 50 minutes this time, and after reaching a person they agree that they recieved the player but couldnt tell me anymore than that and to just wait a couple more weeks! UNBELIEVABLE! I should have just returned it through Amazon. So beware...player works great when it works, but if it breaks and you need to send it back youll be very sorry. At least I know to stay away from Sonic in the future....good thing because I just about purchased a Replay last week, but went with the Tivo instead after this mess.

<Content>This player is fine as an MP3 player but the FM tuner is not really functional.  I live in manhattan where there are plenty of strong radio signals but the SONIC blue only picks up about 2 stations and they sound terrible. In contrast, my 10 dollar sony analog tuning radio picks up a couple dozen radio stations at least and it is about the same size. Also, if you do buy  this unit you should know to take off the wrap-around-ear plastic things on the earphones which are removable and very uncomfortable in my opinion.
