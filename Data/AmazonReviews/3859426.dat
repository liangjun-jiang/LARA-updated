<Content>I think the product has excellent sound qulaity. Also, it is definitely better than the Apple ipods. However, it the maximum volume level is not that high to cancel the nosie especially when you're flying.

<Title>5 Star Sound 
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to give this Player a 5 Star Rating because it sounds so good right out of the box.  You don't have to upgrade the headphones as you do with many other players. The included earbuds sound great and almost made me take my V-Moda Vibes back to Costco, but the Sony's have a slightly different sound ( little more bass) , and they are a little bigger than the Vibes.    I read a lot of reviews at different websites and I thought many of the reviewers were just blowing smoke, or the retailers were just publishing the positive reviews.  Many of the reviewers said this was their first player, so I figured what heck do they know about MP3 players.  So after I got mine, I loaded 51 of my favorite songs and proceeded to listen via my V-Moda Vibes Earbuds.   I also went back and listened to my Sony mini disc player just to compare the sound and have a reference point.  All I can say is wow, what an experience.  I wanted to put the unit down after about 2 hours of listening and go to sleep, but I couldn't.  I listened to all 51 songs ( some multiple times)  until 3:00 am, the day after Christmas.  I heard new detail and clarity  that I had not heard before,and even at low volume. I just got lost in the music and forgot I was listening to an MP3 player.  Incredible Sound and dead silence in between songs,no hiss or digital artifiacts creeping into the sound.  It reminded me of the first time I heard a Professional Series Casette Walkman ( About $ 400.00) back in the 80s.     The volume range on the player is 0 - 30.  I found that 10 is very comfortable, and the sound is even good at lower levels, which with most of my other players,  is not the case.  The player has 5 Pre Set EQ Settings and 2 Custom Setting ( great for different users, or different headsets if you use a different set for working out,vs general listening)  It also has some other sound processing settings that compensate for  some of the differences in bitrates rates on the MP3 files.  It has a feature called DSEE ( Digital Sound Enhancement ?) that almost sounds like cross between BBE processing and DBX Processing.  It would not surprise me it was either or.  It also has built in Surround Sound Options ( I am assuming for the Videos) ,Sound Normalizer and Clear Sound.  They all do something so you have to experiment with settings to get the sound you prefer.  The good thing is when you scroll over a setting, the player changes the sound to let you preview that setting before you actually select and keep the setting.  My initial listening was with the  default factory settings and I was very happy with the sound, but I have now made adjustments to compensate for the headphones I use.  There have been some complaints from other reviewers about the length of the headphone cord even with the extension cord.  I agree, it is shorter than most cords, but there is an upside to the length that I only noticed today.  If you are excercising or working in the yard with these earbuds, you don't have to worry about getting the cord tangled or snagging on something because the cord stays close to your body.  There are times when I wish it was about 3 inches longer, mainly when walking. Since there is no belt clip, the player has to go in the pocket for now.   Now back to the player itself.  It is easier to navigate than the 600 series.  ( I have both).  The click wheel on the 800 series is more tactile than the controls on the 600 series players and doesn't require as much thumb movement. I have never used an Apple Ipod, but most people talk about the click wheel on the Ipod and how easy it is to use, I can't imagine anything much easier than this Sony player's click wheel,and I have used a ton players, other than Ipod.  This the fastest and  most reponsive player I have used.  I have many others, but they all have that awful boot time before you actually can play music. The Creative Zens will start fast if it's not a complete cold start, but this player will start about 5 seconds after you hit any key from a cold start, and faster after you have been using it, and power it off for moment. I you advance to new track , it is quicker than most of my other players. (It takes about 15 seconds for my Zen Micro to start cold and about 20 secs for the IRiver HD 320.)   It sync's really fast using Media Player 11, and also allows you to drag and drop music which is big shift for Sony digital music players. Displays Album Art and file details.  I did not have any lock ups or freezes when trying to sync the player.  The paperwork included with player says there is a a firmware upgrade availalbe now, but I see no need for it, but if you buy music online, you might want the firmware upgrade.  The player displays Photos and Videos  and  I have used both features. You can view photos and listen to music at the same time.   This easiet way to get the photos on the player is to Drag and Drop them into photo folder via Windows Explorer.   I also moved a couple of videos to the player.   This is not easiet process unless you just happen to have a lot Mp4 Vidieo Files stored.  I used a program that I use with my PSP to convert video formats to whatever format you need. Once you get the video on the unit, it is crytal clear, although with a screen this small you probably wouldn't  want to watch full lenght movies on it.  I din't buy this player to view videos or view photos, but it is a nice option.  The build quality of this player is awesome and almost makes you want to treat it like a fine piece of jewelry.  Therein lies another problem, there are not many accessories including cases for this player, so remember that if you buy this player.  I am currently using the little case that came with my V-Moda Earbuds. If I didn't say it before, this is a really small player.  Another reveiwer commented that she almost took it back because it was "so tiny", but ultimately kept it because it sounded so good.  Even after reading those comments, I was surprised at how small it was when I opened the box.  This player is small enough to fit in the coin pocket of most mens pants which is where I have it most of the time, but I am also afraid of damaging it so I will be ordering the case from Sony, which is the only case I have seen available so far.  The player does not have a power light to let you know that it is on, but uses a fade in / fade out clock calendar display that you see every few seconds.  (In order to save battery power, there may be a way to disable that feature in the menu)    There are only four things I don't like about this player, but I knew about 3 of them before I bought the unit so I can't be too hard on Sony.  1.) Proprietary Cable for Charging Battery and Connection to PC - I have an idea why they did this and I hope I am wrong.  If they did it to make you buy cables from them, that is short sighted.  That just creates ill will with consumers, and it won't be long before counterfit cables or cheap cables show up Ebay. 2.)  Lack of Accessories ( Cases)- This may change as the Sony units becomes more popular.  I tried some of the Ipod Nano Cases and while they will protect the player, they make it hard to use. 3.)  No FM Tuner  ( the 600 series has the Tuner) - The 600 series players offer the  FM Tuner,costs less money, sounds just as good.  Not sure what Sony was thinking here.   4.) Headphone Jack on the bottom of unit. I wasn't expecting this, even the Sony 600s series players have the headphone jack on the top. I thought maybe this was done to keep all of the cables ( Charging/Sync and Audio Togther) but you can't listen to the player when it is being charged on your PC.  I haven't tried charging it with a CAR USB Charger yet. I hope it will still play while being charged if necessary, but with an advertised battery life of 33 hours, it should not need to be charge very often.  I have been playing it for two and half weeks now on the original charge.  As I said earlier, I give the player 5 Stars for Sound Quality, Ease of Use, Build Quality and Battery Life.  The proprietary cable thing  and lack of a tuner concern me enough to lower the rating half star for each on the product, epescially when a tuner was included in the 600 series.  I don't want  to call the 600 series a lower end unit because it sounds identical to the 800 series ( when using the same headphones)  and has the same interface except for the Tuner Screen, but the build quality is different, I won't even say that it is lower, it is just different and in someways better.   My suggestion for you if you are looking at this unit is to get at least the 8 GB model, especially if you put any video or photos on it. The time machine shuffle is feature that works well if you have large collection of music. It is very similar to DJ Shuffle on the Creative Zen, and it will keep your listening experience fresh, as long as your ID3 Tagging info is up to date.   Finally, if you are a person that really, really loves music and liked the sound of the Net Walkman Mini Disc players, and early Non MP3 Sony CD Players you will love this player.  I listened to some of the same tracks on both players, this Walkman is so much better sound wise plus you get the convenience of instant access to hundreds of songs.    This is a very good player and I don't think you will be dissappointed if you buy it.  I had given up on Sony in the MP3 market because I was tired of converting all my MP3s to ATRAC. ( even though I like the ATRAC Sound) Also, the thumbdrive Sony MP3 players just didn't quite hit a homerun with me, but they definitely have a winner here, and no I do not work for Sony. I just pray Sony doesn't blow it by making a major design change( other than the USB Connection) to this player.

<Title>WARNING!! Don't Buy If You Like Your Music Loud
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>All the reviews for this player are somewhat true. The player does have some great features such as a great display, long battery life, and easy uploading options. However, the NWZ-A816 has a major flaw, it's NOT Loud Enough. After unsuccessfully searching the internet and calling Sony's customer service for a solution, I have decided to return the player to the store. For those who think I didn't disable AVLS(volume limit), I did. I also messed around with the equalizer, sound enhancer, and ensured my songs where of the best quality. After wasting hours trying to solve this problem, the A816 still lacks the earsplitting sound I am accustom to. Who is Sony to limit my volume? If I want to go deaf or get tendinitis that is my choice.Although the A816's has some great features, Sony's decision to not allow one to jam, negates them all. It is for this reason and this reason alone that I give the A816 two stars. I would also like to take this opportunity to apologize to my dependable and thunderous Sansa for trying to replace her.

<Title>Great sound, great build quality, great menu.
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am attached to my laptop all day long at work so I never justified myself to get a nice MP3 player (I do own a cheap player for mowing the lawn). Why do I need one? But I decided to get myself a gadget to start 2008. After reading many reviews I landed on this A816. Part of the reason is that "Walkman" name.   The previous reviews were right! The build quality is great, it fits nicely in my palm and the controls are solid yet easy to use. I removed all the music and movie files that came with the player immediately and loaded my own ones so I have a fair judgment. The moment I put up the earphones that came with it, man I am SO happy that I get this player! Although Windows Media Player on my laptop offers a lot of options, the sound quality coming out of my company-issued Dell just can't match this little player. And I spent a lot of money getting the high end headphones in search for great sound. This walkman gives great sound reproduction at low volume (I don't normally go beyond 10) which is awesome. The included earphone totally surprised me, it is one of the best earphones I've ever tried.  The intelligent shuffle function is handy. It somehow knows how to create a play list out of my classical, pop, heavy metal, and jazz genre and arrange them as if playing from just one album. By turning on the dynamic volume normalizer it makes listening even more enjoyable at the same volume level.  The downside of this player? Maybe a FM tuner would be nice but that doesn't bother me. I do have one complaint, though, you can't listen to the music when it is connected to the computer. I WANT MY MUSIC, NOW! Luckily, it recharges fairly quickly.  All in all, this is a great MP3 player that you'll want to listen to all day long.

<Title>IPOD Beater
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I did the research and tried all the newer MP3 players. My friends insisted I get an IPOD.    This device beat the IPOD. It is cheaper,better sound, comes with great ear phones and is easier to use.   I prefer the Sony hardware to the Apple Disc on the IPOD>  If you get this player, you will not be disappointed. It syncs seamlessly with Windows media player.   25 hours of battery and compatible with all formats.  A winner

<Title>So far, so good.
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this unit for about 3 weeks now and, so far, I'm pretty impressed.  Sound quality is excellent.  I've even dropped a couple of times on the asphalt while jogging and have had no problems.  That does bring me to the one downside, though.  I wish there were more accessories available like an armband to use while exercising.  This is a new unit so I'm sure that stuff will come.

<Title>Excellent Sound Quality
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Have had this player for a few days now and I'm impressed. I also own a Creative Zen, which has its own positives but here's what put this Sony over the top for me-  * Excellent sound quality. The earphones make a huge difference. * Ease of drag-and-drop music transfer from my computer.  * Excellent battery life. Seems like even heavy use all day makes no dent in battery life. Rated for 33 hours on one charge. I would say that's about right. * Solid construction, feel and tactile feedback. I could operate it without looking at it on the second day.  I don't miss having a FM radio or voice recorder. My local FM stations are lousy anyway and I can use my cell phone for voice memos. Sony has hit bullseye with this Walkman.

<Title>Without question the finest mp3 player I've ever owned...
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As the title makes clear, this is, without a shadow of a doubt, the finest mp3 player I've ever owned, and it may well be the best $100 (2GB model (A815)) I've ever spent.  Not only is the audio quality far, far higher (simply in a league of its own...you can actually hear frequencies below 100 hz/above 5 kHz) than Creative or especially Sansa (nothing but distortion at any acceptable level of treble or bass equalization with the latter), but the build quality alone should make you understand why it costs more than its competitors.  Like you, I'm fed-up with garbage players that A). work for six months, then die for no particular reason; B). never work properly, having DRM issues (see: Sansa), sound-quality issues (see: Sansa and Creative (distortion and no treble, respectively)), freezing issues (see: Sansa and Creative (at least Creative gives you a hard-reset button)), etc. (the list goes on and on); C). both A and B.  The solution?  Sony!  Sony has always been at the forefront of the world's technology in terms of both build/AV quality and innovation (usually too far ahead (MiniDisc, UMD, SACD, Blu-Ray)), and this product succeeds with flying colors in both categories; there is simply no comparison.  If you're fed up with junk mp3 players (and the iFollow), give Sony a shot; spend a little extra and get a product that makes you want to use it!

<Title>Great iPod Alternative
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have often wondered what the big problem is with finding a decent alternative to the iPod.  I had used iRiver products for years, but they seem to have lost their way.  Sony seemed like a lead pipe cinch to counter the iPod monopoly, but curiously they didn't seem that interested until now.  I didn't need another MP3 device, but I was in Best Buy checking out the stock and saw this tiny Sony and decided to give it a shot.  With my iRiver I had loaded something like 400 of my favorite CDs onto their 20 GB device and never felt like changing them.  It served me very well for years.  The problem was I would download singles and newer songs I never seemed to listen to.  I needed something that would handle 400 or so songs that would last me a month or so at a clip with daily gym use.  This Sony device was so small and has such a nice price point (around $130 if I recall correctly) I decided to take a flyer on it.  Sony is a brand I have trusted for many years.  I'm glad I did.  There is no carrying case or other accessories to my knowledge as of yet, but this is a great machine.  Relatively easy to load, it sounds great.  I even tossed the phones and bought a $100 Logitech wireless set and it still sounds great.  Logitech's product is actually designed for the iPod, but it still works fine with this tiny device.  The person who complained about the volume might be onto something, but though I'm a big volume guy myself it's not that big of a deal for me.  It wouldn't surprise me if that person was a little deaf honestly.  The only thing that bugs me is so minor it's laughable.  On the display your can see the track, song artwork, the CD it comes from, the artist and the genre.  Below that is another icon, ostensibly for data of some kind which shows up as unknown in my case for every song.  I'd love to remove that from my view to make more room for the artwork.  Anyway, this is a very nice bargain and seems pretty durable.  Hopefully Sony will make an all out charge against the iPod's marketshare and we can all benefit.  I'd buy this again in a second.  Hopefully they continue to make MP3 players with more capacity and accessories.  The battery life is tremendous.  Hope this helps put someone over the top if they are on the fence.  I'm impressed.
