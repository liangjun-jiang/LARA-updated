<Title>elegance and long battery life
<Date>Tue Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am very satisfied with my purchase. I wanted something small, which would fit my pocket, at the same time something elegant and with long battery span. It is very easy to operate because of different sorting options (type of music, artist, album). This mp3 player meets all my requirements.

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a mp3 player to bring to my desk for work, listen to in the car and something I could use while I was on the treadmill at the gym.  This mp3 player is perfect for my needs.  I really didn't want to spend the money on an ipod, and I didn't need videos and other stuff.  I just wanted music. The 2GB memory is more than enough for me, and it does what I need it to do, play my songs to keep me occupied during work, driving or running.  The ear buds that came with it are uncomfortable to me.  But that could be me, I'm not a fan of the ear buds, I'd rather have regular headphones. Windows media player is a bit cumbersome, and you have to be patient the first couple times you make a playlist to get used to it, but  I've made 3 playlists I have over 170 songs on the player and I haven't had to go back and do it again unless I want more songs.  It's a great mp3 player, and would recommend it for anyone who was looking for one.

<Title>Shuts Off
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player almost a year ago. I used it mainly for gym use. About a month or two ago, I noticed it just shutting off for no reason. I then relized that everytime I tapped the top of the mp3 player, its shut off. It has gotten so bad that I cant even use it at the gym unless I move VERY SLOWLY! so it doesnt aggrivate it and shuts off...VERY FRUSTRATING! Customer service said they would replace it, but going through UPS and sending it to them and THEN taking 4-6 weeks?..I think I may just go with the smallest I-pod for the gym next time. I am thinking if I wasnt using it for gym use, that it may have lasted longer...

<Title>MP3

<Content>Good product. I think it's a much better buy than the IPod, because these competeing products do a lot to make up for the fact that they aren't mac. It is strong built, more capacity for the price, really easy to use. Perfect for anyone who wants an MP3 and not just an "IPod".
