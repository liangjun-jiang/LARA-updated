<Product Name>Apple iPod shuffle 1 GB Blue (2nd Generation)
<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - A steep price for a starter MP3 Player
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The third generation of the iPod Shuffle is similar to the second.  It's a great MP3 player for working out or running, especially if you are a die-hard Apple fan.  However, the steep price means you had better review all your options before you choose this.  Pros - Small size - Nice case design - Many color options - Highly durable player - Apple reputation  Cons - High price point - Less durable shell - Proprietary dock for syncing - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability - iTunes software with limited formats (MP3, AAC) - Competing products offer more capacity for less $$  The Form Factor  This little guy is small!  The body has a spring loaded clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt without any extra case.  Apple added a few extra color options, including the popular purple.  It comes in a composite case. The 2nd generation's case seemed a little bit more durable.  The basic controls remain the same (fast forward, rewind, pause, and play) to access your music collection.  There is a headphone jack which you also use to mount this on the sync dock.  A standard USB B port would have been preferable to this as well.  Storage Capacity  Apple made it available only in 1GB sizes, same as the 2nd generation.  It would have made more sense to bump it up to at least 2GB.  The competing Zen Stone Plus by Creative offers 2GB (twice the songs), an FM tuner and the ability to see song titles for less money.  Sandisk also has some lower capacity Sansa models at similar price points.

Even with the new player composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse.  Software  When you only have 1GB to fill, having to use iTunes software to do it seems excessive.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, the software is not going to be an issue for you.  Price Point    This unit is pricy at about $80.  As of October 2007, 1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail.  That's what makes this price somewhat hard to swallow.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved.  This particular model requires you to pay a premium for it.  If you just want a really small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, the Creative Zen Stone gives you 1GB for $40 and 2GB for $65.  Sandisk Sansa has similarly priced models.  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, this is it.  If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 ($60 more) but gives you 4 times the capacity and the ability to play video.  Overall this is a good player at a price that could be less.  Weigh your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Apple 1GB Shuffle - New Lower Price, Same Popular Player, Check it Out!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content> Apple's iPod Shuffle is a compact MP3 player that's great for working out, running or just plain music listening on the go.  The new lower price as of January 2008 makes the relatively high cost of the device a little more bearable. Great as a gift, extra player, or exercise companion.   Pros  - Newly lowered price!!!! - Compact and functional design - Nicely integrated clip - No case needed! - Great family of Apple accessories - Great for those already used to iTunes - Included in-ear headphones are great for a starter pair - Lots of great color options (silver, green, purple, blue)  - Highly durable player  - Apple brand and reputation   Cons  - Still a premium price compared to competing players (total $ and $ per gigabyte) - Competing products offer more features, including fm radio and voice recording - No screen to view track names - Difficult to control / select tracks via playlists - Proprietary dock / jack for syncing  - Small capacity (1GB) with no expandability  - Limited native file format support in iTunes (MP3, AAC), though you can easily convert  - No drag and drop music control - Non iTunes fans are still forced to deal with software limitations  The Form Factor   Size has always been the iPod shuffle's greatest asset.  The integrated clip is no doubt its second greatest asset.   This unit works fine with no extra case, though there are still options. The composite case comes in one of several popular color options, including the silver, blue, green and purple. And of course, the unit's durability is great, probably because of the simple design.   Apple chose to use a proprietary headphone jack for syncing, which most competing players accomplish with a standard USB B port.  Overall, still a great design.  Durability   Apple deserves points for the more durable player in this group. Even with the composite body, these guys do hold up to a lot of abuse. Creative's failure rates are too high, but Sandisk's Clip is gaining ground in this area.  Capacity  The 1GB size for the shuffle was the only option from Apple for a long time.  The market has been flooded with 2GB players from the competition.  In addition to lowering the price in February 2008, Apple finally added a 2GB option available now at Apple stores. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012LWG9O/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1826215-5574467">Apple iPod shuffle 2 GB Silver (2nd Generation)</a>  Still, as Apple finally ups their size, Sansa now has their Clip in a 4GB size.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00126V8WU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1826215-5574467">SanDisk Sansa Clip 4 GB MP3 Player (Silver)</a>  Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB MP3 Player <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUJ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1826215-5574467">SanDisk Sansa c150 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1826215-5574467">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IM9542/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1826215-5574467">SanDisk SDMX7-2048 Sansa c250 2 GB MP3 Player</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W09ZTK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1826215-5574467">SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Features and Software  Competing players over simple screens for track viewing as well as FM radio and voice recording.  The Zen Stone Plus by Creative and the Sandisk Clip each offer all three features at better price points. Apple's reliability and brand loyalty has allowed the shuffle to survive with limited features.  Competing players also offer drag and drop syncing using standard USB cables or, in the case of the Sansa Express, via direct USB.  Apple still requires the proprietary dock.  For a 1GB MP3 player it seems excessive to have to use iTunes software to sync your software.  Competing players have even worse software, but allow you to drag and drop files on these devices like USB thumb drives.  iTunes is both a curse and a blessing, depending on your point of view.  For those who are used to iTunes or totally new to MP3s, the interface can be a great plus.  For anybody who want more direct control over their music collection, some of the features within iTunes can become burdensome.  Once again, if you LOVE Apple and iTunes, or if you are totally new to MP3s the software will still be a net plus for you.   For those that care about file options, Apple's software allows only MP3 and AAC. You can easily convert other formats to these, but be aware of the limits.  This is only a negative for those really loyal to a certain file format, such as the growing group of WMA users.  Having to have 2 format copies of all your music can really hurt as your collection grows.  Sound   The sound this unit produces is pretty good though not great. While I still feel the first generation shuffle sounded much better, the tradeoff was worth the smaller size.   Cost   The shuffle's price has finally come down to about $50 for 1GB or $65 for 2GB. While not a bargain, this price makes the sting much less painful for Apple loyalists.  On a dollar per gigabyte and absolute dollar cost, Apple continues to charge a premium for their brand.    1GB of flash memory is going for under $10 retail, one fifth the lowered cost of the shuffle.  In addition, competing players like the Sansa Clip continue to offer more features at a better prices. If you want a small player and you are open to brands beyond Apple, your options continue to expand.  In addition to the Creative Stone and the Sansa Clip, new models from Samsung and Sony have added even more options.  Once again, Apple's reputation is well deserved. This model requires you to pay a premium for it, though a slightly shrinking premium.  :-D  Conclusion  If you must have Apple and need a small player for high impact workouts, choose this or one of the new 2GB shuffles. If you want to stay with Apple and can afford it, stepping up to the Apple iPod nano 4GB will cost you $140 but gives you 4 times the capacity and video.  Still, if you're not an Apple die-hard, the Sansa Clip and other options deserve consideration.  Research your options and choose the player that's right for you.  Overall this is a good player at an improved price.    Enjoy!!!

<Title>Awesome technology

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0QIRC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-1826215-5574467">Apple 1 GB iPod shuffle Green (3rd Generation)</a> I bought the 1 GB iPod Shuffle to listen to podcasts or music while I'm working around house and garden.  I like to listen to music or talk radio while I'm working, but because I'm always on the go, I don't like to carry a radio with me.  I often lose reception; the radio is heavy or in the way;  the batteries die too soon; and the sound quality of small portable radios is lousy.  With the Shuffle being about the size of a postage stamp, having a clip, and weighing next to nothing, I can attach it to my shirt or belt and keep working while I listen to my favorite show or music and the sound quality is awesome.  I can listen to hours worth of podcasts and/or music because not only will that tiny little thing hold so much entertainment, but the rechargeable battery will last up to 12 hours!  A lot longer than I'll be working in the garden.
