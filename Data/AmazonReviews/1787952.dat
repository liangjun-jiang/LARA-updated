<Content>I bought this MP3 player back in early August, and got a 2Gig SD card for the add on as well. So far, it has not gone defect on me yet.  A few bottom lines are, you can't view text or pictures at the same time when the music is playing, you cannot change the color of mp3 player skin(always blue) unless someone comes up with some magic hack to change the GUI all together, also the FM tuner has a bit of a weak reception compared to what Sony Mp3 players have as well but not too weak.  Overall, it's a descent mp3 player if you are on a tight budget or want something cheaper than an iPod.  
<Overall>4
