<Date>Wed May 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>great player. 50$ bucks cheaper than nano is what made me buy this. but then its features keep amazing me. fm player, recorder, fm recorder, photo viewer, video player, cool looking. i have run it for two weeks now and have faced no major problems. downsides: 1) doesnt come with armband. 2) Slideshow feature doesnt work 3) slightly heavier and probably thicker than nano

<Title>A quality product
<Date>Sun Jun 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this to replace my SanDisk SDMX1 mp3 player. The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating is that the manual is rudimentary at the best. It tells how to use a function but does not explain what the funtion is for. The navigation is somewhat odd. Although my music are organized in folders, once they are copied to the e260, the folders are no more visible. The player lets you play all songs, by artist, albums, genre, playlists, etc. This is completely different from the SDMX1 in which you navigate by folders. The photo display is sharp with good contrast. The video playing is also very good. I still recommend it.

<Title>Disappointment 
<Date>Mon Jun 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I went to BestBuy to purchase a 1GB shuffler (for running) and a regular ipod 30GB for my long commute everyday 2.5hr. The sales person recommended the Sansa 260e, for $190 4GB and all the options it made sense for me to purchase it.....however file transfer was confusing (MCP mode all the songs displays unknown) while connected to USB can not use the sansa, also the unit comes with sample songs which it freezed the unit,  but it dose not have a reset button so you have to wait till battery drains. One good thing was video transfer was simple and worked. Unfortunately I have to get the ipod but I'm glad I decided to purchase it locally vs. shipping

<Title>love it!
<Date>Wed Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i've been looking for an mp3 player like this for a long time.  the ipod is nice, but i always had little gripes that stopped me from getting one (such as the inability to use anything but itunes to load music).    this player is a great alternative to ipod.  it's about the same size as a nano, but a tiny bit thicker, and a little heavier.  the scroll wheel has a nice tactile feel to it, and contrary to other reviewers i like the way it feels (although i concede the buttons are a little hard to press without adjusting my hand).  the screen is impressive-- bigger, brighter, and clearer than nano.  the menus are well thought out, though this is my first tag-based player (vs. folder-based) so there is a slight learning curve for me.  mine came already loaded with the most current firmware.  the first time i connected it to my computer i nearly panicked-- the unit would turn on, then show an error and turn off.  then i realized i had the "hold" button on.  switching it off fixed the problem.  i didn't install any of the sandisk software and windows xp found the device and gave me the option to sync it with my music in windows media player.  you can also open the player as a folder in my computer and just copy music that way if you prefer.  to copy photos or videos you do have to install the sandisk software.  i copied over all the music i could think of (maybe 30 albums?), and i still have 1.5gb left.  i was considering ordering an extra mini-sd card to expand the memory, but now i think i will hold off since i'm having a hard time filling it as it is!  all in all, great mp3 player!  i will update my review if my impressions change.

<Title>Some notes about the e200 series
<Date>Fri Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The other reviews have already commented on the features and performance, so I'll try to comment on those aspects that haven't gotten much attention.  This is a great player, but I will concentrate on some annoying aspects:  1. When you charge via USB, the display on the device is always on. It doesn't fall asleep or go dim. The device is also nonresponsive in this mode, ie the buttons won't work and you won't be able to play or do anything.  2. If you have a USB wall charger, the display will dim and the buttons will work while charging. But the device must be on, it won't charge via AC if the device is turned off.  3. Playlists can be made on the fly, but you have to play each song you want to add to the playlist in order to bring up the option.   4. Video conversion software only installs on windows XP. It also breaks up larger files into smaller ones, and it's not very intuitive to copy whole DVD's. The quicktime format it uses is proprietary. Also, video files are only recognized in the root folder, so the device won't see files located in subfolders. Videos run at 15 fps.   5. Has the option of choosing MSC or MTP mode. MSC loads the player like a flash drive so you manually drag and drop files. MTP works with wmp 10, and some other third party software to manage your syncing. I prefer MSC, but I switched to MTP because when you unplug the USB cable in MSC mode, the device reboots itself. It does not do this is MSC mode.   This is a great player, but you'll need to spend some time configuring everything to your preferences. The Sandisk firmware has good basic functionality, but if you're used to lots of features for customization, be prepared to work for it with this device. I miss features like "play most recently synchronized" that my old player had. The good news is that these firmware drawbacks may soon be addressed when Rockbox firmware is released. The hardware and build quality of this device is truly excellent, and it will be the best flash player on the market once Rockbox firmware is released for the e200 series.

<Title>AWESOME MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Thu Jun 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This thing is sweet.   PROS:   1. Has more space and more features than the IPOD nano.  2. Video. I have encoded a bunch of Family Guy episodes and they play great.   3. Nice design.  CONS:   1. USB only charger. This is crap. Most MP3 players do this however. You simply need to buy a 5 dollar USB to AC adapter via ebay to be able to charge on the go. MP3 player companies are retarded thinking that a person is always going to have computer access.   2. Breaks up video into small chunks. If you want to watch a 1 hour movie, it will break it up into 10 minute movies. Not a big deal but it just means you'll have like 6 files for an hour long movie.   3. Not many accessories at this time. I want to buy accessories for this puppy but since it's brand new, there's not much out there yet. Hopefully that will change.

<Title>Ipod Terminator
<Date>Sat Jun 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Strengths: Affordable, Plays Video, Flash-based storage  Weaknesses: Low(er) Capacity (compared to hard drive players), case shows marks/fingerprints easily, cheap headphones included  Excellent player for the price - like a smaller version of a Video Ipod, but better in some ways! It is flash based - so no moving parts to break or wear out. The battery is user replaceable so you're not up a creek when it does go out in a year or two.  The software it comes with is just basic, but simple and easy to use - just choose some files (including DVD .VOB files), and it converts them and puts them on the player for you - pretty quickly, too. (Much faster than 600mb per hour that another reviewer said, though I haven't clocked it.)  There's good community support, and talk of their being RockBox support coming up for this player, which will make it even better! It's arguably the best thing out there for the price!   Highly recommended - you can't go wrong with this one.

<Title>A GrEaT bUy!!!!
<Date>Sun Jun 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a great multimedia device.  After hearing that the ipod gets scratched and cracked too easily I decided to look elsewhere for my traveling entertainment.  I did my research and so far I am glad that I chose this device.  I was reading some of the other reviews and I saw that someone had mentioned no stop button, there IS a stop button!  Also, someone had written that the picture slide show does not work, it definitely does!  Plus, I called Sandisk with some questions and they were very patient and helpful.  The ONLY negative (so far) is that there are no accessories for this item but Sandisk has informed me that they are on the way.  We will have to wait and see...  I would say that this is a great buy!!!

<Title>Useless if you travel without a laptop to charge the player
<Date>Wed Jun 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought a SanDisk Sansa e270, and deeply regret the purchase.  I need a travel charger and a spare battery, but you don't sell either, and will not tell me what other chargers, if any are compatible with the e270.  Your technical support representative's answers are absolutely useless - I have cut and pasted my questions and his responses below.  Given the non-existent customer support, I will not buy another SanDisk product again.    ===============     Your Question/Problem: I want to use the Sansa e270 when I travel, but won't be carrying a laptop. How do I charge the battery since you don't sell a travel charger? Can I use the IPod Nano/mini charger brick and plug the Sansa USB into it? If not, what can I use.  Also, I want to buy a spare battery since it is user replaceable, but you don't sell it either. Where do I buy one?  ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/20/2006 08:09)  Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. As of now there is no available wallcharger and spare battery for the Sansa e200 series. Also we do not recommend that you use the charger of the ipod player, considering that is not a product of SanDisk. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!  Sincerely, Michael Louie I. SanDisk Technical Support ________________________________________ Your Response: (06/21/2006 08:03) My trips typically last 2-4 weeks, so I really do need to charge. Since you do not sell chargers and batteries, and recommend not using non-SanDisk chargers, that makes my SanDisk unusable after the charge runs out. The only alternative is to use the IPod charger - please tell me what the correct voltage, amperage, and polarity is to charge the Sansa e270. I am willing to use a non-SanDisk product even if it means voiding the warranty. Otherwise I have wasted almost $300. And when will you start selling spare batteries, since one of the reasons I bought the Sansa was because SanDisk advertised it had a replaceable battery - although this may be true in theory, it is not true if you don't sell one! ________________________________________ SanDisk Response: (06/21/2006 08:03)   Thank you for contacting SanDisk Technical Support. I understand how inconvenience the issue may be causing you. The ampherage, polarity and voltage are all proprietary information that we are unable to release at this time. You may try to do a search on a compatible charger for the Sansa e200 series player. However we do not guarantee that anything will work with it until we put a charger on the market. But we have no information when it will be out. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail. Thank you for choosing SanDisk. Have a nice day!

<Title>e260 vs Nano - an easy decision, heres why
<Date>Thu Jun 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently purchased a new nano for my fiancee, and one of the e260 for myself.  My thought was that I wanted to buy her a nice expensive unit, and I would settle for the less expensive unit.  However, it turns out that the e260 is way better than the Nano.  I'll break down why, and to be fair there is a couple of things also listed that the Nano does better.  THINGS THAT e260 DOES BETTER THAN NANO: 1.) e260 can do more     - You can play video on the e260 - great for little vacation clips from your camera. 2.) e260 screen is bigger, more colorful and brighter 3.) e260 battery is replaceble, no need to throw your unit away when the battery dies (since apple ipod would charge too much to send it in and get battery etc). 4.) Price per Storage ratio.  Nano cost $175 for 2GB, e260 was $140 for 4GB (prices at my purchase time) Thats TWICE AS MUCH for LESS MONEY. 5.) e260 is more scratch and break resistant.  Built better. 6.) e260 has an FM TUNER, you can listen to radio! 7.) You cannot use a coupon or coupon code on any Apple products at any store anywhere, you can with e260. 8.) e260 has memory card slot, yes you can add even more storage and/or move stuff off/on with a little micro-sd card. 9.) Battery charge - you get at least a couple of hours more from full charge out of the e260. 10.) Drag and drop your music onto the unit, no need for management software.  This means the unit can also be used as a file storage device like a USB drive.  THINGS THAT NANO DOES BETTER THAN e260: 1.) Nano is slightly thinner. 2.) Nano has more accessories on the market, its hard to find them for e260. 3.) The scroll wheel of e260 is mechanical, the nano scroll is sort of touch based.  Some prefer the mechanical, but the touch based is prefered by me.  Its no contest for me, I will never buy IPOD again, you just do not get what you pay for.  Really, if there was an IPOD Nano out there with the same features as the e260 and same storage space, apple would charge over $500 for it.

<Title>Would not purchase this product again
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought a Sandisk Sansa e260 and our son had problems getting it to synchronize from the time that he took it out of the box. Then today his Sandisk Sansa e260 fell 2 feet to the floor while he was sitting down and now the screen is destroyed with lines running through it internally. One would think that a 24" fall would not be enough to destroy a flash drive player, but even a rubber skin on the player was not enough to protect this poorly designed player from internal damage. I called the Sandisk company and spoke with a manager who stated that the Sandisk players are not designed to resist ANY TYPE of falls "even if it only falls 12" or less." I did not tell this manager that our kids previously owned the Sandisk Sansa m240 which not only stood up to the abuse of MANY impacts and falls, but one of them went through the wash and still worked! The new Sandisk Sansas do not hold up to the quality that their players once were. These e260 players are less expensive than some and they have decent sound quality, but don't waste your money on these players if you want a player that will last more than a few months.

<Title>An Excellent MP3 Player
<Date>Tue Jun 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is far and away better than an iPod Nano. Like anything else, it has it's pros and cons, listed here:  Pros * Excellent size and feel. It's small, yet fits in the hand perfectly. It's only slightly thicker than a Nano. * The screen is bright, crisp, and displays video. The video is a double-edged sword, however. More on that in the cons. * 4GB is a lot of space, and you can add even more with the MicroSD slot for a good price.  Cons There are two different categories in the Cons. Cons that can be fixed (via a firmware update), and those that can't. First, the Cons that can be fixed: * You can only delete songs from the computer, not through the interface. This can be easily fixed in a firmware update. * Sometimes a weird glitch occurs where you see songs on the MP3 player that don't really exist. You select it and nothing happens. I find simply taking everything off the MP3 player to the computer, then back to the MP3 player will fix this. The downside to this method is that you lose the ratings you give your songs. * The movies are gigantic. The software included streamlines the process, but it manages to take a 54MB .mp4 file and convert it into a 300MB+ Motion JPEG file. I'm not sure if this is normal for the Motion JPEG codec, but it boggles the mind. Also, it breaks up videos into segments of ten minutes. I'm assuming this is because you can only fast-forward at one speed, so it helps make it easier to find where you left off. This can be fixed by simply using the same feature it uses for it's songs, the "Scan through song" feature. Hopefully this can be addressed in a future firmware update.  Unfixable Con: * The buttons are hard to push. If the scroll wheel (which lights up with a cool blue whenever you use it) was set into the MP3 player just a liiittle bit deeper, it would be easier to hit the buttons. But it's not. So it isn't. You end up putting your thumb on the wheel, and tilting your thumb toward the button, or you use your fingernails. Sort of annoying. The menu button doesn't have a responsive "click" or anything of the sort, so you have to push it and hope it registers. Also sort of annoying.  I know there are way more cons then pros, but it's human nature to point out the flaws. But if/when the fixable cons get fixed, it becomes obvious the pros outweigh the cons. I can still wholeheartedly recommend this MP3 player right now.

<Title>Best MP3 for Yahoo Music
<Date>Wed Jun 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i have tried many MP3s over the years and this by far is the most iPod like.  It works extremely well with the Yahoo Music subscription whereas others in the past have had many software issues. the memory expansion slot is a plus but with 4 gigs, you can get a load of songs on it anyway. the only thing i can find wrong is that it does not work well with Yahoo Music playlists. Extra steps are required to copy them over which isn't worth the time. But the extremely long battery life is worth the lack of playlist functionality.

<Title>Sanse e260 player
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There were a few qualities that I looked for in an mp3 player, portability, ease of use, and price.   Portability - it travels well and is surprisingly durable, a necessity for me Ease of use - At first, I got confused by a couple of the menus but, after a couple of minutes, I was able to navigate through with no problems.  I can port my files onto the player without having to use special software - another big point for me.  My only gripe is with the ear buds as they never fit right in my ears, but that's hardly Sandisk's fault.  I'll simply purchase something a little more flexible and smaller. Price - after doing a comparison, I found this to be the best value for my money.   All in all, enjoyable so far.

<Title>Hmm, nice, but...
<Date>Sat Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was really looking forward to this and when I got it I started having mixed feelings. It has a good size, feels sturdy but a bit on the heavy side. The interface is nice, easy to use, but as someone pointed out you cannot delete a file from the player, you must use the computer. The beautiful wheel gets on the way of the buttons, also pointed out by others, and though it is not very smooth it turns reasonably well unless you are trying to go through a lot of songs at once. Then there is the whole issue of only being able to charge it through an usb connection, together with the fact that it uses a proprietary cable and you can't just use one of the standard usb cables available on the market (ok, many players have the same issue...). One other concern are the openings for the microsd card slot and the cable connections that have no protection. Being able to add extra memory is a nice feature. It sounds good but the earphones that come with it are of low quality what brings me to the issue that you can't adjust the equalizer to your own   settings; you have to use one of the preset options. The Sansa e260 is ok for adding some family videos to carry around, but seriously, who is going to watch a whole video in such a small screen? It is not the main purpose of the player; if you want to watch videos get a larger screen/larger storage video player. 4GB is a great amount of memory for music, that is why I bought it. Curious that the movies are .mov, a quicktime/apple standard, and yet it doesn't support mac, you can't even access it as a hard drive if you plug it into a mac.

<Title>Above average mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have this product for about a month now. It's a nice product for the price. I dont have any major problems yet. Before buying it I have read several reviews on Internet, most of them say that it has nice featurs and a good sound quality. So, I bought it and found that its sound quality is not as good as I expected. By the way I am comparing sansa with iPod nano. At some instances I hear hissing sound in some songs which sounds great in my car audio system. I may have to see if there any setting which can improve the sound quality. I like some of the features like loading mp3s from computer. You dont have to go through format change, you can simply drag and drop as in Windows Explorer, FM radio is fairly good and ability to store and display color pictures. It is not better than iPod for sure. iPod has a nice sound and touch pad navigation, in sensa navigation is done by wheel. The height of this wheel is little more than it should be, which makes harder to press the buttons around it. Overall I found it little better than average mp3 player.

<Title>Klutsy, bit it sounds great
<Date>Sun Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I've had it about a month and yes, the Sansa e260 and Yahoo Music have replaced my ipod.  Never thought it would happen.  Pro's - The sound is wonderful.  The earbuds that came with the Sansa are quite good but I am tiring of plastic in my ear so  I bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100 earphones.  Great combination.  All the music I want from Yahoo for a flat fee and a player that produces wonderful sound and only slightly larger than a nano.  Good FM reception and sound.  Cons - A klutsy mechanical interface. Mechanical buttons you have to press very deliberately or nothing happens.  The volume control/scroll wheel is mechanical, not touch-pad like like the ipods.  All in all, it's a better way to listen to all the music you can imagine on a great sounding portable device.  You get used to the ideosyncraisies - and the price is right.

<Title>Better than an iPod, but still a few kinks
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player is a great buy.  Let's go through the good and the bad on this little guy.  Pros: A great machine.  This MP3 player sounds very nice out of a fine pair of quality headphones, and even from those pack-in earbuds (that are surprisingly good themselves).  The screen is beautifully clear and colorful, which is great because the system allows for video playback and image viewing.  The unit feels nice in your hand or pocket and looks very stylish as well.  UI is easy to navigate, even though the buttons themselves hamper use a bit.  This player does not require itself to be synced to a computer player like the iTunes/iPod partnership, and therefore music can easily be added and removed with no DRM slowing (or stopping) the process.  Other features like FM radio and voice-recorder are nice bonus features.  Cons: But it's not without quirks.  There are a few minor issues that must be dealt with.  When you drag music in via My Computer, the Sansa ignores track numbers and plays in any order; only adding music via Windows Media Player keeps tracks in order.  Player occassionally locks up during normal use, but not enough to be a bother.  Face buttons are cramped by scrollwheel and a little hard to press, and the scrollwheel itself isn't as nice as, oh, a touchwheel.  Also, the fast-forwarding is quite slow, and it can be a pain to find your place in an audiobook or podcast if stopped.  Minus the quirks- most of which could be fixed by a firmware update- this is one fine machine.  If you want something like a iPod Nano, but would like to get more bang for your buck, then buy this player.

<Title>Great little unit, love sansa products
<Date>Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought a refurb for $50 on ebay after my wife got one.  My last player was a creative zen which wouldn't last more than a couple hours of battery life, and if you left it sit for a couple weeks the battery would die by itself.  I can leave this sitting around for months and it will still retain it's charge.  Battery lasts a long time during use too.  Seems like some allow you to connect as a MSD (mass storage device) so that you dont' have to sync with rhapsody, the one I got wasn't (which is one of my complaints).  I also don't like that there's no adapter to use this with an ipod connector (for the car).  I would think it wouldn't be hard since the connector is the same, and this unit is capable of remote control, but the pin layout is different.  I've contacted Sansa about a possible future adapter and I've gotten no response.

<Title>Sansa E260
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great product, intuitive and easy-to-use format, FM radio has excellent reception, sound is balanced and has a reasonable frequency response.  Overall, an excellent value.  You should be aware that the unit does not have a volume control.  The two selectable volumes (which both sound the same to me) are adequate for most situations but I would like to boost it a bit at times.  I would buy this unit again.

<Title>Good MP3 player, could've used more interface
<Date>Sun Feb 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this MP3 player for my son, and after playing with it for a few hours, I wanted one.  I purchased an Insignia 4GB Sport from BestBuy, but returned it to buy this one.  I regret that decision now.  This player is a good one, and it sounds great.  My only dislike is the user interface.  I use the rating system alot.  I don't have time to listen to every song I have loaded on my computer, so I copy them to my MP3 player, and as I am running (exercise), or sitting in a waiting room, I rate the songs, best to worse, then I delete the bad ones later.  The Insignia model had dedicated buttons on the side, so you can rate on the fly, the Sansa model you have to run through the Music menu to rate.  Also, the Insignia model would show you the rating on the screen while you were listening, the Sansa model, you have to go throught the menu again to see if you have already rated it.  Also, I didn't realize I was buying a (version 1) MP3 player.  I guess there is a (version 2) with more features in the software, but I did not know that when I purchased.  I guess you can delete songs from the player with a ver2, but mine you have to connect to a PC to delete songs.  The other thing I did not like is the inability to add songs to playlists on the MP3 player.  You can have different playlists, but the only way to change the playlists is to copy them from a PC.  The Sansa came with one playlist already loaded, called the GoList, and it is the only playlist you can change on the player.  I guess I assumed that the best feature of an MP3 player would be that you can create multiple playlists for any occasion.  With this Sansa, you can have multiple playlists, but they did not make it easy for you, in my opinion.  I do not use the movie or picture options.  To view a movie would take alot of the memory space needed for songs, and why would you want to watch a movie on such a little screen.  On the good side, it has a good looking clear interface, has good sound, built in FM tuner, and decent EQ.  My recommendation goes to the Insignia Sport models.

<Title>Rubbish  customer support
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this for six months now and for a time I was pleased but it always bugged me that it wouldn't sync album art over from Windows Media Player 11. Microsoft says it requires a firmware update from Sandisk, but all I get from them are 'canned' responses and the like, or instructions on how to format the player, very complex instructions on MANUALLY adding album art to the player from JPEG files, etc etc, none of which has helped one little bit. I keep telling them NO, I just want it to sync as easily as music does, but all I get back is another idiobot response. I suppose the firmware will not be forthcoming because they have a whole new roster of players now and are probably not concerned with the e200 series anymore. Sound quality is good and everything but if you want a player that will properly function with WMP11 I would get a Zune or Creative.

<Title>Let the music play
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this SanDisk Sansa for my husband's birthday almost a year ago and its still going strong. For the money... its hard to beat. He absolutely loves the thing and has had no complaints. He tells me its one of the best gifts he's ever gotten from me. Hmmmmm.... well its obvious he's tickled pink with my selection and I'm sure anyone who buys the Sansa 260 will be as well. I also bought him a toughskin case to protect and preserve the unit and it certainly does the job quite nicely. There is only ONE thing that would make SanDisk Sansa better and that is if the accessories were more readily available like those for the IPOD.

<Title>Thoroughly enjoyable
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this unit as a Refurb, since it cost $20 less than new and carried the same warranty. I wanted a flash drive player rather than a mini hard drive because there's less chance of mechanical failure. I use it primarily as a music player while traveling, rather than for pictures or video. The e200 was up and running in just a few minutes, with barely a need for the manual. (Actually, there is no manual; it comes on the CD.) The sound is great, even with inexpensive headphones. The screen display quality is good. It feels solid and secure. I've had trouble filling up 4GB of storage, but it's nice to know the unit is expandable via an add-on chip. The four buttons surrounding the Select button are pretty small and require real concentration to operate. These allow you to pause/go forward/go backward/change menus. But all players have some minor failing. I use USB to recharge the battery, though will probably buy one of the many inexpensive AC chargers now available. I would rate the e200 at 5 stars except that it might have some fault so far undiscovered. My first player was a Creative 256k model. The sound and features of the SanDisk are far superior.

<Title>not bad
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I am familiar with sandisk memory cards that I use for my audio recorders and video games for my kids. They have been around a long time so I was interested in how they would do with an mp3 player and I think it's very good. I like the fact that you can essentially upgrade the unit by simply getting another memory card so that you could have an unlimited number of songs. Nice!

<Title>Great player. But you'll need to get the some extras.
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The sansa it's all about the features. Fm radio, Mp3/WMA player, video player, voice/sound/fm recorder, and more.   The quality is great, so far, i've been using it for about 2 months now. The sound quality is quite good. Battery lasts about 20 hours with regular constant use. Firmware is good, but could be better. But to get the most out of your player, i recommend you get the following:  * A wall outlet charger, since the sansa comes with an usb charger only (1st reason for the 4 stars instead of 5). Unless you carry around a laptop everyware, or dont mind spending 2 hours in a cybercafe just to charge the player.  * A protective case, unless you're very carefull with the player, it could get scratched easily (2nd reason for the 4 stars instead of 5).   * Rockbox firmware. This really helps you "get the juice" out of the sansa player, adding great extra features such as text reader, voice operation, game boy color emulator, video/photo viewing without the need to ccompress the files, customizable skins/fonts/colors, file and folder management, text file creation, louder volume, full equalizer, bass/trebble control, and more. Besides, you can install it without uninstalling the original firmware.

<Title>Save on gas read library books on line
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Handley library in Winchester VA just added a free audio books on line feature for library card holders. Download an audio book to your desktop and then to your mp3 player. After 2 weeks the book disappears. The problem, it doesn't work with ipod. So I bought the e260. It works flawlessly with the free software downloaded from the library. No more trips to the library to borrow tapes or cds and no more "OOOWW, I forgot to return that book last month." Although the capacity of the e260 mhas not been a problem, I wish that it came in 8 0r 16 gig flavors.

Since I've had the replacement, I've dealt with continual frustration trying to get the software and the system to function as it should.  An internal sound issue has occured where neither the headphones or DLO FM transmitter work.  Tech Support only says there is nothing they can do. DO NOT BUY SANDISK.

<Title>Great mp3 player, I'd buy it again
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had mine for almost 3 weeks now and use it daily, both around the house while reading and while out and about or on the train to and from work.  If I had the choice agian I'd buy it again.  CONS: The little round thing to use to select different things.  PROS: Everything but that little round button, the brightness of the screen, the sound, the size, the SD expansion slot is a huge plus, since I can turn my 4gb player into a 10gb player for a hell of a lot cheaper then buying a 10gb player.  Going to buy another one for my wife.

<Title>A great product
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this thing. I love the small size, the FM radio feature (though AM would've been nice), and the voice recording. The picture feature is nice, but the video featureisn't very usefull, as the software converts the video into a format that hogs up much of the player's 4 GB. Without videos, 4 GB is perfect for me and fits around 1000 songs. I love that you can drag and drop music into the folders of the player without having to go through clunky software (though pictures and video require the Sansa software). I wish the blue light around the center button wasn't so powerful, as it is quite noticeable in a dark room. It'd be nice if you could dim it or shut it off. Aside from these minor issues, its a fantastic product at a good price. Today, however, this model is a little dated, and you might find that you can get more for your money in newer MP3 players. Not saying that you shouldn't pick this one up, but be sure to do your research.

<Title>I was skeptical but now I am sold
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the Sansa E260 for Christmas.  I thought about the IPOD but want to have the freedom to put anything on it not just Apple stuff.  I have yet to fill it up.  I have music, audio books, video and pictures on it.    It has never frozen on me and the software works great.  I was careful to back up my computer before loading the software in case there was a problem but I have had nothing but smooth sailing.  The software converts all my video into the correct format.  I have updated the sansa software with no problems.    I really like how it feels in my hand and how it operates.  I wanted something simple to use and easy to load.  I don't have hours to spend on  a computer working on the software when I want to change videos or songs.  I want to spend 2 minutes and unplug and go.  The battery life is amazing it never seems to run down.  I watch videos for hours.  I spent 3 bucks and bought an power adapter for the wall so I wouldn't have to have my computer on.  I bought a nice case at Walmart by Case Logic that fits it perfectly.  I have a 2 gig memory card but haven't needed it yet.  I listen to a range of music plus audio books and videos so I am never bored with this.  It's small enough to fit in my tiny purse and I can use it when I am waiting on my kids or doing some chore I would rather not be doing.   Great for the treadmill and I love the "lock" function so I don't have to worry about pressing buttons by accident when I use it.  It's nice to be able to show of pics of family and places I've been.    I really like mine. Best purchase I have made in a while.  Found on sale the week of Thanksgiving through Amazon for 79.00!

<Title>Great item
<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It's locked up a few times in the year I've had it, but it's a matter of a simple reset, no data lost. great controls, great sound. I never use the movie or pictures functions, it's a waste on a tiny screen. I use the AM/FM sometimes, and the main advantage is the file formats it supports as opposed to the limited iPod.   In addition, you can pull all your music back off the player, if you have recently wiped/reinstalled your computer and lost your collection. It's a handy backup.

<Title>mark my words: THIS THING IS [...]
<Date>Sun Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recently bought this sansa at Best Buy, and I very much regret the purchase. I was just goint to Best Buy because I was looking into buying some sort of MP3 player (not necessarily an ipod because they are a lot more expensive than other brands) to hold about 4 GB of music. When telling this to one of the employees, she pretty much talked me into buying a Sansa e260. She definitely had very good reasons for getting a sansa over an ipod nanos: sansa's are a lot cheaper for the same amount of storage capacity, sansa's are more durable than nanos, sansa's have an FM tuner included and nanos don't...the list goes on and on. A big deal for getting an mp3 player was being able to charge it on the go because I'm going on a lot of trips this year and I'm not always gonna have access to a computer. Even though Sandisk does not make a charger specifically made for the Sansa, the employee at Best buy assured me that I could buy a Griffin brand wall charger made for an ipod and it would charge it. I guess I made a mistake on my part howeve because I bought the sansa with the wall charger in the beginning of July, right before leaving on vacation. After charging the sansa right when I got it, it stayed charged all week (to avoid having to charge it all the time, I set the backlight on dim and had it turn off after 5 seconds) into my vacation. After a couple days of long car rides, my sansa needed to be charged so I plugged it in correctly to my wall charger and left it to charge overnight. Unfortunately, nothing happened and my mp3 died. I coulnd't get it to turn on or do anything the rest of the trip. I even went to walmart during my vacation to try a new charger to see if it was just the charger but it failed to charge with it. This is when I knew that this thing was a piece of crap and I was disappointed because I had no music for the rest of my vacation.   Pros - *long battery charge if you don't always leave the backlight on *FM tuner *good sound when using good ear phones (more about that in the cons) *easy to load music onto using my already organized music library on window's media player *very durable and fit well in my hand *easy to get around (I liked how all of the menus were organized)  Cons -  *wouldn't charge with a wall charger!!! (although, when reading some of the reviews on here, I guess a wall charger worked for them) *adding songs to the "Go List" is annoying because you have to play each song you want to add individually *the ear phones that come with them have horrible sound and don't fit in my ears. Also, the little foam things that cover the ear phones fall off so easily.   It's too bad though because I really liked my sansa and how it worked overall. I'm getting an ipod nano soon though because I'm done dealing with crap. Now I know why ipods are more expensive. It's also nice how you actually can find all of the accessories you need for ipod anywhere.

<Title>Only buy this if you have no preferences whatsoever
<Date>Wed Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Let's start with the good stuff: this product is nice looking, it's light, compact, and easy to navigate.  Customer service is exceptional considering the state of customer service in this country.  The sound is very decent for such a small flash player, although I had a hard time finding a comfortable spot for the earbuds. Now for the bad: this player froze up after only two weeks of use, and although I was able to fix it within only minutes on the phone with customer service, it didn't fix the problem completely.  I had to re-format the player, erasing everything I had put on it in two weeks, but the drive space was still showing as filled, which took another call to customer service to figure out.  It is absolutely impossible to put anything in any kind of order on this player.  With music that's not really a big deal, but when you're trying to download an audio book with 150 different tracks, it's a little important to be able to download track 1, 2, 3, 4 etc...Because, well, the book progresses that way.  I can't really follow the story if I listen to track 23 then track 14 then track 142...It's a little confusing. And, it's also a little bit of a pain to have to scroll through 150 songs looking for track 2, then 3 etc.  The software they provide, rhapsody, is garbage.  I must have reorganized about 1,000 tracks on my computer, redoing the ID3 tags for music and audio books, so that when I downloaded them it would all be under the same title, genre, whatever.  Well, after spending hours and hours redoing all my audio files so I could download them in a relatively organized manner I thought it would be nice to put them on my mp3 player, but as soon as I dropped them into the player through rhapsody, it reverted all my files back to the original id3 tag (which customer service was baffled by).    Playlists are also quite a problem on this.  You can't simply create a playlist while on the computer, you have to go to every individual song you want on the playlist to select it, then find the next song, select it, and so on.  It was too much of a hassle.   In short, do your research, and make sure that you are getting the right type of player for your needs.  If you plan on listening to anything in order, don't buy this player.  What I have found is that it pays to do your research, and it is often worth it to pay the extra money for "nicer" products.

<Title>Tested Sandisk e260 mp3
<Date>Sun Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I did tons of research before I bought this player. Some of my friends had Ipods-and were disappointed. I looked for battery life, scratch resistant case, ability to replace battery, ease of copying. I tried 5 different players before I settled on the Sandisk. I can assure you, you will not be disappointed. Battery life is incredible. LCD display is crisp. Get the gray silicone case for a few bucks and cut a piece of clear transparency film to cover display. This player now becomes just about indestructable. With a Y cable, you can plug in to your home stereo. You will not be unhappy with this purchase. Incidentially, if you ever have a battery problem, instead of shipping it back to company, replacement batteries are now available and easy to install. You will be very satisfied.

<Title>Think carefully before you buy it
<Date>Sat Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Bottom line:  when you're paying this much for an mp3 player, don't let $50 make you choose this over the nano if it's not what you really want.  I chose this over an iPod nano, but I think it's basically a toss-up between the two.  Pros of the sansa: - it's just a tad bigger than the nano - you can download songs from pretty much anywhere - you get voice recording, radio, and video with the sansa - it's a little cheaper - replacable battery- I assume they'll start selling these at some point?  Cons: - the syncing is not exactly intuitive; it really only works well with Windows Explorer, and it's inexplicably hard to get playlists on the sansa - if you don't press the menu button just right when you turn it on, it freezes and you have to reset it.  It's a weird and annoying problem. - no accessories!  I had one choice for an armband to use for running. - do you really need video on your mp3 player?  Especially little crappy videos? - the voice recording only recored 3-min increments, and you can't upload it to your computer- so forget about bootlegging concerts, or even sharing a lecture with your friends.  I used my friend's nano and had no problem getting songs on it, so it is the player, not me.  I wouldn't say this is bad, and I'm glad there's an alternative to ipods, but when you're paying $200 there shouldn't be so many annoyances.

<Content>Don't believe the nay-sayers.    If you are looking for an alternative to the iPod THIS IS IT!!    The Sansa e260 series is easy to use, has a great set of features and functions and is (very) considerably lower in price then the equivalent iPod.  I've been using my Sansa e260 for a couple of months now and I just love it!  Unlike some of the other reviewers I have found no problems with the buttons and I find the user interface easy to understand and to navigate.  Keeping it charged is no problem ... just buy an inexpensive AC/DC to USB converter - works fine and you can keep using the e260 while it charges.  As to needing to use proprietary software to download movies; so what?  You're going to need to use some type of software to convert the files anyway, and the software supplied with the e260 does the job just fine.

<Title>It's a great little player
<Date>Sat Aug 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'll admit the main reason I did buy the Sandisk Sansa e260 was because of it's price (I bought it for $180) compared to the iPod Nano (currently the 4 GB Nano is around $250) but I also bought it because of all the added features. You can put on videos and images; you can listen to FM radio as well as record it; and more reaons that I will get to later in the review for what made me buy it.  Pros: - Great battery life.. I can basically go a week without having to ever charge it. - Storage capacity has never been a problem for me and I have almost 1,000 songs and at least 20 videos. - I'm surprised no one has really mentioned this yet but you can actually expand on the total memory capacity with the microSD slot which has cards that currently go up to 2GB. (That's a total of 6GB for the e260 and 8GB for the e270.) - The sound quality is great and heck I just use the default settings that it is set at, I don't really mess around with it too much other then turning the volume up in some situations. - The video quality is great but it depends on the kind of videos you upload like I have short 5 to 7 minute videos that I download off sites and I think the quality on the player is actually better then it was on the computer in most cases. - The overall vibrancy of the screen is a sight itself. When you first turn it on you think wow the color looks great and then you get into messing around with the settings and say wow it can get even brighter.  You're probably thinking about now I bet this guy has no cons at all right? Well despite my love for it there are things I don't love about it or wish would be added.  Cons: - Despite the overall durability the screen does get scratched. Also finger prints show up all over but those are no problem whipping off. - Playlisting on the player is bad. I just gave up with it all together and either just have it play all the songs on shuffle or I listen to a whole albums separate. - I can't really say it's a con now since I solved the problem now but I hated the headphones, they were very uncomfortable and they just didn't fit. Funny thing is though after I took off the ear piece coverings they felt much better. I have never changed out the original headphones. - The voice recording really isn't worth it in my opinion. The sound quality isn't really that clear and you can't make very long recordings although you can make multiple recording but you're still lacking the continuation. - There aren't really any good add-on accessories for the player itself. There is a speaker dock but I really wouldn't buy it and there is also FM Car Transmitter which is great because I don't want to carry around a bunch of CDs. Other then that there is nothing. - Protective casing wise for these players the ones that are out now just look bland to put it nicely. That's one thing I liked a little about the iPod is all the different designs and stuff they have for their protective casing but there's nothing fancy about the casing for the e200 players. - I'm a guy that loves his sports talk shows and there are no stations for that on FM radio. I don't really like any of the music that they play on the radio these days other then some of the songs on good classic rock stations. Anyways my main point is I wish there was AM as well because I would definitely trade FM for AM radio.  A couple tips I have learned so far: - When first turning on the player make sure you unlock it by switching the button at the top of the player left of the headphone jack. I too had been confused about this at first. - If the ear piece coverings bother you take them off. It won't be any less comfortable. - Always use the battery saving settings because they really do save you a lot of batter and you don't need to be staring the screen for every song unless you are paranoid it's going to blow up or something. - There are many easy options for uploading songs to the player so don't be afraid of not using iTunes. (Some options are Windows Media Player, Rhapsody, Napster, and more.)  I hope my review has helped you some in making your decision to purchase the Sandisk Sansa e260. If I were you though I would definitely buy it because it's worth it.

<Title>One of the best for the money
<Date>Mon Jan 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This product was kind of difficult getting started, I had to call the help desk to have drivers downloaded to my computer once that was done it works absolutely great. The product was purchased for my 15yr old son who loves it dearly, he's constantly downloading music and there seems to be plenty of space left. He hasn't done any  videos as of yet but I'm sure he will soon, overall we are satisfied with the product and I recommend it highly.

<Title>Mostly Good
<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>We bought two of these, one for each of our children. One has worked faultlessly, the other we returned and had replaced. The screen went bad after 2 weeks of use, the player said it was full after only 150 songs, and we could not get the video download to work at all. As for the replacement, we have not yet had it 2 weeks, but have already got more than 200 songs on it without any trouble. We haven't managed to get a video on to it yet, but haven't really had time to try hard. So, hopefully our problems came just through one random faulty unit. Apart from those issues, both children are loving it.

<Title>Great item with a few issues
<Date>Thu Jan 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I think it's a great MP3 player. The only problems i've had is it freezing a few times, but i can usually reboot it and it works fine. It has never frozen once it's been playing, only when booting up. Also, a few times it would not let me delete files from it in Windows Media Player. Usually I could just unplug it and start over and it has worked fine. Now it has frozen and I cannot get into it at all. I contacted Sansa and they are replacing it without any hassle, so good customer service also! All in all, a good unit and I am glad I bought it.

<Content>This bit of technology is so frustrating to operate.. The instruction manual was of little or no  help...and finally after hours of trial and error and the help of a neighbor can almost use the eaudiobook portion.

<Title>Good player but is a disappointment
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product because the 8 GB wouldn't work on my computer. My computer wouldn't recognize it at all. I have the same problem with the 4 GB. I can now only use it on my work computer. My home computer is fairly old and only has USB 1.1. I am not sure if that was the problem but that's what I blamed it on. My work computer is USB 2.0. The mp3 player works good but I don't like the ear phones. They do a horrible job of blocking out outside noise because they don't go inside your ear. I use some free no-name ear phones with it instead and they actually go into my ears and block out a lot more noise. The player also doesn't come with a CD like the 2 GB does. It also doesn't have USB modes. If you plan on buying this player I recommend that you either get a new computer or get a MAC. Apparently these things aren't compatible with older computers.

<Title>Best player out there, a few small quirks
<Date>Thu Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player has more storage for less price of a nano.  Its just a little thicker, but otherwise as small.  With included media converter it can play just about any type of video.  I ripped a DVD to my hard drive, compressed it to 1gb, then used the convertor software to get it on.  Now I can watch DVDs anywhere, its great.  The battery life is rediculous, sound quality is good as well.  I don't think the buttons are hard to press at all, and the scroll wheel, while mechanical, is still smooth.   As stated in the title, it does have a few small quirks.  The interface does take a little practice, but after a day or 2 it was second nature.  You can add songs to the "go list" while its on, but to create other playlists you need to make them in windows medial player and sync the 2 devices... Its really easy, just download the pdf manual and it will make sense.  The eq has presets, but itn't otherwise adjustable.  Otherwise, the only downfall is that its not as popular as iPods, so there aren't as many accessories.  I think that if more people buy them and they become more popular accessories should start to appear, but I'll just have to wait for them.

<Title>Tried it, love it!!!
<Date>Fri Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Some of the reviews I read left me wondering if this was the right player for me.  I found a consumer review on-line where they ran through the features and actually demonstrated how the thing works.  That did it for me.  After that, I knew that I had to have it.  I haven't had to be concerned with the technical issues, as it has done everything except convert video clips that I have taken with my camera.  I found some other software that will convert it and allow me to load it onto the player.  Here's why I gave it a five:  1.	Voice recording - I use the voice recording to record meetings at work.  The sound is crystal clear, better than any tape recorder I have used in the past.  Also, using the lanyard and dropping it down the front of my shirt, nobody else realizes that the meetings are being recorded.  It's a great opportunity for black mail!  2.	I was looking for something that would allow me to record radio broadcasts - I've tried it with music and it sounds every bit as good as the station did the first time.  I mostly use it for talk radio and it works great.  Radio reception is awesome.  I record the radio at work in an office setting.  Reception is even passable in the elevator!  3.	MP3s - I am very pleased here.  I was worried that play-lists would be a problem and that having the player randomly select music would also be a problem.  That was based on other reviews that I saw here.  I am sorry, but those people must be idiots.  You can upload the music using Windows Media Player, dragging and dropping play-lists.  The player keeps the play-list and automatically groups your music.  You can select the play-list and it will shuffle just that play-list (if you activate the shuffle function).  You can also play music by song, album, artist, and genre.  Or you can play them all.  It's all very simple and works well.  4.	Pictures - I am a photo-nut.  I love to take pictures of my kids, landscapes, and sunsets.  The photos are pretty small, but the detail that the screen allows makes the images very sharp.  You can definitely fit more pictures in here than you ever could in your wallet.  The photos are all converted to *.bmp files using the software that came with the player, but it is very easy to add photos.  You have to rotate all of your photos so they are taller rather than wider to maximize the size of the image on the screen, but it is not difficult at all.  5.	Memory - I have uploaded 100s of songs, a handful of short video clips and commercials I found online, 147 photos, and a handful of recordings.   I have used just over half of the memory on this thing.    Here are things that I wish you could do with it:  1.	Switch out the battery - sure you can, but you need to buy another special battery and I have not seen an external charger.  This is a relatively minor thing.  It will last a full day (from sunrise past sunset) and recharges in about an hour.  It has not been a big drawback for me.    2.	Delete songs directly off the player without hooking up to your computer - I ended up with a number of albums of my daughter's intermingled with my music and had to keep fast-forwarding over those songs.  They were mixed in with my work music, so I had to tolerate it for a full day.  Again, not a huge issue.  3.	Despite the fact that I have been very careful with the player, it does have some small scratches on its front, one of them on the display.  I can't imagine that this isn't a problem with other players too.  Again, it's not the end of the world.  Things that I was surprised by:  1.	There's a record button on the side.  That makes it easy to record radio programs when you are taken away from listening unexpectedly.  2.	Play-lists are easy to create.  3.	It is easy to set the player to shuffle and/or repeat  4.	The size is really much smaller than it appears in photos  5.	The sound quality when recording (voice and radio)  6.	You can reset the player by merely holding down the power button for about a minute.  I did have it lock up on me when I was getting ready to record a meeting, but figured that out just in time.  All and all, I would say this is a wonderful player and would (and have) highly recommended it to my friends.  I hope this helps sway you to make the purchase.  I was having second thoughts when I read some of these reviews, but those must have been posted by idiots.  Sorry, but it's true.

<Title>Great Little Player But Take Note...
<Date>Sat Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>OK, I bought a Creative Zen MicroPhoto 4gb because it was supposed to be compatible with Yahoo's music service. Plugged it into my laptop and could get it to register maybe 1 out of 10 times. I called their customer support and the guy wouldn't even give me the time of day, instead he emailed me useless information. I returned the product that day.  Then I buy the Sansa e260 and guess what??? Same problem. After two frustrating days I realized their customer support WAS open on weekends so I called. The fellow was helpful and said my USB ports might not be generating enough power to run the device properly because I was using a laptop. Well, I unplugged my other USB devices and what do you know??? It works fine!  OK, so I can't use my optical mouse and a couple other things while I'm synching music, but whatever. The player works, it looks cool and my problem was solved. If only the Creative support people had suggested something similar I bet that device would have worked just fine, also!!!

<Title>Great player especially with a subscription service
<Date>Sun Sep 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased the 4G device, and was so pleased that a week later I purchased a second 6G player for my wife. I read of lot of the reviews here on Amazon, which helped me make the decision to go with the Sansa. I think most features have been covered, I just thought I would add a few tips for people considering this mp3 player.  When I got the player it came with a flyer offering a 1 month free trial for Rhapsody To Go. I had been thinking I would go with Yahoo subscription service, because for years I have not been a fan of Real whose marketing tactics I have deplored. In any event the offer got me to do some reasearch about the various subscription services, and the consensus seemed to be that Rhapsody offered the most features, although it was a bit higher priced.  So I did sign up with Rhapsody for the To Go service, using the one month free trial offer. I can report that I could not be more pleased with the service. The subscription model puts another nail in the iPod coffin as far as I'm concerned, and given Sandisk's aggressive pricing for this player I agree with the Engadget guys that there isn't any reason to go with the Nano.  Now the caveats, and tips. I've not used an iPod and iTunes, but from what I read it is pretty bulletproof. The subscription model and combination of the Sansa e200 series with Rhapsody works great for me...I've got 3 computers authorized and two Sansa players. I've had zero problems with DRM...but if you read the forums there are folks who have definitely had DRM renewal issues.   It's my feeling that the latest versions of Rhapsody and Sansa firmware have got most issues under control. So when you get your Sansa player, immediately go to the Sandisk website and download the firmware updater program and update the firmware on the player...I received my player a week ago, and at that time it did do a firmware update.  Remember to set the USB connection (under settings on the player) to MSC instead of MTP for the update. There are two ways to connect to the player and normally you will use MTP mode, but not for the firmware update. Another point, when I tried to move a playlist created in Rhapsody to the Sansa in MTP mode it wouldn't transfer over as advertised...although the songs in the playlist were moved over. When I connected later in MSC mode the playlist automatically moved to the player. I will assume a further firmware or program update will take care of this issue down the road.  Also Rhapsody recently updated their software, so if you are not just now installing the Rhapsody software I would update their software before plugging in the Sansa. Another important point is that if you uninstall and then reinstall the Rhapsody software, make sure to 'deauthorize' the computer before you uninstall the software. The reason is that you are only allowed to authorize 3 computers (you can only be logged on to the service on one at a time though) and you will use up one of those if you don't deauthorize it before the uninstall. (You can get Real to re-set your list if you make this mistake, but it sounds like a bit of a hassle.)   And if you are going to uninstall the software go to their site and search the forums for instructions on how to do a complete uninstall.  Of the three installations of Rhapsody I performed, one didn't go right and I had to re-do it, but after the second install it worked fine.  Sorry if you think I spent too much time talking about Rhapsody, but my point is that when I purchased the player I assumed I would only use it to play music I already owned that was on my computer. After experiencing the subscription music model (whatever service you go with), I am blown away by how much it adds to the entire experience of the Sansa. I've been waiting for a long time to find an mp3 player that would give Apple some competition and finally, this is the one!

<Title>Regarding video & conversion
<Date>Fri Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Overall I like the player, especially what I paid for it.  Albeit it has a small screen, I'm interested in how it does with converting movies.  I couldn't find any good reviews that covered this, though I didn't read them all.  So here's a little info regarding video and video conversion...  Converting your personal DVD's...  It's fairly easy, however you'll need to use DVD Decrypter or DVD shrink or some kind of ripping software first.  The reason for this is because most DVD's have various audio tracks and for some strange reason the "Default" audio track seems to vary within the VOB file of a movie.  So your converted content may switch from English to French in the middle of the movie.  So you need a ripping tool like the ones mentioned above to remove all but the one desired audio track.  DVD Decrypter is nice in that it will let you rip a DVD into a single gigantic VOB file, and there's a reason you may want to do this, I'll explain later.  The other reason is that there is a plug in for DVD Decrypter which will take care of a cylinder redundancy (Copy protection) issue that exists on some DVD's.  The rub with DVD Decrypter is that you can not really edit the movie other than removing cells, which is very limited...  DVD shrink has an advantage in that you can edit / crop a movie however you like.  However when you go to rip it, it will do it in the standard DVD format, which isn't a problem for the Sansa media converter, it just has to deal with multiple files instead of a single file.  Converting using the Sansa media converter...  Basically the converter converts most any source content (including raw DVD VOB files) to a QuickTime format that is not well compressed.  The lack of compression suggests a weak processor or cheap codec, not sure which.  This is also evident in that pictures are converted into uncompressed bmp files, and recorded audio is uncompressed wav files.  So even know it has the power to play MP3 and WMA files, movies, pictures and regular recorded audio are uncompressed and hence large.  As an example I converted an MPEG file originally 8 megs and it came out at 47 megs after the conversion.  I'm not that familiar with the registered QuickTime Pro which can do all the high tech conversion as it's not freeware.  So it may be for the enthusiasts out there you may find a better way to convert things to QuickTime format and just drag & drop to the player...  Overall it's truly a shareware like piece of software.  It certainly does what it claims; however there is no options whatsoever, unlike the Quicktime Pro editor.  This is truly sad as it could be much more powerful than it is.  So it can convert almost any type of content on a file by file basis, but being limited, there's no way to merge content from separate input files into one output file.  However this can surely be done via other software out there.  Also if you're converting longer content like a TV show or movie, the converter will break up the output files into 10 minute segments.  According to a Sandisk CSR, this is because the player will lock up if the files are longer than 10 minutes.  Luckily the Sansa player will move from one video file to the next, however there is a few second delay, so it's not a nice seamless transition.  As far as converting normal mpeg & avi files, I haven't done too much of this other than to say it worked somewhat.  Some content I converted came out just fine, while other content didn't convert completely or only half of the content converted, so there were some funny things discovered, but again haven't played with this enough.  Hope this helps.

<Title>A Supeurb All Solid State Skip Free MP3 Player 
<Date>Wed Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is the second one I've bought. The first was a e250 2gb model, and I ran out of room as I wanted to have a LOT of music to choose from as well as several audio books. I tried the memory expansion card but couldn't use it the same way as the built in memory, which is typical for mp3 players, so I gave the first one to my wife and got the e260 4gb model. This is a sleek little player, not as thin as some but on the other hand it seems very solid with a rigid metal back, and not very likely to break very easily. I acually like the thumbwheel, and find it easy to use. It would be helpful to be able to delete files directly from the Sansa but perhaps this feature will be added in a future firmware update. Mine came with a 30 day free subscription to Rhaspody, which allows you unlimited downloads to the Sansa, and there's a ton of music of all types available on their site. I also got the FM transmitter so it can be played on FM stereos without mp3 capability, and the sound is suprisingly good, even on stock FM automobile radios. It also provide excellent sound when plugged directly into my Tivoli PAL table radio. It's just a great little unit and I'm very pleased with it.

<Title>great MP3 player
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just bought this little mp3 player yesterday and I love it.  It's very small so if you lose things easily, this may not be the right player for you.  However, it has so many capabilities.  I love that it has the FM tuner on it along with videos.  It took me a while to figure out how to download the music onto it, but once I figured it out I was impressed.  The sound quality is fantastic.  I bought a car adapter with it and listen to it in the car.  This player is great and I'm glad I got it over the ipod.

<Title>Solid  Mp3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I first bought this product it was pretty glitchy but I have had it for a month and it is working great. The videos look real good and the audio quaility is good. I was able to watch a full length movie on my trip home on the airplane. My favorite feature is the voice recorder. I have been able to record a large percentage of my professors lectures. One thing to be aware of you can only upload musice onto the sd expansion video and pictures have to be on the device itself. They dont make that clear but it really isn't all that bad.

<Content>This is my 1st MP3 and I really like it. It has plenty of storage for me and I can always buy a card for it. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best deal. It was a little difficult at first to navigate the controls, but I'm getting better at it. I would highly recommend this to anyone. The price is fantastic. I did upgrade the earbuds.

<Title>Happy and Dissappointed at the Same Time
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Regarding music, pictures, the voice and FM recorder, and the FM tuner, it works well.  My only complaints with any of these aspects are that I can't customize the Genre that is applied to each artist or song, and I can't create multiple playlists.  As for the video feature, this player requires Sandisk's Media Conversion software (which was not included) to load video (and pictures) into the player memory. Even when I use the SanDisk Media Conversion software that came with my son's SanDisk SDMX7-1024 Sansa c240 1 GB MP3 Player, I was not able to get the video to play.  It works fine for displaying pictures, but when I go to the VIDEO folder on the player, it displays the word "Empty" even though the video is listed in the video folder of the player on my computer when I plug the player into my computer USB port.   I have sent a question regarding this to SanDisk via their customer support website. We'll see how that goes.

<Title>Very good competition for the IPod Nano
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Over all ease of operation was good. The quality of the pictures on the screen was great. Transfering music, pictures, and recording is very easy. The expansion slot allows you to have endless memory as long as you have SD disks to put it on, making this item a good rival for the IPod Nano. The only down side I see is that to watch videos you have to convert them first. I would suggest this to anyone who wants a MP3 player but doesn't want to pay the prices they want for the IPods and Zunes.

<Title>New Sansa fan
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Nice features, good price. I bought it as a gift for my 9 year old.  He's somewhat rough on electronics and I wanted to get him something that had full features but wasn't terribly expensive.  When we started using it, I found that it has a load of features and the controls are very intuitive.  It also syncs directly with Windows Media Player, so you don't have to load a special software package for it.  We haven't needed the extra space yet, but you can also put a memory card in it to expand the memory.  If I didn't already have a Zune, I would be getting a Sansa for myself.

<Title>Sansa Rhapsody
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the Rhapsody version of the Sansa with the RhapsodyToGo service and I love it.  I use it for listening to music when I run and occasionally travel.  It's very easy to upload either mp3s from my local drive or subscription content from the Rhapsody interface.  Making playlists for running is very easy since you can create them in the desktop interface and copy them to the player.  The sounds is very good even with the earbuds that came with the player.  The things I don't like about the Sansa have to do with the player's interface and hence my 4 star rating instead of 5.  I haven't ever found a way to stop a track from playing.  I can pause and go back to other menus but there is no stop.  It's very hard to do anything while running even something as simple as skipping a song takes two button presses -- one to wake it up and the other to skip.  I find myself having a hard time figuring out what buttons do what in various modes, for instance, controlling the music vs. controlling the menus.  Overall I am very happy with my Sansa Rhapsody.  Having Rhapsody I don't really have a choice in a player, or at least didn't when I got it in 2006, so I have nothing really to compare it to.  It plays music for me when I am running and I get to pick any subscription content I want so what else do I need?  I pay $15/mo, get to listen to millions of tracks without having to pay for each one so I can choose whatever floats my boat that day for that run.  It's a runner's dream come true until there's WiMAX and I can connect directly to Rhapsody wirelessly while running!

<Title>The best MP3 player I've seen...
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>But then again, the only other MP3 players I've used are the iPod Nano and the Creative Zen V. But this is better than those for a number of reasons. I'm just going to break it down into pros and cons:  Pros -Very similar to the iPod Nano but a lot cheaper. -The battery is easily removable. So if the battery ever dies you can easily replace it yourself. -Very durable. I never liked Nanos because I feel like if I have it in my pocket and I bang into something it could break. Also, the screen seems to resist scratches pretty well. I've used this regularly for about 6 months and the screen is still crystal clear. -Accepts Micro SD cards. -No connectivity problems/errors. I got tons of errors with the Creative Zen V. The Sansa is very user friendly.  Cons -Album art has to be less than 30KB or it won't display at all. I never saw album art not show up on a Nano. -Comes with a program that will allow you to convert many different video formats to play on here. The video looks good, but the screen is so small that I feel like my eyes are bleeding when I try to watch something on here. I didn't buy this to watch video on so that doesn't really bother me. -The FM tuner is cool, but I get a lot of static when I'm listening to it while I'm jogging, which makes it kind of useless for that. -The menus are easy to navigate, but don't display some information the way I want it to (like it doesn't show the time while I'm playing a song). You can easily install a firmware replacement called Rockbox if you want to have menus that are a little more suited to your needs.

<Content>The Apple IPod interface is unsurpassed but I do not want to use ITunes.  However, this unit's menu interface is acceptable.  The menus are fairly intuitive but needing some definition.  Finding the user manual on the manufacturer's web site was a challenge.  The unit excels at battery life and sound reproduction.  Its small size is great for the mobile person and the display is decent.  I like the ability to replace the battery when it dies.  Would I buy it again?  Yes, but I would probably look at some other units since this is my first experience with and MP3 player.

<Title>An amazing alternative.
<Date>Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the e260 on sale, primarily because I needed something with a voice recorder. I didn't realize just how great of a deal I was getting.  I've owned three iPods, with my current model being the 5.5g iPod Video. The Sansa blows it out of the water when it comes to sound quality. In a side-by-side comparison, the e260 delivered a much fuller sound.  As far as software, the interface leaves something to be desired. The menu system is a bit touchy when using the scroll wheel, and the file format compatibility is too lacking for my tastes. I ended up heading over to [...] and replacing the firmware. It was painless, and the instructions were very easy to follow. I now have an extremely capable and feature rich mp3 player that can now play AAC files.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a decent mp3 player on the cheap. I'd also highly recommend they, or their more tech-savvy friend, install Rockbox. It's definitely worth it.

<Title>A Very Nice Player
<Date>Sat Sep 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned several Sandisk players. If you want a low cost player with reasonable capacity and an easy AAA battery choice, Sandisk has been the way to go. Now they have moved way up in class, with the E200 series. These players have a great color screen, more advanced navigation, and lithium batteries that can be user replaced by removing 4 screws. Sandisk sells them for [...].   If you have a 4GB player, you have to be able to find things. When I first got the player, it didn't 'find' the 'genres' of my music files, which is one easy way to categorize. Fortunately, when I did a firmware update, the genres showed up. If you want to create (genre or other) categories for your music, you can use something like Jetaudio to label many 'selected' files, all at once, by the way. This player also sorts by album, and the tracks on the album are in the correct order. Again, this is information in the tag, so the tags have to be done correctly. Most 'ripping' programs do this, at least for mp3's.   Aside from genre, the E200 sorts by artist, and title. The scroll wheel is quite fast, and the bright screen makes seeing where you are much easier than previous Sandisk players. The sound is solid and it seems quite clean with a good pair of headphones. It will drive good phones, which are often less efficient.  This is a good player, especially with the rebates. I use drag and drop, and I loaded this player completely in less than half an hour. The size is just about perfect. If it were thinner, it wouldn't really fit anywhere that it doesn't already fit. The screen size is very good, but maybe not for video. It looks like a solid piece of equipment. I never had problems with other Sandisk players, but they looked flimsy. Also, this one looks much more elegant.  If you upgrade the firmware once, future updates should be automatic. When I drag and drop files with good tag info, I can navigate to the artists and the songs without any hitch. Tags are what makes iTunes work, and this player seems to do a good job, as long as you have good tags. If not, try a program like Godfather.  It's great to see a player that looks good, sounds good, and holds a bunch of music. All for a price that is more than reasonable. I like this player so much I wish I had the 8GB version, but maybe I will get a miniSD card.  I don't like handing out 5 starts, but I think this is 4 and a half. The USB charging is a little limited. I did find that a cheap 4AA USB adapter works fine and charges it. But you still have a special cable you must have with you. But that is a small drawback.

<Title>lasting quality? not so great.
<Date>Sun Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There are lots of great reviews already on here at Amazon, and on the web, so I'll just add what I think is important to reiterate.  -The buttons they are *small*, not raised, and very close to the wheel. I have no idea why they did this. It makes it 10x harder than it should be to simply press a forward/backard button. *can* you eventually get used to it? yes. you can. but why should you have to?  -LCD  It was not meant to be viewed the way it's displayed! Why Sandisk? Why? If you hold the device on it's side, the lcd looks great. but if you hold it straight up, it gets washed out and kinda hurts my eyes to look at. The LCD was *obviously* meant to be put in 90' on its side, as a wide-screen lcd. why didn't they just adjust the controls to suit that?  -sound quality  w/the included headphones, average. If you get better headphones, very good. (for my tastes anyway, this one is so subjective, just try them out at the store for yourself)  -voice recording  did they actually test this? when you play back your recording, it's hissy and pops. perhaps it's the mic sensitivity? You have to speak loudly to get a "clear" recording of your voice, but that just seems silly to do in public..  -Crashing The latest firmware (Sept 06) fixed this mostly, but I'm not 100% sure. My sansa used to freeze/crash about once a day before, forcing me to reboot it. (hold down the power button for 15 seconds) It hasn't crashed since, but I still feel wary of it..

<Title>Voice recording = suxx0r!
<Date>Tue Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I'd definitely give this music player 5 stars if it wasn't for the crappy voice recording. Since I'm in college, I use it not only to play music but to record lectures and the sorts. For some odd reason, the player 'creates' 4 folders and these extremely large setup files ( the biggest one on my player is 8 GB? ). On top of that, I can't record anymore. I'm not sure whats going on, but SanDisk needs to sift through these kinks and fix 'em. Other than that, its a great music player...

<Date>Fri Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The user guide for this device is pathetic. They don't even give you basic instructions on how to use Windows Media Player to synch with the device. Unless you use Windows Media Player, the device only has one play list. Anyway, I got it figured out now, no thanks to SanDisk.   The device is ok. It's no iPod, but at least it's not proprietary--you can copy MP3s to it like a flash drive, but only after you set it to MSC mode (Settings > USB Mode > MSC). You only get one play list in the MSC mode. Someone got this for me as a gift; if I had researched it myself, I most likely would NOT have gotten it.

<Title>Made me appreciate my earbuds all the more
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>My new Sansa has made me appreciate my Koss "The Plug" all the more, for finally demonstrating the fidelity I gain by listening with them.  Sounds I could never hear on cheap earbuds, I can hear with them.  For example, the high pitched, squelchy system noises that my new Sansa generates at random but frequent intervals.  Tried it with some crappy earbuds--couldn't hear those awful sounds (couldn't hear much else, either...).  Ah, but with my Plugs, there they are.  Harping along with Kate Rusby and her delicate melodies, standing out even between the beats in loud, thumping electronica.  I have tried and failed to ignore these noises, but if you're content with the bundled earbuds, this player might be fine for you.    But I have other issues too.  None so bad as the system noises with my earbuds of choice, but collectively I think they will probably lead to my returning this product.    There are two different settings for max volume, and top one is only barely adequate.  This is with my Plugs--poor man's in ear isolators, and much more efficient at converting a watt into a thump than regular earbuds--and with regular earbuds the max max volume is totally inadequate.  Not that I want to blow my ears out, but there are just a few songs that I must listen to at full bore.  The user interface has some annoying niggles.  If I am in the main menu, I have to press the power button to go back to the now playing screen, but if I am in the context menu, it is the back button that takes me back to now playing.  This is obnoxious.  It takes far more button presses than it should to rate a song, which requires too much attention that should be diverted to say, my job, or riding my bicycle.  And if it is in random play, I cannot go back later at a better time to rate the song (which is how I remember songs I've never heard but like), because the random play is random both forwards _and backwards_.  Annoying.  I'm no fan of iPods' but I believe with them, you just press in on the center button a couple of times, roll the wheel to your desired rating, and then one more press on the center to lock it in.  Mucho mas grande.  Also, after the screen dims, any button pressed only restores the backlight, and so it is generally necessary to press a button twice to do anything.  This fact exacerbates the buttons' poor tactile feedback into a worse isue than it should be.  And sometimes playing an album's songs results in one song playing twice and one not being played at all.    The player has crashed on me.  Upon unplugging from the computer in MTP mode, it refused to switch back to the player.  It actually flickered between the menu screen and the usb connection screen, and I was able to navigate to the settings, change the usb mode to MSC, and restart the player by plugging it into my computer and unplugging (as normally happens in MSC mode).  It also crashes if I get punchy and push any buttons during the three seconds in which it is hung up right after rating a song.    Pluses:  I'm not recommending this product, unless you believe my issues won't bother you.  But if they don't, the screen is very nice, large and well backlit, and I enjoy the tactile feel and speed and accuracy of the scroll wheel, much like the first generation iPods, before they went to electrostatic wheels.  The case is very attractive and feels durable, battery life is good, and the price is certainly right.  But the musical contributions it makes are most unwelcome!!

<Title>iPod killer!
<Date>Wed Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Absolutely fan-dam-tastic mp3 player! If you get this player, and you really should, definetely make sure you upgrade to the latest firmware as it adds so much more functionality: custom equalizer, multiple ways to play the music (play all, play all artist, play all album, etc). I'm not really concerned about the video capabilities, but I did convert a few Divx files with the included converter software. I'm not too impressed by that though - the original files were 98Mb Divx5 and when they converted, they were 258Mb. That's a waste to me. There also doesn't seem any way to change the settings for a lower bit-rate, but I could be wrong, I didn't dive into the software much.  Works GREAT with MediaMonkey, sounds great, TONS of storage and very crisp screen. Don't be put off by what people are saying about the scroll wheel, I don't have any problems with it and frankly think that if it wasn't very stiff, whenever you put it in your pocket, it would move.

<Title>Very Good but could be better....
<Date>Fri Oct 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player a month ago to listen to ebooks downloaded from Netlibrary.  It is very easy to get the file on to the player and listen to it.  It has a resume feature where you pause the player and turn it off and when you turn it back on it remembers where you are in the book.  Very nice!!  However, because of my fat fingers I sometimes hit the wrong buttons and lose my place.  Then it is a royal pain to fast forward to the spot in my book.  It can take 15-20 minutes to fast forward 10 hours in a file and then it can be tricky to get it to stop in the right place.  I contacted sandisk about getting the fast forward to have the abilitiy to go really fast forward if you hold the button down for a certain amount of time.  Something like jumping ahead an hour instead of 20 second increments like it does now.  They said they would think about it.  I am looking for something else.  In the meantime if I lose my space over 10 hours in or longer I listen from my laptop so I don't have to get frustrated sitting with a slow fast forward.  Just thought I would share this with other audio book lovers looking for something to use.  I am considering a pocket pc instead which has a mobile version of windows medio player and I can use the seek bar and slide to my spot in the file in 10 seconds.  No resume though in those pocket pc from what I hear.
