<Content>Buying this product was a huge mistake. I urge you to refrain from buying any type of Sony product that uses Sony Connect. It is the worst software when it comes to adding music to the player.  The player itself was okay, great battery life, so-so screen, great idea with the USB connect. All of this is washed out because of Sony Connect. It makes adding music to the player because of share rights. Basically CD's that you own and burn to your computer are useless. Customer service is terrible. That's right Sony, I am calling you out of your hole. I will never buy another Sony product (which I consider their other proucts great) because of my distaste for Sony Connect.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I HATE YOU SONY!   
<Overall>1
