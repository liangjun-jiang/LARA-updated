<Content>Do not buy the iPod Classic!! While this iPod offers the basic benefits of the iPod family, Apple has made one, Microsoft-worthy, change.  The only component cables that will work (especially the video/AV/component cables) are the $50 (or more) Apple brand cables.  They have inserted an "authentication chip" requirement into the firmware.    If you notice, the 5th and 5.5 generation iPods (not the newest 6th gen. Classic) are more expensive for a reason: They're LESS RESTRICTIVE.   After-market cables (such as Belkin/Griffin/Etc) will not allow video output from the Classic to TVs.   If Apple introduces a firmware change to allow ALL video cables to be used, then you should consider this one...otherwise, stay with the 5th/5.5 generation units.

<Title>Decisions, decisions..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had my 3rd gen ipod for 4 years, holding out on a video ipod until for a larger screen.  I was torn when Apple released the full-screen flash memory based 'touch' with 16gig max (less than my old 20gig full with music files), and the small-screen hard-drive 'classic' with up to 160gig. Maybe the full-screen and hard-drive together would wear too much on a battery?   I decided I would be annoyed with 16gig, managing which files to load.  I have a Blackberry, and get enough internet, without being limited to wi-fi, plus all my work mail and calendar are tied to that. The bigger touch screen was not worth it for me, and I could not wait for another upgrade.   Because of an Amazon delivery est. 4-7 weeks out, I canceled my order for an 80gig, went to Apple instead(free shipping), and ordered the 160gig.  160gig does not seem extreme.  There is always something new to fill space.  Higher quality music and videos, backups, games etc..  Plus the apple-site shows the 160gig battery has about an extra 30% play-time than the 80gig (apple site Classic tech specs).   Had to pay sales tax, but got free engraving.  Used that to add 'return to' with my name and email on the device.  That gives the honest majority of our population the chance to get it back to me, and the less classy folks will need to scratch up or hide the back side.  **update** I now have it in hand and stick with my 4-star pre-review.   I got it loaded fine, including new videos I had in anticipation, and many photos from my pc -all of which barely made a dent in the space.  The options are very easy to manage in iTunes.  I like you can choose full-photo vs. ipod-veiwing-photo file sizes. Old news to many of you though. Of course I went full-sized, I have 160gig now, and this is a great way to back up those pics. Actually I have 148.79 available space.  Everything looks good and runs smoothly, so I'm not griping about the space the os/software used up.   I like the album art display on the menu and songs.  Things like that don't matter in the big picture to most people, but those types of touches make Apple products seem a little more friendly. I am jumping from a monochrome music-only ipod, so for me this is a major upgrade.   It does have the search option, but typing in a word by scrolling around a click wheel is not much faster than working through the menu. It also has a few games loaded, clock/alarm, a lock code setting, notes and calendar you can load from your pc/mac.  I like the stopwatch, which dispays an old analog version.  Using a stopwatch makes even boring activities seem more like an event. The only real rub with this is the 'TV-out' (video output)option is locked to 'off'.  I had seen a 50buck cable for sale from Apple so I knew I could do it(cnet claimed video-out had been removed), but I read on a rumor-site that you will now be forced to use the Apple licensed component-cable in order to enable the video out.  Fine, it comes with some other adapter stuff, so I'll do it, but their availability is 3-4 weeks.  I do love this device, and appreciate how far we've come since reel-to-reel and projectors, but not getting a hard-drive in the the 'touch', and not having the video cable (and many games) ready for launch takes a star off. *** Update 2 *** Well, I had it stolen already.  Hope the engraving somehow causes the perps some pain.  Smashed my car window at church and grabbed my bag.  I was dumbfounded.  I did an on-line police report and tried to get my serial number from the Apple registration.  Could find no way to veiw previous registrations, and the email confirming the registration didn't have it.  Without the ipod connected to iTunes there appears to be no way to see it there either.  I easily signed on to Garmin and got my gps s/n (they got that too), so I don't know why apple would make it so difficult.  My wife found it printed on the box.  Good old printed ink.  Writing it down may be a good idea.  Maybe this is gods way of telling me to get the touch?

<Title>Prefer Touchscreen
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I prefer the touchscreen, at least over the scrollwheel, simply because the scrollwheel is too imprecise, and it's hard to get to deeply nested items.  I've been happily using a 1 gig (yes, that's one gig) device for almost 2 years now, and have been anticipating moving up to an 8 gig device, so moving to a 16 gig device seems downight exciting.  16 gigs holds 192 CD's at 196 kbps, mp3. Does anyone realize this? I don't have that many CD's, and a lot I don't listen to anymore anyway, and even when you include some converted mixed-tapes and long podcasts, which I need to "recycle" anyway, 16 gigs is, quite frankly, great. I can't imagine having to manage 160 gigs of music, what with al the tagging and converting of files - sounds like a nightmare, and intrudes on the listening experience.  The touch is definitely a breakthrough.

<Title>IPOD 30G + Video Problem
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received an iPod for Christmas 2006, and lately it has been cutting out about 1/2 second, I estimate, randomly. I emailed Apple on their incredibly confusing website, saying let me know how to get this fixed under the one-year warranty. I actually did get a response, but: get this: they'll cover it under warranty, but the shipping and handling would be $31.65!!! I emailed them back complaining, saying it's too much, and that I'll just live with it and buy a Zune next time. I never got a response other than the usual offers to buy more Apple stuff, now that they have my email address!!! BE CAREFUL with this company!!

<Title>Don't buy a special offer from Apple
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Foolish me, I just followed Apple's invitation a few weeks ago to buy their 80 GB iPod classic in flashy, greasy, view-all-fingerprints black finish. What I paid for that meager package (not even including a decent power supply for the wall outlet included, not colormatching white USB cable and white earphones!), was way much than their new classic models. And now this! Apple is fooling us with dumping prices of iPhones and iPods much lower than they offered just a few weeks as "special offer". Yes, their offers are special, but in a manner that I will probably never ever buy an Apple product again. Foul Apple.   BTW: Guess, the new iPod 160GB features a bigger, more power-consuming hard disk drive. So: more memory, less running time (about 8 hours less compared to the 80 GB model), and of course no way to replace the battery yourself?

<Title>iPod  vs iTunes
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like almost everything about iPods, but I can not STAND having to use iTunes...it is a total pain in the behind...If Apple would allow the iPod to just look like a hard drive to my computer I would be all over this thing. I started with a 30 gig iRiver which I loved but out grew. Now I have an 80 gig Archos 504 which is good but a bit large.  When I first got my iRiver I used iTunes software and it drove me batty...Come on Apple!! Free up...let folks use iPods as little HD and you will lose your competitors but until then....

<Title>a "fascinating" device
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This small, portable music player is quite fascinating. It is composed of a synthetic byproduct of petroleum, known by most as plastic, though the exterior shell seems to be composed of a thin sheet of brushed aluminium (Ai, atomic number 13). The "plastic" from which this device is constructed appears to be of the highest quality, however, when closely observed, I found it to be softer than desired, thus, it scratches easily. It plays music that is downloaded to it via a computer, either Macintosh or PC. This may be a deterrent to those of you who do not own a computer. When playing the music, it uses small phonic devices inserted into the ears. These are called "headphones". Due to the nature of these "headphones," dogs cannot listen to your music. When listening to the music, I found it to be of satisfactory quality. This device has a large storage capacity which is its primary selling point. If you buy this device, you should be sure to have music to download to it, otherwise, there will be nothing to listen to. The music that I recommend is Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and Puccini. I find this music to be of superior quality, and worthy of listening to.

<Title>I've got one!!! Size matters..
<Date>Sat Sep 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Ok guys, I just picked up my silver iPod classic 160gb from the Apple store on Regent Street in London so I can give an actual review on it.  I've had an 80GB video iPod for a year and it's already full, so I was really hoping Apple would make an iPod big enough for me. Presently I've got 110GB (and counting) of music, so this iPod is for people like me who have a large music collection, and who like to be able to take it anyplace.  The 160GB iPod is the same size as the 80gb, but costs less than the 80GB did when it first came out.  With a brushed aluminium front finish (similar to the 2 and 3G Nanos), it should be less prone to scratching, though the back is the same smudge magnet, and I don't know how resilient the screen is. The front is curvier than that of the last 2 video iPods, with the screen slightly depressed from the rest of the casing.  Additional features are extra long battery life (40 hours for music, 7 hours for video; I've tested this and playing music non stop without much fast forwarding, etc, it's about right), and cover flow (a fun way of scrolling through for music using album cover art, though it is a bit sluggish).   The new split-screen interface lists functions to the left half of the screen, and symbols (or previews of content such as cover art, videos or photos shown as a slide show) to the right as you scroll through the functions. Neat!!  During music playback, after being idle for about 80 seconds, the screen goes gray and displays a clock, and battery power. Viewing tracks in an album also gives you, at a glance, the track times. Same for video. A nice touch. To my hearing, the sound quality (without equalizers, mind you) is improved; more bass and a bit more treble. The iPod turns off in about 2 seconds, much faster than previous models.  It's still got the other regular features; album track lyrics (new, nicer text font, and it also shows the album art), can play video and games, store photos, contacts, calendar, notes, stopwatch, and screen lock (which allows you to lock the screen with a password), and it can be used as an external hard drive. It shows up in windows explorer as an external drive. The search feature allowing one to type in album/song/artist titles (introduced in the last video iPod) is still there, but relocated to the "music" menu. I didn't spot it at first. In fact, the menu has been reshuffled to make it better, and (under settings) one can now view number of songs, videos, photos, etc graphically just like in iTunes.  If you need loads of space for your music collection, you can't go wrong getting this. Judging from the crowds in the store, Apple's got another hit here. Now if only the iPod touch had this much memory...

<Title>Finally, more than 80GB!
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>20 years worth of CD purchases filled my current 60GB iPod long ago, with another 25GB still waiting to go onto the first iPod that would break at least 100GB.  Glad it finally arrived with some room to spare, but hope it does a better job of navigating that quantity of artists/songs/etc than the 60GB did.  Hope it sounds better, too.  After all, that's what it's for.  I'm not ready to give up the click wheel for on-screen nav, but was impressed with the responsiveness of an iPhone I tried (and I'm brutally critical).  Still, you can feel and control the click wheel when you're not looking at the device (in your backpack, in the car) and you can't do that with a glossy screen on the iTouch.

<Title>Absolutely stunning (I own this product)
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>UPDATE after 2 weeks use:  One feature that makes it all worth it for me: switching the shuffle mode between albums/songs/off while in shuffle mode. Let's say I have 10,000 songs on shuffle, and I hear a song by Nirvana that gets me in the mood to listen to more Nirvana...I click the middle button 3X and switch random to "Album". Now I'm going to listen to the rest of the album. Before, I had to go to Menu, scroll to Music -> Albums, scroll 500 album names to letter N, then choose album. Can't believe reviewers overlooked this feature.  I insist the sound quality is very good. The new DAC is different than the previous gen iPods, but by no means worse. Sound quality is subjective and depends on many factors including genre, encoding, headphones, hearing loss etc. In my isolated case, I noticed a slight improvement in treble and a huge improvement in bass. The 5.5 gen 80gb used to wash out the bass. Mids and overall dynamic range is just about the same.  ------------------------------  Pros:  - For MP3's encoded in 192kbps, you can fit roughly 27,000 on here - about .08 inches thinner than 5.5 gen 80gb iPod - sweet finish on the front - center button is a little concave and feels better - coverflow is great eyecandy, let's leave it at that =) - new interface for every menu is very intuitive and stylish - battery life is AMAZING - 10000 songs and 6 movies later it's not even half full - sound quality is great, no need for eq imo(using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGLZUE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-8782139-7500665">Sony MDR-EX90LP Stereo Earphones</a> ) - when music is playing and the screen in dim, you see the battery charge and clock in large numbers  Cons:  - Coverlow only organized by artist, can't do by album (or at least can't figure this out yet) - Great theft potential - Back still scratches easily - iTunes is not exactly the best software ever written for windows  Notes:  No, this mp3 player is not perfect, but it's way up there when compared to other players overall. Obviously you won't get $100 headphones included. Yes, iTunes is clunky and there are better ways to organize your music, and you have to convert all your movies...at the end of the day: it's small, it's easy, it's cool and it will play you media really really well.
