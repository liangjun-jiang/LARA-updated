<Content>This is a very nice product.    Pros -works well -many functions -cheap  Cons -battery only lasts about 3 hours of playback not 10 as promised -unit does not have a Brand, they say its Anerge but when you receive it, there is no trace of that brand anywhere - it doesnt really matter though

<Title>Battery Powered!!!!!

<Content>You get what you pay for with this product.  This product is powered by a AA battery and is not recharged through the USB port (as I thought it did).  It came via USPS in a brown envelope stamped with airmail postage from Hong Kong.  It DID NOT come in a box or any packaging.
