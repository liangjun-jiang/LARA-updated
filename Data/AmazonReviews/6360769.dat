<Title>Flimsy and small
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It is a nice little package - if you like small packages. The problem I have is the little toggle button in the front - They make it look like a dial in the pics - but do not be fooled it is a flimsy black toggle button. that is easily broken. The toggle is a two piece button that should not have been used.   Spend a little more and get the bigger Zen or IPod

<Title>Creative's products have problems, Zen V is no exception
<Date>Sat Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my Dad as his christmas present becuase he said he wanted an MP3 player. For 100 bucks it was a good deal, or so I thought. After he installed the software, Windows kept on giving errors saying that the device wasn't connected or something was wrong with the hardware. After reinstalling the fireware on the device (Creatives support is really not user friendly) Windows still could not detect it. Since my Dad lost the box, I couldn't return it to the store that I bought it from.   Like the last Creative product I bought, the Zen Mirco, I've encountered problems like no other. Save yourself some time and a headach. Look form something else OTHER then a Creative.

<Title>Awesome player for the price!
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very nice compact player. I've had this player for 2 1/2 weeks and  have had no problems whatsoever. It has worked flawlessly. Downloading music is very simple. The clock, alarm, customizable EQ, microphone, organizer, and FM radio are all nice touches. I added a V skin which really help it from slipping out of your hands. Headphone sound quality is good but I had a problem with the foam cover falling off all the time so I've upgraded to V moda bass headphones. This is a very nice system with a ton of features for under $100.00

<Title>Pros Great Sound Size- Minor Cons
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this player as a gift.  I am really impressed with the sound quality. Once you get the hang of it, navigation is easy. Cons Recharging the battery is a pain.  The shipping Mini-USB to USB connector also serves as a means of charging the battery while connected to the computer.  An A/C wall charger can be ordered from Creative.  I don't understand why this component wasn't included in the original package.  After all charging off PC takes *forever*. If you travel without a laptop and didn't order the additional wall charger, once your battery runs out - you're sunk.  Pros Cnet gave the Zen V Plus high ratings and called it an "Editors Pick". On the downside, accessories are not available at retail stores that sell the Zen.  As of this writing, the only place you can buy them is at Creative.

<Title>very pleased
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this for my 11 year old son. At first I was upset, it is much smaller than I had expected.However he loves it. The software is very user- friendly and he needed only basic help from me in the begining, now he can load all his own music without assistance. It does have a joystick-type button to access the  menu so I would recommend caution and patience when using that. So far, he has had no issues with it.Definitely worth the money. The sound quality is amazing. One thing that is not made clear though: it does have a FM tuner, BUT you can NOT record from it, we thought you could.

<Title>Unreliable
<Date>Sun Jul 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I thought this product had a great price and excellent features, and when it worked it was actually pretty excellent.  My complaint though, was that it crashed very frequently. With each firmware upgrade things sometimes got better and sometimes got worse. I had to carry a paper clip with it so that I could reset it when this happened (which happened every day). The worst part of this is that it crashed most often when seeking, which I would want to do after the previous crash to get back to the part I was listening to. It was very frustrating.  Finally, a few days after the warranty expired the system simply ceased functioning. It won't turn on, no response from plugging into the computer, nothing. It's dead.  I was very sad to see it die, because I hoped they might eventually fix the crashing problem with firmware upgrades, and despite the crashing everything else was very good (good sound, pleasant interface, even had a line-in recording and built in microphone).

<Title>great but dissapointing
<Date>Thu Aug 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The product is great. It is so light and small that it fits anywhere. The screen is bright and easy to work. I am dissapointed because the product does say that you can fit 500 songs but that is not true. They should be truthful and say that it is possible to fit up to 500 songs since you have to take into consideration the actual "size" of the song. In other words, how long the song may be has to do with how many you can fit. All in all I was able to fit 211 songs. Not even close to half but I do like it.

<Title>Better with at least 2G of storage
<Date>Tue Aug 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The only drawback would be that if you really want to add videos to it,make sure you get one with at least 2G of storage or more.The videos are not compressed and therefore take up more space.The file size doubles when converted.  I have had to reset the unit a couple of times but overall,I'm cool with the Zen V Plus.I like Creative's products and will likely buy another Zen V Plus player but I will get one with more storage.

<Title>feels cheap, navigation is odd, but works like a charm
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>overall, for the price, it's an awesome little audio/video player. the video, although on a really tiny screen, looks fantastic. it feels very futuristic to be watching such quality video on such a tiny device. it also records audio with a built-in mic and plays the radio. it's really amazing how much technology they can cram into a tiny peace of plastic. that said, it has its problems. the navigation is goofy; there are only two buttons even though it appears there is plenty of room for four, and to pull up the menu you have to hold down the 'back' button and wait. which i feel is more than a little counter-intuitive. it sometimes stops responding when the battery gets low, but after charging it's right back to normal. i wouldn't recommend it as a gift, because at first glance (and touch) it seems cheap, but if you're looking for a tiny, light, inexpensive device for yourself that can play multiple audio and video formats, this one does the trick.

<Title>Don't Buy This!
<Date>Thu Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content> Update:   The player freezes with no sound and with the screen on (displaying album artwork), at random times and for no apparent reason. One of my two units had to be reset so many times that it can no longer be reset: it feels like that internal pad you press on with a sharp pin has now disappeared (it must have broken off). Our only recourse now is to wait 3 days for the battery to run dead, and hope that it will be reset simply by recharging it from scratch. We've only had this unit since August (it's now December), so I no longer feel the reliability level of this product is sufficient to justify its purchase. Buy something else that doesn't have to be reset all the time!     I bought the 2 GB model because at the time it had the largest flash memory of any unit that works with my Napster-To-Go subscription, so it can store the largest number of songs and color photographs. The 1 GB version is identical except for the amount of installed flash memory.   Since this is the V Plus version, it also has an FM radio and voice recorder in it.  I gave this 1 GB model only 3 stars because it's a much smaller amount of memory than other models, and there's a glitch described below causing it to go comatose after being disconnected from power.  Why did I choose a flash memory based MP3 player? Napster-To-Go compatible hard drive models with much larger storage capacity abound, but I figure they'll break prematurely because they use a hard drive that can't withstand much jogging, accidental bumping or dropping.   I bought two of these players plus the separately sold AC wall charger, and attached one of them to the wall charger for 6 hours, while I attached the other one to a USB port on my PC to charge it for 6 hours.   At the end of 6 hours, the unit attached to the PC was fine until I unplugged it, then it went comatose and would not even revive when the reset button was pushed several times. I had to exchange it for a replacement unit just two days after buying it.   The unit attached to the wall charger was fine, and I went on to load it up with music using my Napster-To-Go subscription. That was fine until 2 weeks later, when my wife charged it on a PC using the USB cable. After charging and disconnecting from the PC, it too went comatose.   This time I was able to revive it by pushing the reset button.   Then I took a look at the other unit, which had been charging on the AC wall charger. It had also gone comatose, and I was able to revive it by pushing its reset button.   The reset button is inside a tiny hole on the left edge of this unit. You can find it by following the thin groove that's below the screen all the way to the left edge of the unit, where you'll find it on the side. The picture in the manual does NOT accurately depict its location.   The hole leading to the reset button is very, very small. The instructions say to penetrate that hole with a pin.   I used the sharp end of a safety pin to do this. When the pin is inserted, it's quite easy to miss the reset button unless the pin is inserted at exactly the right angle. You'll know it's not at the right angle if you don't feel that you're pushing on a pad with a spring behind it when you reset the unit. That pad travels a short distance until it's stopped by a control surface inside the unit; that's when you know it has been reset.   The reset system should be redesigned so that it doesn't depend on the angle you insert the pin to work. I suspect that the first unit I returned could have been reset if I had known that you have to insert the pin at just the right angle to do it. Since I didn't know, my several attempts to reset it were not successful.   Resetting the unit is akin to rebooting a PC: it revives it when the internal software (called "firmware") has frozen by restarting the software. It does not erase your songs or photos.   Make no mistake: this MP3 player looks, feels and works beautifully. However, since the firmware is newly designed, it appears to have bugs relating to disconnecting it from USB or charger power that cause it to freeze, and the reset button is a little hard to use if you don't know about the things I described above that could cause you to be unable to reset it. You may just end up with a unit that's frozen and not be able to reset it.   It needs to be a little more user friendly than that. Hopefully a future firmware update will be available that will lower the occurrence of the unit locking up (freezing), especially when disconnecting from a USB port or AC charger after recharging it. As another user noted, the "safe disconnect" icon is often times not even in the system tray.   If you don't subscribe to Napster-To-Go, your options to get content for your MP3 player are to transfer your favorite songs from CDs you own to your hard disk ("ripping the songs"), or purchase songs one track or album at a time, at a price ranging from 88 to 99 cents per song from Napster, Rhapsody or WalMart.   You can also download books you want to listen to (such as best sellers and classics) or "podcasts" (your favorite newspapers read aloud, or your favorite radio programs like NPR) from a plethora of sites (like NPR's website, or NetLibrary or Audible) that make these available, onto your computer's hard drive. Now you can listen to your music, audible books and podcasts over your PC loudspeakers while sitting at your PC.   Then you can transfer your songs, audible books and podcasts from the hard drive of your PC to your MP3 player(s). This enables you to take your MP3 player with you to enjoy listening in your car, in your office, while jogging or working out at the gym, while shopping, or at the pool or the beach to hear your music, audible books and podcasts anywhere.

<Title>A solid music player
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It's been about a month since this came in the mail and it still works great! The Zen V Plus, in my opinion, is better than the iPod Nano. This can play videos, it has a built in radio, it has a bigger screen than the Nano, and with the Line In Recording feature, it makes this little tyke a beast. The downside to it is that Scratches are starting to show and it doesn't come with a wall adapter. Finger prints show up like wild fire also.    the programs it came with makes it all even easier! I can convert my Video and Audio files if I want. The new thumbstick is neat. it would've been better if it was alittle bigger. Fully Charging the player only takes me around 3 to 4 hours and It's battery life is about 15 to 17 hours for me. Please INSTALL THE CD BEFORE YOU PLUG THE V PLUS INTO THE COMPUTER!!! I don't know why, but that's what said in the manual.   The earphones are pretty big, they pop out of my ear real easily. buy earphones, especially Creative's new In-Ear earphones.   If you have the money, buy this! It's well worth your money! If you even have more, try saving up for the Vision: M models.

<Content>The Creative Zen V Plus is in my opinion is a lot better than the Ipod or Ipod Nano.If you plan on buying an mp3 player than buy this one.It is really easy to set up and get started.It has a lot of features.  -1gb of music. -Photos. -Videos. -Date and Time display. -Mini recording microphone.   -AND LOTS MORE-  You can upload a different background for it,change the color theme,change which angle the screen displays.It shows music by Playlist,Album,Artist,Genres,All Tracks,Recordings,Bookmarks and DJ.The crontrolls light up in te dark.The only downside is that it scratches easily,so you might want to buy a case or a cover.  (Note:The first time you charge the mp3 player dont play with it let it charge because that will affect the battery.)

<Title>Piece of Junk
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My daughter received this product for christmas and it froze on her about 10 times the first day and then wouldn't work at all.  After 3 days of tech support from the website, they finally agreed it doesn't work.  I just sent it back (Of course I had to pay postage)so didn't save any money.  Oh and to top it off the company I purchased it from on Amazon won't reply to my emails.

<Title>Read the reviews before you buy - then don't!

<Content>Flimsy feel to the toggle switch.  I bought it for the line-in recording capabilities, however the connector is too big for the connection on my stereo. The previous reviewer mentioned firmware issues causing problems when disconnecting from USB. This is what happened to mine; I am unable to reset it or fix it. There is a list of items on the screen including reboot, reload firmware (which erases what is installed, but then seems to provide no way to reload). I'm returning it, and will stick with my Sandisk red 256 mg player. This one has very simple drag and drop capabilities through windows explorer, or easy sync with media player.  the Zen isn't as easy to transfer music to, at least compared to the Sandisk.

<Title>Great Product

<Content>I bought this Zen for my 11-year old daughter for Christmas, and she just loves it.  The menu has been very easy to use.  She learned how to manuever around the menu even before we entered anything on it.  It is just the right size, works great, and has enough capability (pics, music & video) to keep her busy.

<Content>This little MP3 player was exactly what we were looking for.   It downloads very easily and you can download both music and videos.   It is an impressive player and for the money, it was perfect.  I was looking for something for a pre teen and he was very impressed, but in the process other kids and adults who saw this product were equally impressed.
