<Title>Great alternative to the iPod
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you're like me and don't want to join the millions of sheep, try this player.  I got it about 3 weeks ago and I'm totally pleased with its features.  The display is simple but I don't need fancy graphics.  Just want it to play mp3's.  The unit is a little bigger than the old e series but it's classy in style.  Yes, the glass face does attract fingerprints but I bought a case so it's not an issue.  I don't use WMP for transferring the files.  Just plug it in and drag the files onto the music folder.  What I like most about it is the AAC file support.  If you encode your files at 96K AAC, you can squeeze quite a bit of music on 8 gigs (about 3 megs per 5 min song).  But then you always have the SD media slot if you run out of room.  Try that on an iPod.  The EQ is nice to have.  The earbuds are ok but I bought some better ones.  My only gripe is the way the player organizes the music.  It doesn't read the tag for track number so each album is listed in alphabetical order.  That's fine for most music but if you listen to progressive music, the songs all segue into each other so the songs have to play in a certain order.  I suppose I can make a playlist to fix that.  It's minor and I can live with it.  Definitely give this player a shot!

<Title>Overall problematic MP3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines.  The rewind bar doesn't work either!  you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease.

<Title>Good player, bad software
<Date>Sat Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>As an MP3 player, the Sansa View works perfectly well. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the software installed on the player. It's glitchy, and even small annoyances can become big problems when there's no good solution for them.  After updating to Windows Media Player 11, I found that my Sansa no longer worked with my computer. None of the songs I added showed up on the computer, and the player refused to let me add any new songs or sync with Windows Media Player. I couldn't upgrade the firmware, either. Formatting the device solved the problem, but it also meant that I had to add all 8 GB of music back onto the player.  The manual that comes with the View contains almost no information about installation or troubleshooting, though the customer service reps are very patient and helpful if you end up having to call them. Also, the player only works with Windows XP (and possibly Vista), which limits anyone who prefers to use other operating systems.   Though this MP3 player will charge through a USB cable, those with laptops or computers with USB 1.0 ports will want to (or possibly even have to) purchase the wall charger. Though my laptop has USB 2.0, it still doesn't charge the battery very well or very quickly.    I really enjoy the Sansa View as an MP3 player. The interface is nice, and so is the design. It's easy to use - I use it to listen to music in the car, and it works wonderfully. I only wish that the software installed on the device was anywhere near as good. It's what's keeping me from recommending the View to anyone else.

<Title>Love My MP3
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love this tiny MP3 player.  Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great.  I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio.  The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort.  I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music.  To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price.

<Title>Pretty good player
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player almost 2 months ago and I love it. I bought a wall charger and a protective case at the same time, so I've had no trouble with fingerprints or charging. The charge holds very well (I haven't tried charging from the PC, I prefer the wall charger) I use Windows Media Player 11 to manage my music files, and I've had absolutely no trouble syncing files, just a matter of choosing the songs and they sync in seconds. I did not use the CD that came with the player, so I can't comment on the content, instead I went to the Sandisk website and downloaded the user's manual in PDF format, which is pretty straightforward. (BTW, it also explains that some USB ports may not have enough power to charge the player, this may be why some customers are having trouble) Downloading photos was also very easy, again using WMP 11. I also downloaded video that I took with a digital camera.So far I haven't had any freezes like those described by other customers (I would suggest going to Sandisk's website and updating the firmware) I don't give the product 5 stars because if I'm listening to songs and then go to photos or the radio, when I go back to songs, they want to start again from song#1 instead of where I left it, which I find annoying. Also, I didn't like the earbud style (replaced them with Sony) and the fact that it didn't come with a wall charger, I had to buy it separately (but most players don't come with the charger these days). However the modulary style of the charger means that I got an extra sync cable, which is nice because the plug is propietary (another thing I don't like) Overall, I'm very happy with the View. Nice display, easy to use menu, great battery life, good sound, nice slim size, memory card slot,good radio reception, voice recorder, power saver features, syncs trouble-free with WMP 11. The good definitely outweigh the bad.

<Title>Better than the Ipod I had
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I previously had an ipod nano 2nd gen.  it had gotten water logged and thus, died.  my fault entirely.  i began to research more into other mp3 players.  my best friend showed me his sansa, i think it was the c240.  after a lot of messing around with it, i decided that the sansa brand was the way to go.  the fm tuner works great incase i would rather just want to listen to the radio.  i love the drag and drop option for music rather than syncing to a music player.  the screen resolution is great, the only problem is that it gets a bit sketchy.  it doesn't affect the performance so i'm not worried about it.  i got it as a christmas present from my fiance and absolutely love it.  the screen is awesome, the music quality is great coming out.  the only thing i would suggest is getting a new pair of headphones.  the plugs that come with it tend to get uncomfortable after some time.  no problems with the battery.  i had a usb-house plug adapter.  it charges it great and i get a couple days of play.  that's including use in car and listening to it during classes.  the usb plug adapter can be gotten at walmart pretty cheap.  i would recommend charging it that way rather than via the computer.  that way, you don't always have to have the computer on.

<Date>Wed Feb 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I ended up buying four of these MP3 players.  I originally bought them for my children for Christmas.  Then my husband said he would be interested in one, so I bought him one also.  They were all so happy with them that my husband suggested I get one for myself and I did.  We all really like them.  I love the fact that I don't have to carry around all the cds anymore and once I got used to how it works I just love it.  My version even though they say they are the same thing are different than the other three but either way we like all the features they have.

<Title>A competitive mp3 player in an iPod-dominated world.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>There have been many mixed reviews of this product, and from what I can tell, opinions are split between people who expect an MP3 player and those who expect an iPod.  No doubt, iPods have their benefits, but the Sansa View has proven to be superior in my opinion. Being a college kid, I keep my MP3 player with me at all times as if it were some sort of life-support equipment.  I used to have a first-generation iPod Nano, but I converted from that fad religion when I saw my girlfriend's Sansa e200.  My Sansa View has more capacity than the current generation iPod's in the same price range, with just as high quality of audio playback.  The navigation with the rubberized click wheel takes about three minutes to get used to (yes, the iPod's amazing touch wheel is award winning, but you'll find, after about a day of use, that the Sansa's navigation is just as intuitive as any other).  There are other structural features that add to the View's quality: the integrated hold switch is easy to use, and the back of the Sansa View is covored by a rubberized finish that helps keep the player still when on a table top (unlike the scratch-prone chrome backing of the iPod).  When it comes to the synchronization of the View with your computer's media library, I strongly reccommend using Windows Media Player (free from Microsoft, if your PC doesn't already have it; they have a Mac version, too :-D).  That program's Sync tab and organization, ever since the introduction of WMP 10, have made it just as easy to use as iTunes or any other, once you get used to the different formatting.  It will even recognize your specific Sansa View, and the two work quite harmoniously together. As I have not yet had any technical troubles with my View, the only problem I see inherit in its design is that the Sansa's screen stays lit, with a glowing "connected" symbol, the entire time it's plugged into your computer.  Even when you're not synchronizing, and you're just charging the player, the screen is fully lit.  The problem I see this having the potential to cause, though it has yet to happen, is someone forgetting to remove their View, leaving it connected to their computer for the weekend or so, and having dead or floating pixles burnt into their screen when they return to use their player.  I don't know if that would happen, but, nonetheless, I always take my View off its charging cord the minute it's done. Despite this flaw, the View has countless other features, making it superior to the iPod and other player.  It has a built in FM tuner, which is handy when you don't want to listen to any of your own music, and you just want some casual background music.  You can even record FM radio, along with anything else you want with the built in microphone and voice recorder. One last important thing to mention:  Many people don't realize that when they buy an iPod, they're aren't really getting an MP3 player, as an iPod can only play the specific iPod file type coverted and purchased through iTunes.  Furthermore, the video capability of iPods is limited to ONLY those videos purchased through iTunes.  The Sansa, on the other hand, can play raw MP3 files without having to be converted, and play any of the most popular internet video types, such as WMA and ANYTHING converted through Sandisk's media converter (free from the website).

<Title>A very good product and great value.
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've been a fan of Sansa players for some time.  Their products outshine the competition on several critical points:  --They are Audible.com compatible.  If you love audio books like I do (I drive a lot and they are a constant companion) then this is an essential feature.   --It has a built in voice recorder. --It works with a variety of software. --It has a built in FM tuner...AND it can record FM radio too...a really wonderful feature. --You can expand its memory with a miniSD card.  The screen is bright and the controls are simple to use as well.  A couple of points: --the chapter mode for audiobooks doesn't work well.  I don't recommend using it since it loses its place in books. --the radio records in .wav format which uses up a lot of memory.  (I worked around this by saving the file as .wmv and playing it as a video (one large file went from ten Gig(!) down to 500meg.  Overall, dollar for dollar, it is a better value and more functional than any other product currently available.  You will not be disappointed.

<Content>So far my view has been almost perfect. I have had it for about a month now and have had no problems with freezing etc that others had reported.

<Title>Sansa View Rocks!
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is my second Sansa mp3 player, the first being an e260, so I kind of knew what to expect.  As expected, it's a great mp3 player with the ability to play videos.  It's very thin and has a very nice finish to it.  I like the controls on the View vs the e200, the scroll wheel is where you press instead of having buttons outside of the scroll wheel.  I bought a silicone case and armband for it and the fitment is perfect.  The only hang up I have is the Sansa Media Converter.  You can drop in all kinds of movies and have it convert them to video your View can play, but not only is it slow, but you have to leave the View plugged in while it's converting.  I use Any Video Converter to convert to MPEG4 (the free version works great) and then drag & drop on the View.  It does hang every once in a while for about 10 seconds, but only the controls/display, the music keeps playing.  There was a firmware update that GREATLY improved this, but SanDisk rolled back to the previous version because it would kill the battery in about half the time, or less.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with it.  Oh, and it doesn't have a place for a lanyard like the e200 series does.  Sometimes I like to hang it around my neck while at work because I don't use the arm band unless I'm running or at the gym.

<Title>SanDisk tech support saves the day!
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First a word of caution for people ordering from Dell:  I ordered Sansa E280 from Dell but they shipped me Sansa View 8GB instead for reasons Dell said that "were beyond their control". They called the View an "upgrade". Although it has a bigger screen, I'm having my doubts.  I made the mistake of not opening the box for 35 days. When I did and discovered it was not what I ordered, I tried to return it to Dell, but was told they could not take it back even though it was not what I ordered. So much for "the benefit of the bargain" that I was taught in law school. Dell's customer service rep told me that I could always return the product within 90 days if it was defective so I should go ahead and try it out. An hour later, after downloading a few pictures and songs I disconnected it from my computer, but the View's screen was frozen with the words "Connected" in the screen. At this point I was very  ready to return it to Dell, but the new service rep denied any 90 day defective return policy and said my only recourse was with the manufacturer. I will never buy any Dell product again, nor will I buy any product sold by Dell. They respect neither common law principles nor their customers.  When I called SanDisk tech service, they resolved the technical problem of the screen freeze instantly by walking me through a hard reboot [by pressing the power off slider switch door about 15 seconds and resetting the firmware]. Naturally the SanDisk tech support person for the View told me that it was a much better product than the E280 (in spite of the inferior reviews by customers here at Amazon). He said "all these issues have been addressed through firmware updates".  I am hoping he is right!

<Title>Great little mp3
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there.

<Title>NEW PRODUCT -  NOT THE SHELVED ONE  (Corrected)
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Amazon is incorrectly using the product description from the old Sansa View that was shelved earlier this year.  They should create a new product page for this Sansa View.  This is a completely new product that was just announced by SanDisk a few days ago and will be available in early Fall.  UPDATE: It now looks like Amazon has fixed this entry.  The product description seems like it does now describe the new Sansa View, which is correctly pictured in the graphic at the top of the screen.  I also want to add that this device seems to pack the power of an iPod Nano + FM radio + support for subscription music sites + MicroSD expansion slot for about $50 less for the same amount of memory.  It's also only slightly thicker.  Seems like a killer device, but I might wait until someone can review the quality before I buy one.

<Title>Would be great....
<Date>Sun Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The good first: this is a very sleek player, nice and sturdy, with a much better wheel than any other mp3 player (in my opinion). The FM radio function is great, and the screen is beautiful.  The bad: It is very annoying to figure out how to put songs on the Sansa View, and how to take them off. Sometimes your songs show up in Windows Media Player, sometimes they don't. The instructions are virtually useless. The instructions state to simply drag music into your "MUSIC" folder on the Sansa...except there were no folders on my Sansa (and no, they weren't hidden, I checked multiple times). I had to use the format option before anything showed up. Frustrating as it was, after a few hours I figured I could deal with it, because I use my mp3 players more when they are disconnected from the computer anyway.  But then, my Sansa started freezing everytime I went to the Video menu. I hadn't even put any videos on it yet!   I bought this looking to switch away from the iPod, but I think I'll have to go back to it. At least I know my iPod works, and is easy to manage my music files.  If you can easily figure out how to manage music and get a Sansa that doesn't freeze, then more power to you.  EDIT: Just would like to say, about an hour after I wrote this review, the screen and the blue ring started flickering for no reason (no music was playing or anything). I brought it immediately back to Best Buy and got a full refund.

<Title>Malfunction and battery doesn't last long
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting "stuck" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.    Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice.  It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.  Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality.  This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly.

<Title>Good, but not as great as i thought.....
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine (16gb one) the first week and heres the deal: The player is beautiful, no question. The size is perfect imo and very light. The radio and mic features are very nice, and watching music videos or movies is much more enjoyable then i would have thought, thanks to the screen size, vivid colors, and detail. Everything is crisp and clear.  But the player does have many faults that I found upsetting, epecially for such a new product.  There does seem to be some difficulty with adding songs, you can drag-drop or use windows media player to "sync", but personally both options are faulty. Drag-drop twice did not work when i tried adding a single song to the rest of the files, and the folder wmp "sync"'s to is not the same folder where you drag-drop to, so maybe its an "either or" type of thing. wmp would be easy IF (and thats a big if) u already use it to manage your mp3 collection (i didnt though.)  For some reason mine would not retain a charge after charging from my pc. I took it back at one point and they suggested a wall charged since many have "problems" with usb charging. I'd never had a problem with my old ipod charging that way, but i bought a wall charger and it worked, charged to full and held the charge from that point on, so I dont know it thats this type of player or mine unit only, but its something to note.  Mine also did experience random "freezing." Its not too often, but if you keep pressing buttons it will last longer,so when I noticed it freeze, I would press nothing and wait for about 20 seconds the screen goes black (music will still be playing) and it basically ignored whatever you just pressed, but is ready for commands again. Very similar to a pc when it has to boot up a hd to access data, but this is flash based so it really shouldnt be doing that. (plus thats pretty long even for a spinning drive)  Also while its a solid design, the polished exterior is very prone to fingerprints and scatches. Smudges wipe away easy, but you'll be wiping it often. And the hard platic will get scratched by almost anything so I would ABSOLUTELY buy a protecive case if I bought one new.   Just for note.... the instructions are pure junk (if you care), there are about 21 preinstalled songs that are NOT on the disk that comes with the player, so dont format or delete if you want to keep those, ohhhh and the earbuds are less comfortable then the cheap ipod ones, so you should probibly drop a few bucks for new buds.  I know I made this sound like a bad player, which is sad cause I really love mine. But I had high expectations for it being better then the ipod and im just not sure it is. I had an ipod mini for 3 years and while it had almost none of the features this thing has, it was reliable, fast and easy to use. I never had any of these issues with that player so its hard to justify the extras when you're giving up some of the main functionality, like adding and playing mp3s without hangups. :/

<Title>Very good for the price
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Sansa View on sale for $129.99, and I am very pleased with it. As a first-time buyer of an mp3 player, I was reluctant to pluck down a lot more money for an IPod, which at this point seem overpriced and overrated, given the other choices that are now out there.   The sound quality is quite good. I'd forgo the built-in EQ settings, which sound uninspired, and opt for the custom EQ that allows you to tailor the frequency response to your own tastes. I agree with some other criticisms that I've read online both in customer and professional reviews that lower bass response is a bit lacking.  But I've found that a combination of tweaking the custom EQ settings, plus buying a better pair of earbuds that the ones provided, make up for this mild inadequacy. I bought V-Moda Bass Freq earbuds, which really help to round out the sound of the Sansa by providing plenty of lower bass response. My listening tastes range across classical, jazz, rock, blues, popular, and electronica, and the sound quality the Sansa provides is very good across all these genres.   The Sansa View is a bit large for a flash-memory based player, but I think this is due to the generous size of the display. The video quality is bright, sharp, and with good color, for videos, photos, and album covers. One small complaint is that the wallpaper options are quite plain, and there doesn't seem to be a way to add your own wallpaper options (or at least I haven't discovered it yet). Menus are simple and easy to navigate.   One feature I really wanted which no IPods have is an FM tuner. The digital tuner works quite nicely, with good sound and reception and up to 20 presets.  I really like the control wheel. It works smoothly and the rubber gives it a supple feel. And the look of the Sansa View simple and elegant, with a shiny piano black finish, with the body having a sturdy, solid build quality to it.   I've found the 8gb built-in memory to be more than adequate for my CD library. I've loaded around 60 CDs (a little over 1100 songs), and I still have about 1.5gb left. Bear in mind that many of my CDs are classical symphonies, jazz compilations, or electronica, which average 60-70 minutes each and take up space more quickly than your average CD. And the expansion slot for a microSD card, which I haven't tried yet, would allow me to add an additional 8gb of storage.   Overall, I'd rate the Sansa View as "best in class" in terms of offering very good overall quality and a generous selection of features for a modest price, compared to other comparable mp3 players.

<Title>Nice little MP3
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I picked this up a couple of weeks ago and have been using it on a daily basis.  The initial setup was easy, just plug it into a USB port on your computer and start downloading music and pictures.  There is no software for the unit, however you don't need it as you can drag and drop your files to the appropriate folder on the unit.  The screen is amazing!!  It is very clear and bright.  The sound is amazing with several presets to choose from( Jazz, Classic, Rock, etc.) as well as a customizable Equalizer.  I love the slim design as well as the jog shuttle wheel on the front. The FM radio on the unit lets you record live broadcast and save them for listening later.  It also has the capability of playing audio books and podcasts.  One of the main reasons I picked this unit up was the expandability with the micro SD slot on the side.  Once I find a nice case I will be ready to go!!    If you are looking for a sleek mp3 with nice lines, amazing screen, good sound and easy transfer I would recommend this to anyone.

<Title>Beats the iPod and the Zune!
<Date>Sun Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am not sure why everyone has given this player a bad review. I own the 8 GB version, and I love it. I have never been impressed with the iPod. It's too over-rated, and it's not appealing to me. Although the click-wheel is cool, that's all that I like.  I also looked into the Zune, and I'm not impressed with that one either. I checked out the 30 and 80 GB versions of the Zune. The 30 GB is like a brick. It's huge! And it's heavy. And I don't really need 80 GB of space.  Then one day, strolling through Best Buy (or rather, Worst Buy) I came upon the SanDisk Sansa View. I started playing with the features on the in-store display, and I was impressed. First off, SanDisk has been around for years and is a name that geeks everywhere (like me) know and trust. Second, it's not an iPod. Third, it does all of the same things as the iPod, and it's cheaper. Let's compare.....  The 4 GB iPod Nano (3rd. Gen.) is $149.99. It plays music, video, displays pictures, has a click-wheel, and is kinda small.  The 8 GB SanDisk Sansa View is $149.99. It plays music, video, displays pictures, and has an FM tuner. It can also record through a microphone, and it has a click-wheel type device on the front for navigation through menus.  My favorite feature that blows the iPod and the Zune out of the window is that the Sansa View is expandable. You can put in up to 4 GB more via MicroSD or SDHC. I've never seen an iPod do that!  So, overall, I am in love with this iPod and Zune killer. I hope more people out there will realize that the big names like iPod and Zune are just getting money for a name, where as the other companies like SanDisk give quality products for the price of the big name stuff.  Oh, and one last thing. Windows Media Player is the only downside. I'm not a fan of the Windows Media Player, but it the sync process easy and fast. I put 4 GB of music on my player all at once, and it only took about 4 minutes. Not too bad.  Not-as-popular companies: 1   Big name companies: 0

<Content>The instructions are bad. As mentioned is someone else's review the user is directed to place files in folders on the Sansa View that do not exist. Supposedly one can drag and drop WMV files right into the device and they will play. That has not been my experience. SanDisk does provide the SanDisk Media Converter for download but it is painfully slow to transfer/convert video and will only do so if the Sansa View is plugged in. The software puts it directly on the device which is a one way street. I found that I could not then copy the videos back to my PC for later use (i.e. create a stash of videos to use on the Sansa View). I also discovered that the Sansa View, while offering to display Album Art will totally screw up some of the art. I have several CD worth loaded and find that sometimes the art displayed is from a completely different album. I also tried using the godawful Media Converter software to load photos. Within the software are controls to supposedly rotate the picture for optimum display on the Sansa View screen with a little preview display included. The rotation was completely bollixed after transfer to the device. Everything was off by 90 degrees clockwise. In this instance I was able to copy the folder to my PC and fix the problem with other graphics software and then put them back on the Sansa View. Hopefully SanDisk will come up with firmware and software fixes for these problems, but until then I really cannot recommend this product to anyone.

<Content>I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend.  Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck.  We tried everything but nothing would happen.  The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one.  The next one we received at least turned on.  We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on.  Thats where trouble came.  For video and pictures, you  have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter.  I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player.  We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing.  My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck.  I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems.
