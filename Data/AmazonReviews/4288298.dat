<Title>WARNING- DO NOT BUY!!!
<Date>Thu Aug 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I would give this 0 stars if i could. Don't waste your money on this product.  I bought this item last winter and the headphone jack recently stopped working.  I sent RCA the player for a replacement.  Let me tell you that the people that work there are incompetent.  They first said that I would have to pay $69 for labor and that it would take 7-10 days for me to receive my replacement.  10 days went by and I called them back, and they said it had not yet shipped but that I should expect it shortly.  12 more days, now three weeks total, and I called them back and they told me that they had sent back the original to me because there was something wrong with the Serial number.  They said I should have received it, but I had not, and they had no idea why.  Three days later I called back and apparently what they told me before was a mistake and that they had not sent it back to me.  In addition, the mix-up was because the headphone-jack breaking was a KNOWN problem and therefore I would not have to pay the $69, but that it would take another 7-10 days.  12 days later, more than a month now, no replacement so I called back.  Apparently, its on back order, and they could not give a range for when I should get my replacement.  At this point, I no longer want to deal with this company so I ask for a refund, which takes 6-8 weeks.  I would rather wait to get the refund and buy a different product, especially since the headphone-jack was a KNOWN problem, which means it would probably happen again.  Do not waste your money on this device, you WILL regret it.

<Title>Treat it like your computer..
<Date>Sun Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my lyra for several days now, and well the first day all of the con's were there.  &lt;> slow menu change's &lt;> out of sync audio &lt;> ect... Then I had a thought, the lyra's a usb hard drive, and all of the "disk access" related issues have a easy fix....Defragment the HD.  Over a usb 1.0 connection it took me 9.5 hours to defrag it, but once that was done the menu's are more responsive, and the files load quicker.   Treat it right and it will do all it can for you.   Just don't bad mouth it if your wanting it to do more then it was designed to do, for being the size of a paperback it does a lot.

<Title>Another product built to break
<Date>Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>CONS: Can't really use while walking/running(too big). Headphone jack stopped working. Most of the time it had 5 minute waiting period (frozen) for loading songs. You cannot scroll music while listening, hence going back to the menu and having to wait the five minutes again. The knobs came off so i had to select songs only by growing my fingernail long enough to reach the selector. If you still are adamant about buying this, MAKE SURE you carry around a paperclip to reset this device for its inevitable freezes. The best part is...it stopped accepting the charge from the power source. What a piece of garbage! PROS: 20 gigs/plays/records (some) video / looks nice and feels good when it is shattered with a hammer

<Title>DONT LISTEN!!!!!(and dont mind the spelling)
<Date>Wed Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Cmon People!!!!!!All the geeks of 2005 reviews are idiots!!!Im not gonna say my Lyra rocks but it is good. It may be heavy and a little big but it does all kinds of things.Download all the new stuff from RCA web page and its great!! Look ignorants, If YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY A LYRA JUKEBOX THEN YOU ARE A CIVILIZED PERSON. Dont drop the THING. OF COURSE IT WILL BRAKE EVENTUALLY! IS LIKE DROPPING YOUR CAR FROM THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. And this is the reason it comes with the ugly leather case. Take care of it. Youve just spent 300 dollars in somthing then you should take good care of it. So, the lyra has an awsome screen, a bunch of EQ's, perfect quality in music and excelent resulution for the pics. Just one detail, if you love listening to music more than lokking at video and pictures and dont really want to use the office documents folder where yu can keep all kinds of stuff, then get the iAudio X5 which is really great also. Another detail to geeks, if you dont like it CHANGE IT!!!!!You have like a 15 day guarentee for free. I recomend the Lyra jukebox for older people above 18. For the majority of young people, smaller things such as an ipod or and iriver are better. But I still think lyra rocks. Buy it, but be PACIENT!!!!!   Somtimes americans are so......never mind.

<Title>Save your money and get an iPod
<Date>Sun Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this a year ago thinking it was a step above the iPod because it played video and pictures.  Besides the fact that the new iPod can now do both, I was still wrong.  For one thing, this Lyra is quite bulky, making it very inconvient to bring around wherever you go, which is what I like to do.  Another thing is its much more difficult to sync to your computer.  You can use it with Windows Media Player, but whenever I tried to add even a few cds worth of music it seemed to take forever because it had to convert all of the files (even though they were alread mp3's)  Navigation is another feature that the Lyra is bested by the iPod in.  It takes so long to scroll through all the artists on the Lyra.  You just have to old the down button for what seems like hours to get to the artists in the middle of the alphabet.  Playlists are another things that the Lyra just does not do well in.  The only way I ever figured out how to make playlists was on the Lyra itself, and this took forever. Youd have to go through and select the songs you want (which as I said earlier, takes forever scrolling through the songs) and then add them to the playlist. But you can only have so many selected at a time, so it enlongated the process further.  Battery life is just not acceptable.  It seemed to last a good amount when listening to just music, but viewing pictures or videos drained it much quicker.  I'm not sure you could get through a whole movie on one charge.  The final thing was after just a year of very light use (it was too heavy to bring with me too often), it just died.  Wouldnt turn on or anything. Now lucky for me, I had bought the extended warrenty at Best Buy, and when I took it back, they gave me the new 30 GB iPod video, which as I have mentioned, enjoy and use much more often then the Lyra.  So save your money and buy an iPod instead.

<Title>Consistently unreliable hardware - best to avoid this one
<Date>Mon Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>None of our units proved durable enough to use anywhere else but at home using headphones, connected through USB to the computer, or to the TV/Stereo using the line out. After going through the reviews last year, we initially purchased a matched set of these for two teenagers for Christmas '04. The first unit was DOA out of the box - the seller replaced it, no problem. We since have had the other original unit replaced, and then the replacement replaced, due to the known headphone jack problems. This was after lengthy phone calls with RCA customer service and a lot of run around on the first replacement. Now, the replacment for the original DOA has the same headphone jack problem AND will no longer connect to external power and charge. RCA initially said they'd replace it as well, but after 3 weeks with no communication or replacement delivery from RCA, we called back and were informed that there are no replacements in the system to send. A refund was offered in December '05 with a 6-8 week turnaround. The refund was finally received in June '06 even with our frequent follow-up contact - it turned out that RCA-Thompson was holding the refund at each review tier for 6-8 weeks. This was definitely "not ready for prime time product". After the customer service experience, I would not recommend an RCA product to anyone.

<Title>Great Item!!! but.....
<Date>Thu Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The style of the RCA RD2780 is awesome.  It can do lots of things: record tv shows and vhs and DVD movies.  copying music is fast!!!  I just have two concerns though...I just purchased this last November...so I am still learning how my Lyra works...it's just frustrating when I try to listen from one song to the other, I always need to press the Menu button or the on/off button when I choose another song.  I just recently recorded a Dvd movie, dont get me wrong, the movie was crystal clear...but...when I try to test to skip some scenes...I couldnt do it.  when i try to press the forward button, the machine goes to pause...Hope you Lyra RD2780 fans could help me out on this...I would really appreciate it!!! but over all,  I love my RCA RD2780!!!  It's cheaper than the Ipod and it can do lot's of things too for a very reasonable price, so go ahead,  buy one and you'll know  what I'm talking about. (by the way, you can also store and see photos!!!)  Hope this would help you...God Bless

<Title>Avoid this player
<Date>Sun Dec 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>It seemed like a really good buy - under $200 for a 20GB A/V player,however, don't let the disk drive capacity and the recording features fool you....unless you don't intend to listen to MP3s on it.  The biggest annoyance, one that puts you off using it, is a migraine causing loud click at the start of each track. It is there no matter what volume you set the unit to.  Secondly, it takes forever (a minute or two) to start playing a track from the menu. Third...don't leave home without a pin to reset the unit every now and then.  It just would not turn on.

<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The first day I got the RCA player it broke. The warrantee doesn't cover anything, but the hard drive. Then we followed the instruction to update the item and it freezes up. We were put on hold "long distance call" for half and hour and then found out they have to replace it and they said that as to big of expense for the company. This is a pile of BS from GE and RCA!!!! It is a pile of trash.

<Title>Now it's 1 star or less
<Date>Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased an RCA Lyra model 2780 in early January. This unit worked as expected for about 2 weeks before it exhibited what I found later to be a known flaw with the model, a faulty headphone jack.  I contacted RCA/Thomson to attempt to find a place to repair the unit, to be informed that it needed to be sent in to the warranty center. So I posted it to the warranty center with the specified copy of the bill-of-sale, and was informed that I would need to wait a week or more for the company to "receive" it.  Once it was received, I was then informed that it would not be repaired, it would be replaced. And that they were allowed one month to replace the unit. So I waited one month. Upon finishing that month, I was informed that the company would be paying me the cost of my unit, that this was the only option. So I re-sent in the bill-of-sale to a fax number. I was then told that it would take 6-8 weeks for them to send my refund.  Yesterday (3 weeks later), I was contacted by a supervisor and informed that I would not be receiving a refund for my defective property because it wasn't purchased from a recognized dealer of RCA Lyras. And today I am informed that I will also not be receiving my defective equipment back from RCA/Thomson.  So far, Thomson has repeatedly misled me about expectations, wasted hours of my time in dealing with a poorly-staffed and poorly-managed call center, and I'm now informed I can receive neither my property or a refund from Thomson.  Not only will I not purchase another item from RCA/Thomson, I will be letting people know through a variety of online and RL connections exactly how poorly their product is made and supported by the company.

<Title>Not Bad, Needs Work But Well Worth The $$
<Date>Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>If you want this thing to work correctly, you've GOT to upgrade its fimware! The RCA site is now up with current firmware and a complete manual. I suggest that you print out the manual. Believe me, you'll refer to it much over the 1st few days as you find out what The Lyra can do.<p>I bought it on 11/19/03 and haven't looked back. It takes a while to get used to the feel of the controls and to what does what, but after a couple of days, it's almost 2nd nature. Some functions are not yet available but will come in future upgrades. I look fwd to them. They will make The Lyra really worthwhile to own. <p>I usu watch it when I have a break on the workroom floor, usu 1 hr out of 4 hrs. It fits well in my apron pocket and isn't heavy. Where ever you stop the playback, The Lyra 'timestamps' that spot so that you won't have to FFWD to that spot again. Upon your return, it asks you if you want to start where you left off or start @ the begining of the show. I might have to reset it once or twice/day, usu after entering a lot of commands in rapid order. The video is good as is the sound. I use the low rec mode and the picture is close to tv quality, which is more than fine for one person watching an hour or so @ a time. To rec, I hook it up to my DVR's tv out, set the DVR to play and the Lyra to rec for the duration of the show. The Lyra's screen shows what's being recorded. After the rec period elapses, The Lyra shuts down after saving your file. I don't like that you can't name the file, but that's supposed to be one of the firmware upgrades. It won't rec DVDs directly from your DVD players' out plug, but it will play DIVX encoded files (ie, owner purchased ripped DVD's, for your own personal use, of course).<p>As for the MP3 audio, it's close to being as good as my iRiver flash player. Nice, crisp, and loud. I work in a nosy place and can hear it just fine. Also, nice leather carrying case. On a down note, I'm not sure where they are getting the battery life info, but my LYRA gets about 3-4 hours (video)before it poops out.<p>All in all, $$ well spent!

It is easy to record videos and the quality is good considering what you are watching it on. Sound is very crisp and loud. The pictures are clear as well.

<Title>I love my Lyra ... :)
<Date>Thu Dec 04 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I found the negative reviews to be extremely unhelpful. I recorded a movie from my Tivo onto the Lyra and it plays back perfectly. The sound quality was outstanding. Nice surround effect. The picture quality is fairly good but not outstanding. It's definitely good enough to give friends the wow factor.<p>Recording from Tivo allows to you to &quot;backup&quot; movies. Of course you can not &quot;backup&quot; copyrighted DVD's from a DVD player. Unless, of course you get a Macrovision- disabled DVD player off the internet. Seriously, with a Macrovision-free DVD player you can backup YOUR DVD's (that you purchased) to the Lyra and have it for long trips. I found that 40 hours is the maximum video hours alloweable when using the &quot;High quality&quot; video setting and the &quot;192 kb/s&quot; - best audo setting. The Matrix Reloaded which was 2h 30min used up 1.10 GB.<p>My computer with Windows XP,  recognized the Lyra instantly as a removable drive when plugged into USB port. Very nice. So you can just drag and drop files into the three main folders-&quot;video, photo, audio.&quot;<p>For the reviewer who said, &quot;there is no signal, unable to record.&quot; The video source, (Tivo, dvd player) must be on play or the Lyra will not recognize. If it's on pause it will not see the source.<p>However, some MPEG (not sure what MPEG format) clips I downloaded fromt the internet was not a &quot;recognized format.&quot; Supposedly the Lyra will support &quot;AVI and MPEG4-SP.&quot;<p>MP3 playback is outstanding. Excellent sound quality. And it loaded very rapidly via USB to the Lyra. I wish I had  USB 2.0 on my computer because the Lyra does support 2.0.<p>For those complaining about screen quality- you would have to purchase a laptop with a excellent video card and LARGE battery to have better screen quality. I think the picture is fine considering the size and form factor. Any better will require a heavier larger battery. Ie- buy a laptop and lug that around.<p>I love my Lyra, considering it's size and price...:)

<Title>Can Anyone compare the Apple iPod to The RCA Lyra A/V
<Date>Fri Dec 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Disregard the stars...Sorry people this is not a review, but I didnt know how else to get peoples attention on this. I wanted to know how this compares to the Apple iPod becuase I have the 20GB iPod and I ordered this as well. I know that with this product you can watch videos and such, but as far as dependebility and study-ness how does it look? Because with the iPod there are no moving parts (except the button which you flip to lock the buttons) and that means that there is not risk of &quot;breaking&quot; the iPod (except if it accidentally hits the flor from a high enough place). SO if anyone can post a review which tackles this question I would greatl appricieate it. And again sorry for me posting it in the review section

<Date>Sat Dec 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Yep - <br>Quick story:<br>Bought on the day after Thanksgiving.  Returned a week later.<p>Longer story:<br>Although the there are a couple good points, there are many more bad ones.<p>Good - pretty sharp screen for size, nice recording features (has straight RCA in and RCA out), on the whole nice set of accessories (although the leather case is ridiculous), lots of space (20gigs)<p>Bad - slowest OS I think i've ever seen on a portable - it will randomly say &quot;saving settings to hard drive&quot; and pause for a good 30sec - 1 min, takes around 10-20 seconds to start playing each song or movie, cumbersome controls (if you want to use it as a convenient MP3 player, you have to hold it in two hands and go through the whole interface any time you want to change a song), can't browse through songs while one is playing, can't create playlists on the unit itself, start up time to record video is variable (from 10seconds to over a minute) so if you're trying to record anything off tv, its tricky to time the starting, audio lags on recorded video after 10 to 15 minutes (loses sync - gotta love watching mouths move and the words coming out after like a poorly dubbed foreign film), leather case is bulky and pretty much impractical short of keeping it &quot;safe&quot; for storage (who wants that on their belt?!), only .avi movie files recorded with mpeg-4 video and mp3 audio codecs can be used (plus the asf format it uses to record), and finally, the most annoying thing - half of the features in the OS come up with an annoying message saying &quot;feature is not available, look for in future upgrades at www.rca.....&quot;<p>Overall - RCA rushed this out to capture the xmas market long before it should have.  While the video is relatively clean and a good step for portables in general, the negatives greatly overshadow it.  Trust me, i loved the idea of video, and if all you're looking for it that, this could (COULD) be somewhat useful, assuming you're patient enough.  However, if you have any plans of using it for music also, and don't have unlimited patience every time you want a new song, this is not the one.  I ended up taking mine back and getting a beautiful new 3rd gen iPod last night, and while there's no video - wow, every accolade apple has gotten for this is warranted (and this is coming from a very anti-apple/mac, die-hard pc guy)<p>and as a note to those who say the new firmware fixed problems, i'd just like to say that I had the newest upgrades for both the software and the lyra itself, and i still had all these issues

<Title>Delivers what it promises!!!
<Date>Sun Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I was skeptical about this product. Unlike most new products that the manufacturers scramble to release before the holidays, the Lyra A/V jukebox is bug free. Some reported bugs like freezes during fast rewind, etc. were fixed by the latest firmware. There are many fancy features that the unit does not support yet, but will support in the future. But the main features that, I'm interested in, work flawlessly. The unit can record from any video source with rca a/v out (tv, vcr, satellite receiver, etc). The unit plays back video recorded directly from an a/v source OR DivX encoded video transfered though the USB interface. The unit can also playback video on a TV. If you're planning to buy this unit, do yourself a favor and also buy a copy of DrDivx from Divx.com. DrDix can encode any DVD into DivX format directly playable by the Lyra A/V jukebox. If you travel a lot, with 35-40 movies on the palm of your hand, this gizmo is your dream come true!!!<p>Impatient, non-computer-savvy people are giving this unit a bad name. Those who don't know how to rip a dvd, or re-encode a video file to various formats, I suggest you stick to a portable dvd player. This unit is not for you. For the rest of us, this is what we've been waiting for!!! An added PDA functionality would have been nice, but I am happy with what this unit has to offer!!!

<Date>Mon Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Don't think you are going to transfer your DVDs and then hop on an airplane to watch! The unit shuts down after giving you a warning if you attempt to copy any DVD or VHS to it.<p>The unit arrives with obsolete software. You get to spend the first hour downloading updates, installing new firmware and new drivers before the main features are operational. (The unit comes with a sheet explaining that this is necessary.)<p>Then, after installing the new software you find that many of the features will be available in a &quot;future release.&quot; The menu options are there for new features, but if you click on the menus you get a vaporware promise of the future. Don't even think of using the built-in equalizer or tone controls: touching those buttons brings up more &quot;future release&quot; messages.<p>&quot;Please wait&quot; takes on new meaning with this unit. It seems to need a 10 second pause frequently.<p>The controls are wiggly and flimsy. The buttons are randomly sprinkled along the front, ends, and top of the unit in a pattern that defies logic.<p>The menus are awkward and obscure. I never could get a movie that was playing to stop nor could I get back to any menus once a movie started. I literally had to power cycle the unit to get to the menus.<p>The unit only supports MPEG-4, so you cannot RIP movies to MPEG-2, DIVX, or AV formats and play them.<p>No, you cannot read a DVD using your PCs DVD player and save it onto the unit and play it. (Seems like that would be a basic feature of the unit.)<p>The picture quality is acceptable, although the audio quality was a dissapointment.<p>This unit is bleading edge. It really is a version 0.1 product. I am sure that with three hardware revisions and four major software releases it is the type of product that we will all take with us on trips and on the road.<p>I'd pay a fortune for a version of this that works, but the one I purchased is going back to Amazon pronto.<p>Havging waited for the unit for 6 months, this was a great dissapointment.

<Title>RCA Lyra  RD 2780 AV Jukebox leaves a lot to be desired
<Date>Tue Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>The unit is fairly compact, but certainly not pocketable. The screen is reasonably nice and so is the audio along with the 20 GB HD capacity. The problems lie mainly in totally inadequate and clunky software, which has to be updated on-line right after purchase. It is very counterintuitive and extremely deficient. One cannot even perform the simple operation of zooming in and out on photos. They can only be displayed in one, fixed size.<p>Alhough it seems logical to be able to load DVD movies into the unit, that has proven to be impossible. It might be done with an MPEG4 encoder (which RCA did not see fit to include), but straight out of the box - forget it. Since the video playback feature is by far the main atraction of this gizmo, a serious oversight like this renders it practically useless.<p>It might record off a TV set, but frankly that seems like too much of a hassle to me. I would much prefer to do it through my computer's USB 2 port. In short, the Lyra is going back to the store. Hopefully units such as this, will soon be available in an improved version and for less than $400.

<Title>I love it!  But it does have problems...
<Date>Wed Dec 10 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have been carrying this unit on my daily 2-hour commute since buying it two weeks ago.   I record programs I want to watch on the hard drive of my DVD recorder in my absence, then copy to the lyra. Saves me the cost of recording shows I don't want to keep permanently to DVD's just for portability. Wish the timer recording feature allowed selections of smaller than 1/2 hour increments, though. The video and audio quality are plenty good for me.<p>But...  the fast-foward bug is NOT fixed.  I have to reset the unit several times daily.  It should have come with an attached reset accessory.  Plus the leather cover has to be removed to reach the reset hole - not good planning.   Also, the cover's see-through plastic over the display ripples and reflects light so it's sometimes a struggle to have a glare-free picture.<p>Battery life is not impressive -- under two hours for me so far.  <p>You can't name files using the unit directly, but you can re-name in windows explorer when attached to your PC.<p>On-line customer support is non-existant.  I've sent two inquiries -- one about buying additional accessories and the other reporting the FF bug remaining -- both replies came quickly but basically said they weren't equipped to respond. <p>The buttons are quirky - and if you don't push in the precise direction, you won't get the result you want.<p>Despite the problems, I really like this unit and will be keeping it.

<Title>The Guy who asked keep the iPod, answers his own question
<Date>Thu Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>As the title says this is from the same person who asked if it is wise to keep the iPod or trade it in for the RCA Lyra A/V. Ok first off the idea is really good: to combine both audio and video in one compact unit, every electronics persons dream, but this does not live up to it. At first it seems cool, but the more you look at the negatives the positives go away.<br>      <br>Positives are that it can play video, it can play music, has a cool interface, stores 20GB of stuff, it comes with everything you need so you dont need to spend extra money, and it can record stuff from the TV, VCR, or DVD(with the DVD you need the right "tools").<p>Negatives are that its super bulky so you cant just carry it around for fun, it cant be used as just an mp3 player becuase turning the thing off and on may damage it and it take a while for the stuff to load, the product is not complete so it cant just be used out of the box becuase you have to download some stuff, and the video quality is not good. If the video quality is what your concerned about, like I was, then dont get this product wait for the next generation ones like these to come out because it will get better.<p>All in all the product was ok, but if you want to compare it to an iPod, the iPod is the way to go...for now.
