<Title>My favorite MP3 player so far
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've used just about every MP3 player there is and this one is right there with the best of them. It's small light and extremely easy to use. You don't need ANY software to upload songs to it. The device shows up like a drive on your PC. You have the option of using Windows Media Player 11 to upload songs, but I'd rather just drag and drop songs or use my Napster subscription to upload songs from Napster's huge library. I thought 2GB wouldn't be enough but it is so easy to upload songs when my mood changes that it's never been an issue for me. If you like to watch movies then you may want to go with the larger 4GB (NWZS616) or 8GB (NWZS618) versions of this model since a typical movie takes up ~700K memory after you compress it to QVGA. If you want a larger screen size then you can get the NWZA815. That model is basically the same player with a larger screen. It also has a heavier metal shell, but it does not have an FM tuner like the NWZS615, and I wanted the FM tuner. I typically use my player in shuffle mode in my car and if I don't want to hear a song, it is a breeze to reach down and click just to the right of the center button to skip to the next song. I honestly can't see how anyone would be disappointed with this player especially when you consider the great price.

<Title>Couldn't be happier
<Date>Wed Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I just got this little fella as a gift yesterday, and I could not be happier.  Loading music is very easy and navigating is a breeze.  The only problem I have is the earbuds.  Maybe it is just my stupid ears, but they are a bit uncomfortable.  I wanted an ipod, but am glad I didn't get one after using this for only a few hours.

<Title>Awesome!

<Content>My son loves this mp3 player, I puchased it for him for Christmas after a thorough investigation into different mp3 players. The walkman sound clarity is "Sony" (meaning outstanding!). It includes FM radio, which IPODS don't have, not to mention how user friendly it is. Let me just say this, I played with his for awhile & ultimately purchased a cute little pink one for myself ( I just exchanged the goofy little shuffle my husband purchased and got a few bucks back to boot!) I would highly recommend this!

<Title>isn't it about the music for most of us? save$ go Sony
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My Son owns an Ipod..big deal, with $300.00 in pocket I went to Walmart for the heralded Ipod,I got playin around with the $90.00 Sony, in an instant some little voice (maybe a person under the counter) instructed me to pay the 90 plus tax and use the rest to buy a printer I desperately needed with the money i saved.ame home and used Media 10 to down load and am truely surprised at the very musical sound, and imaging.It's a small rascule, best not drop it when Fido's around, he'll lick it up like book of stamps. Learning curve ain't bad and as a musician, I am using it toreplay my praticing and even that sounds good.. well maybe OK. Ipod, shmypod, save some money.. after all to most of us isn't about the music? This may be a caveate' however, as far as I can tell, its set up for WINDOWS MEDIA 11 player... so user friendly I feel I'm being treated like a school kid. It will work with the MEDIA 10 but is not so friendly. After about 40 hours of use I still am amazed at the reproduction and amazed is not a word I use much, maybe its a pefect combo of earbuds to amp but I am hearing what I never knew was there and I am not new to these gizmo's or high end home components.  My little bugger is filled to capacity with the likes of mississippi fred mcdowell, Jessie mae hemphill, R.L. Burnside, Isman Bracey and very obscure cuts, the shuffle is quick and get some nice surprises, the ergo might have been a bit more thought out but I am from the 60's. Almost lost it twice, going to get the walkman carrying case, attach a chain to it and nail it to my head. I started losing my faith in Sony with the new era of high tech but they got something here.. Want vid get much more memory, this is a musicians high.

<Title>Who needs an ipod?
<Date>Tue Feb 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Several years I purchased a 2nd generation ipod which I adored. I downloaded music from Comcast Rhapsody and synced it with my ipod with no problem whatsoever. One sad day, as a result of leaving it in the car overnight and repeatedly freezing the battery, the ipod died. I then sprung for an 80 GB 5th generation ipod. It was sleek and shiny and smaller than the first one. I was in heaven! That is, until I actually tried to use the thing. Apparently between the last purchase and this one, Apple determined that I was going to use itunes for my music downloads and that was final. I hate itunes. They do not carry a large selection of the type of music I like to listen to and they only give you approximately a 10-second preview of each song. Once you purchase the song, you can put it on your device but God forbid something happen like purchasing a new pc - you are unable to get it again OR sync what you already paid for and put on your device to your new pc. This infuriated me. As well, it does not work AT ALL with my new Linux laptop and the entire experience left a bad taste for me. They are entirely too restrictive with what I choose to do with MY device and MY music once I purchase it.   Out of frustration, I purchased this inexpensive little Walkman. When taking everything from the box the Walkman was so small I nearly discarded it. It appears much larger in the photos. It is certainly attractive and super-portable. Within 10 minutes, I had it connected to my pc and in the process of transferring 300 songs to it. Sure it is lacking in the storage space on the ipods but do you REALLY need 80 GB or even 20? I did not. I never used more than 3 after YEARS of transferring files.   This is definitely a device worth considering if want something simplistic to store your music and are not heavy into collecting photos and videos, etc... I purchased Nanos for my children during the holidays and I am so sorry I had not thought to take a look at these.

<Title>Neat little MP3/Video player
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have been on a Sony rampage lately (bought 2 Sony W80 Cybershots, NWZ Walkman and a PS3) and I am always happy with what I buy.  I bought this player in pink for my fiancee because it came in pink and she loves pink.. It also went great with her Sony Digital camera which is also pink.  I tried it out before I gave it to her and I was pretty much impressed with it once I messed around with it a little. It was simply a drag and drop affair uploading music to it. I was also able to transfer files with Windows Media Player. This also allowed me to upload the album covers. I love that you can upload pictures to it and it will play a slideshow.  Sound is very clear and has a very good high volume level. I did not have a chance to use the included headphones as I bought her pink JVC Gumys but they are 11 dollar headphones and still sounded great. I have owned a Toshiba Gigabeat 20GB and my brothers all own iPod videos. Having said that I was still impressed with the Sony. The small screen has an incredible resolution and the video demo really showed what this little player can do with video. I have not tried to upload my own videos though.  When I presented her with this as a gift I gave her the option of the Sony or a brand new 3rd Gen iPod Nano... iPod 4GB or Sony 2GB... she tried out the Sony and thats the one she chose. I returned the ipod and put the money towards a PS3.  I would like to think that she chose the Sony because it was pink but I had also bought a pink anodized case for the nano and this did not sway her decision. I think she made her decision when she realized that it had a battery life of 33 hours!  She also didnt feel like she would ever need 4gb of music anyways. She liked the styling better than the Nano which is a bit wider. I am thinking of buying one myself now :)

<Title>I like to say I own a "Walkman" again.
<Date>Mon Nov 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pro's: Very good sound quality, perfect picture quality for a screen this small, very easy to put music on it if you have Rhapsody or Windows Media, battery life is great (I get about 20-26 real-world hours), it turns on and off very quickly-(pause it and it will turn off after 30sec.;Press play and it starts instantly!), YOU'RE NOT STUCK WITH iTUNES!!, IT'S NOT AN IPOD!!   Con's: the included headphones aren't that great, you must use the proprietary plug to charge and interface with the PC.  Over-all it was a great buy! MY first "real" music player was cassette "Walkman" as a kid. I'm just as giddy over my new portable as I was 20 years ago.

<Title>EXCELLENT!!
<Date>Tue Dec 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My son got this for Christmas and my Daughter got an Ipod. The Walkman is SO much easier to use! Very user friendly, has FAR MORE features than the ipod and you don't have to deal with the "i" software or syncing thru apple. This player works fabulous with Windows Media Player. It's fast and so easy to upload, select, sync...everything you need to do in no time flat! The iPod is confusing, the buttons are strange and not very user friendly.  I wish I had bought one of these for my daughter and not wasted my money on a iPod!  This is a FABULOUS player for songs, video, pics...EVERYTHING!  Very Easy to navigate!!  I LOVE IT and my son is THRILLED!!!

<Title>Far better than an iPod
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got this player as a gift for my grandmother, loaded it up with music & pics of the grandkids and so forth. Fantastically easy to operate, and the pictures look great on the screen. Also love the slideshow feature. Haven't gotten any remarks back from recipient yet, but I will post another review if I hear any complaints. Also - it's REEEEEALY nice that they've broken away from Sonic Stage. The drag&drop file loading means you aren't bound by any one player, and that's certainly a feature apple could stand to integrate. I have a gift Nano that stayed in its packaging for a year and a half because I couldn't get the ^&%$ thing to work, and when we bought a mac recently and were able to reformat it (it refused to reformat on our old PC) I took a look at it, and told my husband to either keep it for himself or put it back in the box, because I'd be getting a sony mp3 for myself sometime soon.

<Title>Good player
<Date>Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>It's pretty cool. The player's quite small and light. Love that it has FM radio and allows you to shuffle music.  A few quibbles, I'm annoyed that I have to buy a separate charger in order to charge directly (non pc). Also I can't create a  playlist on the player. I have to upload the playlist from the computer. Otherwise no problems with the player.

<Title>good little unit
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This unit gives a good value for the buck.  Plug in the usb port with Windows XP, drop and drag or copy and paste all your mp3 and mp4 files. I never even loaded Sony's software that came with it.   There are better sounding units out there for pure audiophiles, but for $99?  I don't think so.  I bought 3 for my kids and they love them.   This is a small player and big hands (or thumbs) may push a few miss-cued buttons.
