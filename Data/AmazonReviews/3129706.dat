<Product Name>Kingston Technology K-PEX 100 1 GB Portable Media Player
<Title>a pretty capable little device, with many capabilities.
<Date>Fri Dec 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>There is a lot that this little 1 gigabyte "K-PEX 100" can do...  The sound that the MUSIC mode produces is quite impressive; the RECORD function does not record the FM RADIO, but there is a Line-In jack, so with another radio, you can still record a WMA file (from 32 kbps up to the 128kbps ). easily. And the quality is pretty good.  I was looking for something that worked like a PDA, and I've come to terms with not being unable to input text into a MP3 player, and being able to replace the battery.   When the battery could be replaced (like the Creative Zen line), I could could not display long TXT files easily. When I couldn't replace the battery (like the Ipod, which I do own [40GB 4th-G]),I was stuck with parsing out my files into 4K parts for the Notes function.  Although the "K-PEX 100" splits words in strange places, and no amount of carriage-returns will force a blank space between paragraphs [a couple dozen apostrophes create a sufficient visual break for this], now I can read a TXT file of ANY size! Just pressing the up and down keys on the compass-style keys, I read a long 60K academic article on it!  I'm surprised that MP3 players that display TXT files on their screens haven't been promoted more as e-book readers. Yes, I've forgone the inability to input text into a device for now, but this little device, has still more capabilities which provides a sufficient workaround...  ... it has a MiniSD slot! If you carry a USB-key that can read to and/or write to a MiniSD card, just pop this into your computer, and then pop the card into the "K-PEX 100", and then you can display your JPG picture files in the PHOTO mode or TXT files from the TEXT mode. With a little creativity, and some embedded folders, you can display a calendar, read through a diary, and look at your pictures from your camera.   That brings up another feature, in case you don't want to use the MiniSD card avenue... the HOST mode! If you use the enclosed [and unfortunately, proprietary] USB host cable, you can use your own camera's cables and memory to import the pix directly in the "K-PEX 100" hard-wired memory. Tried it a couple times, and it works fine. I still prefer the MiniSD method.  The starting up of this device does take about 15-20 seconds, and that's a bit annoying, but it doesn't outweigh its strengths (a "file manager" to examine the devices contents, TXT capability, 1 mode of user-defined EQ capability) and there's still more! Built in games and a VIDEO mode (need convert these on your PC with the "K-PEX 100" included software) too, and I haven't even started using those yet!  And the clincher is that all of this is available on a device merely a hundred dollars, about size of an Altoids case (but don't try to squeeze it in one, it's a millimeter too long), a barely a couple ounces. Handsome looking, lots of power, and virtual invisibility on you... it's hard to beat!

<Title>Capable and Compact

<Content>The KPEX media player is smaller than I had expected. I have had great fun with the games and video playback and all the other tools - I have my bus schedules on there that I can read with the text feature, for instance - but its primary use for me was always going to be as an mp3 player, so I can best be of service by comparing it to previous flash-based mp3 players I have owned.  - Previous players have always fallen short in the volume department. I can stand next to the freeway with my KPEX on (where my train stop is) and hear my mp3s just fine.   - Previous players have always only been able to play files in the root directory of the drive. The player's file browser allows me to play only selections from folders I create on the player, and the player treats the directory you open an mp3 from as its playlist.  - Previous players have never been able to resume mp3 files when I stop them in the middle, important to me because I listen to many audiobooks. The KPEX will, as long as you do not go into another mode between stopping and restarting the file.  General positive notes: voice recording quality has been good. The player comes with a rubber guard against damage, an audio line cable, an extra USB cable adapter to connect to the player with a standard M-M USB-A cable, and an attractive leather neckpiece, all welcome additions.  I couldn't be happier with this player. I suppose I should write some Cons. The games packaged with the player are both action games, and I think I am not alone in preferring puzzle games on my portable devices. Kingston has no plans to develop further games for the player as of this writing. While mp3 playback does, FM playback does not continue when you exit to the menu. The included earbuds were not padded, making them too painful for me to use.

<Product Name>Kingston Technology K-PEX 100 1 GB Portable Media Player
<Title>BY FAR the overall Best value in Multimedia player: MP3, FM, GAMES
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>GREAT ! multimedia device that can do more then just about every other device I've seen out there & at a very low price [Under $100 on sale.].  Where else can you get a quality, reliable multimedia device that can play MP3, FM radio[Worked great even in South America.], Voice recorder, Cool Games, Display photos & text, transfer from & to other devices AND HAS A MINI SD SLOT TO ADD ADDITIONAL MEMORY MAKING IT UNLIMITED FOR MUSIC, PHOTOS, ETC.  Screen is bright & easy to see.  The only two minor gripes I have with this device is that the connections to device are a bit small & you must be gentle when making USB connection & the only way I'm aware of to charge this device is using the USB connection which can be a problem when you're on the road with no PC to connect to.  For under $100 you just can't beat this & you get good support from one of the best large Memory companies around.  Three cheers for KINGSTON !
