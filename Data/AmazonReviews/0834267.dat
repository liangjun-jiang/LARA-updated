<Title>Almost 5 stars, but the volume is too low!
<Date>Wed Sep 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a nice improvement from the 604.  The higher resolution is much nicer for web browsing.  It also makes my pictures and videos look so much nicer!  The web browser works great and I love how it can do flash.  The only issue I have is the low volume.  MP3's are not to bad, but I can turn the volume all the way up with headphones on and it's just at a medium sound level (not loud at all).  Any movie ripped with 5.1 is terrible with headphones.  With the volume all the way up it is still soft and hard to hear.  The build in speaker is a little louder on this compared to the 604, but I just wish the headphone output was louder.  I was able to rip a movie with an MP3 soundtrack and increase the volume by about 200%.  This made a huge difference and it is now at least listenable.  I am guessing you need the docking station and have your 605 connected via SPDIF for the 5.1 sound to work.  Update 09/19/2007: Well I had originally purchased a 604, but it was defective and I returned it for a 605.  I only had the 604 for 2 days before I returned it, but I purchased the cinema plugin for it.  I called Archo's sales and they said they could refund the charge if I purchased the plugin for my new Archo's, which I did.  They even sent me an email confirming the refund.  After about 2 weeks I never saw the credit.  I called them today and they told me that it was a mistake and they could not refund me the 19.99.  I told them about the email and she said she already saw it, but told me too bad!  I was really shocked and will dispute the charge with Visa.  Still very poor customer support.  I still love the new Archo's, but that was really poor customer service.  Chad

<Title>Well worth the purchase if you buy the DVR station as well:
<Date>Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605wifi is, for the most part, a great product. The interface is easy to work around in, and its out of the box capabilities are decent. Moving files to and from the hard drive, while not as easy as say an iPod, is a lot more of an open ended system that doesn't attempt to protect you from yourself in terms of locking the player to a certain computer. What you have here is a portable hard drive that lets you view your pdfs, movies and photos as well as listen to your music. It does each of these tasks efficiently and really begins to prove its worth when you take it on longer trips. Out of the box it also comes with a good file management system that allows you to delete files directly through the system menu, which allows you to make space while you are on the go and don't necessarily have a computer handy. This defiantly proves worthwhile when you access the expanding Content Portal and want to download a movie while you are on the move, but don't have enough hard drive space to support it. When you are around PC's networked wirelessly and have access to them, the 605 also allows you to stream audio and video directly from them, as well as download new files.  Now... to be honest, while those features are all nice, after I was done playing with them I never felt like they justified the price of the player as a package.  This is where the plugins come in. Most people will likely drop the $29.99 for the Opera browser, which is steep, but again is nice to have. The browser is quick and easy to use, and works better then most portable web browsers I have worked with. If you have used an iPhone, it is very comparable to how Safari works on it, which is defiantly a good thing.   The player only truly ever justifies its purchase though, when you connect it to the DVR station, which is bought separately. In any home theater system, this is a godsend of a budget component. The dock outputs to your TV and accepts inputs from many devices (in my case a cable box). What's nice about this is that you can use the combination as a more open ended Apple TV system that allows you to use all the wireless streaming video/audio/picture capabilities of the system, while having it connected to the TV. This saves a lot of hassle, say if you have a divx file you want to watch on your computer and do not want to go through the process of burning and converting it to something your DVD player would accept. With this system, you just connect to the network, navigate to the folder on your computer where the file is, and viola, it streams to your TV!   For those who don't own a DVR or want to make their recordings more mobile, the DVR station when connected to the Archos also accepts schedules of your cable programs from a list that is updated by Archos, and allows you to record from the TV either automatically or manually. You then have a mobile version of your favorite show that can either be moved to your computer, or watched like one would any DVR/Tivo program, with all the pause, forward and rewind features to get rid of those pesky adverts.   The Archos certainly has its faults though. Without the DVR station the battery takes forever (no joke) to fully charge. Furthermore, not all the features have been implemented yet, the content portal is slow to get the new suppliers, the widgets system is nonexistent as of writing this review, and current accessories are virtually barren aside from a helmet camera (that lets you record what you see while on the move), the DVR and some batteries. Even the official cases for the generation 5 line aren't released yet, leaving all current owners limited to using either the only supplier on the market (over priced and generally not a great case) or protecting their Archos with the factory supplied case which is quite possibly one of the most unpractical cases the company could have made. Finally it doesn't have the fun gimicky ease of use an iPod touch would have. It's bulky, thanks to the hard drive, and the buttons on the side (while very useful) don't do anything to help the 605's dire need for a little sex appeal.

<Title>Writing from this device
<Date>Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So far, so good. I'm writing this from my Archos 605, sitting in my living room.  So far I've only been testing the web browser which I bought as soon as I got this running.  The fact that I can write this right  on the device is pretty cool.  The screen resolution is awesome.  I'll write more later from the PC but so far I love it!   Ok.  It's been a couple of weeks - and I still love this thing.  Sitting in my easy chair writing this update from the 605 on my WiFi.  By far the greatest thing is the screen.  At 800 pixels wide, you can see a full-width webpage - everything is perfectly legible.  You can zoom in with a double-tap on the screen, but I mostly find that unnecessary.  NYTimes, Google News, etc. - all look great.  I was messing around with a colleague's iPhone the other day.  The Archos screen kicks its butt.  Pictures and movies look great.  Music is cool - support for cover art, etc.   Sound?  My only major complaint.  It's way too quiet.  Even with my noise-reducing headphones on - I had a very difficult time hearing soft dialogue on video playback on an airplane.  At home I can turn it up to full volume without hurting my ears at all - it's not even uncomfortable.  As far as I can tell, there's nothing you can do to make it louder.  It's one of the few disappointments I have had.  What else?  I'll write more from a computer later this week.  Although it's perfectly functional, it's still a pain to use this virtual keyboard.  Still 4 out of 5 - I'd give it 4.5 if I could.

<Content>If it didn't break suddenly, I highly recommend this product.  Inexpensive, beautiful display, clear sound, fancy functions...  However, after 2 days, suddenly it broke... I couldn't believe it... I was just putting it on the desk and listening to my favorite music. I also used it really carefully because usually touch-panel products are so sensitive. However, it broke. If you don't want to waste your money, don't buy it.

<Title>great product!!
<Date>Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did alot of research before buying this and after several weeks bought the 605 30gb. I am happy with my purchase, but I would like to say that there are a few things you will need to realize before you buy this #1 I was confused about if this thing had a SD slot and it doesn't which was my own fault I didn't read the description better (the smaller one I think its like a 10gb not sure is the only one that has the SD slot #2 I bought mine to take on tripos and watch movies on and it works great (excellent picture and quailty) and after buying all the extra plug-ins was able to surf the web (now let me say this aint no laptop so if your buying exspecting the same speed as a laptop better save your money and buy one but if you are just looking to check your mail do alittle surffing and be able to slide it into your pocket after you got the best) #3 I would like to say that the customer sewrvice really SUCKS, and for the money you have to spend on this it seems like they would treat the customer better. #4My only real complaint with my 605 is thatthe battery is awful and since it isnt replacable that makes it a major problem (mine only last maybe 4-6 hours) I have to say I thought I might have made a mistake buying a 30gb but I have alot of music on mine and keep maybe 4-5 movies on at alll times but could easly have 30 if I wanted I just erase them after I get through and load on a new onefrom my desktop which is really easy (and I aint the most computer friendly person in the world). Oh one more thing the speakers?!?!?! Weeelllll lets just say it aint no bose sound system it is what it is a personal player and with the includede earbuds it works great but if you are going to trey and use it as a sterio you wont be happy unless you get that thing archs has you can set the unit into and plug up to that has built in speakers, my next purchase is gonna be a DVR staion I am waiting a few months for the new to ware off so I can get a refurbished or atleast alittle better price.Good luck with your decission and I hope I helped you alittle ans sorry about the misspelled words.

<Title>Good look and feel BUT web app and some other plugins cost extra!
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player, had it for a week and returned it. I bought a charging kit from Gomadic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010ELOM8/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-0542713-0191925">Car / Auto and Wall / AC Essential Charger Kit w/ Tip Exchange for the Archos 605 - Gomadic Brand</a>  Everything worked well and I was excited to try the browser.  When I selected the browser a window popped up saying that this "plug-in" needed ... which costs an extra $30 ... Doh!    Next I tried to use the MP3 player, which is where this device lacks the most. Get this, you have to load a playlist.  Otherwise you can either play one music file or all music files.  There was no way for me to select by folder (which is all I need), artist, album, nor genre.  Now on to loading a movie, which was a typical video I use with other video players.  When I clicked on play it said that it was only supported with an "plug-in" that  ... wait for it ... cost extra.  There are two types of video plug-in at $20 each. I decided it is not worth it and returned it. I bought it for three reasons which it was lacking in all three areas: 1) Play videos (not many video formats supported, other supported at an extra cost) 2) Browse the web (costs extra) 3) Play MP3s (GUI lacks)  In conclusion...  Pros: 1) It has good look and feel 2) video playback good (when supported) 3) screen is clear and bright 4) keys work well 5) good user interface in general 6) good weight (not too heavy) 7) good battery life  Cons: 1) Web Browser App cost an EXTRA $30 2) Some codecs (video formats like AVI) are not support ... BUT you can add some codes, of course this costs EXTRA of at least $20 3) MP3 player user interface is lacking. I could not find a way to play by folder, artist, genre ... MUST make playlist ahead of time and upload it to the player  cheers

<Title>Great Media Player!  Make your Friends Jealous!
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second Archos. I replaced my old 550 with the 605 and I am quite happy with the upgrade!    Bad: Volume is low - With the headphone supplied the volume was very low.  I replaced the headphones with a pair of in ear Sony's and now I don't have an issue.  I thought the supplied headphones were uncomfortable anyways.  USB Charging ONLY (out of the box) - There are NO USB plugs on the unit.  The only way to charge the unit is via the supplied USB cable.  You will have to buy one of the Archos adapters to charge the unit via a wall adapter.  I bought the Mini Dock.  It has Power (international plug included btw), USB, and video out.  Extra $$$ for Plug In's - Some of the features that are loaded on the 605 are not available unless you pay an additional fee, like the web browser.  The web browser costs $30.  Kind of annoying if you did not know that going in.  Once you buy the plug-in, you get a code that you type in to the 605 to unlock it.  Good: WiFi - Very easy to connect!  It doesn't seem to have the strongest antenna I've ever seen but it works just fine.  Web Browsing - The Opera browsers is great!  Plays streaming video and audio files, like YouTube or any flash based sites very well.  You just have to be a little patient some times when clicking links, I don't think it has a ton of RAM, so it can lock up if you don't let the pages load all the way.  HUGE Screen - I just flew to Italy and watched four episodes of Band of Brothers in wide screen.  Looked and sounded amazing.  Play Music while Browsing or Looking at Pictures - Great feature!  You can leave the music player and go to the web or your photo albums with out stopping the music.  Great for slide shows.  I am quite happy with the 605!  Highly recommend it!

<Title>intensively amazing
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I should preface this by saying that this is in fact, my first portable video player. The Archos 605 is my upgrade form an old iriver H10, a perfectly great mp3 player, but i wanted video. After many moths of search, I knew it had to be Archos, and I chose correctly. First of all, the very obvious screen is absolutely amazing. Though I have never had a PVP before, I have used many different models ranging from the iPod video (pretty much every video gen available), Creative visions, and so on, and the screen is unbeatable. A step up from the slightly foggy 604 the 605 offers a very crisp screen that boasts the highest res. available on the market today. Even though the screen is a whopping 4.3 in. (wide screen) the player is still reasonably sized. It fits nicely into my pocket, and the case is protective enough for me to not have to worry. The video quality is obviously great, but also so is the internet. I purchased the internet plug-in, which by the way gives you access to widgets you can't get other wise, and it works very well. I have wireless in my house and school so I use it quite often and the speed is reasonable for a portable player, (Just as good as the iPhone, which I have used as well). Navigating with the touch screen is easy and fun, though the manual might be good to skim through. So far I have no complaints at all besides the length of the USB charge, but I am planning to purchase the battery dock so problem solved. Other than that I have found it very hard to put this amazing player down. It is a great buy and a very decent price. This is where it's at!

<Title>Alot of features and great picture......quality a concern
<Date>Sat Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My first Archos arrived with WiFi non-functional.  Thanks to Amazon for replacing the damaged unit as Archos customer supportwas ABSOLUTELY no help in trying to resolve the problem.  As indicated in previous reviews, Archos support is terrible.  My second unit arrived with everthing functional.  WiFi was quickly enabled and easily found my wireless signal and connected with no problem.  The unit immediately searched for a firmware update and downloaded and installed.  Since I primarily purchased this unit for travel, I did pay the extra price for the internet browser as well as ability to play MPEG-2 files.  While pgms and movies download at a decent speed, I find that some web pages and sites are very slow with the Opera browser.  Browsing tends to be easier using the Menu keys on the side of the unit (forward, back, etc.)  I actually find the menu keys to be quite useful, It maybe just the way I hold the unit, but they are very responsive and toggle well.  Links on web pages are often small and I have not figured out if I have to double or single tap to select.  It seems to change up on me.  I prefer to use the stylus over touching with my finger, however, am somewhat disappointed that there is no where to store the stylus (like the old Ipaq PDA's).  Connecting to a PC via USB and transering files is a snap. you do need to set your unit to act as a USB hard drive to use windows explorer drag and drop.  Setting the unit as a media sync device was also easy, however, windows media player's quirks makes this more difficult than it should be This unit will sync music, video, and pictures and WMP was not intuitive to me to "not sync" my 1000's of misc photo's.    The media player is decent and does play some songs at a low volume.  I assumed how I ripped them was more of a factor than the unit itself.  The equalizer does a fine job of fine tuning the listening experience.    This player is excellent for watching will ripped video files or pictures.  The picture is crystal clear and the screen does not show any smudges or dirt.  I am not sure how archos did this, but kudos to them for an excellent screen.  In summary, this unit does a fantastic job with movies, pictures, and videos.  WiFi on a working unit connects quickly, but the Opera browser is painfully slow at times.  The 605 (30GB) model is a little heavy but has a decent form factor for what I purchased it for.  There is no place to store a stylus and the shipped case is as cheap as they get.  A leather case can be purchased from their web site like the browser and software to play other (MPEG-2) media files.  The available links from the Archos portal is lacking content at this time, but hopes to expand at a later time.  The fact that my first unit was damaged and customer support was non-existent is the reason for the 3 stars.

<Title>Great Portable Video Player
<Date>Tue Nov 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the best portable video player on the market.  There are others:  the ipod (classic, touch etc), Zune, PSP etc but Archos players generally tend to be better in terms of support for a wider range of video formats, and the Archos 605 is the best device from Archos so far.  The interface is improved from previous versions (with the implementation of touch screen), the screen is of good quality and video playback smooth.  I use this device to watch TV recorded from my Windows XP Media Centre PC and it works great.  Copying video onto the Archos does not require any special software (no iTunes or similar required), and you are less likely to need to transcode your video (a process which can take hours and may result in audio synch problems whatever player you use) as it is more likely to be supported in its original format on this player.  If you just want to listen to music, go for an iPod or similar, but if video is what you are after, this is the right device for you.

<Date>Wed Nov 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the archos after much deliberation between the i-touch, the archos and a few other PVPs. The choice rapidly concentrated on the archos and Itouch. I actually tried to buy the itouch twice at retail stores and was unable to get one.  My decision to purchase the archos initially came down to memory and screen resolution. I have a 2gb ipod nano and think that sub 10gig is really not enough space for music - let alone video. So I bought my archos. Initially the interface was a bit of a challenge. The extra plug in were annoying and the lack of a realistic DVD copying program excutiating. I now download from Cinema now and Amazon - I am still extremely annoyed with amazon for not allowing rentals to be transfered to portable players and not clearly demonstating rentals as regards purchases.  I travel a great deal and consequently my archos gets more use than for most people. The upsot is I LOVE IT - the video quality is exceptional, the music player is fantastic (volume could be louder but new ear plugs make this a minor problem). Connectivity is fantastic. In short this is a fantastic peice of kit. I have subsequently played with the itouch and while the interface is pretty and the usual design elegance is there I still prefer my archos. The downside is that gettign add ons  kit - wallets, hardware etc is a problem in comparison to itouch. The follow up softwre - widgets  -seems to be delayed. These issues knock off the final star. The player itself is an easy 5*

<Content>after reading many many blogs and reviews i decided to go with the archos 605 and i havenet regreted so far.  ive had it for about a 3 and 1/2 months now and everything looks great.  Video is incredible with its resolution of 800x480 which is one big reason i chose the archos 605.  other than watching videos music sounds great and viewing photos is also great. there are so many features that u can get (which i plan to get) that make this the best thing out there so far.  Touch screen works great, wi-fi rocks and i cant say enough about the kickstand they have on the back.  Its so simple but it really is great to have so i dont have to hold up the player all the time.  Overall:10/10 recemmend it to anyone. Love it love it love it!!!!

<Title>No playlist management
<Date>Sun Nov 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So like they say, the screen looks great, audio quality is fine, Wi-Fi browser works relatively smoothly.  Here's where the product dies: you can't manage playlists from any PC music player.  It won't work like an iPod or Zune where you can create playlists in iTunes or Windows Media player and then transfer them over.  You actually have to find every track you want in the playlist in "My Computer" and drag and drop it over.  This may not be a problem for most listeners, but at least for me, I have an extensive (70gb) music library and I manage all my music in WMP playlists.  Not having this functionality really destroyed the player for me and I'm planning on buying a different MP3 player now.    Sorry, Archos.

<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Bought this product with the dock. By and large, both work as advertised. Read the product description at to what it does - I'll go over the cons.  Biggest problem is this company has absolutely no support. Go to their website and there's no tel# and/or email address.  Big problem - I recorded dvd movies to the device. It'll let you play on the device but not on an external device (e.g. TV).  The user-interface is absolutely w/o "out of the box" thinking. very cumbersome and at times very unintuitive (e.g. copying files)  There's some video editing features - sometimes buggy but works.  Sometimes the mp3 file tags don't transfer over properly. This could be a WMP problem.  Also, bought the browser. works but i wish it played WMP video streams.  The company really needs to provide some sort of a support mechanism - at least a forum.  Happy with the product..but sometimes not so.

<Content>I am very satisfied with my purchase. I've read other reviews and I know that certain codecs and add ons like the web browser cost extra but, I understand why Archos didn't include them - because they would drive up the cost of the units. I consult for a video technology company and I know that Microsoft and Apple are greedy with their codecs (which is why I convert my videos to Divx and buy products that encode/decode in Divx.) So... I completely understand.   The interface is too cool. The screen is bright and clear. Battery life is awesome. USB charging is convenient. Very well designed. The Opera web browser option is awesome and comparable to a PC web browser (although I wish it used the Mozilla code base instead). It handles YouTube like a pro. It's a good replacement for carrying a laptop on train and plane trips as far as entertainment and web surfing.

So far, it played all the AVI files in my collection(Anime, TV shows...etc).   -Uploaded my photo albums and it's a great way to show them to friends and relatives.  -MP3 music quality is comparable to my IPOD mini. -Have not used the internet feature.  Properly not going to since i'm online at home and work.  Mostly because it cost $30 to unlock the software.  Would have given it a 5 star had it not for the amount of time(overnight oonnection using USB to a CPU) needed to charge.  Can't believe an AC adaptor was not included.  Ordered the travel mini charger and awaiting it's arrival.  Base on reviews, the travel adaptor should cut charging time considerably.  Battery life is not as advertised, but i'm statisfied.  Video is about 3 hours and MP3 proberly longer, have not tested that.  I mainly use it to watch shows on my daily commute.  So far, pretty statisfied.

<Content>Well ok. I just recieved the Archos 605 Wi-Fi 30 GB,  and so far its alright. Music files go in easily, video looks very clear, etc. But ive been having a bit of a problem. I go to the Content Portal, and try to activate that, so it tells me to go to the Archos website and download Firmware. Well, ive tried that already, and when its done, i tired to open the firmware file, but its un-openable, if that makes sense; its not readable, and it looks like you need a certain program to open it, so im wondering, if anybody here can help me out with this problem. i appreciate it very much if so.

<Title>605 Wifi whybuy?
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 Wi-fi is not a bad unit but the company sucks!! The unit has no place to put the stylus, you have to pay immediately for another 3 items to make it function. It does not have access to the web until you buy Opera, then it won't play VOB files for movies until you buy the cinema software. You cannot charge it quicker than many hours through a USB, it comes without any wall charger, you have to order a unit for $29.99 to speed up charging. The battery life is quite a bit less than claimed. Finally if you happen to live outside a big city anywhere in US or Canada and have a PO Box as your billing address they will not ship to you, you cannot pay with a VISA in that case, even if you purchased the item with the same VISA. Attempting to discuss these issues with the company is simply frustrating, the minions do not seem interested in your comments.

<Title>A laptop alternative!!!
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It can play music, video, email, surf the internet, and open PDF files.  You can write notes and make simple calculations with widgets.  I think I am going to leave my laptop home the next time I travel for pleasure.  The only thing I will potentially miss is Excel.  Hope there is going to be a widget written for that purpose soon.  Highly recommend this great little device.  I had previously considered the Ipod Touch.  The Archos 605 is bigger but you get so much more.

<Title>Great Multimedia Player
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Great photo and video resolution, really nice audio quality, good Internet connectivity, and easy to navigate.  Easily syncs to Windows Media Player to download files.  Somewhat awkward to use touch screen keyboard on Internet access, but not much of a problem.  You will really need the Mini Dock or DVR Gen 5 Dock to fully use the whole capability of the unit and charge it quickly so plan to pay for accessories.  Internet browsing also requires extra money to download Opera OS, but it works well.  Great unit especially for those who spend a lot of time on airplanes.

<Title>Great media player!
<Date>Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After much deliberation I decided to puchase the 30 GB version of the Archos player.  The reasons I chose this over the competition include:  Nice screen Touch screen Reputation to play everything Unit size Cost  After using it for 20+ hours, I've come up with a short list of pros and cons:  Pros: Screen IS great.  Any reasonably formatted video looks fantastic  Audio sounds great.  While it wasn't very loud in a large pair of reference headphones, it sounds much better than my last gen iPod.  Ability to output video to television through the docking station is NICE.    Wireless works great.  I plug it into the DVR station, sit down on the couch, use the remote to access the shared folder on my PC and seamlessly stream my video to my television.  Battery life is long enough for a NY-CA flight...roughly 5 hrs of play time.  Cons:  To really get good use out of the player you need to buy a few additional things.  The AC3 codec is a must, as many videos are encoded with AC3 sound.  The web browser would be nice, but is not a necessity, and a docking station is a nice add on. $20 for the media codec, $30 for the browser, $99 for the docking station...adds up.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd buy it again in a hearbeat

<Title>Archos: the ipod touch killer
<Date>Thu Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received the Archos 605 WiFi 30GB for Christmas and I am very impressed with the bang for the buck.    The good: This is a well designed product that seems to be build very solidly.  The image the screen produces is phenomenal.  High resolution, excellent dot pitch, vibrant, well back lit, and viewable in all lighting conditions.  The responsiveness is excellent and the touch screen sensitive.  The box includes all of the cables and components to get you going and it actually includes a printed manual that is useful.  In addition the Archos is pre-loaded with the unabridged version of the manual in PDF format on it.  But you probably won't need it for much.  The Archos is very intuitive to use.  The UPnP features work great for streaming media to your Archos.  Just setup your Windoze box with Media Player 10+ and set it up to share.  MAKE SURE YOU OPEN THE PORTS IN YOUR FIREWALL SOFTWARE and very shortly you'll be asked if your Archos 605 should be allowed to access media on your computer.  Seconds later you'll be able to view any picture or play any video or audio file that the Windows Media Player has in it's library.  Wait until you get to play with the Archos content portal.  Of course they want to sell you stuff, but the free part is the best!  Just click on DailyMotion and enjoy.  It is YouTube for your Archos.  (Check out archos.dailymotion.com)  On top of everything, the battery life is great.  The Not So Good: The WiFi is pretty good...as long as the Archos likes your wireless router.  There have been some software upgrades that have made the WiFi more compatable, but you may be forced to change the encryption scheme to get the Archos to play nice.  I had to change from WPA to WPA2 on my router at home.  Oddly, I have not run into any challenges at public WiFi locations.  I was a bit frustrated that after purchasing the device that I was expected to spend more to get additional codecs and the opera browser.  But at the end of the day I don't need the codecs and Archos is using a leveraged model that allows the unit to be cheaper for those of us who don't want or need the other features.  Why did I give it 5 stars instead of 4? Wow, that was a hard one.  The device is rock solid and has exceeded my expectations in the value department.  I was a bit frustrated with the WiFi problems I had,but that has been worked out.  I was also put off by the fact I had to pay for the browser, but I thought about the value proposition and decided that had the product been $30 more expensive to begin with and included the browser I would have still thought it was a great value.  So, it is not a *perfect* 5 stars, but closer to 5 than 4.  If you're on the fence about buying one, just do it, you'll love it!

<Title>Very good portable video player
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This player replaced my previous favorite Creative Zen Vision: M  I had the creative for a while and thought of upgrading and this was the only player that I had in mind (iTouch wasn't even considered since it does not have a big screen like the 605 and the screen resolution was lower).  What attracted me to the 605 is how easy it was to use.  The touch screen works flawlessly and the buttons on the side are very easy to use.  The battery life is respectable, around 5.5 hours of video and around 18 hours for audio.  It supports the major formats such as AVI. XviD and DviX (H.264 and M-PEG2 must be purchased separately as plug ins).  Transfer rate is smooth and easy.  Here is my biggest gripe about the player (which caused me to sell it off to upgrade to the newly released Cowon A3) the amount of formats supported is very minimal when compared to the A3.  I own a lot of video in MKV format (although currently the A3 cannot play a lot of videos because of the lack of H.264 native support but hopefully a firmware update will fix that) and it does not support it.  Also, any video resolution not matching the screen resolution (800 X  480) cannot be supported whereas the A3 can support up to 720p.  When I contacted Archos they told me there was no future firmware update for MKV and that nailed the coffin on the player for me.  If you do not mind the fact that this player lacks a lot of formats then this player is right for you.  However, if you want a player that supports a huge amount of audio/video formats, look to the Cowon A3 player as it is your only option.  The reason why I did give this player the same score as the Cowon A3 is how easy it is to use this player and there is physically nothing wrong with any of the design (unlike the A3).  Also, it can go online for those who are into browsing on the net (make sure you have a WiFi connection readily available).

<Title>Great for video, good for music, weak for internet
<Date>Wed Feb 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The video playback on this player is excellent.  The killer app for this device is the DVR attachment or if you have Dish Network you can transfer files directly from some models of the Dish DVR.  It is better than paying i tunes.  The sound quality is good but sometimes you get a click sound when the screen dims to save power.  Player is compatible with lots of file types.  You have to pay for extras like web browser.  This device can be set up so when you plug in the USB, it can to be recognized as a media player, or as an external hard drive.  I thought that was a very cool feature and I wish I had bought the 80 or 160 gig so I can use it as a external hard drive when traveling.   I was disappointed with the user interface.  It is awkward, doesn't make good use of the touch screen, uses weird symbols, and you have to work with multiple layers of windows to get to what you want. The widgets are weak and difficult to use.   You cannot sync the contacts, calendar, or notes like a PDA so when you add in the limited text entering ability, the widgets are almost worthless. You can't customize the screen or interface.   You have to read the manual to understand the device because it is not very intuitive.  It is difficult to do things like delete files.  The PDF reader works well but it would be better if you could change pages with the touch screen.  The optional games are worth $10.   The browser crashes occasionally and the wifi reception is weak.  The ability to share media files wirelessly on a home network is very cool.  The player has a solid build but you have to lock the buttons if you put it in a pocket because the sensitive buttons and touch screen will make the device go crazy.  The button to lock the device is slow and difficult because it is supposed to have a different function when connected to a TV.     I bought this device to replace an old PDA that I used for media files, limited Wifi, eBook reading, and as a PIM.  It is a poor choice for that because of weak user interface and inability to sync.  I can read some eBooks as html or PDF files but turning pages is slow.  The unexpected benefit is it is a GREAT video player and a versatile MP3 player.  I am hoping for multiple software updates to improve the user interface.  Overall it is GREAT for video, very good for music, Great for file storage, weak but usable for Internet browsing, and for weak PDA type functions

<Title>The Future in your Pocket
<Date>Thu Feb 21 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have owned the Archos 605 unit for a couple of months now and there is just not enough I can say about this nifty device.  You will be blown away by the amazing quality of the 800x480 resolution 4.3 inch screen.  The unit is smaller than a PSP but holds so much more potential.  First, I must discuss the problems with the Archos 605, though none are essentially important. The Archos 605 has the ability to view PDFs using the file browser but my only complaint is that loading a PDF is rather slow and the fact that flipping pages requires several seconds to load is ridiculous. The plugins are optional.  I do not have many problems with this nuisance but I hate the fact that I have to pay for the web browser.  The browser is Opera powered and works relatively well though it is still on the slow side (a firmwire update will surely fix this problem).  This is where I run into most of my problems though.  I can web surf on Amazon with the Archos 605 but sometimes the unit loses the connection and freezes or resets on its own.  I'm not exactly sure what the problem is but hopefully Archos will fix this in a future firmwire update. The other plugins are somewhat frivolous but I believe Archos is charging too much.  $20 in order to watch MPEG-2, H.264, or MPEG-4 movie files is overpriced.  My way around this hassle is converting my video files, which I have no problem with doing.  I enjoy the fact that I rarely have to convert video because of the Archos 605's large codec support.  The best feature is the fact that the Archos 605 can be connected to any computer and no hassling synchronization software is necessary. Now that the minor issues are out of the way, I must explain a little bit about the Archos 605 unit.  The best settings for converting High Definition content to high-quality standard definition video is a 720x406 resolution and 3072 kbit/s.  Though the Archos 605 can support a higher bitrate, 3 mbps is very good quality and is viewable without any drop in framerate.  Compared to the PSP settings of 2.5 mbps at 368x208, the Archos 605 clearly is the best portable media player for viewing video. One thing to understand is that the Archos 605 runs on a harddrive using a linux operating system.  This means that the unit takes a little while to startup.  This is not really an issue but people should be aware of why the unit does not seem to be doing anything for about a half a minute when booted up. The video feature is the main reason I use my Archos 605.  Archos was generous enough to create movie clip thumbnails for each video in the video folder.  If you need high definition content that you want to convert and watch on your Archos 605, you should look at the Apple Quicktime Gallery or on Stage6. The music feature allows for the creation of playlists (takes a little bit of learning to get used to) and displays any album artwork.  I would say that the music quality is okay on the Archos 605 (video is where the 605 really shines). The photo feature has some touchscreen controls that aren't as gimmicky as an iPhone but are still nice to have.  Pictures look very crisp on the high resolution screen. The file browser is a great underrated feature that allows for moving, copying, and renaming files.  The ability to organize is great.  Also, you can access files from a Windows PC (using Windows Media Player 11 to turn on media sharing). I tested the media streaming option and I am still stunned at the Archos 605's capabilities.  I can watch a movie on an external hard drive attached to my computer by setting a folder's properties to allow sharing.  The file opens quickly, never loses connection, allows for skipping around, and works as if the video were on the Archos 605's harddrive. I am unable to go in-depth enough on every feature of the Archos 605 but this portable media player is unbelievable and a must-have for any HD addict or aspiring photographer/videographer.  If you do buy the Archos 605, get the DVR station (eventually) to make full use of the Archos 605 but get the mini docking station immediately in order to charge the 605 quickly.

<Title>Great Concept, Bad Design
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First off, let's go with the positives. Assuming you pay up the money to get the plug ins, you can play pretty much anything you want except for those windows exclusive formats.  The screen is amazing and the browser is great.  The 605 has all the features to be an Ipod killer.  And that's when the negatives come in.  first off is the horrible build quality.  I've had an archos in the past and i made sure to get an extended warranty on this thing.  I've had it for a week and the shape of the device seems to be changing.  there are now curves where there should be straight lines.  The touch screen works well enough with practice, but Archos decided to give 2 styluses(or is it styli) in the box.  Only problem is that there's nowhere on the device to put those babies.  But the styluses aren't really necessary.  The access to the Archos download services via wifi seem like a good idea, but the products are way too expensive, especially videos.  If you want a device that will make you say "sweet" everytime you figure out another one of its tricks, i'd say go for it.  If you want reliability, then stick with the Ipod or the Gen 2 Zune even though they don't have nearly as many features.
