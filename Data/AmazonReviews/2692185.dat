<Content>I bought this player about a week ago after my Lyra wouldnt hold a charge and I got fed up with "hardisk" players. I also bought a 2GB MicroSD card turning the player into 4GB. The only drawback: If you use all the memory, the player is slow to load. It has to "Refresh Database" each time you turn it on which takes about 15-25 seconds. VERY easy to use with PC. Plugs in to PC to charge and to transfer files. The headphones that come with the player are less then perfect. You might want to invest in better headphones. I have owned 2 prior Sansa products. They are great! Has voice recorder, FM radio, the works!   
<Overall>5
