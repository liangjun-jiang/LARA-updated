<Title>Love my nano!
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I received my 4gb pink nano as a Christmas present last year and so far so GREAT!!!  I have no complaints at all.  My nano has withstood two teenage sons taking it from room to room, one 12 yr old daughter who goes horse riding listening to it and me, who takes it along to work and endures the bus ride home.  Its always had a cover on it which I insist or they dont borrow it and for the longest time I kept the covering on the screen and dial but after 6 months my son removed them and still NO scratches and this nano is in pockets, purses, backpacks and sometimes just lying around, its been dropped I  hate to say and still working like a charm.  we love this little gadget of technology and this Christmas my 3 kids are getting their own so maybe mom can have hers back!!  I would recommend it!!!!

<Content>So I was the first kid on the floor with the IPOD NANO, I ordered one from MAC the Monday of release.  It arrives, we all OOOOH and AHHHHH I take it home and charge it for the night Wake up at 5:30, fully charged battery, put it on and get on with my day, by 10 AM the battery had DIED CRAP!  I call up MAC and they want to REPAIR this one I say HELL NO!  I just BOUGHT it, I am not sending this back for you to REFURBISH it, I want a new one, and you screwed up my inscription, too.....  So I am getting ready to mail this back, when I charge the  battert ONE more time, all night charge, fresh in the AM  This time, it stayed on from 7:30, when I started to use it until 1:26PM, an hour ago, my NANO died from poor battery power.  Watch out when you get these, I am going to return this and hope I get a better one, if I get another POOR BATTERY, I am going to get a freaking refund, this is BOGUS  MAC should know better than to release a product that is crap  :/

<Title>Excellent addition to the iPod lineup, some caveats
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Replacing the iPod mini in the middle of Apple's iPod line, the nano fills the spot nicely, bringing a lot of nice features and a few compromises.   The nano uses flash memory chips for storing the music and data, unlike the 1" hard drive found in the mini and 1.8" drive in the full-size iPods. The benefits of the flash memory are multifold - battery life is very good, there's no skipping, and no chance of damage to moving parts from shock. An added benefit is that songs load up instantly, unlike on hard drive based iPods where there would be a slight delay as the hard drive spun up if the song requested wasn't in the memory buffer.  The nano also takes cues from its bigger brothers, with a very bright color screen with higher resolution than the mini's (176x132 vs. 138x110), photo viewing capability, and the signature white and silver body. It also has a few exclusive features, including a nifty Stopwatch, a Screen Lock feature styled after a combination lock, and an enhanced Clock. Unfortunately like the mini, you can't install Mac OS X on it and use it as a boot disk.  In usage, the nano works like a charm, though the bottom-mounted headphone jack takes a little getting used to after four years of it being on top. Battery life ranges from 12-15 hours in mixed usage, with it coming in on the low side if I listen to high-bitrate files (probably has to read from more memory). The screen is wonderful when the backlight is on, but visibility outside isn't as good as the old monochrome screens.  Despite its positives, the nano has some things that aren't so great. The headphone jack is located on the bottom and has no additional connector like on past non-Shuffle iPods, so the remote control no longer has a place to plug in. This also means that accessories that use the remote port like FM transmitters will not work. It goes without saying the accessory manufacturers will produce a ton of goodies for the nano by virtue of it being an iPod, so the concern is mainly for iPod owners with existing accessories or things on the market currently that won't work with the nano.  In going with a clear plastic/stainless steel design like the big iPods, the nano is more scratch and dent prone, unlike the mini, which was a tank with its rugged aluminum casing. I've already scuffed the back of the nano after only five days of usage, while my 18-month old mini looks virtually new. The nano also features a miniaturized version of the excellent Click Wheel, which can be a little tough to work for those with big fingers. It doesn't depress as far and the center portion is flush with the unit, which makes selecting things a bit tough occasionally.   Of note is that the nano cannot connect to your computer over FireWire, though it will charge. USB is the only way to sync, and users with the older USB spec will be waiting a while to fill up the nano. Even with photo viewing abilities, the nano cannot output it to a TV like big color iPods, so the implementation is halfway since the screen is too small for any extended viewing. On this initial firmware revision (1.0), navigating back and forth through menus can get a little laggy at times, with the menus not coming on smoothly if you press the buttons too fast.   After countless iPods Apple still has not included an easily-replaceable battery, so when it eventually dies you'll either have to send it back to Apple or attempt to crack the nano open. The lithium-polymer battery Apple uses will last anywhere from 18 months to 3 years depending on how often it's recharged and how it's used. Running your iPod until it's completely dead (total discharge) is bad for the battery, and will cut down on its lifespan.  Apple's been bringing the price of iPods down steadily, but has been accomplishing this partly by cutting down on accessories packed in the box. My 3G iPod came with a wealth of goodies, but the nano only comes with the omnipresent white earbuds, a CD, USB cable, and a piece of plastic to enable the nano to fit into future docking accessories. The buds look neat, but the sound quality leaves much to be desired. Picking up a quality pair of headphones will do wonders for your auditory experience.  I've owned every iPod since the original 5GB unit all the way back in 2001. For its greater capacity and use as a backup drive I'm keeping my 60GB iPod photo around, but for daily use the nano is where it's at. It deftly combines the advantages of the flash-based Shuffle with the perks of the full-sized iPods and adds its own unique tricks to the bag. Packing 4GB of flash memory with all of its advantages at a decent price is no small feat, and the smallness of the the design has to be held to be believed. Not many reservations, and definitely recommended.

<Title>Before you take the plunge ...
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love the iPod. Always have. At home, we have five, including this one: the 4GB iPod nano.  Before you leap, realize two things: (1) this iPod is extremely fragile compared to other iPods, particularly the tough-as-nails iPod mini (a drop of a couple of feet onto a linoleum floor took out the screen); and (2) the black version gets scratched very easily, and shows scratches far more than any white iPod I've owned (after a day and before dropping the damn thing, it already looked awful from scratching -- and it was treated with kid gloves).  Okay, if you can live with those caveats, and invest in a durable protector (we bought the arm-band holder, which does a lousy job of protecting the iPod nano)--none of which are out yet--then this new iPod is truly an amazing bit of technology. It's tiny (it feels even smaller than the photos suggest), has great sound quality (better, I think, than any other iPod I've owned), and the display is gorgeous (even though tiny).  For me, the mini (now defunct, but bargains still abound) is the better choice given its sturdiness. I'm not up for museum-relic care for my electronics, which would certainly help if you own one of these.  Another beautiful, functional gizmo from Apple. Just know what you're getting. Some websites claim the nano is sturdy. I can tell you, from first hand experience, it isn't. So, you be the judge. (Sure, the thing still played, but replacing the screen will set you back at least $90, and, even on the web sites in question, the screen broke.)  (Oh, and if you see someone taking shots at the iTunes software, don't believe it. It's the best music software out there, and its integration with this--or any--iPod is a joy.)

<Title>Great, but still not scratch resistant!
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The Ipod Nano is a very worthy successor to the wildly popular Ipod mini and is a great addition to the Ipod family.  This thing is tiny.  You won't believe how tiny it really is until you have it in your hands.  The Nano pretty much does everything the big 20g Ipod can do, except it holds only 1000 songs with 4g model and 500 with the 2g as well as photos and album art.  It also includes a stopwatch which is handy when I go running.  It is also extremely light.  I thought the Mini was light, but this feels like a feather not to mention extremely thin.  It slides into my front pocket with ease.  The screen is smaller of course, but doesn't lose its clarity.  There is also the return of the touch sensitive click wheel first introduced on the Ipod Mini.  It works very well sifting through songs in seconds.  The Nano comes in the familar white and a very slick black, however the black one will definitely show more scratches.  Gone are the variety of colors of the Mini.  The only gripe I have about the Nano is that it is extremely proned to scratches.  I was extremely careful with it even handling it with a microfiber cloth, yet still managed to get scratches on it.  I don't know if it's only me, but I get really anal about scratches on brand new products I've bought.  You would think after coming out with the other Ipods that suffered the same problem, Apple would've been smart and covered the Nano with a scratch resistant material.

<Title>Reluctantly elevated to "necessity"
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I didn't want to like the iPod Nano.  I bought an iPod Mini for my girlfriend.  I thought it was cool.  But never seriously considered getting one for myself.  I own a pretty nifty Pocket PC cellphone (the I-Mate Jam - highly recommended, BTW).  I've always been happy with storing my songs on an SD. My cellphone gave me communications, games, music, productivity (excel, etc.), and got lots of "techno-geek" points. The last thing I wanted was yet another electronic gadget to carry around.  Then I made the mistake of taking a look at this newest creation of Steve Job's Apple. I was blown away. It's SO SMALL. And, very stylish. And very useable. And, at 4 GB, adequate for all but the most demanding consumers. And, at this price, it's cheaper than buying memory cards totalling up to 4 GB.  Instant there was no question of not owning one. I reluctantly, but secretly proudly, now carry an iPod Nano to complement my cellphone. I'm afraid that I won't be using my PocketPC phone to listen to music anymore.  Apple truly blows me away. Kudos to Steve Jobs for his remarkable transformation of his company into the most innovative mass market tech company out there. Anyone who knows Steve Jobs history with Apple knows how remarkable his task really has been. Also, anyone who knows the story about Apple computer and the initial problems with the name of the company understands how ironic this whole field of innovation is!  In conclusion, buy this product. Beg, borrow, or steal - well, not steal. Use any legal and ethical manner of getting your hands on one of the Nanos. You SO won't regret it!

<Title>The new iPod, looking good.
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just picked up my iPod Nano last night. I totally thought this thing was going to suck. Man oh man was I wrong. This thing is beyond belief. This thing is so damn small its unbelieveable. It is definitely worth getting if you don't need all that extra space.  Size: The thing is really small and about the width of a pencil. It is really light. You need to see this thing up close. The commercials don't depict the right image. The click wheel is smaller, and the main button in the center is slightly bigger. The screen is small, but then again its the Nano. The backside is metal, just like the regular iPod. I'd take care of that because it fingerprints and scratches. Then again you can't help the fingerprints. For such a small iPod, this thing is impressive.  New Things: Alright lets start out with placement. The hold button is on the top left, and is small, you might need to use your fingernails. The headphone slot is on the bottom left. It comes with the regular headphones, although I thought they were the one that goes around your neck. The slot for the USB is right next to the headphone jack, and surprisingly the only way to charge it, if you don't have the additional charger. If you do have the additional charger your in luck, because it does work with the nano. But just be careful if you have the USB charger, because if it runs out of battery, your pretty much screwed. The color screen is really clear, and enhances everything. Cover art is available if you get it from iTunes. The features that are new in the iPod are compelling. There is a world clock, stopwatch, screen lock, and everything else you are used to.   Packaging: The packaging is different. The box is smaller, and is black if you get the white Nano. It opens up to the iPod on the right, then the supplies on the left. They are in a open up pouch on the top. There are two small packages. One contains instructions, stickers, and an iTunes 5 installer. The other package is contained with headphones, an additional add on to the dock, the USB cord, and covers for the headphones.   Quality: I got the white Nano, mainly because I am big about scratches. There are unfortunately a couple on the screen, but when the backlight is on, they are hard to see. If you get the black be careful about scratches. I am waiting for a case to protect it. If you want to wipe off something dont use your shirt. Use a Kleenex, or something soft. The sound quality is better as well. The screen quality is also better especially with a color screen.  Pros and Cons.  Pros: -Very slim put it anywhere, wait for a case before you put it in you pocket. -Sound quality is better. -Color screen. -Additional features. -Battery goes for about 14 hours, 10 hours with backlight  Cons: -Only charges with the USB cord, unless you buy the AC charger. -Scratches...ehh they are annoying, especially with the black.  -Need to take great care of it, avoid dropping it.  With all cons gone, this thing is for you! If you want a durable little iPod, and are not too obsessed about music, forget the shuffle and get this! I highly reccomend it.

<Title>Absolutely Astonishing!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you think the pictures and T.V. ads for this look impressive, wait until you actually get your hands on it. I got a nano just a couple of days ago after giving my old 15 gig iPod (the one with the row of 4 buttons above the scroll wheel) to my dad. This iPod is so incrediblely small and light weight. The screen is very bright and vibrant and pics look great on it. The sound quality is excellent as with all other iPods, and all of the great features, plus a couple new ones (stopwatch, world clock, screen lock), are here. The click wheel, although a little smaller than the ones on other iPods, is very accessable and easy to use. At 4 gb, you will probabally be able to get just over 1,000 songs on it, which is a very good ammount for the average person. All in all, this iPod is great and definitely has a "Wow Factor" that will facinate you when you see it.  Pros: *Amazingly Small and Lightweight *Great Sound Quality *Great Features That iPod's are Known For *Nice, Bright Color Screen  Cons: -Will not work with all older iPod accessories

<Title>Lack of VIDEO-OUT is a fundamental flaw
<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I waited through the iPod evolution and finally bought the 4G iPod (clickwheel) in 2004. The hard disk technology broke 3 times within a year (under warranty) and then finally a 4th time the week after the one-year warranty expired. I swore I would never again buy another hard disk-based iPod. The very next week, the iPod Nano was release. I was mesmerized. It sounded perfect! Granted the 4GB version has a $150 profit markup, is easily scratched, delicate and low memory capacity (only 4GB), but at least it was flash-drive based. I actually bought this the next week, and returned it before opening it once I found out that it didn't have VIDEO-OUT capabilities for photos and no FireWire capabilities, as the regular iPod's did. Those were deal-breakers for the tiny $250 device. I will wait a bit longer for the 2nd generation Nano which hopefully will have VIDEO-OUT and FireWire capabilities (and hopefully more memory) even if they have to be a bit larger. The iPod and iPod Mini's are small enough for me already; I like the Nano for its flash-drive technology (for prospective reliability reasons).

<Title>Discreet Ipod
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have definitely known what it has been like with so many people in the MP3 craze. It has been so popular, people aren't buying music anymore from the basic music Mom & Pop shops anymore. While that has been the case, the ones that majority of people have went to are the Ipods. Since they came out a few years ago, Apple has truly lead the MP3 player market at least 2 to 1. While there have been so many different styles of Ipods like the regular, the Ipod mini and the shuffle, there is one that can be just easier to take anywhere your heart desires from the inside of your pocket. This is it.  The Apple Ipod nano edition, is a far better version than the lackluster Ipod Shuffle was when it was introduced. This MP3 player device can hold just about the same amount of songs as the Ipod mini, 1,000 songs, yet it is so small you can just just put it conviently anywhere. The Ipod nano has all the abilities that the regular Ipod and the Ipod mini have, with a convient LCD screen, that displays the menu and songs well. While it does have some bright spots, there is one disadvantage with this device. Although it is uniquely well, it has a short battery life, and not as much as some other MP3 players have. Even the Ipod mini have a slightly longer battery life by just only 4 hours.  While there are so many different MP3 players on the market, the Apple Ipod nano is a great buy for anybody who wants to get into the MP3 craze while it is hot. I have tried this quaint player in the stores, and I liked it a lot, and Ipod know you will too.  Portability: B+  Display: B+  Price: B  Enjoyment: B 1/2+  Overall: B 1/2+

<Title>Impossibly Small, and A Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute.  Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil.  In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle.   Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces.  Weight is another jaw-dropping figure.  The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.    Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable?  Don't be!  The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable.  Why?  The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player.  The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.    Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs. The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic.  It features a nice resolution, and color.  You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music.  There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.    Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.    Color - White is the traditional iPod color, and it will match many of your other Apple products.  Furthermore, white is less likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies. I love the Nano, and its going to make my life a lot more fun.  Gigabytes of music in 1.5 ounces, so there really is no limit to where the music dan go.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>The coolest mp3 player in the universe!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>What a stunning piece of equipment. My absolute favourite gadget at the moment! This has just got to be the coolest mp3 player in the universe, and it is so tiny, it is a wonder it works. Definitely on it's way to becoming the best selling mp3 player!  I own a 40gb iPod which is almost full, and needed another one, then this came out just in time for me. The Nano comes in white or black. Mine is the white one.  I was really excited when I got my Nano. I carefully opened the beautiful packaging (still have my iPod packaging, LOL!!). Wow!! To see one is to want one. If you hope to resist, throw away your wallet/credit card before viewing.  Very easy to use. Sound quality is excellent. As the Nano uses flash memory, it does not skip, no matter the jolting it receives. Software (as usual) is a no brainer to use. The colour display allows you to view the CD art as music is playing. Cool! You can also store and view your pictures on it. The click wheel, as tiny as it is, is still easy to use.  Other features are a world clock, stop watch, and screen lock. As with other iPods, you can use this as an external drive to back up. Another neat feature is display of lyrics to whatever track is playing. You must install the new 5.0 version of iTunes, and paste in the lyrics yourself.  You get 14 hours play from a single full charge. As usual, to ensure long battery life, try not to let the battery run out completely, (also, skipping tracks, using the backlight, etc use up the battery faster). Charging is by USB to your PC/Laptop, or a standard iPod charger (thank God for my 40gb iPod).  Still not too pleased with the supplied ear plugs so I use a pair by Sony that clip behind the ears and really bring out the sound. That's my only moan for this 5 star device! Now excuse me, must get back to gazing at my Nano. Aaah!

<Title>Apple has done it again
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB of space first, and now they want to take 80% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.  ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $50, you can upgrade to a Photo that has 5x times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is--it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.  Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their petite size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300.  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>Sexy, showy, and solid
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've been using my 20 Gigabyte Ipod 4G for a while now and been quietly watching Apple unveil one after another, upgrades to my now defunct Ipod. The Ipod photo which is now standard on the 20 gigabyte and higher models comes in color, longer battery life, and it allows users to view photos. The Ipod shuffle was pretty much a low end flop. Although with its flash memory and relatively small size/price, Jobs even admitted he didn't quite get the same response out as he was expecting.   But enter Ipod Nano- the response has already been tremendous. People I know who want one now have been calling stores nearby to find one and most of the 4GB ones are sold out. I can imagine it'll be like that for a while.   Pros:   What I like about the 4GB model is exactly what I didn't like about my Ipod 20GB model. I didn't use the space at all. I have in rotation about 1000+ songs and I rarely listen to all of them. In fact, I mostly rely on my playlists of about 50+ songs. So really, I was only using about 1/5th the space on the Ipod 20GB model. With the Nano, you get the best of both worlds. Realistically, the most space a typical music listener will ever need is about 4GB or about 1000 songs. I've discovered this with my 20GB Ipod and now unfortunately regret buying the larger model. So Nano to me, fits what I think most music listeners would need in terms of space.   What immediately knocks my socks off with this new Ipod Nano model is the size and weight. When I was going over the product description, it was listed as 1.5 Ounces. I was thinking oh that's only 1/4th the weight of my Ipod 20GB. But then I took the Nano and compared it to household items I have. To put it in perspective: if you were to take eight quarters and place them in the palm of your hand, the Nano would be lighter than that. Just test it out, if you have a dress shirt or pants pocket, put 8 quarters into it. Jump up and down. The Nano is about five sticks of gum. Nothing. 1.5 Ounces is truly amazing. Regarding size, its width is smaller than a number two pencil. The Nano is like six credit cards together.   What I think makes this a simple no brainer awesome product are the capabilities the Nano has. It puts to shame the Ipod mini. It is functionally equivalent to the Ipod photo. Other than the no Firewire capability (yet, probably soon) or bluetooth capability, you can listen to songs, store and show photos, and sync up with a calendar. It has a clickwheel just like its larger brothers (20, 60 GB models). The monitor display is crisp and magnificent for its size. You can't zoom into photos or play with them as you would on a camera or computer but they come out clearly. The color is amazing.   The battery range is more than what they advertise. I've clocked it at going more than 14 hours and 13 minutes. This is on shuffle without the backlight on of course.   Cons:  Limit of colors- I liked the minis because you had the option of choosing what color suited you. I'm more a blue person so neither black or white fits me. The black model is a nice start but I've heard it scratches and shows finger prints too visibly. I hope Apple can release colored ones soon to sorta tie in with the Mini idea.   The earplug connection is on the bottom- why o why would you do that? I understand that if you get the lanyard headphones, it would make sense to have them placed that way so if the Nano was hanging like a necklace, you could see it right side up. But, I plan on using the Nano as a portable music player in my dress shirt pocket because of its light weight and tiny size. So the placement of the earphone plug bugs me.  I'm starting to notice that Apple skimp on accessories for their products. At first they gave with their Ipods, chargers. But with the Nano, the only accessories you get are the Ipod earphones, a dock, and a USB cord. You'll need to buy a power charger separate, which is another 30 dollars if you don't have one already. I had one already from my 20GB model. (This is an aside but people here are falsely posting here on reviews, saying that you can only charge it using the USB connection so you would need a laptop or computer to charge the Nano. This is not true. I've been charging it fine using my regular standard Ipod power charger that came with the 20GB model.)  Overall- If you're not a fanatic music listener and need to have like 4000 songs on one music player, if you're like me, a typical joe who has at most 1000 songs and would never fully use a Ipod 20GB, you'll like the Nano.

<Content> Of all the small mp3 players out there, this one is the best..I returned my 20 gb so I could have something smaller to take with me to the gym..This is the best and most convienient mp3 player I ever have seen, I think this will replace the Mini.  Also, Flash memory is much more reliable than HD in the regular Ipods so you dont have to worry about this one if you dropped it..I get warranties from Best Buy anyways (which I suggest doing), so dropping these things isnt a problem.  Go to the gym in style with this baby!

I had a different kind of Mp3 player, that was bulky, and hard to read the buttons, the nano is easy to use, and it is so small. The sound is great, hard to believe it comes out of something so small. I am sure once I get use to using the software and downloading more songs, it will become even easier.

<Title>Small and handy
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I like the nano because it's small and handy. The interface is also more efficient than others on the market. It has a lot of features and is versatile at organizing music.  With 4gb, I can store an awful lot of songs, but be aware that the way you rip your mp3's make a very noticeable difference to how many songs you can store. 192k mp3's are 33% larger than 128k mp3's, so you may want two versions of the same song - one for home, one for your 4gb ipod. When I'm outside with the earbuds in, I can't tell the difference in quality so I'd just assume have more storage.  I strongly urge anyone buying a nano to invest in a case. Because they are portable and will be going in pockets, backpacks, etc. they will be subject to all kinds of fuzz, crumbs, and grit and the case will help keep it out. I've read also read how fragile others have found them to be, which is another practical reason for a case. I have had no issues with mine but it's never had any real abuse from dropping or being sat on.  My largest complaint is that you are, for all practical purposes, married to iTunes. There are so many ipods out there, and iTunes is so bad that I'm suprised it's not getting better. I could write a small manifesto on why iTunes stinks, but this review is really about the ipod (which is good!)  Another small issue is that the firmware upgrades to the ipod (which you do through iTunes) are of varying quality. Sometimes they fix issues, sometimes they create them.  Other minor detractions: * Battery life could be better, but I get around 8 hours * Screen is difficult to see outside * Wall/car chargers are not included (but cheap on amazon) * Copy protection pieces (mp4, some iTunes features) are annoying * More expensive than competitors * If battery poops out, may as well buy another - $75 replacement is a ripoff

<Title>Impossibly Small: Worried it's too small?
<Date>Wed Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod Nano is the second smallest iPod next to the Shuffle, albeit, it's thinner. I think this has some people scared, after all, that's only the height of 3 quarters stacked on top of each other. The first thing I said to myself when I first held it was, "I really hope I don't snap this thing in half." Obviously it's not going to but it definitely doesn't feel/look strong at all, I feel as if I'm carrying a delicate egg with me that could break with the slightest pressure. Although this is not true, it really feels extremely fragile.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice piece of technology. I brought it to school today for cross-country and left it in my locker during the day. I was sure to treat my little baby iPod Nano with all the care in the world especially when I have a half liter bottle of water in the same bag, which I was afraid was going to crush it. In the end it wasn't crushed. After I took it out in the lockeroom and hooked it up to our stereo speakers it was touched by about 25 kids from my team. It took a beating; finger prints all over the back and LCD, along with a few scratches.  Are you worried you might break the LCD or scratch it into a piece of scrap metal? I know I am, I'd advise getting clear plastic adhesive protector such as the ones decalgirl.com sells. It will cover the entire iPod Nano which will cause minimal damage to it when it's dropped, scratched, plus no more horrible fingerprints. Ya!  On another note, I'd advise getting a case of some sort whether it's the armband or a protective case. The Nano is so small I'd definitely feel better if it was encased in something sturdy and more robust. If you don't care about all the Nano's fancy fancy, and REALLY cool features, you might want to buy an iPod Mini from some online store.  But besides all this junk about the cosmetics, the Nano has some amazing features. holds 500 songs (2gb), you can store and display photos, it has games, a calendar, a clock, contact list, notes, stopwatch, and a keypad lock.  If you just spend a few extra dollars and invest in some protective accessories I think you will be extremely happy with the iPod Nano!

<Content>I have never been a believer in the IPOD before. Always seemed to fragile and too expensive. I had a Creative Labs Zen that was sturdy...took abuse...but heavy...a bit cumbersome. I saw the Nano and immediately checked it out. Was I wrong about Apple. This Nano is amazing. I had it for less than 2 hours and put about 400 songs and more than 200 clear, sharp pictures on it. I'm sold! Also, all those folks who advise how this thing scratches, etc. I don't buy it. I've thrown this around my car, my pocket..all over the place. It shows some fingerprints, but that's about it. No scratches, no broken screens, nothing except cystal clear sound a crystal clear display. I love my IPOD Nano. Great job Apple!

<Content>[...] Review: This will be the best selling player on the market.  With a color screen, ultra portability, the nano is awesome.  But, there are major flaws such as scratches.  I know the ipod tend to scratch easily. But just one day in my pocket the nano was full of scratches, which is ridiculous. Buy the white nano because you won't see as many scractches.   Also buy a screen protector!!! You will be thanking me later.  Also, there seems to be a little buzz in the background when you play an mp3 song.  Will cont. to update.

<Title>Great look, practical device
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After reading horror stories about iPod nano, about its bad screens, easy to smudge and to scratch, and supposed "easy to bend", I have to say iPod nano is nothing to worry about.  Treat it as what it is: a small factor electronic device on the pricey side. Do not abuse it, and don't do weird things with it. I have kept the plastic cover that the iPod nano shipped with, and it's been protecting not just against scratches and smudges, but also makes me feel less guilty dialing with greasy fingers or worry about dust getting into LCDs, which is pretty common. The touch wheel works fine, the screen still looks extremely crisp.  Anyway: the good stuff: iPod nano sound is great. The EQ does work very well. The touchwheel works perfectly, even though it's smaller. The screen may be small, but it is VERY crisp. When you sync your photos, you have the option to only load small sizes, which saves space, but appear really sharp on the screen. It's also great to view album covers. This thing is also VERY light, to the point that it's unbelievable even after days of using it. I can haul it out of my deep pockets by pulling on the earphone cord with no worry because it is light, and the earphone plug is very tight. (Earphones feel heavier than iPod itself.) The back - where I did remove the wrap - does smudge a lot, but nothing out of the ordinary for very shiny surface (it's more reflecting than my mirrors), really. And it's light enough not to feel it being anywhere, so shirt pockets are perfect places for this thing. The headphone jacket on the bottom is genius.  The complaints: nothing is perfect, and iPod nano has a couple of issues. The touchwheel might be a bit *too* sensitive. Sometimes just pulling it out of my pocket makes the volume go up or down. The lock switch in my opinion is too hard; I need to poke it with my nails. Also, it lacks the option of viewing album cover only while playing. That would have been nice to have on the colour display. And you only get 3.7 GB of usable space, which seems to be too big of a difference because the file system shouldn't take so much space for such a simple device.  And the battery is weird. I don't think the indicator works reliably, and there is no way to view detailed battery level; there's only a small bar on the topright. It's gone to absolute thinnest red, and after plugging into USB for 5 seconds and unplugging it, it shows the battery back to half full. That makes no sense. So my guess is even when it says it's charged, it isn't fully charged. I have been able to get about 6-7 hours with minimal use of lighting, medium volume, and fairly frequent power on and off and scrollwheel use. Gets me through the day, but not much longer. Also, battery doesn't charge when I have my iBook in sleep mode, (because USB devices technically could still draw power.) So I have to leave my computer on to charge it.  Lastly regarding the lack of radio: I do consider that to be a disappointment. But FM reception is actually peculiarly bad where I am so I did not miss it too much. I'm just getting used to podcasts. Curiosly enough, the "Shuffle my songs" does not skip over podcasts, (which for me are mostly news talk shows,) so it's a bit surprising.  But I do very much love this device, and would recommend it highly. It looks great, and is a great piece of engineering.

<Title>The truth about the nano
<Date>Fri Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You read such a lot of rubbish about these things. I've had mine from day one, so I'm in a good position to say that the iPod entirely lives up to what's claimed for it. But at first you might not think so, because the battery life seems poorer than the spec says. This is pretty important: you need to condition it by running it right down, charging it right up, running it right down to zero again. At least twice. It makes a big difference. Get a case for it (there are plenty out there now) and you won't have to worry about scratches and stuff. Mine's not scratched. I can only speak for the way this thing works with a Mac computer, but it is utterly seamless. Honestly, it couldn't be easier or quicker to do everything you want to do. Whole albums rocket from your Mac to the nano in about 6 seconds (that's via USB 2.0 of course). Perfection in this department. I haven't tried any other earphones with my nano, so all I can report is that the ones you get are pretty good if you don't need huge amounts of bass. The posiion in your ear is somewhat critical though and I find myself fiddling with them a lot. And the little foam pads (you get two spares) keep falling off. But, the sound is very sweet and clear. It's a nice feeling, when you're out and about, that there's no hard disk to skip. The sound is very stable. And very, very high quality. I doubt you'd be able to detect the difference between your iPod and something high end when you're out and about. It's that good. I even play mine through my hi-fi (stick it on shuffle and it's great for parties) and it sounds great. I bought the little dock to connect it, which bypasses the headphone amp and keeps the iPod upright. The best thing is the size though. It positively vanishes into a shirt pocket. It's smaller than a credit card, yet has a really clear bright colour screen. And it syncs with my Mac's address book and calendar. And has a miniscule version solitaire. And displays photos (though they're so small it's hardly worth it). Oh and you can easily use it as a hard drive. I'm still stunned by it after all this time. I wouldn't travel without it now. It could even be better than I imagined.

<Title>One week old and no scratches
<Date>Sun Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I've had mine a week and do not have a single scratch on it.  I've had it in my (otherwise empty) pockets, dropped it a couple of times (from a short height onto carpet), and it still looks as good as new.  OK, I am paranoid about scratches until the nanotubes ship, so I handle mine as carefully as possible.  But I fully expect it to be in great condition when the tubes ship next month.  Black will show scratches more easily than white, so think about that before you get a black one.  I chose a white one for that reason.  I feel it should have come with a dock for $250, but I knew it wouldn't and I was OK buying it without.  I'll get a dock later.  Some folks are leaving the plastic protective sheet on the front until the tubes ship.  Great idea, you'll have a perfect condition nano!

<Title>Nothing sounds like it! But power source limited! (Adaptor costs extra).
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod's USB interface recharges from a computer USB connection only. This means if you want to go anywhere that does not have a PC available for recharging then you are left with a dead hunk of metal until you find a computer to power it up again. It takes about four hours to do a full recharge (and half a day to charge when out of the box, not 4 hours like it says in the manual), so I am not sure how you will feel about leaving your $300 iPod with an Internet Cafwhile on holiday or away from home. You need to buy a USB power adaptor if you want to plug your iPod into the mains. Without the power adaptor, which costs an extra $30, you are limited to PC recharging only. So be prepared to pay more than just the cost of the iPod for these nitpicky add-ons.  The iPod is an amazing device on two counts. One is that there is absolutely nothing on the market that is this size and holds so much data. Palms can not compete for storage size, end of story. Even the low-end 4GB iPods are overkill for MP3 playback. The clickwheel at the front of the iPod is genius. You move your thumb in a circle to scroll everything in the menu or volume. It has an amazing blue ambient backlight for night viewing. There is a top switch for locking the menu buttons so you can't accidentally adjust volume. If the headphones jack out by mistake the unit pauses automatically. The iPod mini series can easily go undetected in your jeans' pocket. The full version is a little bulkier but not by much more than already stated. The Nano series is nearly invisible. If you read the manual properly you can even store data files on the unit (in the notes folder etc.), so you can also use the iPod as a mass storage device for transporting files. As for extras, well it is quite smart. The software is updated by Apple over the internet, so you have calendars, address books, time-zones and an assortment of other extras that give the unit more class. However the alarm clock is just garbage because the device has a very limited internal speaker that is designed for just low-level `clicking' sounds. The iPod is both PC and Apple compatible. The earphones are really well designed; the white cord plastic even feels nice with a respectable length that does not tangle. However the universal white nature and shape of the earphones makes it easier to identify you as an iPod user. Although there are claims that the iPod is scratchproof, this is absolutely not the case. My metal is already starting to show scratches after a month of use. The screen, for all intents and purposes, scratches the same as a mobile phone does. Whoever programmed the sound software deserves a Gold Medal. The only sound system that even comes close to matching the iPod's sound quality is DOLBY DIGITAL or THX. The iPod is in that league. An expensive hi-fi system will not even sound as good as it.  The iPod file loading is not as easy as it seems. You must start working on your MP3 files before you can use it. This means right clicking the MP3 file (or group select) going into the file's properties and inputting genre, artists, albums, so that the naming systems work when in the iPod. You load the MP3 files into the Library of the iTunes software and see if you have the lists alright before finally dumping the chosen library selections onto the iPod's hard drive and taking your whole music collection for a walk on your hip. This could well be the FIRST MUST-HAVE APPLE PRODUCT that a PC user should own.  *Note - There is one major downside to the way the iPod plays files. You can not have continuous play of an album without breaks between tracks. If you want to solve this you need to join up your album into one giant MP3 track using external MP3 software. However Apple updates their software and firmware so maybe in the future they will solve this issue.  Pros: -	THX, DOLBY DIGITAL quality music centre that fits in your palm. -	Cosmos sized tiny hard drive. -	Design and Clickwheel. -	Apple support  Cons: -	Mains Power Adaptor Costs extra. -	Tracks pause between each other. -	MP3 files must be annotated. -	Recharging time is a bit long.

<Content>I've had and enjoyed my mini for a year or so now.  Just bought a nano and A/B'd the sound on the two; same songs, same headphones, same eq settings.  The nano quality is so much better I could hardly believe it. I read the other reviews saying the same and thought to myself, "I doubt I'll notice much" but the difference is quite noticeable.  Its still brand new, but so far I love it.  Only disappointment is that the nano doesn't come with an AC adapter for charging (the mini does).
