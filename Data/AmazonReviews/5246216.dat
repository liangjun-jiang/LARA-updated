<Title>excellent player for the money
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>easy of use, lightweight and simple interface make this player a good contender against the apple analog. I did a little research before buying this puppy, so I can't relate on a comment about the supplied earbuds. I will however mention that the supplied USB cable is only about 3 inches long, so bear this in mind for data transfer and charging if you use the included cable. transfer rates and charging were very good, and I do suggest updating the firmware on your Zen Stone to the latest version since it improves the effiency of charging. once you take the player out of the box, Creative suggests you charge the player right away. I did so in under an hour, then I updated the firmware. once this was completed, I used Creative Media Lite to begin file transfer, and I noticed that my player was once again charging itself. with the stock version of firmware, it had been charged to 100%, but after updating, the device realized it was actually only 85% and continued charging itself to the correct level.  while some people will complain about the load time from startup taking a couple of seconds, this is a small sacrifice for a very good budget 1 GB MP3 player. I had stayed out of buying MP3 players because the price had been too intimidating, but it just got entirely too cumbersome to lug around a CD player anymore. I was quite shocked to see how small this player really is... just a tad larger than a box of matches. so far I have had no problems with it, it is a solid little device and a good deal at the current price.

<Content>Zen player is very portable and light.  I bought the skin to go with it so that it can clip onto my clothes while exercising.  It is a lot less expensive than the ipod and just as functional.

<Title>Creative Zen Stone 1GB - Nice starter or spare MP3
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone 1GB is a nice value in starter MP3 players.  It has the same capacity as the iPod Shuffle at $40.  For $20 more, you can get the 2GB Stone Plus which also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + simple design with more color options  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - below-average battery life of 10 hours or less - software issues - Creative software is buggy - DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable from 1GB (no SD card slot) - no FM tuner or voice recording - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles - for just $20 more you get the 2GB Stone Plus with added features  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  The 1GB Zen Stone is decent but not perfect.  It suffers from quality issues and is really ideal for specific uses.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express nor as cool as an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations.  The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This burns out faster than the old battery operated unit, but is more convenient.  The sound is nice, and it comes through in stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds, which most people replace.  The Zen Stone Plus is the only larger option at 2GB. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/102-4398829-6044943">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Creative has fixed some of the software issues.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Excellent Product
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased 3 of these MP3 players for my 3 daughters (ages 9, 11 & 12) for Christmas.  This was our first experience owning an MP3 player.  It is super easy to use, very small, fits in any pocket.  We drove 4 hours each way to Disney over the weekend, and my hubby and I both agreed it was was most quiet road trip we ever took as a family.  The girls listened to music on their Creative Zen Stone MP3 players, and read books.  They didn't even ask once to put a DVD in the player.  How's that for a good product???  It's awesome and we highly recommend it for 1st time users, and to teach kids the responsibility & care of owning one, before spending more money on a bigger, better model.  Happy New Year everyone!

<Title>Creative Zen Stone a very good buy.
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted an mp3 player for my daughter for Xmas.  I did tons of research and came upon the Creative Zen Stone.  Compared to other mp3 players, this was a great value for the price.  I ordered it, and it was delivered very quickly.  My daughter loves it.  She never leaves home without her mp3 player.  I would definitely recommend this item.

<Title>Works well, but battey life is disappointing
<Date>Sun Jan 27 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a decent, low-priced product. It is so tiny and light that it is great for use when walking/jogging/cycling. My only complaint is the battery life. Using 192kbps WMAs, battery life was a disappointing 2.5-3 hours. Using 64kbps WMAs increased battery life to 8+ hours and allows for a LOT of songs in 1GB. With ear buds and street noise, sound quality isn't great, so trading lower bit rates for longer battery life is acceptable.

<Title>Functional, but limited
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have not used this very much yet, but here's what I can tell you.  For the price it is a good value, but I miss not having some digital readout that tells you what song is playing.  Also miss that you can't just put in a battery when this one goes dead (something I never liked about the ipod)  Also, the major limitation is the volume--it just doesn't get loud enough (I use earbuds) to rock out to the fullest extent.  The good thing is it is tiny--like REALLY tiny.  The battery seems to hold for a while.  You can create subfolders within the file structure and you can skip from file to file (like playlists but not quite as handy because you have to  shuffle through them blind)
