<Title>I love this thing!
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Archos 504 160gb for a couple of months now and I love it.  I did get the one add-on in order to play mp2 files but otherwise it has played everything.  I read somewhere that it wasn't guaranteed to handle avi files but mine have all worked.  I'm no techno wiz when it comes to this stuff and thankfully I don't have to be.  The picture is great, sound awesome (more on that later) and overall I'm totally satisfied.  The other reviews here go over the details of what the unit is like so I'll focus on other aspects that I wished I could find before I made my purchase.  Hope it's helpful.  For add-ons I got the travel adaptor for quick recharging.  It's quicker then using the USB to computer link but I could have skipped this purchase.  I say that because I also got an extra battery & an external charger.  This allows me to charge the battery away from the unit.  Without that capability it's a pain to charge a battery on the unit, then remove it and swap with the other battery and charge it.  This way I always have a fully charged batter & a way to charge the dead one without keeping it connected to the unit.  For all of that I've never actually needed the 2nd battery as the main unit has never been fully depleted.  I also bought the leather case for the 504.  Much better then the case that comes with the unit, which is useless.  The new case allows me to watch the unit while it's in the case, charge it, etc.  It still doesn't have a kickstand for watching but that's a minor point (Correction, it does have a kickstand).  A worthwhile purchase IMO.  And I got an adaptor to allow two sets of earphones to be connected so my son & I can both enjoy this thing while we're on a plane.    As far as sound goes the external speaker is pretty useless.  It is barely audible.  The earbuds that come with are also a pain, but I hate all earbuds.  I considered some Shure ec? units but the cost is nuts.  So I finally settled on some Sennheiser PMX60s and love them.  They were $30 and sit on your ears (neckband types) quite easily.  Love the sound.  If I was buying again I'd consider the 604.  I avoided it because of the 30gb max size.  But now that I own one I realize that you don't really need that much space.  It's not like you need to archive videos on this unit.  That's what your computer hard drive is for.  All you need is enough space for a good 10-20 hours of watching (I mainly use this unit for videos/dvds).  As you watch something you delete it and make room for more.  The Wifi aspect of the 604 would be worth the smaller storage space.  So it's two thumbs up for the 504 and a strong consideration to move up to the 604.  You can't lose, this is a sweet unit.

<Title>Kinda grows on you
<Date>Sat Mar 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Got mine 3 weeks ago. I had a different opinion on the unit; specifically I had to buy the plug-ins but, my opinion has changed. I have become a little more familiar with it and found that it will read other file formats with no additional add-ons. Seems the unit will accomodate all types of video file formats. Most can be transferred directly; others I have to convert and compress. I already had NERO 7 for this task. Still trying to figure out the RM files. The unit itself is solidly built. The side buttons stick up eough to use as a grip to keep it from falling out of your hands. If you plan on watching a recording of your favorite game, while riding a roller coaster, forget it. But if you plan on being stationary, it works fine. I keep trying to remind myself that this is a hard drive and it's subject to damage if used as a walkman so I try to be mindful of my struts when I go for walks. The 504 comes in handy when I visit my local laundromat. I'm still only half way through 'Munich'.

<Title>Excellent feature set
<Date>Thu Mar 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You cannot complain with the feature set supported by the Archos 504. It has 160 GB that should cover most big MP3 collections. It has a phenomenal Video capability. Most importantly, it is not tied to a specific platform such as iTunes. However, this is not a product comparable to the iPod (that's like apples and oranges). It is unwieldy in comparison to an iPod. But it will let you record video directly from external sources (without iTunes/Windows media). The controls are a bit non-standard (though you would find more keys here than in iPod/Creative). The design does not give in to single-handed use like in traffic (might be done with some experience over months?) so you will have to plan ahead for the journey. But the real gotcha is none of the above but the fact that everything from the power charger the fancy case is an accessory for which you have to cough up extra and THAT hurts.

<Title>great product
<Date>Fri Mar 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This baby is a little big for the athlete but as mp3/pmp toys go its awesome. The screen is very high quality, the OS is very user friendly, down and up load times are relatively fast. The one negative thing I have to say about it is that it does not support all file types. The company has made it so you can do firmware updates for free which is great but these updates should include codec/plugins for all video file types. This particular product does not include mpeg 1 or 2 type videos. So you have to go to the Archos website and order a disc (you can't even download it from the site) with the plug-ins. That said everything else about this thing is really great.

<Title>Great player - BUT BE WARNED
<Date>Sun Apr 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am ecstatic about the sound of this player.  I've  compared it to ipod, Sansa, and Creative.  The Creative comes close, but the Archos leaves the others standing still.  This is my 1st portable video device so I don't have a comparison. But a couple of people I know with video ipods love the picture quality.  The 504 is also easy to use. Now, here's the warning which may or may not apply to your situation. It does NOT work with all Plays For Sure services.  I have thousands of tracks on subscription from Napster & Rhapsody that I download for my old player.  They are all useless on the 504.  The files will transfer and play for a day or two, but then they stop playing because the Archos says the files are copy protected.  Of course they are, but I downloaded new files to make SURE the liscenses were current and they still wouldn't play.  (Once you start getting this error message, any new tracks transferred won't even play once.)  The only workaround I've found is to format the hard drive and reload, which works, but after a couple more days the files go dormant again.  This is a BIG time waster, but even more inportantly, you can only transfer the files 3 times every 30 days. So at best you could listen to the files for 1 week a month.  I sent my 1st player back because I though it was defective.  The 2nd player acts the same. Archos tech support, (nice & helpful), told me to use the URGE service from MTV/VH1/CMT.  It's working so far, but obviously this has and will cost me a LOT of time. The unit also will freeze ocassionally, but it's easy to unfreeze.  This doesn't bother me because this is the only player I've been able to find with more than 80 gb, so I'm more than willing to cut some slack.  I've got roughly a thousand cds, plus my subscription tracks. I need the space. Given the storage space, the ease of use, and the melt-in-your-chair sound quality, I didn't feel the Plays For Sure issue and the occassional hang-up were worth deducting a whole star.  My ONLY other issue is when you set up a playlist, you can add by song, album, artist, genre, rating, etc.  But when you view the playlist or want to delete anything from it, this can only be viewed/done track-by-track.  I've put this suggestion in to tech support.  Hopefully it will be a simple firmware upgrade.  Also, if you're going to use this for video, (which I won't do very much), the accessories you need to perform most of it's higher functions are extra $$$.  I know this is a LOOOOOOOOONG review, but it's a lot of money.  The buyer should be informed.

<Title>Nice media player with some minor drawbacks
<Date>Thu Jul 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Nice media player. The screen is very bright and crisp. The keys are a bit hard to get used to, but you can manage after a while. The main drawback is that in order for you to achieve basic functionality with the device (connect it to a TV, charge it in the mains, dump files from USB devices) you have to buy one or several different accessories. To extend the playback capabilities to more file formats you also need to buy more plugins from Archos.  I bought the Docking Adapter and managed to transfer 2GB worth of photos from my Canon EOS to the Archos in a couple of minutes.  Movies have no subtitle support and the sound coming out of the headphones is very faint. There is no way to increase it via equalizer. The built in speaker is almost useless.  The TV recording capabilities were not as expected. The device doesn't have a built in tuner, so in order to record something, you need to connect it to the TV and then the AV Station sends infrared remote signals to your TV or Sat/Cable receiver to change the channels. That means that if you want to record straight from the TV you need to keep it on. You also need to place it towards the device. That means that it needs to be backwards (screen is not visible) in most of living rooms setups.  All in all it's a good device, good to browse pictures, watch movies and listen to some music, despite its minor drawbacks.

<Title>Archos 504 160GB - best thing since sliced bread
<Date>Thu Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It took me the best part of a year to finally part with about $500 but in the end, it was a no brainer. Nothing else has the capacity and it really is pretty easy to use. I also bought the docking station to copy DVDs and TV which certainly helps. I have directv with an HD DVR so I can copy any show or recorded segment to the player and play anything back on the TV. Some DVDs will only play back on the 4.3" screen due to copyright but the idea of a portable player is to watch on the portable player, not on a big screen. The 10 seconds to boot up is not an issue. You know it takes that long so deal with it. A PC or laptop takes a lot longer and everyone accepts it. I have about 1000 CDs, 20 DVDs (music) and 1000 photos on my device and am still burning DVDs. I have about 45GB remaining. It's great to be able to take your music collection with you in the car, to work or on travel. Everyone I've shown it to is impressed. If you're really into your music and have plenty of it, this is the machine for you.

<Title>Abysmal Customer Service
<Date>Fri Aug 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I apologize in advance that I am able to offer no insight whatsoever into this player's capabilities.  You see, mine does not work.  This would be much less a problem if Archos' customer support functioned at all.  Perhaps in this day and age it is too much to ask, but given what I paid for this device, to say nothing of the money you have to sink into accessories before it will do almost anything, it seems reasonable to ask for more.  The only available technical support is a baffling webform on the Archos website, and although they promise a response in two business days, they have never gotten back to me in less than a week.    After some fantastically stupid "support", they finally agreed to fix it.  I sent it to them, they sent it back and absolutely nothing has changed (it has a bad hard drive or processor, hard to say which) and the problem is obvious enough that they clearly did not QA the thing at all before they sent it back.  So now I am getting back on the carousel.  Sigh.  Many of the opinions on here seem well-considered, so you should certainly believe them about functionality.  However, if you buy this and you ever need the company (this is not a $40 disposable player, after all), it will be a sad, sad day for you stretching on into weeks, maybe months.

<Title>So glad I purchased this!
<Date>Mon Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had initially set out intending to just go and buy an iPod video - I had one of the original iPod's which proceeded to break, and then I had the colour photo one which made it to just over a year after I bought it and then decided to stop working. Something inside me said that after two failed products it probably wasn't the best thing to do to fork out some money to Apple for another product that would just give up on me when it felt like it. So I got out there looking for something similar and came across the Archos 504, and BOY am I glad I did.  At the time I purchased this it had been about for a while, and new more advanced models coming out with touch-screen and wi-fi capabilities. However I opted to go with this model for several reasons which I will now outline. Most appealing had to be the fact that the 504 offered 160GB memory which was unparalleled in the other models and any other rival products I had seen. Also I felt that seeing as the 504 had been about for a while any issues that caused problems with it would have been ironed out so I would be purchasing a more reliable product rather than getting something that felt like it still needed some beta-testing. I have to say that I've now owned it for a month and haven't experienced any problems.  Something that was both attractive but also a slight worry with this product was the size of it. It was appealing to have a screen that made videos watchable on the go without any strain being put on you, (having tried out the iPod video I felt this wouldn't have been the case as the screen is WAY smaller than what the 504 offers. However I didn't want a unit that was cumbersome and required a bag to go anywhere with. I am a big guy, so for any lasses out there this wouldn't fit in your pocket - but it fits nicely in mine I will admit which was a huge relief.  I've heard the controls on the unit described as counter-intuitive, and that has to be something I disagree with. I felt the controls made total sense and I still get a thrill of the way the whole thing works together.. it just makes a lot of sense to me. Perhaps I am counter-intuitive in that case? What is a shame is that there's no backlight for the buttons, so when it is dark it is not easy to distinguish which button is which, but I've found after a month you can operate the unit with your eyes closed. The menus in all the different features are very self explanatory I feel and they are easily learned.  The player can handle a lot of video formats, my favourite of which is the DivX playing capability. I have not yet purchased the cinema-plug-in which I fully intend to do because it allows you to play some other useful formats such as .vob from a DVD disk for high and AAC audio. I think this will be a worthwhile plug-in though. I'll be purchasing it soon.  I am so pleased I decided to buy this Archos 504, it was worth the waiting for. I feel like on some occasions it is a little obvious, but it does the perfect job so far  Gav

<Title>VERY SENSITIVE MEDIA PLAYER
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second ARCHOS that I've had and I feel that it needs to be more durable for all the money you shove out to get it. My first one fell out my locker and I definitely accept responsibility for that, but this second one I've bought takes the cake. At first, it was doing fine. No issues. But now, it has shut down and it won't start back up. I went to the site and tried to reset it like the instructions said but that didn't work. So, I sent an email to the ARCHOS site and now I'm awaiting a response. I think I've finally learned my lesson. All that glitters is not gold!!! Beware Buyer, unless you are the type that don't mine spending money or super careful of all your stuff.

<Title>ARCHOS Still Insists on FAT32 Limitations
<Date>Fri Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I would give this product the highest number of stars possible, +1 if they'd just realize that the FAT32 format limitations are extremely annoying!    This portable DVR is among the best for size, quality, ease of use, etc.  Problem is, they insist on keeping the FAT32 limitation -- presumably because they don't want to have to make a separate version for Mac computer users.  What does this FAT32 limit mean?  If you have a movie that is longer than 2 hours, or you want DVD quality of any show longer than 1 hour, the protocol causes the file to split because of the 2 gb file size limit. In other words, if you take a movie like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (which my kids love) and want it in DVD quality, the file will actually split TWO TIMES.  How frustrating when you're watching the movie and have to wait while it closes file #1 and opens #2, then does it again for file #3.  Yes, you CAN configure the Archos to automatically open the next file in a folder/subdirectory, but there's still the time lapse and annoyance.  Sure would be more than willing to pay a little more for a device that is NTFS -- so this annoying, outmoded/outdated protocol and it's limitations are removed!    Great, by the way, for using as a travel companion on airlines and in hotel rooms!
