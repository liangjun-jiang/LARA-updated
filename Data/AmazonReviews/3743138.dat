<Title>Good for on-the-go!
<Date>Sat Nov 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this item with low expectations but overall I am very pleased with my purchase. I wanted a small and affordable MP3 player that I could take with me to work out at the Gym. I have a Ipod Nano but I didn't want to risk it at the Gym. This player clips to my shirt when I am working out, or walking, jogging, etc. You have to be careful with the clip on feature because as you can see from the picture the surface is very smooth. The inside of the clip is smooth as well with the exception of a male/female dimple. If you do a lot of jumping causing the player to bounce on your shirt then the smooth surface of the inside of the clip allows the clip to slide off. This doesn't seem to affect the clip while running but jumping jacks or jump rope may cause the player to un-clip itself. Since the player is light weight if it does fall off the headphones will prevent it from falling too far usually. The player is very simple featuring continuous playback or random. It supports MP3 and WMA but not AAC or Apple's Format.

<Title>son loves it
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally gave in and bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas. It was advertised to hold 500 songs which I thought was more than enough. At first I was a little concerned because of its size (resembles a binder clip) and was very afraid that my son would lose it after a week. I was also very concerned that I would have a problem loading songs (friends have shared horror stories of having to load special software-- complete with trojan viruses-- and running into all sorts of problems loading songs.) Well, the clip is certainly a nice feature for my son since sometimes he wears sweatpants and the clip nicely secures the player to his waistband. And I do not consider myself a techological wizard, so I was pleasantly surprised that adding songs was as easy as saving files to a flashstick. The directions were fairly clear and concise. The package came with everything I needed to set it up. Keep in mind, this is a bare-bones, no frills mp3 player.  It doesnt tell you how many songs you have loaded (unless you hook it back up to the computer and view the files) and we're still trying to figure out how long the battery will actually hold a charge (we noticed that when the player is powered off, we have had a few issues turning it back on and have had to 'plug it into the computer' to recharge it again.)  I'm sure its operator error and we'll figure it out. Anyway, it's a good excuse to remove it from my son's hands for a while. Overall, we are very happy with the player, and intend on getting another for my husband for his birthday.

<Title>great if first one, not for current I-POD owners
<Date>Mon Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this as an inexpensive replacement for my daughter when her IPOD shuffle was stolen.  Bad mistake.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice little mp3 player.  The problem is that all of my daughter's music is under I-Tunes, which formats music that you legitimately own in such a way that you can only copy the music over to an IPOD.  Anything that's not an IPOD will read the music as copywrited and will not play the music.  If you're not using I-Tunes, buy this, you'll like it.  If you already use I-Tunes, don't buy this.

<Title>had some problems, decent player
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This works pretty well as a decent no-frills player.  I had some problems with the player not turning on after a while, even though the battery should have remain charged.  If I then attached it to a USB port for even less than one second, then it would function again (I could turn on and off, player would play for a long time).  After an overnight, then it would not work again until plugged in.  It was definitely not a battery charge problem.  Customer support advised reformatting the drive (right-click on the drive when in windows explorer) and reinstalling songs.  So far this solution has worked.  There is also a reset switch to try (which I don't think worked in my case.)  They also advised to make sure you "safely remove hardware" when removing from USB port (click lower right menu) to avoid messing up the device.  the instruction manual does not contain any information about troubleshooting.  After more experience with the player, it appears that it does not hold a charge very long if the player has not been used for a couple of days.  I have not tested whether you get close to 5 hours immediately after a full charge, but I know for sure that you do not get even close to that if you try using the player a couple of days after doing a full charge.

<Content>This is a great product I am thinking of ordering another one. It charges fast holds a lot and is very light to carry. I have an ipod which holds lots but compared to this is like a dinosaur in size

<Title>Love/Hate...Mostly Hate
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I first bought this little player, it had a lot going for it. I didn't have to worry about installing software or trying to install something on an outdated operating system (I'm still running on Windows ME, because I hate myself). Not only did it come with a headphone adapter (to go from a 2.5 to 3.5 size set of headphones) and was suspiciously cheap (a 1GB player for $25.00), all I had to do was plug it in, let it charge, and drag and drop music files, as this was pretty much a glorified flash drive. Honestly, I just needed something basic, so I wasn't worried about display screens, FM tuners, recording features, or the ability to move forward or backward through individual tracks, all of which are nice to have, but not strictly necessary. I just wanted something to play music on the go. It was perfect for me. It was great.   Until I realised how badly it was designed.   Within ten minutes of opening it, I lost the headphone adapter, and apparently, after going to four different stores, not only did no one sell headphone adapters, not a single salesperson knew what I was talking about. That was a big surprise, and when I realised I had lost the adapter, I sincerely did not think it would be such an issue. Annoyed, I told myself I'd just get around to ordering one online. Until then, I'd just suck it up and use the annoying earbuds that came with the player.  And then, within the first two days of use, the buttons got jammed against each other, rendering me unable to use the forward button. After the headphone adapter debacle, the last thing I wanted to deal with was going back to the store and dealing with incompetent salespeople, so I just plied it off and used my thumbnail to press directly on the little metal nub on the circuitboard. And then the rewind button jammed. I just plucked that one off too. Eventually, I just ripped all three buttons off, leaving my player naked. Thankfully, it continued to work just fine. For about a month. When it just...stopped doing anything. It froze when I tried to fast forward to the next track and shut itself off. At first, I thought it was a power issue, but I was able to turn it right back on again. The exact same thing happened. I turned it on again, and it froze in the middle of the track, the power button on, but completely paralyzed. I tried using a bit of wire to press the reset button inside the player, but felt nothing. I could feel the tip of the wire pressing up against the opposite side of the player's plastic case, no reset button to be found. Recharging it did nothing, seeing as the computer refuses to acknowledge its existence, so I couldn't even try reformatting it. Now the battery is dead, won't recharge, the computer doesn't recognize the hardware, and I'm out $25.00. Even something that cheap should work for more than a month. Am I wrong here? I really wish I had read customer reviews before buying this thing; I could not believe how many people were experiencing the same or similar issues. You get what you pay for, I suppose.
