<Title>Horrible...
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>don't even bother!    It keeps freezing up, turning off, and won't sync with any of my mp3s.  Samsung was very unhelpful and said that it was "a Windows/Microsoft problem" when I reported when the device was starting to sync, then caused Windows Media Player to shut down (on 2 seperate systems!) entirely and then the USB cord is faulty, saying that it is unplugged when it is not.    Instructions were incomplete and shoddy.    Try a Zen player or a Rio.  Those at least work right out of the box, plug in the USB, and you're off.

<Date>Tue Jan 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Even though this MP3 isnt perfect, its good for the price. what other 5gb mp3 player can you get for $80? had some problems when syncing because its unclear how to do it, but the mp3 player portion of it is good.

<Title>samsung refurb
<Date>Sat Mar 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my second purchase of this model, the first one was new. I lost my cord and had no way to recharge and this was actually the cheaper way to go. I was a little worried about buying refurb, but it worked out fine. Mine did freeze up as well, but that is because Wind media player wanted to download everything at once. I might suggest that if you have problems with it freezing there is a reset button on the back that you can push in. You will lose all of your music but it does save the hassle of fighting with samsung to return it. Once it is working it works great, my only complaint is not long enough battery life (apx 8 hrs). That said there are numerous mp3 players that you can buy new with longer battery life and apx the same price as refurb.

<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased one and received it, it never worked right.  I received a replacement and have had the same problem.  I think this model is a waste of money unless they fix the bugs.  It just keeps saying you have to repair the disk with software that does not come with it.

<Title>Garbage
<Date>Sat May 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this mp3 player and it worked great out of the box.  I didn't have any problems synching music.  The sound was fine I replaced the ear-buds as son as I got it and I was quite happy with it.  About 2 months after I got it things started to go wrong. It would have a system error for no apparent reason and I couldn't get it to work unless I reset the device.  I upgraded the firmware, re-formatted, called samsung and tried every possible solution to get the thing to work again.  In the end I wound up getting another mp3 player from a different manufacturer.  I really liked this player when it worked.  I would strongly recommend not buying this mp3 player it is a waste of money and time.

<Content>I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT. THE SOUND IS GREAT AND IT IS SMALL AND EASY TO USE. HOWEVER I DID FIND IT DISAPPOINTING THAT THE LCD PANEL LOOKS AS THOUGH WHOMEVER HAD IT BRIEFLY STABBED IT WITH A PENCIL. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SAMSUNG WOULD HAVE REFURBISHED THAT PART AS WELL.  IT HAS PUT ME OFF REFURBISHED ITEMS AS THIS IS MY ONLY EXPERIENCE. I DID RECIEVE MY PLAYER IN A TIMELY MANNER AND INTEND TO KEEP IT- JUST AN FYI TO OTHER SHOPPERS.  THE ITEM MAY NOT BE IN THE SHAPE YOU EXPECT IF IT IS REFURBISHED.

<Title>good samsung mp3 player
<Date>Sat Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I really like this product. I also have used an ipod mini and a creative zen micro. I enjoyed both of those as well, but this one has proved to be the most durable of the three. And I love the color screen and handy belt clip. The design allows for quick and easy song finding...much better than the other two mp3's I've tried out. The battery life is good, songs easily and quickly transfer to the device, and the sound quality is great. I'm very pleased with the quality and price of this player.

<Title>Defective Mp3
<Date>Sun Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I receive my Mp3 player on tuesday jan. 7th, wasted hours downloading all my songs.  The next day my Mp3 did not even worked.  I called Samsung and they informed me the Mp3 player is defective.  So now I have to pay for shipping and send it to samsung and wait an additional week and waste more time downloading the same music. The Remanufactured price is great, but all the wasted time????? When I contacted sumsung, they informed YH-820MC 5 GB digital audio player has been stopped, due the problems on the hard drive and they are no longer making anymore.

<Title>The Good, bad and ugly 
<Date>Sat Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have recently purchased a remanufactured MP3 player from Samsung. I have no real complaints or anything negative to say about the unit. I paid about $130 for the unit and for a 5 meg unit it is great. I do not care for the sound out of the earbuds and I wish the unit had a equalizer. This feature would be much easier to use that the SRS. I feel the unit is a tad on the heavy side while running or biking but what the heck, it was only $130. I have had the earbuds replaced through Samsung. I can only say that was a never ending problem, I had long wait times, the wanted my sales slip and the warranty paperwork. Wow, did they want my underwear size too??? About 3 phone calls to get new earbuds.    The unit is easy to use and songs are very easy to up load. I have run about 3 full charges through the unit and 8 hrs seems to be the max on the batteries.   But for the most part. I would recommend the unit as I have not had problems and 5 meg is a ton of space on a small unit and at $130 for the remanned unit it is a steal of a deal.

<Title>from one extreme to the other...
<Date>Tue Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This product, at first, put me through a living hell! Not so much the product, but the manual that samsung sends along with it and the napster program that must be used to put music on it. Very complicated at first. Many very important details are left out. But once you get them figured out this product is DEFINETLY worth the money. you are not going to find anything comparable within 100 bucks give or take... Granted there are some minor scratches here and there, but its about the music right?   Some hints about the player and napster to possibly help you avoid problems... - in order to use the recovery utilities, be holding the players Fast forward button when u hook it up to your computer.(player must also be off prior to connection) - In order to get all of your music on your player how you would like it, u must drag all of it to the all music folder under the samsung icon. Do not drag it to the box or just the samsung icon... it will put it all on a napster playlist...  - if u decide to format your device, you will need to download the firmware for it... just google it...

<Title>URGENT MESSAGE!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Sat May 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this product for its price and to replace a faulty gift.  Atfirst this product worked great but the it started acting up.  For instance it is said to be a hard drive device well it is not!  And then about a week after I got it the device would not boot up.  I called Samsung and they told me to send it back to them for replacement and I did and I got it back 4 weeks later when it was suposed to be 2.  Now I am not able to add songs to the new one and so I have sent it back a second time.  After all this I found out that they are only able to refund you after 2 replacements.  Bad product all around so DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!
