<Title>No Good - Randomly Stops Playing - Going Back
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Player stops playing songs randomly. No rhyme or reason, just stops. You have to hit play twice and the song starts where it left off. FM radio works very well, it's too bad it has bugs. I am returning mine and will try a different brand.

<Title>Creative Zen player
<Date>Fri Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Just an absolutely incredible product.  As a musician it is what I was looking for.  It plays with excellent fidelity, records from the internal mike with clarity, records faithfully from the line in jack. Has enough capacity to allow me to carry all the info and music I need to and from gigs.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone wanting a reasonably priced recorder/player.

<Title>Great Music Player; Not So Great Video Player
<Date>Sat Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Compared to the competition in its price range, this a very good choice for a music player.  It's small and light, and the interface is intuitive and easy to set up and customize.  The OLED display is visible from any angle, but is dim in outdoor lighting.  The display is not very sharp, so this is really not a good player for photos and video.  However, the audio is way above average once you replace the included earbuds with something better.  It has lots of EQ settings and a good FM radio, and the included Creative MediaSource Organizer software makes loading of tracks and set-up of playlists quite easy.  I listen to a lot of podcasts and was disappointed with the included Zencast software, but found that if you turn on the MediaSource "media sniffing" function it will automatically find podcasts in my iTunes library (iTunes makes podcast subscriptions ever so easy) and they can be readily dragged and dropped into the Zen.  As noted in other reviews, USB charging from a computer does take a lot longer than it should, but if you have a USB wall charger it goes much faster.  I don't think I would buy another one of these, but overall I am fairly happy with it for music and podcasts.

<Title>Is there a real user manual for this thing?
<Date>Sun Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Okay, this is my first mp3 player, so maybe they're all this user-unfriendly. If so, let me know. There is a serious lack of information available for the operation of this unit. The user manual does not supply it. So you're left to figure it out for yourself. First of all, I'm able to download stuff, (except for the five songs I bought on Itunes for 99 cents each), so I'm using it. But you must find out by trial and error how to use the thing. I'm used to devices picking up where you left off when you stop it. But if you don't save your place in a book or podcast, if you don't unpause the unit by the time you're time runs out and the unit shuts down, you have lost your place!! Why doesn't it pick up where you leave off automatically? Are ALL mp3 players like this? If you're interrupted and don't have the 20 seconds or so to save your place, in a bookmark, you're screwed.  Next, to get from menu to menu, you must push the proper buttons in the correct order, which you learn by trial and error, and must press them for the proper length of time (!) or you can also lose your place.   You must also NOT press certain buttons or you'll lose your place. For instance, if you are listening to a book, and happen to press BACK on the tiny joystick, it will exit playing and take you to a previous chapter or even the start of the book!  I'm sorry, but I'm used to cassette players and CD players and I've never had to be so careful in pressing a button on a player before. Are ALL mp3 players like this?  And there is no help from the user manual. None. Not even online.  You're on your own.   This is only the beginning. I have no idea how to make a playlist. And there is no information on how to do so. Not on the Creative site. If someone out there knows of where I can get this information, please let me know. The menu system is clumsy and unfriendly. Everything about the unit is clumsy and unfriendly.   I may buy an apple ipod if I find it is more user-friendly, and just use this unit for....   I have given it 2 stars because at least it works, but I'm not happy with it.

<Title>Love it!
<Date>Sun Dec 31 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had a Creative Labs Muvo2 and loved it.  Unfortunately, the hard drive fried after the warranty expired, and I was infuriated by CL's policy of charging for tech support calls.  I swore I would never buy another CL product.  I did a lot of research before buying a replacement and considered the iPod Nano and Zune.  Finally, with my Christmas money in hand, I went to Circuit City, ready to buy an iPod.  I asked the salesperson which mp3 player he had, and he told me he had the Zen V+.  I asked why, and he said that, for the money, it was the best player on the market, and includes a radio, video capability, photos and a huge capacity for storing music files.  He was so enthused that I figured I had nothing to lose.   I brought it home, set it up and was amazed at how intuitive the software was.  I loaded ten CDs in rapid order and downloaded all of my music.  Within two hours I was groovin' to my entire Taylor Hicks download collection (I'm a Hicks fan, what can I say!)  The FM tuner picks up my favorite R&B station, which doesn't always come in even on the best stereo.   I highly recommend this little player.

<Title>AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! unbelivably better than the ipod... but...
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is an awesome mp3 player, except it has a few problems...  Pros: brilliant color screen makes it easy to see what you are doing, even if you are using it outside where there is a huge glare  I dont care what people say about the stupid thumb navigation being too small... its fine. if I made the mp3 player, I would have chosen a different mechanism to scroll and stuff... but there is no real problem with it  Look at the size of this thing!!!! its TINY!!! its AWESOME!!!    Cons: i have had it for 3 weeks and it has frozen 4 times. 3 out of the 4 times, I very simply resseted it and it was fine, not really a problem unless you don't have a small paperclip.   Here's the big con you have been waiting for: one of the times it froze, I reseted it and it turned on again and it looked fine, until it froze again. OH NO! I repeated the process of finding a small paperclip and reseted it. IT FROZE AGAIN WITHIN SECONDS OF ME TURNING IT ON!!!! i repeated this process many times, but it was no use. I emailed the creative labs support thingy and they gave me a simple solution. Here it is if this happens to you. reset it, and when you turn it on, it will go through the regular startup screens of the creative symbol, and saying Zen V Plus. When it says the creative symbol, hold down the play button and a "recovery menu" comes up run the "cleanup" and then "reboot". it worked for me, so it should work for you.  last couple of cons:  video is bad because of the small screen  line in encoding is hard to use  Thats all for now!

<Title>Here's the Major Problem.........
<Date>Thu Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software doesn't work, the computer doesn't recognize the unit... .these can all be fixed.  I have had my Zen since October, and like everyone else I initially fell in love with it.  I really loved the fact that I could download all my 2-year-olds music to make car trips so much easier!  I loved the size, the Outlook sync feature, and the FM tuner.  However, it does keep freezing up when you disconnect it from a power source.  And this time putting a tiny pin in the reset hole to hit the hidden button won't do anything.  It won't shut off, and it's frozen on the beginning screen- it won't go anywhere else, won't hook up with the computer, and repeated attempts to reset are not working.  It's very frustrating to not be able to access the reset button- one reason I think I will be moving over to the tried and true Ipod.  Creative really needs to work on this major design flaw!  Don't buy this unless you want to be really frustrated!

<Title>Very Nice Little Gadget
<Date>Fri Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 player for my wife after owning the 30GB Creative Zen Vision:M for a year. I am a fan of  Creative products and the Zen V Plus is another great one. It is really a neat looking player with a very nice looking display that is crisp. The navigation is simple to use although the little joystick is a bit tricky to get use to. I highly recommend this product both on style & function. One other bonus is that your music can be encoded using .wma format which can reduce the files sizes significantly (about 40% or so) allowing you to fit more music on it. My only complaint is that, as is typical with all non-iPod players, the accessories for the Zen V Plus (and Vision:M) are very limited and the provided software takes some time to configure properly to sync with your computer.

<Content>I first saw the Zen V Plus in Glamour Magazine, and thought, "interesting, I wonder how it compares to the ipod". My brother got it for me this past Christmas, and now I don't go anywhere without it. I love the size and how idiot proof it is...i'm not very smart when it comes to gadgets, but even the downloading cds on to it is childs play. The only downside is, the first time i used it, it froze on me and I had to wait for the battery to die to get it to work. Other than that, its great. And it hasn't happened since. Buy this product! Its worth every penny you spend on it.

<Title>Definitely one of the best MP3 players out there
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Creative Zen V Plus after browsing through what seemed like hundreds of MP3 players, either flash based or hard drive based. I read reviews everywhere too and finally decided on this product. After a month of using it, I have no complaints whatsoever - all my music, videos, and pics are easily transported onto my player, and the sound is GREAT! I would definitely suggest buying a new set of headphones though; the ones attached aren't that great and probably won't fit your ears.  The FM feature is great too! Of course the reception depends on where you live and where you're located. But generally it gets good reception - unless you're in a cave or something.  The screen is definitely nice, and the menus are really easy to navigate. You won't regret buying this product!

<Title>Terrible Documentation
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Physically attractive, with many interesting features, the Zen suffers from serious limitations.  Most significant, the documentation is grossly inadequate and fails to set forth how to utilize many of the most important features. For example, nowhere is it seen that in order to enable the resume feature when listening to an audio book, you have to shut down the unit. And nowhere does it indicate how to shut down the unit. Scrolling ahead and back is also a problem. If not done very carefully, the unit freezes and must be rebooted. The earphone  connection is poor, often requiring jiggling to restore sound in both ears. The Ipod is a far superior unit. The only advantage of the Zen is its ability to use items downloaded from the public library. The Zen is a major disappointment.

<Title>Great Buy for 1st MP3, Great for Books & Music & More
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I love my Zen V Plus 4 GB.  I wanted a durable MP3 for work outs/travel and this little guy has lived up my wishes.  I wanted an MP3 that would work for audio books as well as great music. The bookmarking works well if you have a 12 hour recorded book with no chapter or time breaks.  Music is rich and clear.  The FM radio was an added bonus that I use more than I thought I would.  Small screen is clear and bright with amazing resolution.  Downloading my Microsoft Outlook contacts was a snap.  The firm ware has froze up a couple of times but a hard reset with a small straight pin has never lost any data.  Only negative would be the lack of ANY kind of user guide.  I spent more time surfing for a manual than I should have.  If you just play with unit most features are found quickly.  Hint: hold down the back arrow and several bookmarking, play modes and creating play lists are avalible.  I hope this rechargeable battery last more that 2 years but time will only tell.  Great buy for the money spent(code for "I think iPods are way over rated for the price").

<Title>Outstanding portable recorder... with one major flaw.
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If you have old tapes and records you would like to be able to archive, put into your computer or other MP3 player, and/or burn CD copies of, this is the the portable media player/ recorder for you...but it has one MAJOR flaw*  A line in jack (odd 2.5mm, but adaptable) is a very rare thing on a portable media player/ recorder, and this has one...add to that it's VU meters and it's close to perfect for making digital copies of any audio source including your old analog recordings. That's right it actually has a line in jack AND VU meters..how sweet is that? With an adapter ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3GPIS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0917478-0089613">Audio Adapter - Rca - Mini-phone Stereo 3.5 Mm (m)</a> ) you can jack it right in to your stereo system..with the included 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable you can jack into anything with a standard stereo 3.5mm headphone/ output jack.  Recoding is encoded at 128 or 160Kbps MP3..ok so it.s not high end top  notch audio, but it's just fine for cassettes,LPs, 45s, radio, and yes even your old 8-track cartridges. 320 Kbps would have been better, but 160 is adequate.  It also has a built in mono microphone that makes decent sounding recordings.  ..and yes it'll play your audio and video files, and display pictures too... just like everything else, bla, bla ,bla. Nothing new there.  Audio output is not very loud, but it does have a real user adjustable five band equalizer.  Battery life is about 9-12 hrs...Uh... battery..battery...WHERE'S THE BATTERY?  * THE BATTERY IS NOT USER REPLACEABLE. IMHO that's inexcusable. When it goes dead on you and you're away from home you're sunk. Likewise when it'll no longer hold a charge. The only way to replace the battery is to literally pry the case apart or have it replaced by a technician!  As a recorder I'd give it an 8/10.  As a portable media player I'd give it 2/10 because of the battery issue alone...where it not for that I'd say 7/10.. sounds good for what it is, but I wish it had more output power.

<Title>Good player for audiobooks
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I use my mp3 players for listening to audiobooks & podcasts, and I'm trying to find "just the right one".  I've been using this one for a month now, and it's turning out to be my favorite so far. As I've found with the many players I've tried, there seems to be no commonality to these things but the power switch.  This player works with Overdrive books from the library and books from audible.com.  I haven't tried Netlibrary, but think it would be good there as well.    Documentation provided for its use is dismal; you need to be willing to spend time and just figure out on your own how things work.  You can find help in the user forums here at Amazon, or the Creative forums.  An installation CD is included with the player with lots of horrible warnings: "DO NOT connect your player to your computer before setting up the software."  Interestingly enough, further along in the booklet, it is mentioned how to use the player with a computer that doesn't have the software installed.  Since I don't like to install all these specialty programs if I can help it, I've found this player will work just fine without the Creative software - Windows Media Player will work with it fine.  Overdrive and Audible each have their own programs that you need to get their books, and they will handle the transfers to the player.  Suggest you try with or without the special software and see which you find works best for you.  The player has a bookmarking function, something that is really necessary for audiobooks, not so much with music. The bookmarks, however, are not at all intuitive to use, and figuring them out took several visits to the forums mentioned above.  Now that I know how to use them, I still find times when I have to make more than one try to get it done.  The good news is, I'm finding it's not really necessary to bookmark all that often.  When listening to a book, if you just turn the player off (without pausing first), when you next turn it on it will resume playing from the point at which it was powered down.  So unless you want to listen to part of one book, then go on to listen to something else, bookmarks aren't necessary.    The battery life for a fully charged player seems to be only about 8-10 hours, which is a bit shorter than I'd like, but it's OK.  The player has a little "joystick" for navigating around the menus - I've seen reviews that don't like this, but I do like it.  It's easy to navigate with. The screen is nice and readable.  Since I don't store photos or watch videos, I can't comment on those aspects of the player except to say it's supposed to do them.    Main things I like:  4GB storage, a nice amount for carrying several books with me to listen to.  Nice readable screen, easy to navigate to what I want to hear.  Bookmarks if I need them.  When turned off, resumes at where you were - also keeps the volume at the same level (I have another player that always returns to its preset volume which is higher than I like when turned off then back on - that's annoying). Small size, nice looking player.  I still feel that I'm in the learning stage with this player, but feel I've discovered the main things I need to know.

<Title>Good value player, but wasn't as flexible as I hoped.
<Date>Sat Feb 16 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very nice little player. It's easy to hold and does a lot for the money.  However, I hoped to be able to use it without special software, just drag and drop folders to the device.  While you can drag songs from your hard drive to the player, your folder structure isn't retained when you navigate the music on the device - you just get a long list. If you want to make "folder-y" playlists, you have to use software to do that, either the software that comes with it or sync with Windows Media or the like.  Not what I was hoping for.  It is possible to create playlists using the device itself but the process is rather tedious.  If you like Windows Media player and managing your music and playlists with that, this will work perfectly for you.  The sound is good, and the line recording feature is great.

<Title>Died After 10 mins of use
<Date>Tue Jan 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been waiting for years since the mp3 craze started to find the one that was just right for me before purchasing.  The Zen V Plus has all the features that I wanted.  So right out of the box I downloaded about 1 gig worth of my mp3s to listen to it on my commute to work.  I listened to what I downloaded for about 1 min to make sure it was transferred ok.  Seemed great.  The next morning after 5 more minutes of use I heard these REALLY DANGEROUSLY LOUD high pitched chirping sounds while the music was playing.  Then the player just froze.  I reset it and it shut off ok, but then on restart it would always freeze on start up.  I contacted their customer support and they told me to reinstall the  latest driver, firmware, and application s/w.  I tried to do that, but when reinstalling the firmware the player simply freezes also.  Customer service people told me that I must have did something wrong and could send it back if I pay for shipping and if they found it was a problem I could have fixed they would charge me. Perhaps I just got a player w/ some corrupted memory, and I could probably get it working if I tried long enough, since I am a computer expert, but I really don't have time in my schedule to devote to fixing a product that should be working right out of the box.  Thankfully I bought it from amazon and returning it was simple.  Granted it would be a great product (way better than the Ipod) if it worked.  But from all the reviews I've read I'm not the only one having this problem so there is something wrong w/ their quality control at creative. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.

<Title>Awesome MP3 Player
<Date>Wed Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I always research a product before I buy it if it's a purchase over $100. The only two bad things that I could even slightly be picky about:  1. The small screen which would make it hard to watch videos (a feature I've yet to try since it is a mp3 player, not a DVD player.)  2. The Zen freezing and having to be reset.  The latter almost dissuaded me from buying this player. After reading about how often and how difficult it was for some to reset I got scared. But, I took the plunge since it was the only REAL drawback and if that did happen, I could always get refunded. Well, I've had my player for about a week now, and it's frozen twice (after disconnecting from the computer). Resetting it was simple. The first time I took a sewing needle, stuck it in the hole and reset. The second time I was at work and used a paper clip to reset it. The hole is so small that you can't help but to hit the button correctly. After resetting, the library rebuilt itself and continued playback like nothing had happened. Not a real drawback, IMHO.  4 of my friends have the Ipod Nano which cost about $60 more than mine while having less features. 3 out of the 4 envy my Zen. The line-in encoding is nice, though I wish it pulled the track information instead of just labeling it "Line In Recording (Date)". The FM Radio works very well. The customizable backgrounds, I love it. And the simple "drag and drop" or just "sending it to" the player for your files on the computer... couldn't be better.  I'm thoroughly and impressed and satisfied with my player for the money.  Not to mention, it looks better than the Ipod and it's scratch resistant. Just what I need. (Though, I have the leather carrying case. So cute!)

<Content>The Zen V Plus is very small yet packed with tons of computer power. I would say it rivals quite well with the Ipod Nano. I love the brilliant display, the pictures option for wallpapers, the built-in FM radio, and the durability as it is very compact.

<Title>Good product except freezed in a week
<Date>Thu Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This's my first mp3 player. I purchase this one because it's the only flash memory based mp3 player that has bookmark capability. Listening to downloaded audio book is my main purpose.  Menu is easy. Some functionalities need to read PC installed manual to figure out, such as how to setup bookmark.   Problem is it stops working yesterday, five days after I bought it. First it froze, no button works. It recovered after I pushed reset button using a pin. In a few hours, it froze again. This time, reset is not able to bring it back. As soon as the screen is on, it froze, no matter how many times I tried. The thing I did yesterday is loading about 2G music into the player. It might have some issue when loaded with too much music, but, hey, it's a 4G player.

<Title>Nano Trump card
<Date>Fri Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The other reviews covered most of what you would want to know if you were considering this player, I'll breifly express my opinion and include some technical details not found in the other reviews.  This player is amazingly robust, small, and sexy.  Having owned an Apple Nano prior I really appreciate this players "stance" of being shorter and thicker.  The unit is about twice as thick as a Nano, but less then half the height.  For me with larger hands this unit is much easier to operate.  Some people complained about having to reset their unit, having had this for 2 months now I've never had a problem.    Technically, the unit stores the location of several songs and movies you've been listening to in its memory.  This is great for videos and podcasts where you may have to put down the device inbetween listenings.  The syncing software works well with the exception of some video's you have to convert first before putting on the player. the included Zencast software (for subscribing to podcasts etc.) works very well and also allows you to sync within it.  Finally you can also use the device as media storage device for other files if desired.  The ability to throw music (and charge) the player on any PC is a huge advantage of this player (and other non-Apple products), I'm grateful to get away from the lock-in that is Itunes.

<Content>I love this MP3!  It is small and easy to use.  We now have two in our house and will order another.  It is easy to load the music, create playlists and use the player.  Color on screen is great and I love that there is a radio on it too.  Sometimes it is nice to listen to that.  Another great Creative MP3

<Title>Another broken player...
<Date>Fri Jan 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After following startup directions exactly, charging for the requisite 6 hours, using the Creative software installed on my computer, my 4GB Creative Zen Plus froze repeatedly during playback.  Today, when trying to shut it down, the entire device froze.  Tried to restart it, followed the steps to reset it... no luck.  Now, I can't even get it to turn back on and there was power left in the battery.  Am returning to Amazon with regret and will look for a different kind of player.  Also, a note to other potential buyers, the black player ends up getting fingerprints all over it and looking generally greasy from the oils or lotion on your hand.

<Title>Be warned
<Date>Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased 3 of these players b4 xmas for my kids on the recomendation of the worker at walmart(big mistake,I know).All 3 of them have had major problems.I am so pissed about these players that I am writing my first product review ever.Player 1 had a firmware crash on day 1 (Christmas)!It went into recovery mode and couldn'nt get out of it.Luckily I was just within the time limit to take it back to walmart for a refund.I wish I had just taken them all back.Less than a month later, the on/off button on player 2 pops off and won't go back on.So now my daughter gets to turn it on and off with a pen tip. Now this morning,35 days after opening, my other daughter tells me her players firmware crashed(player 3)!Again,can't get it out of recovery mode. I search the web and find a link in a forum about mp3 players.It took me to a recovery tool from creative for this problem.I run the program,and it gets the player working again but there was an error on their site so the program wouldn't complete! Now when you turn it on it has to rebuild the library every time.Custom settings reset every time. What a pain! As you can tell I do not like this product. These are just the major problems.If you are buying this product to save a few bucks over the competition, you should also know that the headphones that come with this player are horrible.You will spend another $30+ for a decent set. I replaced player 1 that I took back to walmart with a sony walkman that I ordered on amazon.Oh my God,the difference in quality was amazing!From the look,feel,and above all the sound,sony really came through.The screen is bigger,the headphones sound great and the buttons are sturdy and easy to use,and it wasn't much more money!In closing, don't make the same mistake as I did.Educate yourself on what is available b4 buying.

<Title>Great design, but a lot of bugs, poor quality, and warranty repair costs 1/3 as much as a new player
<Date>Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: Great design Really like the design of the software Great features, if they only worked Small size  Cons: Poor quality Many bugs involve daily resetting Warranty repairs(3 months after purchase) are 35% the new price, and that is full warranty coverage per Creative Labs. Customer Service... felt like the service a bull gives a cow Need to buy ear buds as the one with it are the 10 cent ones  Life of my Zen V Plus: The resetting was a pain, but tolerable since I constantly made sure I bookmarked the location and could easily get back to it (Audio books).  The ear buds are junk as are most you get with players.  Eventually, the player screen slowly faded over a few days and then stopped working after just over 3 months of owning it.  I had been careful and knew it had never been damaged or even dropped.  It was always in padded plastic case.  I call Creative for the warranty and this is where it got really bad.  It took 2 weeks just to get a RMA from creative to send it to them for warranty repairs.  I sent it with all the info.  They then contacted me 2 weeks later and said they hadn't gotten the receipt.  So I faxed another copy of it.  They said it didn't come through.  Long story short 3 more faxes from different fax machines, 4 times e-mailing it as an attachment as an .mdi, .pdf, and .jpg file and then screenshots of circuit city's order history page and they finally got it.  A few days later I get an e-mail requesting I call and provide payment for handling and diagnosis before they'll even look at it.  I looked at my warranty and saw it said nothing about having to pay for anything, but shipping to them.  They have clarified that it did say I wouldn't have to pay anything.  I am now stuck deciding if I want to pay half the cost to get a new one or suck up my loss and go get a different player.

<Title>Weird static-sounding background noise between tracks
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>When I bought this I was really impressed with the fact that the buttons are really quiet. There's nothing more annoying than being at the library and being able to hear every little click on someone's phone or mp3 player.   So, I decided to plug my headphones in and listen to the sample music, just to see what it was like while playing music. At first the sound quality was great, not knock-my-socks-off but very impressive. However, as soon as I shifted to the next track I heard... a strange noise. No, not a beep from the player. Not cell phone interference. Just... noise. Sort of like a record before the music plays, but a little more electronic. I thought that maybe this was just a bug, but then I switched to the next track and the next. Same thing.  I'm not that picky when it comes to mp3 players, but it should be a given that the player performs the function of playing mp3s well. It doesn't. I am returning this tomorrow.   Note: I had the old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CS7U1C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-0917478-0089613">Creative Zen Vision: M</a> and it worked great. It didn't make weird noises when I changed tracks, and really that's the bare minimum when it comes to mp3 players.

<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT WILL BREAK WITHIN 6 MONTHS.  THE SCREEN WILL JUST DIE AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO FIX IT. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU TAKE CARE OF IT OR NOT, IT WILL JUST NATURALLY BREAK. IT IS SOMESORT OF PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS MP3. THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR MP3 IF YOU BUY IT.  BUY AN IPOD, SANSA, A ZUNE, IT DOES NOT MATTER, AS LONG AS IT IS NOT THIS.  ALSO, PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY CREATIVE PRODUCTS BECAUSE I ALSO BOUGHT HEADPHONES THAT DID NOT WORK.  I REPEAT THIS PRODUCT WILL BREAK.  THIS DID NOT JUST HAPPEN TO ME, IT ALSO HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, AND DOZENS OF REVIEWS THAT I HAVE READ ONLINE.  THE ZEN V PLUS WILL WORK FOR ABOUT 6-12 MONTHS BUT AFTER THAT THE SCREEN WILL COMPLETLY BREAK AND THE PLAYER WILL STOP WORKING.  I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING AN MP3.  PLEASE PICK A DIFFERENT PRODUCT FOR THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.

<Title>Decent choice for music and audiobooks
<Date>Mon Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was looking for a new player that would support both Yahoo! Music Unlimited subscription downloads and Audible books.  The choices are few.  I already had a Creative Zen Nano Plus, which I loved, but didn't work with Yahoo!.  The Zen V Plus has done very well at integrating with Yahoo! software and I easily added over 500 songs (automatically synchs my playlists).  But, the Audiobooks are hard to find on the menu (only available through the Genre section), and it is touchy about keeping correct place in the book.  When I tried to fast forward, it kept skipping to the next track, and then would restart at the beginning of the track.  If I press PAUSE before shutting down, it tends to skip backward as well.  And the battery life is much shorter than my Zen Nano.  So, for just music, it is a nice product.  Handling of audiobooks could use some improvement.

<Title>GREAT MP3 PLAYER
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>In the 6 plus months that I've been using my Zen V Plus 4GB I had no complaints, sound quality is excellent, features and menu very good, really stylish, I put it through an entire New year's party and everybody was happy with the music, and comments could go on an on... It froze only once after I hit the reset button it's been working fine.  Recommendation: buy the car or wall charger for it (from Creatibve though because there are some immitations out there that could give you a lot of trouble) it will save you a lot of time and the need to look for your computer to recharge (because it won't charge in any other computer different than the one you have the software installed on)  I'm going for the 8GB one next!

<Content>It's not the absolute best but it's up there I guess. The only problem I've had is that it tends to freeze from time to time and the only explanation I could find from the manufacturer's site is due to corrupt data. Now, I don't know how could that happen except maybe when I converted my CDs to .wma/mp3 formats but I've never had that problem with other creative products. Bummer.  I'd still pick this over all the other choices out there right now though.

<Content>I got my Zen V Plus about 3 weeks ago and if froze a few times the first couple of days. I downloaded firmware and it has only frozen up twice since then while I was trying to bookmark a book which is very difficult. Yesterday the power switch fell off and is lost and I have been trying all day to get a response from their customer support by e mail and phone. All I have been able to get is a auto response via e mail that says they will respond within 24 hours. I was never able to hold long enough to get to speak to anyone in their customer service dept. The player has great sound, poor battery life, freezes often and seems to be poorly constructed. I wish I had shopped around a little more.

<Content>This is my first mp3 player.  After reading the reviews, I thought hard and long about purchasing this player but ended up purchasing it in the end.  AND I am so glad that I did.    I loaded up 748 songs right away.  Songs that I ripped from my own collection of CDs.  I also loaded up photos and videos from my recent trip to Hawaii.  I had no problem doing this and the software was self-explanatory.  Basically, drag and drop into the ZEN V Plus folder.    And to top it off, I synched the ZEN with my Outlook contacts.  No Problem.  The ZEN menu system was easy to navigate.  I could easily find the music that I wanted to play and the photo/videos that I wanted to watch.    I love the small compact feel to the ZEN.    So far...so good.  I am glad I purchased this product.

<Title>Documentation please!!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My first mp3 player was a basic 1 gig Creative player. Great sound, easy to use with Windows explorer. Unfortunately, this device has virtually no instructions on how it handles mp3 files and the software is just as bad. I expected to categorize my music using folders, sub-folders, etc like on my computer. No way! I finally realized after several emails to creative that the player doesn't work that way. It uses "tags" associated with the mp3 files and the firmware to categorize your music. Unfortunately, nearly all of my ripped cd's had no tags so everything was a mess. Fortunately, I was able to add tags to the mp3 files without re-ripping my entire 350 cd collection. Better documentation explaining file handling etc would have saved hours of aggravation. Also, allowing a windows directory approach would be far easier. I recently discovered that a different brand player uses the same approach and also lacks documentation on how files are categorized, etc. The more indepth general manual did mention in a footnote that files are categories by tags, but didn't explain how they are added or how to edit them. What a pain. Overall, a great sounding compact player that should come with an AC charger.

<Title>Awesome Player - Great Price
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I checked as many online reviews as I could before deciding, and the Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB was both highly regarded and going to give me the most bang for my buck.  I was not disappointed.  Don't let its' small size or spartan appearance fool you; once you get the hang of the menu system, it is both easy to use and intuitive. It sounds great, though some of you may want to get a set of higher end earphones.  It appears to be fairly durable; so I'd expect it to stand up to just about anything short of outright abuse.  I've used a variety of MP3 players over the years and this one is by far the best.  The bottom line is that it's done everything I've expected of it and I highly recommend it.  I can't comment on the included software, as I use Linux (openSUSE 10.3), not Windows.  You can either reformat the Zen as a MTP device, or go to the Packman repositories and install Gnomad 2 and any associated dependencies to use it as a native PDE device, which is what I did.  Works flawlessly!

I carry it on my neck with the supplied lanyard when on the train and while riding a bike and I can't be happier. Again, sound quality is very very very good (I use Sennheiser headphones). The only thing I can think of that is probably better on iPod is the scrolling speed. Using the joystick the scrolling speed/control has less sensitivity. The joystick is very comfortable anyway, and control is very good so in my opinion it is still a 5 starts device. In my opinion the price is a steal as well (and I don't work for Amazon :) )

<Content>I had to replace my old zen with a new one cuz i broke it and i decided i should upgrade. This is so much better it holds so much music and the battery lasts, for me, at least one week and thats with everyday use. I like my players small and sleek, its very compact but the screen is still large enough to see. I really enjoy it and i have many other friends that feel the same way.

<Content>The Creative Zen V Plus at this price cant be beat by any other player.  I have had my Zen for about 3 months now and all i can say is wow. So many more features than the competition and at a better price.  Pros: -Price -Line In is Crystal Clear -Microphone -and more  Con: -It froze on me twice (which is to be expected from any MP3 player)

<Content>Love it! Much smaller than I expected. Easy to use while running. Much better than the Zen Micro I had previously, which had the touch screen. The toggle does need a  fingernail to use, so it might not be as easy for someone short nails. Headphones do not have good sound and get muffled sounding when you sweat, so I use different ones.

<Title>Breathtaking
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a Zen VPlus and wow, it was simply breathtaking.  Where do I begin?  Firstly, I tried ipod from a friend of mine & it was great from every aspect, but I wanted the sound quality to be a bit better. I own some Creative stuff so I hoped if I go for a Creative MP3 player, it should do the job.  And it did! The little player has excellent sound quality - full spectrum with an exceptional s/n ratio. I am very satisfied with it.  Pros: - The player nicely fit in the hand. You'd find you'd like to keep it in your hands even when you don't want to use it. It's like a toy. - The device is very usable. The menu is very convenient. And the 2 buttons + joystick behaves exactly the way you think. Some people say the joystick button is a bit tight and gives a cheap feel. But I did not find it so. - When you look at the player, it looks totally anonymous. All product information is mentioned at the back side of the player. Even the root menu item reads, simply, 'menu'. I like this very much. Because if the player is very attractive, with its sophisticated artwork, it captures some share of attention which otherwise should have gone to the song itself. When you listen to music, the player should support you, by not capturing your attention and let you focus on the music. This player does it very well. - The screen quality is great. Creative has used OLED, which is not as bright as LCD. But the OLED display is viewable from every angle, unlike LCD, and also consumes less power. The ability to view from every angle is a great thing. - The ability to play video, the FM radio and the ability to record from Line-In audio adds much value to the package. - The sound quality of the FM radio and the recorded audio (from built-in mic) are extremely good.  - The casing and the screen are covered with a scratch-resistant layer. The player was dropped once with a big impact which made me to lose all hopes before picking it up. But the player works fine and still I was not able to find the scratch mark of the impact! Seems like it is truly scratch resistant. - The software kit was very convenient. You can manage play lists, etc., very quickly.   Cons: - Would have been better if a battery charger was included. The USB-charging takes some long time. But this was not a big issue.

<Title>Great Mp3 player . . . When it works.
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased this as a replacement for my Zen Nano Plus that died a sudden death just after a year.  I figured I dropped it too many times, or something like that because I know I give "pocket electronics" (i.e. PDAs, cell phones, Mp3 players) a very hard life.  Well this one never left my house, though I will admit I put it through its paces.  My biggest problem with it is the buttons on the side of the joystick.  Whenever I use them, it almost feels like I have to use TOO much pressure to activate them.  I would expect something like this from a device that was 1-2 years old not one 3-4 weeks old.  Besides that, I love my player.  The screen isn't big enough to watch full-length movies, but I won't be doing that anyway so that doesn't matter, the pictures show fairly well, sound quality could be better, but I don't just listen to music; I'll read or do other things while listening, so sound quality doesn't bother me.  Also the battery life is repulsively short.  Even if I have a full charge, I'm lucky if I get 6 hours of listening time.  When you take everything into consideration, this player isn't good, it isn't bad either, it is your everyday, run of the mill average mp3 player, and I was highly dissapointed by that.

<Content>I love this player. Looks and works wonderfully. Holds more than an iPod nano and has FM radio. All of my friends who have nanos say they would much rather have a Zen. It is much more durable and holds pictures and videos. I love it! (great price)

<Title>battery life is short
<Date>Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>his model seems to have a battery life of about 9 hrs so it's not really 15 hrs. To extend the battery life one must not use the equalizer, use lower bitrate songs, and lower volume yet it still has a short battery life so if you're planning to go on long trips it's not good. The annoying thing is that the headphones are a bit too big and uncomfortable for my small ears. The creative media explorer software was easy to use to sync music from my pc but there were some files that couldn't transfer with the smartfit option. The smartfit option allows me to compress the file that are transferred to the zen. The error that I got was that the music files in question might not be an audio file. Those music files transferred successfully when I disabled the smartfit option and transfer them as mp3 files. overall I feel this product offers a lot for its price but I would have liked a longer battery life. The charging time was not 6 hrs, it was actually about 3 1/2 hrs for me so I think that 's acceptable compared to the ipod or sansana.

<Title>Little player, little enjoyment
<Date>Wed Apr 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If I had to do it again, I'd spend a little more and get an iPod.  Extremely low output when used as AUX with stereo systems.  My screen kept getting dimmer and dimmer until it went completely black, luckily within the warranty period of 3 months.  Creative was not horrible to deal with from customer service stand point, but is that why you'd buy a player?  I'd rather have one that doesn't require additional work in a few weeks.  Not bad for using around town, workouts or even on the slopes, but don't expect this to be the best of what's available.

<Content>Great fidelity, amazing capacity, can record line in form a CD player or cassette, video clips, tiny size. This unit is more than I dreamed of.  My wife received it as a gift from me and just loves it.   I also purchased her a FM adapter and car charger.  Higly suggested if you want a good high capacity MP3 unit
