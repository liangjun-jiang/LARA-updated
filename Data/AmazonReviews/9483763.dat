<Title>Very Easy To Use, Nice but Cheaply Built
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Another in the growing list of very cheaply built almost useless from word go light brittle plastic MP3 players.  The controls on this player are so flimsy you expect to see them on a cheap 3 for one dollar bargain toy.  If you buy this be prepared to treat it extremely gently.  This thing is not designed for anything more exciting than a brisk walk or a low impact workout at the gym.  The thin platic case case is almost passable strength wise but the controls are so cheaply done that if you get 6 months hard use out of them consider yourself blessed.  I guess making one of these things out of a strudy material like "HEVAY METAL" and building controls for it that could withstand a rough Harley ride a back pocket is asking too much in todays cheapest is best bottom line culture.  I for one would gladly pay more for a player this size made out of stronger base material with a strudy set of controls that are this easy to use.  I give it three stars for ease of use.  I had this puppy up figured out and running within 10 minutes of getting it out of the box and powered up.  The headphones are adequate but not awesome an easy enough fix if you need perfect sound.  I'd just like a MP3 player strudy enough to go knocking about in the back woods with this old Wolf when he needs music on the go.  Its a good buy so long as you remember to ALWAYS BE GENTLE WITH IT!  This is a nice player and would have been perfect had they just made the thing able to withstand use in the real world.  As it is this is a nice plastic player for nice sadate sedentary plastic people.  This MP3 player is for those content to watch the world go by set to elevator music placed on this device.  If you are busy out there living life riding hard actually doing things extreme sports etc, hiking, getting into the outdoors this is not the player for you unless you remember to ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS BE GENTLE WITH IT!  Peace be Yours my brothers and sista's. Stay Strong!

<Title>Good Sound-Good Features
<Date>Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This MP3 player is small,it sounds good and has some great features.  It has everything the more expensive brands have.  I called them to check out the warranty and they said, if anything goes wrong within 12 months that they will repalce it for free.  Sounded like a good deal and it works well. I'm happy with the decision I made.

<Title>great service
<Date>Wed Aug 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was very impressed with the service I got from this company. I called in to see if they had an arm band that I could put my MP3 player in. They said that they didn't have one yet but are getting them in a few months. They went the extra mile to email me the search page on amazon that had arm bands and the links for the ones they know fit well. I just got my arm band and it is perfect. Now I can throw my MP3 player in my bag and not worry about it.

<Title>Do you know what kind of WMA files you have?
<Date>Thu Sep 01 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the iClick Swurv5 from Amazon for my wife's birthday. I based my choice on the excellent reviews given by other users and its reasonable price.  Basically, I wanted a player that was WMA compatible and would synch easily. My wife doesn't do complicated. She loved the size and style of the Swurv5. The USB connection was straight-forward enough. But when we tried to download songs from Windows Media Player the love affair ended. Of the twenty-two songs in her playlist, only two would download.  I tried contacting iClick and they were very, very helpful. They suggested downloading only a few songs at a time. That didn't work. After going back-and-forth for a few days without progress, I thought I should tell them exactly where I was getting my WMAs--iClick had never thought to ask. Once they found out that I was getting my WMAs directly from MSN Music, they seemed to know what the problem was.  Apparently, there's more than one kind of WMA and MSN Music sometimes uses DRM? in their files. The Swurv5 can't handle DRM.  iClick suggested downloading songs from another service. I wondered why "WMA compatible" didn't include MSN Music--Microsoft's standard from Microsoft's store. Maybe the Swurv5 works great with MP3s but I've never used them.  Short story. My wife loves her new iPod. Her first synch downloaded one-hundred & thirty-eight songs without a hitch.  Two stars for iClick's customer service (they were really great).

<Title>good MP3 for the money
<Date>Fri Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I like this MP3 player very much.  It has a lot of feature and it's easy to figure out all of the functions without even looking at the manual.  Everything is self explanatory. It sounds good enough with the headphones you get with it, but it will sound even better if you use your own set of headphones. The unit is nice and small in size, it holds a lot of songs and the one AAA battery lasts a long time. The only 2 minor negative thing about it are, #1 the FM tuner does not lock in every station on the dial.  #2 the display section (on the front of the unit) is made out of thin glass, which can easily crack.  It would be nice if the Company that builds them, would also supply a protective carrying pouch for it.  I rate it a 4.5 out of 5 stars (very good item).  Thanks MP

<Title>Cheap, Poor Customer Service, Faulty Software
<Date>Wed Oct 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>First of all this is made of such cheap plastic it's ridiculous. Second it says on the box it works with Windows 98 but the driver files don't show up on 98 SE. Then their customer service is terrible. I've e-mailed 6 times in the past 3 days and haven't recieved any usefull help. They just ask me over and over what version of Windows I'm running. I had this rush shipped so I would have it for vacation. Well, I leave tomorrow and the darn thing still doesn't work.

<Title>Swurv away!
<Date>Wed Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Swurv5 now for 2 years and when I first got it, I loved it. Its very small, light weight and the fact that it doubles as a USB drive makes music transfer really easy (just plug in to USB port, computer recognizes it as another hard drive, and drop in your music). The reason I only give it 2 stars is for 3 reasons. 1.) It uses a proprietary cable. I lost it and could not find it anywhere, including on the support web site iclickdigital. 2.) The slider control is now broken on my unit after using it to navigate from folder to folder. I've been pretty light on the touch so to see that it is broken now is very discouraging. 3.) The support for this device is virtually non-existent. There are some chat rooms on iclick's website but no one could tell me where I could get a replacement cable. The bottom line is although out of the box, this is a great player, there are cheaper, more sturdy, and better supported mp3 players out there.
