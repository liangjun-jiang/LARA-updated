<Title>Something's wrong with mine...
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Today, when I was trying to turn on the player, it kept turning off. I was disappointed b/c I wanted to listen to music on the commute home. I thought the battery just died. After charging it, it wouldn't turn on again so I had to reset and reformat the player. If I have to do this again, I'm going to return it. Other than what happened, it's a great player with great sound.  Update: 9/14/07 I spent a long time last night putting 270 songs onto my player. It worked fine last night. I plugged it back to my computer for charging. Today I turned it on, I saw the creative logo and then it just shut off. What gives???  UPDATE: 10/14/07 Do not leave the stone connected to computer when it's off. i think that was the root of the problem.  Update: 11/8/07: it happened again. I don't know if this is what you call getting locked up. when i plugged it into my computer, the creative media lite software didn't show any songs or folders. So i had to format it again. urgghhh..

<Title>Good Little MP3
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I paid more for the Zen Stone Plus over the Zen Stone because I wanted a screen. However, only the song title is displayed. The player doesn't automatically shuffle songs like my last player but it is okay. The headphones aren't the greatest. After getting new headphones, the sound quality was great. Navigation is easy and not too confusing.  Overall, a great player for the size and price.

<Content>Very cool because it's ridiculously small but works almost like the IPOD shuffle when navigating. I would like it better if it was just a bit easier to get from say song one to song thirty. I recommend the keychain add on. The headphones are flimsy.

<Title>Okay player with some problems
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cute player, amazingly tiny. Very easy to use. Sound is good. Display is very readable.  Problems: as noted elsewhere, the browse function does not let you select specific tracks, just folders and then you can use the skip function to find the desired track.  Minor annoyance (especially when driving) -- to start up and shut down, you have to hold down the button for about 5 seconds.  If you're listening to books, it's good that it does remember where you left off. However, you cannot specify multiple bookmarks so if you want to take a break and listen to music for a while, you've lost your place in the book.  The main problem I have with this is that it has locked up several times. You can insert a pin or clip in the reset slot, but that's hard to do while you're driving and, by the way, it also loses your time and any other settings.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player.
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did some research on different players and didn't want something big or something 40GB in size.  So for $50 I went for the Stone and it's really impressed me.  2GB fit approx 30 CD's, 9 hours of music or there abouts.  The battery life is really good and the one feature that really made my go for it was the Stopwatch.  I run a lot and am training for a Marathon so this feature was just a plus really. I was a little disappointed that it didn't have a split time but I can live with it.  There is a shortcut button that you can setup to point to any menu item which is a great feature.  I have mine set to the Stopwatch so I can review it while I am running. The size of the player is very impressive as well, people have seen it on my arm before I put the ear phones in and ask me what it is, they can't believe it's a MP3 player.  The FM Radio is OK, you have to be in a good reception area.  I have tried out the Voice Recordings yet.  Another neat trick of the player if you buy the arm band is that you can place the player on your arm either with the control buttons on the right side of the player as you'd look at it or on the left, but one of the ways would make the screen appear upside down, well you can change the orientation of the screen 180 degrees. Anyway, I am very happy with it.  I now see people with iPods and they look bulky and knowing they paid 4 times the price of the Stone.

<Title>A very nice, little MP3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been a fan of Creative for almost a decade now. I've had quite a few of their products and have liked them all - Jukebox, Muvo, ZEN Nano. The Stone plus is great. I bought one for me and one for my wife and we both love them. One great thing about Creative is that you don't have to install any special software on your computer to get MP3s onto to the Stone if you don't want to. And I don't. It acts just like a portable drive - no muss, no fuss. The interface is easy to use, clear - even in bright sun with sunglasses on, and has all the needed functions. It is tiny and durable and with the armband this is a great player for workouts - especially bouldering. The battery life is adequate and carries me through most activities. No complaints. An easy five stars. Thanks again, Creative Labs, for giving us an alternative to those fruit players.

<Title>Great little player with a screen
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: -easy to read screen -cheap -small -light  Cons: -no dedicated hold button (you have to select it through the menu) -doesn't come with ac adapter just a usb cable -Doesn't work correctly with Winamp  Other thoughts: The hold button isn't really that necessary since the buttons don't usually get accidentally pressed. The only software that I could get to work with this player was Creative Media Lite which is free to download off the Creative site. It's a pretty basic piece of software, but it works .

<Title>Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB - Decent Value and Performance!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB doubles the size of the iPod Shuffle and adds a monochrome screen for viewing track names and settings.  Add in the functionality of a built-in FM tuner and voice recorder at $65 and you have a great value.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner with 32 presets ( though it's just average )  + voice recording   + simple design (no more click wheel!) with more color options + great navigation and sorting features  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WAV, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - average battery life of 10 hours (OLED screen sucks the battery) - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled )  - some DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable - few size options 1GB and 2GB - Creative software is buggy - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  Unfortunately, the 1GB Zen Stone had some quality issues.  With the new 2GB Zen Stone Plus, Creative has tried to improve on previous models and compete with the Sandisk Sansas.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express and doesn't have all the cool cache' of an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively and has some NICE features.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone Plus is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations. Unlike the shuffle, you can actually see your track names! The OLED screen is perfect for a player this size but does suck more power and shorten the battery life.   The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, up, down, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack, microphone hole, and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This is less versatile than the old battery operated unit, but more convenient.  What about sound? The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds. Most people replace their standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.   The Zen Stone doesn't have larger storage options. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording. The built-in microphone is nice for short reminders.   The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Content>I have the 1 GB Zen stone player which I filled up pretty quickly. So I ordered the 2 GB because it holds about 500 songs.  Just like the 1 GB player it sounds GREAT.  I don't care for the head phones that come with it. I use a good pair of Sony Earbuds, which I recommend. This is a GREAT player for the money, and it works well when I workout(at the Gym). Well worth your money.

<Content>I was very impressed with the sound from the ZEN Plus Stone!! I did have to purchase different earbuds because the ones that came with it didn't stay in my ears. (I ended up buying the kind that wrap around your ears, and highly recommend them!)  The software for the player is VERY simple to use...a plus for me!! Being my first MP3 player, I had to download the directions from the internet because printed DETAILED directions do NOT come packaged with the player. I highly recommend the ZEN Stone Plus. It's a great little player for a great price!

<Title>Four Most Important Features (MP3 player, sound quality, battery, and price) Are Lacking
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was excited about buying this MP3 Player/FM Radio for workouts.  I had an Ipod Shuffle (1st generation) in a sport case with lanyard for years and loved it, but it was stolen from my car.  So, I tried to look on the bright side and try a new more versatile player that was smaller than my Shuffle but with a digital screen and FM tuner so I could tune into the TVs at the gym if I wanted.  For the price, I'm very disappointed.  The MP3 player skips on occasion (something that never happened with my Shuffle).  The sound quality is OK compared to my Shuffle.  And the battery DOES NOT last 9 hours as advertised.  I could use my Ipod for weeks (3 to 4 one-hour work-outs a week) before I had to recharge it.  The Creative ZEN Stone Plus lasts only 2 to 3 one-hour workouts before I have to recharge it.  As one reviewer pointed out, the controls also leave more to be desired.  For example, when I hit the arrows or other buttons during a workout, I want to skip to another song or adjust the volume or switch over to the FM tuner, but I have to hit them twice, once to turn on the screen and then again to change a song, volume, or other setting.    In the end, I searched for and bought another Ipod Shuffle (1st generation) and a sport case with lanyard (which together came to less than what I paid for the Creative ZEN Stone Plus) for my workouts.    I also purchased a Coby MP-C895 MP3 Player with 2 GB flash memory, FM radio & USB drive for a friend who just started working out (a "you go girl" gift).  It's not as sleek.  But I set it up for her, and, for nearly half the price as the Creative ZEN Stone Plus, the sound quality is better, the screen is more informative (it gives you the song, the artist, and the album, etc.), it's much easier to use, and with a AAA battery for electronic devices (i.e. Duracell M3 Ultra Digital batteries or Energizer e2 Titanium Technology batteries), it lasts and lasts and lasts.  There's no need to recharge the device; just replace the battery.  She loves it.

<Content>I've had this product for a couple of months and I've stopped using it unfortunately. As a player it's pretty good. The sound quality is good, the display is pretty nice, but it has a couple of drawbacks. Quick Pro's and Con's.  Pro's: + Good sound quality + Doubles as USB disk + Strong battery life  Con's: - Stopwatch is pretty gimmicky - Can't browse while listening (switches to song you highlight) - No clip (without an accessory)

<Content>This is perfect for my use! I was looking for a light, tiny mp3 player to take with me when i go running. Well this is perfect!!! It`s just a little bit bigger than the iPod Shuffle, but it has a nice screen. load music is super easy... just drug and drop... no sofware. the earphones are high quality, bettere than the ones that come with the Zen Stone. 2 gb is plenty for many hours of music!!! It owrks also as a USB storaga device. Copying files from the computer to the device is just a little bit slow, but it is a mettere of the flash memory that allow a lot of storage in a little size bu requires a little bit more of time. Anyway!!! ALmost perfect... would be better if there would be a belt clip included in the box but the palyes is so little and light that it`s impossible to feel it when the musci is started

<Title>good value but could use some improvement
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There are many good features that move this a step beyond the Creative Zen Micro that I had been using and certainly many more than you'll find on a more expensive iPod.  I often wished that Zen Micro had a four-way rocker-switch to move through its well programmed navigation.  The switch is good on the Stone but the programming is a step back.  The folder options are not easily navigated and the directional buttons don't scroll through the end of a function list.  That is, if you reach the end of an option list you have to press the button in the opposite direction to get back to the beginning as opposed to continuing forward to the beginning of the list.  I also missed the ability to erase files from the unit itself as opposed to through the software interface when it's linked to a computer.  I miss the ability to record FM radio from broadcast.  Also the FM reception is decent but not as good as a Sansa Express that I have.  The LCD display is useful but very difficult to read in sunlight.  The form factor and buttons have a fragile plastic feel even if they're actually resilient.  The biggest flaw is the battery.  First as a very small unit (it's about the size of a 'Nilla Wafer), I wasn't expecting much but unfortunately it seems to leak power even when it's off.  If you fully charge the unit and then don't use it for a few days it will lose as much as half of it's power.  I've notice this flaw in two units from different sources.  Anyway, I've only detailed the flaws but it's still a good value with good sound.  I'd consider the Sansa Express or this unit well ahead of an equivalent iPod.

<Title>MP3 KILLER FOR ITS CLASS
<Date>Tue Dec 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Creative Zen Stone Plus is an MP3 killer for its class. Why? 1) Feature rich: FM, stopwatch, flash memory, equalizer, bass boost, common audio format support, easy navigation 2) Accessories rich: skin, armband, keychain, portable speakers 3) Great fashion and style: different colors to choose from, different color skin to pair with 4) Tiny, light, durable: once you look at the real one, you'd know what I mean 5) Large capacity flash 2GB/4GB in US market (4GB available direct from Creative) 6) Very good audio quality (as good as Zen Wav exclusively from Walmart but not as good as Zen 4GB/8GB/16GB/32GB) 7) Cheap! (Dell US offering US$86.99 for 2 2GB Zen Stone plus, one black and one red, each with skin and clip, free 2nd day shipping, deal still alive as of this review)

<Title>can't make playlists
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a zen nano, which I loved.  It was lost, and I figured this newer model would be even better.  Well, it's cute and the sound is fine, but I can't make playlists!  I teach fitness and need to be able to put songs in the order I want, but this stone only puts songs alphabetically.  Very frustrating for me.  It's practically worthless.  I'm not crazy about the way you press the buttons to get to the menu, browse songs, etc.

<Title>do yourself a favor, save up and buy something with a readable screen.
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this thing should be for sale at a dollar store after the holidays. OK so they squeezed 2 gig into a postage stamp, cool. but it's dumb, meaning no intelligent software. you can't sort songs by artist, you just load and it puts them into whatever order it wants. I don't want to listen to say the chili peppers then my favorite country star as an encore. so if you want a little order in your device spend a little more and get something intelligent and doesn't slip out of your fingers like an ice cube while your driving or cooking or whatever.

<Title>Great Price/Performance ratio
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>What I like: 1) price 2) super light weight 3) FM radio 4) Good sound quality 5) The GUI is good enough 6) Stopwatch  What I don't like: 1) tracks are played alphabetically - so you have to edit file names and add 01,02, etc. to the start of file names that haven't been set up with this in mind.  Note if you use Windows Media Player (free!) to rip CD tracks, the correct track numbers are automatically inserted into the track name so when these tracks are transfered to the Zen, they will be in correct order.  If you use the supplied Zen Media Lite software to rip tracks, the track names will remain unchanged, so because they are played alphabetically, they could be in the wrong order.  A free utility (named Reorganize!) mentioned on the Zen support site will lessen some of the manual effort needed to rename tracks with numeric prefixes, or if you have the time & patience you can use good old Windows Explorer to hunt down each track & manually rename them.  2) No gapless playback - if you listen to opera, etc. this will drive you nuts when you "hear" about a half second of silence between contiguous tracks. According to my research very few players by any manufacturer support gapless playback - so a new generation IPod may be your best bet if your musical tastes include "continuous" music.  There is also an open source firmware download from Rockbox that supposedly works on a variety of players (not the Zen Stone plus)  that supposedly will support gapless playback - and will also probably void your warranty & disable other features (like FM radio) 3) Microphone is ultra low quality 4) Non USB based charger is an expensive option (like most manufacturers) so if you travel, prepare to spend extra for this 5) Blah battery life: I only get 6 hours at the most

<Title>Great MP3 Player
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I received this MP3 player as a gift for Christmas. It is very nice and has many good features. It can charge by being plugged into your USB port on your computer and it charges pretty fast. I use it when I run and it is small enough to where it won't fall out of your pocket. It has a stopwatch function which is also good for runners, so they can keep track of time. There is a FM Radio, too. I highly recommend this MP3 player.

<Title>*THE* SMALL MP3 PLAYER (FROM A JADED SHUFFLE USER)
<Date>Fri Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I wanted to buy a no-nonsense mp3 player to keep me company while running. No video, no funky display menus, no labyrinthine software to work with. If I wanted to spend half a day getting my music in order I'd shell for the 80 gig iPod.   So I got myself a Shuffle, by far the sleekest small pod in the market.   But boy did I regret it.   After the one-time registration and initialization (which is not optional) the lemon wouldn't get the songs on it, thanks to the infamous "Disk not found error". Googled for it and discovered websites that are brimming with untended complaints; I'm on Windows XP, but the glitch seems to pervade operating systems.   Spent a day battling with the idiosyncrasies. Downloaded and installed an extra utility that Apple's Help site recommends. Enabled the Shuffle "for disk use". Reset it to factory settings and tried all over again, five times. And I'm a fairly persistent tech-savvy one. I did everything that's needed and more, but the stupid thing will still not remember the settings, will not let me change songs, and so on.    Tired with all of this rigmarole, I got this sleek little gagdet. It's a little larger than the Shuffle, but you can see why: Shuffle doesn't have a display and it uses the same jack for charging and earphones so you can only do one of those at a time. Stone Plus on the other hand connects through a small non-spaghetti USB cable, comes up instantly as a new drive on your PC, you copy the mp3 files from your music folder to this drive, and you're done.   I was up and running in 5 minutes flat. Can't help kicking myself for having fallen for the iPod luster.   Without becoming any clunkier in any meaningful way (both the doohickeys are pretty small), Stone Plus shows me the song that's playing, which I don't see on Shuffle. Stone Plus has an FM radio, a voice recorder, a timer, and a digital clock--none of which the Shuffle has. It charges in 5 minutes, which the Shuffle doesn't. I can use iTunes or any other tool or even nothing at all, but with Shuffle I am in an unhappy marriage with iTunes. The Stone Plus will hold about 1000 songs in comparison to Shuffle's 200 at the same bit-rate.   Because this is Creative, the company known among geeks for its speakers, the ear phones that come with the Stone Plus have a fabulous combination of bass and treble that will please the most fastidious connoisseur. After hearing them Shuffle's white thingies sound tinny and childish. I got my Stone Plus with a clip that makes it much more practical for running.   And all of it at 60% of the cost of a basic bare-bones Shuffle.   Sorry, Apple folks, in the small-mp3-player market Apple is simply the beautiful blond bimbo who trips on high heels at ten paces. If you're in the market for a nifty little mp3 player, skip the Shuffle. Even in the 3rd generation it's a 3rd rate contender.

<Content>This just what Creative ZEN, a wonderful MP3. I know Ipod is a great product, but thi sone is better. No only because the sound and easy way to use. Zen have more features that you need pay extra (a lot more to get it) whit Ipod, like the FM radio and the screen. If you look for small great MP3, this one is the right for you.

<Content>I ordered three of these (in green) and NONE of them worked. They performed when plugged into the computer, but failed to hold a charge once disconnected from the PC. This was after the tech-support recommended "all night" charging.  By way of background, I'm fairly computer savvy, have a new PC based system, and spent hours on the phone with Creative tech support trying to fix the problems. Ultimately, I had to return the units.  Stay away.

<Title>Great
<Date>Fri Feb 01 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this along with the Zen TravelSound (which I highly recommend, by the way) and it has been great for use in my car. Works just like it should, tiny, seems durable (I dropped it in a parking lot and have had no problems), lightweight, and easy to use. Great for running/exercising. I like that you can use windows explorer to organize it and add/remove music from it. Side note: If you are going to use with the TravelSound its a little annoying when you want to turn it off or on because you have to unplug the mp3 player from the speaker to press the on/off button.

<Title>Excellent for an "on the go" solution.
<Date>Wed Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a 60 GB Ipod that I found much to bulky to use unless I was stationary. I purchased this for an "on the go" solution. The Zen Stone Plus is a well built MP3 Player that is a better alternative to the iPod shuffle in my opinion. The Stone gives you 2 GB (1.8 to 1.9 actual because of the software but still almost a full GB more than the shuffle.) for less than the price of the shuffle. I bought the optional skins(with clips) to complete the MP3 Player. The only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is the navigation menus have a delay in response of half a second. However, this MP3 player isnt made to browse your music for endless hours like the other Zens, its made to slide in your pocket when you are at the gym or out hiking and listen. Thats what its for right?? To play music?

<Title>Good player, but be warned
<Date>Thu Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>EDIT: New firmware was released by Creative on 8/1/2007 which fixes the firmware issue with Media Lite not detecting the correct battery level. (Yay!) +1 star, as so far music playback has been solid, considering its size and features, a total of 4 out of 5 stars.  As of 7/26/2007: This Creative mp3 player does everything that its advertised for, except for its battery life and upgradeable firmware. As of now, the firmware has not yet been updated (the non-Plus edition had a release just yesterday 7/25/2007). For me, the player keeps misdetecting remaining battery life, which is very annoying because it does not charge correctly. A number of internet forum users, including those on Creative's forums, have also complained about battery issues and charging problems (just search google for "Zen Stone Plus charging"). This is the cost of having a very light weight mp3 player with no exchangeable battery I suppose.  Just be careful not to damage the microphone when trying to find the reset button! I poked my mic by accident- it still works okay.  Otherwise the sound quality is good on the highs (trebles) but very poor bass- which might not be important if you listen to it with cheap headphones or on the airplane/subway/bus since you wouldn't hear it any ways. For under $80, I got what I was looking for, so no serious complaints. Be sure you compare and buy if you have other expectations.

<Content>I purchased the zen stone plus as an alternative to the ipod shuffle, mainly for the price and the 2gb capacity.  As with any consumer electronic the review is highly Dependant upon what the the product is used for.  I bought this, with the armband, for the gym and running.  For this, there is no better mp3 player on the market, it's light, stays on the arm securely, and is easy enough to use.  Be forewarned that the browsing of music is not entirely intuitive, it is mainly meant for just throwing your music on it and listening

<Title>Excellent tiny mp3 player/radio!
<Date>Thu Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have a 30 gb ipod, and have had several mp3 players before.  This 2 gb device was purchased for my jogs.  It performs wonderfully.  There is a short learning curve to organizing songs into folders, but I love the sound and the tiny featherweight package is easy to carry about.  The radio is not as good as the one on my old iaudio, but still it picks up the local stations well enough.  If the radio were a bit stronger, it would get 5 stars.  Highly recommended for joggers.

<Title>Still better than the shuffle even with it's glaring faults.
<Date>Sat Aug 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the first Stone and loved it. The folder skip switch was one of the coolest things about the ipod shuffle killer. But then Creative decided to try and one up themselves. So starting from my favorite feature I'll outline the changes.  That folder switch had to be dropped for the Plus. Instead Play and a Shortcut button (for switching to a favorite mode quickly) is put in it's place. Now the center button on the face of the player acts as a context sensitive select/menu button.   The added FM radio, Voice Recorder, and Stop Watch are pretty basic and get the job done. Nothing to write home about and as far as extras go, they may have their use here and there (a lot more useful than the iPod Shuffle).  The music player portion is where Creative got lazy and lose a star. Hot off the intuitive heels of the Stone, Creative manages to drop the ball an d produce one crappy interface. Getting through the main menus is easy enough on the player, clicking the center button once brings you to the menu where you go through the functions and holding it down brings you to the menu for the current function you are using.   That's not so bad. Just takes a little getting used to. What is bad however, is that you can't browse your folders. Huh? Yeah that's right. You just pick folders, not songs within folders. What hurts even more is that the only folders that are shown are the ones with audio files in them! So kiss your file tree goodbye. Creative just prunes it. Another oddity to note is that the MP3 player has it's own weird auto-hold function after the screen fades out. You'll have to tap a button to wake it up, then tap whatever you wanted to actually tap. This can be even more nerve wrecking than going through the music.  Outside of how music organization is handled (and the lack of play lists), the new Stone Plus isn't so bad for the price. The added screen is clear and easy to read and a definite must for the added gigabyte of space on this tiny MP3 player. And the audio quality is just fine. Not perfect but pretty good for something this size.  The first Stone (and Sansa Express) already gave ample reasons to not buy an iPod Shuffle. This is just another nail in the Shuffle's coffin (I consider the iRiver S10 to be the dirt that goes on top of the coffin). So go get one already.

<Content>This player has some major battery issues.  Charging issues seem to be mostly resolved with a firmware update from Creative, but the truth is, the battery life is miserable (about a third of the advertised life).  Other than that, this player is fantastic, the interface, sound quality, and physical appearance are all excellent.  As long as you can afford to charge it every 2-3 hours, it's great.

<Title>Awful battery life, and tough GUI make this just above average
<Date>Tue Sep 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It does the job by playing a mix of 2 gigs of music, but if you expect to actually find music that you want to listen to, forget it. Just let it run. Navigating is the biggest pain ever. The battery life is 6 hours at best, and if you leave it in your bag a week or two, chances are it will be dead, or close to it. Since I despise iTunes, I wanted an alternative to the neat little shuffle. This definitely does the job.  Conclusion: Since I can't expect great user functionality from a tiny little player, better battery life would make this player a 4.5 out of 5

<Date>Thu Sep 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this product on the recommendation of a techie friend. It probably would be great if I were 12 instead of 50... I have problems with the small "one button does all" programming. It took me several hours to figure out how to get the songs to shuffle. It comes with such abbreviated instructions its obvious that they assume that everyone knows how to use it. You can download a more detailed user manual from the website. But once I finally got it set up, it's great. The sound clarity is great, and it has a setting to make sure you can't turn it up too high. This is my first MP3, so I can't compare it to others. But since its half the price of an iPod Shuffle and 1GB more space, I definitely think its worth the money.
