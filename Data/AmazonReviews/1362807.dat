<Title>FM Recording leaves much to be desired...
<Date>Mon May 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this device to get clips off of the radio, the FM reception and sound is very good, however this device falls flat on it's face when it records the FM to a low quality WAV type file.  Is this some kind of FM copy protection ploy?  Whatever it is, it sucks, and I am going to once again have to look elsewhere, but there doesn't appear to be any device yet that has great FM reception coupled with great FM MP3 recording, except a multimedia PC.  If anyone knows of one, please let me know?

<Title>Simple, but great
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had this for half a year now, and I found it to be a great little player.  The #1 reason why I think this player is so great is its simplicity. When plugged into the computer through its USB cord, it's detected as an additional hard drive. You can drag and drop your music (or other) files onto/off it. I know the manual tells you to use the Creative upload/download software, but I've always bypassed it, and had no problems so far. The navigation/menu is also very intuitive.   Another perk is its ability to support many languages. You can set the default language to 15 different languages, which includes English, Spanish, German, Italian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.  This is especially important to me since a significant portion of my music is not in English.  I can't speak to the radio recording quailty since it's not a feature I need/use.     But the bottom line is, if you are looking for a simple/easy to use player that's intuitive to navigate, this is your player.

<Title>Great at first then the hard drive just died after 1.5 years.

<Content>I got this after reading some other reviews online. It is a no frills player. In the beginning, it was great, easy to navigate around and very lightweight. But after 1.5 years, the hard drive just flat out died. Computer did not recognize it as a secondary harddrive anymore. I rarely used it except a couple times a week at the gym max, probably did not even use it for more than 50 hours. It was always protected in its case and never dropped.  I thought it was lame, I read of a lot of other reviews where the hitachi drive died. I thought it was ridiculous to have to spend 25 bucks to get it fixed because it was past the 90 day warranty. Stay away from this player, there are plenty of other better ones with less problems.
