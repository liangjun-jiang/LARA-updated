<Title>This is perfect
<Date>Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Granted, I am no novice when it comes to such devices, and knew full well what I was going into when I bought this; but, still, I am shocked at the negative reviews I have read. While each users experience will be different, I must say I am pleased to see those unsatisfied choosing to downgrade;  this is an advanced piece of equipment.  For me, it's perfect.  I have installed the latest firmware, which allows the user to utilize ogg vorbis files, which is why I purchased this model, without affecting any other uses of the player.  If you are not afraid of spending just a little time, you will gain AMAZING (shocked by the what the one reviewer wrote!) sound quality, and an awesome overall experience.  I also work in radio, and the voice recorder is of a near studio quality when set to mp3 128 kbps...compare this to other voice recorders that sound like a cell phone in the middle of the desert...the text reader allows for great reading on the go, and the video works great, so long as one doesn't mind the conversion process.  Granted, I must agree that the included software is sluggish, at best; but when used only for updating the system's libray, and converting video, it is fine.  Use another freeware software (Mediamonkey) for syncing the T9, and you're in for a great experience.

<Title>Good but with 1 annoyance
<Date>Mon Jul 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great portable media player but is annoying in one aspect: it requires that you reencode all videos in their difficult to use software. The process is very, very slow. Its apparently a Samsung variant of Divx designed to prevent you from encoding the videos yourself with a better program.

<Title>Samsung is great!
<Date>Tue Jul 31 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is an affordable mp3 that works excellently. I had previously owned the Sansa e250 but returned it because it felt a little too clunky for me. It also seemed to get scratched easily. The Samsung YP-T9 has a harder exterior that is pretty scratchproof and is actually a lot better looking than the photo they have here on Amazon. It's smaller than you might think and has the Samsung logo as well. I think I'd rather have some sort of scroll wheel to navigate but the buttons are fine.

<Title>Much better performance than what I expected
<Date>Tue Aug 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After spending quite a bit of time looking at the various options for an MP3 player such as the Zen V plus and Sansa e260, I finally chose the the Samsung YP-T9 2GB because of 3 things, 1st. - although all 3 products had pretty good overall ratings, it seemed that the Samsung had fewer firmware problems (such as lockups). 2nd. The physical build of the unit seemed much more solid and classy than either the Zen Plus or e260, and 3rd. Amazon had a really good price on the purple 2GB model ($85.00).  I have not been disappointed and although I was concerned about the 2GB capacity, have found it not to be an issue at all. I have a few hundred mp3 songs, numerous photos, podcasts and even some home video clips of my granchildren on it with about 500mb to spare.   The sound, even with the provided earbuds seemed okay, but after listening to other 3rd. party earbuds, I was blown away by the quality of the audio. I have ordered a set of Sennheiser CX300's which were on sale here on Amazon for less than $40.00 delivered and am really looking forward to replacing the OEM buds. There are numerous EQ settings, or you can create your own custom setting.   The user menu is fairly intuitive and even though the manual comes on the provided CD, it is not really neccesary to get started using the YP-T9. The provided PC S/W is adequate, although lacking many features seen with other products. It would be nice to have the ability to better integrate with podcast feeds.  Video handling and compression is very good and the screen display is suprisingly good, unless outside. The provided FM reciever is pretty weak, but will find the stations I am most interested in listening to and the recorder is nice if you want to capture a talkshow segment. The voice recorder is very basic, but gets the job done.  One thing I would have liked to see was integration with MS Outlook for the contacts, the Zen Plus has this capability and if it were not for the cheap feel and lower quality of the Zen unit, I might have gone for it instead of the T9.   I have had absolutely no lockup problems with my T9 and use it every day, uploading news podcasts in the morning which I listen to on the way into work in the morning via my aux input on my Honda Civic and I listen to it via earbuds during my lunch break. The unit seems very well built and Samsung includes an additional 3 months warranty if you register the unit online, giving it a 15 month parts and labour warranty. Battery life is excellent as well and although I had originally planned to get the car adaptor to recharge during the day if needed, have not found it to be neccessary and can use it all day w/o even getting to 1/2 charge.  Overall I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase decision and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone else.

<Title>Amazing mp3!
<Date>Sun Dec 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have had this mp3, the same as the black one, for two weeks and it is amazing. It is really simple dragging your music and putting it on the mp3. The sound is really good and the fm radio works perfectly and I sleep in a basement room! I know in one review somone said the buttons are easily pushed but I haven't had a problem.  Just an added thought my brother has an ipod and he said he wished he had gotten this mp3.
