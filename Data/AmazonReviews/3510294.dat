<Title>Rocks as ipod & web browser (insight from an iPod junkie)
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>There's really only two reasons to buy this iPod over the others.  Simply said it is the touch display and the ability to surf the web.  I purchased my iPod touch the first day it was available.  I have had it for about a week and here's my review:  As an iPod: Just as good as the 5.5 generation iPod.  Effortlessly imported all my music. Excellent music quality and plays all day long.  You just need to shut down the visual display to preserve battery consumption.  Note: The games do not work on this one.  Also, as others have noted, controlling volume is awkward if the screen is dark.  As a web browser: Simply awesome!  I could take this on vacation for reading my email (It is much better than my cell phone). I was able to log into all of my web-based email apps and send and receive messages.  Using the keyboard is not hard at all.  If you rotate the display before you enter text, a bigger keyboard shows up on the bottom.  NOTE: There is no feature to save your login information like Apple's regular Safari.  This means you need to retype your name and password into many services over and over again each time you launch (Apple, let's fix this on the next upgrade).    Summary: Fully exceeded expectations.   A few things that are not obvious:  - There is no manual and you need to figure out how to navigate as you go.  I found a manual on Apple's site. - The YouTube performance is spotty depending on how many folks are demanding a video - Battery power will get sucked dry fast if you surf web or watch videos

<Title>Almost Great
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this unit primarily because after owning a 5th Gen iPod (80) I found myself using the video function about 90% of the time.  The Touch is certainly a great video unit.  Yet, why Apple gave us a unit with so many shortcomings is distressing.  Why is it missing email, why no Google maps, why no direct entry to calendar? Also, why no ability to enter notes?  My biggest disappointment is why do I have to buy a new cable ($49) to view movies on a television.  Other than that all the other functions work great, Safari is much better than my Palm TX for web surfing and iTunes works well.  I just hope that in Time Apple allows 3rd party apps or fills in the missing pieces.

<Title>Maxed out
<Date>Mon Oct 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>To be honest I was dissapointed when it was announced that the iPod Touch would be introduced in 8 and 16GB versions but decided to get a 16GB version any way. In real standards this is what I have on so far. 13 playlists (17 albums) - 249 songs, 23 television shows (20@22 mins, 3@43 mins), 7 full length feature movies, 3 documentaries, and 616 photos. Granted it is not my entire library but it is fairly substantial, enough for some long plane trips. Although I look forward to future renditions with more memory and features, and I will have to maintain it more often than my 4G iPod, I am very happy with my Touch. The technology put in the Touch and the iPhone stands alone. If I didn't like my phone carrier and plan I have currently I would have considered the iPhone, but the Touch suits me just fine.

<Title>A great product with room for improvement
<Date>Tue Oct 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First off, I would like to point out that I am typing this review with my iPod touch. With that in mind, would like to start off by talking briefly abou what is supposed to be the touches main function, playing music.   The music player is to say the least breathtaking. Cover flow works quicky and is extremely user friendly. Overall, the music player works better than any other iPod I have owned. Specifically, the touch has better sound quality than any other iPod so music downloaded at 256kbps sounds gorgeous. The different organizations of music is increadibly tidy making it a joy to use.   The next feature, internet, is well done for such a small device, but there is still room for improvement. I have gotten used to using my thouch's Internet features such as typing and resizing pages to better read them. One thing I have had a problem with though is that sometimes safari crashes on me if more than one window is open. Also, several websites require more plugins than the touch has resulting in unloaded items. Overall though, I found that this is perhaps the best mobile internet program on the market. All in all I am extremely pleasedwith this program and its performance especially because of its international settings which allow me to type emails, using the email website like gmail.    The wifi chip, I have noticed, picks up a weak signal and it sometimes beomes necessary to move my fingers around the antenae piece on the touch. After doing this, the signal seems to regain all its strength. In comparison to other PDA's, the touch definitely has the best wifi chip and works quite fast.   It is upsetting that Apple desired not to include the feature to add calandar events and i rally believe that they will create an update to be able to do so. It is also rather unfortunate that it only comes in 16gb as its highest capacity player. But because it is a flash player i can understand its rather high price. Also being a flash player allows it to have better battery life and allows it to be as thin as it is. The last ral disappointment for me was that the backside is that plastic used on the old iPods. This makes it a scratch magnet,  but suprisingly only on the backside the screen is amazingly dare I say bulletproof and has resisted scratches and a significant amount of pressure, significant enough that it would cause other iPods screens to crack.  The last major features are the itunes music store on the touch and the ability to watch movies. I was not blown away by being able to only purchase songs on my ipod but on the whole it is a nice feature to have. The ability to watch movies is not new to Apple, but the screen on the touch is lovely and watching movies on it is not hard on my eyes lolike the previous iPod 5th generation.I do not have the negative black problem with my screen and for those who did, many were fixed by the latest iPod update.   The esthetics on the touch are infallable and its structure feels sturdy and well build. The battery life is like no other iPod I have ever owned and the screen is gorgeous. In the end the touch is definitely a product worth buying and though not a great value has the best features I have seen in any iPod so far including the newest batch of them.

<Title>A cool ipod
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you don't worry about the price and smaller capacity this is the ipod to get. It is a great product a marvel. It is very thin and sports a huge screen. Most of the features it derives from the iphone and most of us know what the features are. The features like auto rotate cover flow work pretty well. The wireless works fine and I downloaded a full album from itunes.

<Title>BEST iPOD EVER!
<Date>Wed Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is by far the best iPod I have ever used.  The user interface is amazing, with the accelerometer to change the orientation of the screen.  Video and coverflow are amazingly clear and smooth.  As for Safari, at the risk of repeating myself AMAZING!  I don't know how they designed a full web browser (except flash, yet...) into the iPod Touch.  The zooming and everything is very easy to use.  Also, WiFi isn't slow like in other wireless electronic devices.  Not T1, but adequate.  Most of all what surprises me about this product is that is very intuitive.  I didn't even read the manual and I already know how to use everything on the iPod.  A continuation of Apple's ability to make easy to use electronics.  My only hesitation was the size.  But, 16 GB is enough for most (not all of you with 100,000 songs on your 80 GB iPod video or whatever, but most).  I have about 10 GB of songs, and the rest I'm reserving for videos and photos.  Enough for a couple movies and a good amount of pictures.  Just manually select which videos you want on your iPod in iTunes.  Also, as of yet, the only case available from Apple are the iPod socks (too overpriced and not effective enough for me).  Though some third party sellers, including Amazon have put out their own cases.  Overall, best iPod ever.  Once you buy yours, you'll see what  I mean.  Happy Buying!

<Title>Amazing Product
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just received this product about 1/2 hr ago. I have played with this product at the local Apple store. So far, playing Ipod Touch everything seems magical from fast responsive touch screen to its cover flow features. I believe this is the greatest product created by Apple so far. There may be some improvements necessary as many of the reviews have suggested but i am completely satisfied with this product and its price. Many people think that it costs as much as a laptop, but sometimes these people forget that it is 1/36th of the size of a regular laptop. There are many corporations out with deep pockets, why cant they make this kind of innovative product? it needs passion to make a product like Apple Ipod Touch, which Apple has.  I recommend and support this product.

<Title>Now we've got a serious iPod which is so easy to use.
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a beautiful looking device and now (as of January 2008) I can add iCal appointments on the fly and sync them with my Mac. This makes the iPod Touch almost a PDA. Safari has a few issues because there are several important plug-ins missing which may restrict access to some websites. The iPhone is currently affected by this too.   I bought one of these for my mother and she adores having it to view the photos of me and my dog (we live 4,000 miles apart), the videos of us together, and of course the music and movies she loves. It helps her to feel connected to me in addition to our 'phone calls. My mum is a technophobe, yet she can use the touch screen interface easily.  At 16Gb, the Touch had adequate memory, however add several hundred songs and a few 1GB movies burned with the help of Handbrake, and you discover you may need a little more memory unless you want to remove the movies every once in a while.   Expect Apple to release an iPod Touch and revised iPhone with more memory in the latter half of 2008!

<Title>ipod touch is NOT a PDA -- DON'T EVEN THINK IT
<Date>Sun Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>See other user review titled "Lack of iCal Editing makes the Touch A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT, September 30, 2007"  It's a nice iPod and Internet browser but it stops there.  You can't add calendar appointments from the iPod and there is no notes or tasks function at all.  WHAT USE IS THAT??  If you don't have admin rights on your computer, like me and my work computer, you can't install iTunes and therefore you cannot sync your Outlook calendar or contacts without going through the labor intensive process of exporting your Outlook PST files to another computer.  It also does not sync sub-folders for shared calendars (i.e. your exported PST files) or SharePoint calendars so you have to copy-paste it into the main folder.  I am very angry that this was not just an oversight, it was Apple's conscious decision to NOT include the ability to add calendar appointments -- this capability is in the iPhone but not the iPod touch.  Just keep your PDA and MP3 player and you'll be better off.

<Title>A little satellite computer terminal! IF you can get wifi hookup.
<Date>Sun Feb 17 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I LOVE IT!!! (With a few caveats)  I bought the Touch the minute they added the mail, maps, and weather widgets and bumped the memory up to 16 gig. I had been dying to get an iPhone BUT: I have Verizon, and I have too long on my contract to justify changing my whole family's plans just for a gadget, PLUS: I have a 20 gig iPod, and I didn't thing 8 gig was going to be enough (even though 20 is really more than I need). Still, I really need roaming access to email for my business (and Verizon makes that VERY hard with Mac), so I was delighted to be able to rationalize this purchase with the advent of the mail app on the Touch! (I'm a LITTLE bugged that I didn't wait a month and get the 32 gig. Oh, well.)  It's been ALMOST everything I wanted it to be: I LOVE the touchscreen, I can listen to my books and music, plus WATCH lots of video podcasts (which I don't get to at home, because I'm using the screen to do other stuff when I'm stitting at my desk). I love the contacts interface, and I use the photos a lot more than I thought I would (my last iPod didn't have video...I know, antique.)   The main problem seems to be that it's kind of hard to get wifi service. I imagine soon there will be free wifi spanning the globe, but right now I have problems hooking up more often than not. This makes it hard to use the email, which was my main motivation for buying, and also the maps app often either can't locate me (a big advertising feature for the product), or doesn't work at all.   I'm sure these problems will be relieved when wifi is more prevalent, but for now I find I'm having to go to Starbucks most of the time when I want to check my email.   I'm happy I have it, but it could be better with better wifi service.

<Title>Apple's iPod Touch Pre-Updates - Great Player, Nicer Price! Test Drive it Today!!!!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JNYWBG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple iPod touch 16 GB without Software Updates</a>  Apple's 16GB iPod Touch was the largest you could buy before the 32GB version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012JNQYK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple iPod touch 32 GB</a> was released in January 2008.  This mobile device has a great combination of quality, and features, though its capacity falls just short of the ideal size for a true media player.  The awesome video, sleek thin body and web capability are enough to make this unit worth considering despite a high price and some missing features.  Pros  + Buy it without software update to save a few dollars + 16GB of storage is a decent size for plenty of music and a few TV shows or a movie + Great design with a sleek thin body!!! + Beautiful 320x480 pixel wide-screen provides pleasing video viewing + Turn to the side to view video using the full wide screen width + Orientation detection changes view to landscape mode automatically when turning iPod! + Brighter screen with great contrast and crisp sharp images + Wireless access via 802.11 b/g compliant antenna (hopefully `n' will come soon) + Wireless searching and video on mode can be disabled to extend battery life + Great interface for Safari web browsing with easy WiFi hotspot setup + Headphone jack compatible with standard phones, unlike iPhone + Supports both NTSC and PAL video out + Works with some legacy iPod accessories (except standard A/V cable and some docks) + Diminishing price tag in terms of $ per GB of space + Unlike iPod classic, all flash memory means less failures and breakage + Flash memory also awesome for running / working out, though I use my nano for that  ;-) + Coverflow actually works nicely on the Touch, much better than on the iPod nano + Slightly better sound quality than 2nd generation iPods + So far seems to have lower error rate than other iPods + Apple reputation is highly deserved + Plenty of free video and audio teaser content available on iTunes  + Easy access to iTunes right from your device over your local wireless internet! + Apple SDK being made available which means more apps are on the way!  Cons  - Unlike the 32GB model, not enough capacity to make it a replacement for your disk-based player  - Have to pay extra for new apps including stocks, maps, email, notes and weather - Touch design is almost too minimal without hold button or easy volume adjustment - Very difficult to adjust or use without looking at it; some earbuds include controls that help - Screen requires "real touch," bad for those of us in cold weather cities  - Data port seems more cramped than other models and difficult to seat on many dock ports - The headphone jack is strangely placed right next to the data port; ok for landscape mode, awkward in portrait mode - Not backwards compatible with legacy docks and cables; Universal dock now required for video out - Battery life still shorter than other iPods due to WiFi and video power needs - No expandability or SD card slot like Sansa View or Creative Zen - iTunes software with limited native formats (MP3, MPEG4, AAC) and high overhead - Some poor interface designs, such as volume control only available when upright - PDA functions such as calendar syncing and contact management still need work - Playlist and music groupings are lacking and need many improvements - Still lacking some features such as built-in FM radio & voice recorder - Missing Zune features such as the ability to share songs with other iPod Touch units  - No Bluetooth for peripherals and accessories - No wireless synching or wireless access to iTunes WLAN libraries - No WiFi viewing of live iTunes PodCasts - Still no local viewing of PDF or other common document formats - No mode to use as disk storage?!?! - Roughly 2GB of space taken up with iPod software alone!!!! - STRANGE Apple business practices - ie, charging for software features included with the iPhone???? - While the cost is slowly coming down, still quite expensive in total $ terms  Looks and Design  Aesthetics and design have always been Apple's greatest strengths, along with Steve Jobs' marketing savvy.  The iPod Touch is solid but light.  It has a longer body than either the latest iPod nano <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a> or the iPod Classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLKIHA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple 80 GB iPod classic (Black)</a>.  Yet it's slightly shorter than the iPhone.  It's nice and thin, though not as thin as the new Nano.    The big 320x480 pixel wide-screen is simply gorgeous, and the instant landscape mode combined with high quality video resolution makes this the first truly beautiful mobile video player.  The old Creative Vision W <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHBZHC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Creative Zen Vision W 60 GB Widescreen Multimedia Player (Black)</a> had a lovely display, but was MUCH thicker.  The Touch blows everything else away in terms of looks and design.  The metal back common to most iPods still attracts fingerprints, but you will be too busy staring at the screen to notice them.  The screen too attracts smudges.  I've heard it's almost impossible to scratch it, but I still bought screen and body protectors before I ever touched it.  Apple did away with the hold button and the click-wheel.  While I really love the touch interface, it's impossible to change tracks or volume without looking at the player, an awkward trait.  Get a nice pair of headphones with integrated controls and you won't notice the omission as much.    Sound and Video  Sound quality is slightly improved from previous models.  The included headphones are the same as other models.  I actually think the included phones are fine in terms of sound, but not so much in terms of comfort.  Upgrade your phones only after doing a lot of research.  For the Touch, having phones with volume control and additional buttons is a huge plus.  This guy really showcases video, but the sound is still very good and improving with the last few models.  I expect this trend to continue.  To really enjoy video, you will probably want to pay up for the larger and more expensive 32GB model. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012JNQYK/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Apple iPod touch 32 GB</a>  Most video encoding is done at very high bitrates, which has the added benefit of better sound.   Use the highest quality bit-rate you can stand if sound quality is your primary desire.  As for me, I have been through frequent hardware upgrades to add more disk space and finally try to collect all my music and videos in one place.  Features  The features in the iPod Touch were in development for 3-4 years.  I was one of those who read the rumor mills daily waiting for all those features to come out in one bang.  Well they didn't.    The first Touch seemed to artificially remove some features already available in the iPhone, which was very disappointing.  Now Apple has offered some of those original features in a "software update" that costs $20 more.  This policy is not a good one.  That's why if you can live without those extra apps it's worth it to purchase this model without the update.     The device's battery life is still shorter than one would want, but longer than the iPhone and more than adequate for an average day's usage.  Users will notice their battery indicator going down, but probably won't get cut off before they get home.  Apple's software is still a weakness with very limited direct control over your device library and few file options.  No external disk function, no native WMA support?  With key features disabled, such as use as an external hard drive, it makes you wonder.  Hopefully some of these features will be added back into this device with time.    Coverflow works MUCH better than on the iPod nano and actually helps when scrolling through your videos.  Press your  selection and the cover flips over to show you which tracks are available.  It's still buggy and there are some UI features that are lacking.  Elapsed time and track length aren't shown for podcasts, and volume adjustment only shows up in portrait mode for some reason.  Hopefully some of these features will be added in a FREE patch. 	 The Safari web browser is THE killer feature of the Touch.  Finger-based scrolling is very intuitive and you will be navigating with ease in no time.  I'm less happy with the virtual keyboard and I can't wait for an alternative to appear.  I have to use it very seldom, so I can live with it.  The video out signal options are a nice addition and can be set to either NTSC or PAL.  This is great for those who travel or have some foreign hardware, like me.  ;-)    The 802.11b/g built-in WiFi antenna connects to most hotspots, though I hope wireless n will be included in the next version.  The antenna works well, though with a seemingly limited range.  You can turn off wireless scanning to save battery life.   It would have been awesome to have Bluetooth for wireless headphones or other accessories.  Some of those Zune-like features would also help, such as wireless syncing, music sharing or access to WiFi playlist libraries or live podcasts.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WG6XW6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player Black (2nd Generation)</a>  Even basic staples like a built-in FM radio tuner, voice recorder and an expansion slot are also missing.    Both the Creative Zen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a>, which is much thicker, and the Sansa View <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VM8EDW/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)</a>, which is taller, have some of those added components built in.  Newer Archos players has many of those players plus much greater format support <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W0Q2PU/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-7348455-0160026">Archos 705 Wi-Fi Portable Media Player (160 GB)</a>.  Yet none of those players have the level of wireless internet capability that sets this unit apart.  Even fans of competing players will agree that the iPod Touch more than makes up for missing features by utilizing the features it does have VERY VERY WELL.     Conclusion  Overall this device is an HUGE improvement.  Apple's sleek design impresses once more.  With time, hopefully the kinks and omissions will be worked out.  If you can afford it, definitely consider getting the larger 32GB model. Either way, the good far outweighs the bad.   Enjoy!!!!

<Title>Amazing product, just not worth money
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>even though the price for a ps3 has dropped to 400, it still isn't worth the money your paying for it. I mean at $350, the xbox 360 is just a better deal. I mean once you factor in the extra cost of the wireless connector, hddvd player and xbox live charges(ps3 online is free) it may cost well over 600 dollars compared to the 400 but you should completely ignore the extra 250 dollars because you don't neccesarilly have to pay for it right away. For this reason alone i'd suggest not buying the iphone. or the ipod touch for that matter. Now that microsoft has lost the hddvd war, xbox's sales are sure to go up since people always want to support the underdog. You therefore shouldn't buy ANY apple products since microsoft s clearly better and you wouldn't want to send the wrong message. Besides, Steve Jobbs' last name is just plain annoying. If that's not a great reason not to buy an ipod, i don't know what is.

With a fully-functional web browser, an email application and a notes applications (these last two with the software update), this device helps you easily maintain contact with corporate systems and colleagues.  Besides, the graphical interface is wonderful and the touch technology is simple wonderful to use.
