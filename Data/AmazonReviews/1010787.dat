<Content>If you don't mind the size, this is the greatest portable media player out there.... And you can't really make it any smaller if you want to still take advantage of the 3.5 inch screen and 30 Gb....  And I've never heard a better sound than the one coming from my Toshiba....

<Title>There's a reason its discontinued!
<Date>Sun Mar 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This unit is absolute garbage.  Forget the moronic design, lack of features, etc. The actual construction is terrible.  The allegations as to battery life are utter fabrications, the buttons don't always work, but, get this, IT SPONTANEOUSLY ERASED ABOUT 20 GIGS OF MUSIC.  Pretty sure Toshiba got wise and took this junk off the streets.  Anything you buy has been sitting in a warehouse somewhere since 2003.  Spend the extra cash and get a reputable unit. Toshiba does not know how to make media players.

<Title>A solid product when used correctly
<Date>Sun Mar 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the Toshiba MEV30K last week after searching for something powerful and cheap, and it's pretty much everything I had hoped for. (BTW, I got it for $144 from BeachCamera through Amazon, and I noticed they've since raised the price, so you're probably getting gypped if it's still $170-something.) Sure, there's a few mistakes in design, but overall, it's not half bad.  Let's get one fact down: when treated as an independent entity, the Gigabeat V is an absolute dream. Intuitive controls, INCREDIBLE sound quality (the external speaker is kinda quiet, but I guess that's better than loud and distorted), good resolution (granted, not perfect, but not as bad as some of the other reviews make it out to be either), and lots of features. But it kind of falls short any time it has to communicate with anything else. For example, it can't be charged over USB, nor can be charged through a power cord while it's connected via USB (i.e. two hours of synchronization complete, we're halfway there! Oops, "Gigabeat has a low battery and will turn off soon" -- looks like we gotta unplug it and go charge!) Second of all, the synchronization is problematic with WMP. But there's hope! Luckily, whoever wrote the product description that said it can only sync with Windows MP was smoking reefer at the time. You CAN use some third-party programs to sync the gigabeat. I recommend MediaMonkey, since it's free and usually error-free; Winamp works also. (Let's face it -- WMP is the devil! I tried to sync with it one time, let it run for three hours and when I turned on the gigabeat, it had synchronized NONE of the songs I told it to and EVERY OTHER MEDIA OBJECT ON MY COMPUTER. What the --? When I finally got that sorted out, it was still pretty lame, considering it's nearly impossible to get it to recognize changes in ID3 Tags as a valid reason to update the sync files without having to do a LOT of waiting.) Trust me, don't use WMP, you'll regret it.  The physical shape of the MEV30K is a little awkward, but not that bad. It still turns some heads, in a good way. It's lopsided, but still rests at a close-to-upright position. And its size is a little annoying. Not as versatile as some of the smaller ones, but what do you expect with you're getting an awesome wide-screen display?  The product is advertised as having 30 hours of continuous audio playback battery life. Ok. This morning, I woke up with it fully charged and by the end of the day, it was already telling me I had to charge it again. I had watched no videos on it during that time. Maybe there's a drastic difference in regular/continuous playback, or maybe I still haven't worn the battery in yet, who knows? But it's not that bad. Just remember to plug it in every night before you go to bed and you'll be fine.  Here's a fun factoid: Toshiba gives almost no support for this product. Firmware upgrades? Nah. Cool accessories? Nope. A decent form of protection so you can actually carry it around without having to worry about damaging the giant screen?...NuUh......  Now for some miscellaneous facts. When connected to the computer, the Gigabeat uses a media protocol that treats it differently than some other devices; you've probably run into it before, but just in case...there's no drive letter, so you'll have to be creative in manipulating it. You CAN use it as a portable hard drive, although the ramshackle filing system it uses leaves much to be desired. For example, if you try to put a windows briefcase file on it, it will convert it into a regular file folder. Then convert back when you drag it back out. Let's see, what else?? There's a lot of settings you can fiddle with. Brightness, scrolling speed, system sounds, the usual lineup. Lots of language options. I can't vouch for the video playback since that's not really my thing. The few I have tried look just fine. But it's the sound quality that counts, and I've heard sounds with the gigabeat I'd never heard before, even in my favorite songs. The gigabeat really brings out some things you've never noticed. One thing that's annoying is that the screen stays illuminated in order to display the battery indicator while it's charging, even when the unit is turned off. So the corner of your room will be glowing late at night when it's hooked up. Just throw a towel over it.  Overall: 5/5. Perfect? No. Still deserving of a 5 though. It certainly exceeded my expectations, and it's not nearly as bad as some of the more critical web sites make it out to be. Bottom line, if you can find a good price for it, don't let this great product pass you by...

<Title>No Support from Toshiba...? Cannot find driver for VISTA!
<Date>Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have purchased this device for 4 days. This is a nice little machine. It fits perfectly in my palm and the volumn of the built in speaker is pretty nice. The buttons are pretty neat. Easy to use and the interface is awesome.   Yes, I like the look of the machine. Let's talk about the downside. First of all, I am unable to set up a connection with my Toshiba notebook (VISTA 32bit). I have tried the CD that comes with it, it doesn't work on Vista. I tried to find the driver from Toshiba's website.. well they don't have it too...   Alright, you don't support new machine, I will deal with it. I connect it to my old Windows XP notebook and it works fine. MP3 and pictures are great with it. When I try to put WMV videos in it, somehow it doesn't support the frame rate of the videos.. Then I tried to use some other software to convert to a lower framerate... it end up the video lags every 5 second... I believe it's because the length of the video is too long? (120 minutes)  I was so excited about the machine. But now I am kind of disappoited. The support is not enough. And the user manual didn't really help. I have been a Toshiba fanboy for a long time but this time they really disappointed me.

<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I believe this is one of the best mp3 players out there, music, video, pictures, and biult in speaker (could be better), it's all there. But the headphone jack broke after two months. There may be couple reasons for this: 1# I am an athlete so I run with my mp3, 2# I left it in the car couple times over night, and 3# I dropped the player 2-3 times. So who knows, if your good at taking care of your electronics, then maybe this product is for you. But if you're a runner like me, then maybe buy some other mp3 player that's for "sporting use".

<Title>MP3 player for the discriminating palette
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just wanted an MP3 player.  This thing blew my mind.  30GB MP3 player with video, works with Windows Media Player, comes with all the cables and software.  I have over 2000 songs and 25 music videos loaded into it, plus 3 episodes of Dark Angel and I've used less than a third of the memory.  Adjustable brightness, equalizer, shuffle... headphone jack for cassette adapter or headphones, plus a little external speaker if you don't have earbuds... but you do, because it comes with those, too.  8 hours of video playback from a single charge! Navigate by song title, artist, album title, genre, or create a quicklist of ur favorites.  with video; sort by source, name, or date.  There is an option for TV but I haven't used it...you can also uplaod pictures, using windows media player...  I LOVE my Gigabeat!!!!  get one RIGHT NOW!! Seriously, you want this thing.

<Title>Excellent music/video player
<Date>Sun May 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is the best music/video player on the market for less than $200.  At 30gb it can hold movies and music files without any problems. It is easy to use. I had already had an Ipod and was looking for something different to not be tied to Itunes or any particular provider. It is easy to use. I bought one for myself Feb 2007 and one for my daughter Mar 2007 who is 8 and use it proficiently.  You can play and download music/videos from a variety of websites. I use AmazonUnbox for movies because you can download to two portable and two PC devices. Sometimes I use Vongo. I use CDs/Walmart and other websites for music. The only weakness is that this version does not have a radio. You have to buy the 60gb version to get the radio.  But we like the built in speaker feature and long battery life.  Also note, we found one cheaper by looking who is selling (at that point in time Beach Camera) on Amazon and then purchasing the item directly from their website.

<Title>Deserves a  4 out of 5 ( review after six months of use)
<Date>Sat Jul 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is by no means the greatet media player out there! It is bulky, the image is not great, the sound is above average but could be better! That being said, it is very resistant! I have had mine for six months now, and it still performs like a champ! I dropped it a couple of times and it seems fine. The battery life is great ( about 4 hours for videaos and 9 for music. ) I have had problems using windows media player 11 to upload video files to it. I found out that it is easier to just easier to convert the video files to WMV with a software called "Jet Audio Media Player" and drag and drop to the "video" folder inside the drive. It is also one of the cheapest media players out there! One more thing it is extremely difficult to creat a playlist for the Gigabeat, unless you use the "Quicklist" option. The interface needs a major overall!

<Content>The main issue I have is there are no accessories to be found; Toshiba doesn't seem to have ever made many accessories (like cases, skins) and neither did anyone else.  I also have some problems with my computer detecting it when I connect it; sometimes I have to restart.  That's kind of a pain.  But i've gotten very good battery life (contrary to some reviews) of over 8 hours even, and I like that it has a radio, and built in speakers so I can set it on the kitchen counter and hear it without earphones.

<Title>Great replacement for CD player
<Date>Mon Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this player to have all songs from my CDs readily available without the hassle of changing CDs. I essentially use it like a more flexible CD changer on my stereo system. This player is perfect for this kind of non-portable use for several reasons: - It is cheap and has a 30GB hard disk (holds all my CDs in high quality) - It comes with a power adapter and does not need to be charged through USB/computer - It has a big screen for easy readability and is heavy enough to not fall off the shelf easily  The only thing I did not like about this player is that Windows Media Player, the software recommended/required for synching music with a computer, is somewhat unintuitive. But it is getting better...  If you are looking for a small portable music player, this Gigabeat is not for you. I would also not consider it to be a great video player because of the small screen.

<Title>Excellent hardware hampered by half-witted software
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First of all, let me point out that you *CAN* simply drag-and-drop files from your Windows Explorer to the folders on the Toshiba gigabeat V. However, if you do this, you may not be able to get extra tag info such as album art.  Now the review.  The Toshiba gigabeta V is a portable media center player; "portable media center" refers to the platform Microsoft has built for devices that can play video, audio, pictures, recorded TV, etc. The V competes with "full-sized" media centers from Creative and Archos, and it's *not* a slim, feather-weight media player like the latest iPods.  On the other hand, it's got a biggish, very bright LCD screen (QVGA resolution) and a 1.8-inch shock-mounted 30GB (27.7GB reported by Windows) hard disk.  Because the hard disk appears as just another external storage to Windows, you can use the V as a portable hard drive.  The buttons on the V are pleasant to press and are quite intuitive.  The placement of the skip and play/pause buttons (on the top) is unconventional.  The V has a monoaural speaker, which I love because I can enjoy music-on-the-go together with my toddler Charlie.  (I play lots of classical music to him.)  The sound quality on the V is just excellent: a lot of range, and a lot of volume.  With the battery, which lasts around 18 hours playing back 128kbps-encoded MP3 files in real life (and Toshiba claims up to 9 hours for video playback), the unit weighs in at 7.7 oz, so it's not lightweight, and its bulky physical size makes it just okay to fit in a men's trouser pocket, or in a jacket pocket.  The styling is neat, though, and it's not something you'll ever feel embarassed about showing to your friends.  What's not so good about the package is the Microsoft software that drives the thing.  The portable media center on the device itself tries to be friendly and, for basic operations, it's not too bad.  But when you try to do anything beyond just play/pause/power off, it gets annoying.  For example, it's almost impossible to use playlists.  Also, it's impossible to delete files on the device; you'll have to use Windows Explorer or Windows Media Player.  Speaking of the latter, the manual says you should install the WMP 10 on the enclosed CD-ROM regardless of what WMP you already have on your PC.  I already have WPM 11 on my XP computer, and no file was installed: the V played well (or as well as it could play) with WMP 11.  Of course, Windows Media Player is not a totally user-friendly piece of software, despite numerous UI improvements over the versions.  Sync'ing can still freeze the program, and the most annoying part of WMP is it tries to pull all media files on your hard drive together, including temporary internet files you may have downloaded.  Editing tags is still a pain in the butt.  After you sync, it's not entirely clear, at least not at first, how you manage the files synced to your V.  But if you're willing entrust your library of music, videos and pictures to WMP, you can probably avoid worrying about the sync details.  If you, like me, want to have some control over which and how files are sync'ed, you'll run into a lot of frustrating moments.  Overall, the V is a good media player -- and I really like the built-in speaker feature.  It lacks some features found on other players, like FM or recording, but it has a decent TV-out feature that lets you play video and audio on a TV set.  The screen is gorgeous, and that makes the overall UI experience a pleasure on a day-to-day basis.  Oh, did I mention the V has great sound quality?  (I know it because I'm a classical music lover and demand the highest audio quality.)  BTW, the V has been discontinued, which means you can find it at great prices.

All you need is a suitable cable (with the right connectors) that can be bought cheaply over ebay. But it does take a lot longer to charge through USB. Since I have my laptop on throughout the day, I can charge it up fully without any problems.
