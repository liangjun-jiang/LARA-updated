<Title>Very Functional --- but there are better deals now

<Content>The player works well.  Vey well.  The user interface is easy to use, it syns with Windows media player flawlessly, and battery life is very good.  Unfortunately, for about $40 more you can get a refurbished 20 Gig unit.  Most people don' have a library more than 5 Gigs, so, perhaps it doesn't matter.  Again, I am not disappointed.

<Content>No doubt this thing is cool, but in buying it I made a huge mistake. I had always refused to give in to the ipod crowd and so I tryed this thing out. The sound was good, but then I had to figure out how to put songs on it. This was my fourth MP3 player and it was the most complicated of all of 'em. If you want the best, unfortunately you must pay for the best- get an ipod. Save yourself  the pain.

<Title>Not as cool as I thought.

<Content>I bought this iRiver because my music library was all WMA music files.  I had previously owned a 256 mb iRiver (which I really liked) and was looking for something a little bigger. It is all right for an mp3 player, but after the newness wore off, I became more disappointed with it.  First of all, to charge the player, you have to attach the adapter to the usb cable.  So, you end up having a mess of cables and always have to use two just to plug the thing into the wall.  Charging time is pretty fast though, but it seems like the iRiver sucks a lot of the battery when it isn't even on.  That leads into my second frustration with the iRiver.  It has a standby and an off.  You have to hold down the power button for several seconds before it goes off.  Sometimes you think the iRiver is off, but it is really on standby and your battery goes down even faster.  Third, it seems like forever to start up.  I think my computer starts up faster than this.  The buttons for play/pause, forward, and back are on the side and aren't really user friendly.  It does synchronize with Windows Media player well, and it plays your WMAs.  The color screen is nice, you can load your photos, but it won't show album covers. This isn't a bad mp3 player, it just wasn't what I was looking for.

<Content>I purchased the Iriver 5GB, and I am really happy with it. I use it everyday, I keep it in my purse. It is very light and small, but I can listen to all the music I want. The fact that it was remanufactured is great because it lowered the price, and at the same time, I am glad to enjoy a brand new product.

<Content>Shipping was prompt and item was fairly inexpensive.  Once received, the item had a slight dent in the bottom lower corner and I had trouble getting the player charged. Most likely a problem with the rebuilt player itself, as my store bought player has no problem of recharging.  All in all, the player itself is wonderful and user intuitive, but there were some problems with the rebuilt unit itself.

<Title>Works well, but not the best
<Date>Thu Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, im not really under 13, i just dont have an account. I've had this player for about a year, and it's definitely worked alright. I found that a few problems with this mp3 player were that it only held about 1200 songs for me. It was a little confusing to transfer songs and pictures and i found it completely impossible to make playlists or transfer text. Another thing thats not so great about it is that you can only charge it when it's hooked up to the computer AND plugged in. you can always buy a port for it, but thats the only way to charge it away from the computer. It does have a great, very clear, very colorful screen and it has a much better design on the surface and on the screeen than the ipod. It plays well, and has many sound EQ settings to change the sound quality and how it sounds. Basicly, if you're looking for a good, cheap mp3 player that you won't get too attatched to, this could be right for you.

<Title>WOW!

<Content>I hate buying remanufactured anything, but this item has last me a long time.  I like it more then the Ipods because it does more like built in radio, and recording (voice).  5gb was plenty and less confusion for looking through songs, and time saving.  The customer service was very helpful, and showed me how to do more things.  Works great!!

<Title>Not bad for the price at all.

<Content>Coming in at about the size of a cell-phone, this MP3 player has many features that make it quite worth your while.  It also has some drawbacks that keep me from giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm the kind of person who is pretty good at working around some of these shortcomings.  PROS:  1. 5 gigs!  For this price, it's a steal. 2. There are MANY preset EQs for almost all kinds of music.  You can also create your own custom presets.  Sound is quite good. 3. Attractive color screen, albeit a bit small. 4. Ability to record not only radio, but voice AND a line-in jack.  The only drawback with the line-in recording is that you need to separately purchase the Iriver docking bay, which I have done.  Considering I bought the MP3 unit at Microcenter for 95 dollars, getting the docking bay for 40 still makes this a steal.  I have used this to record live music and it does a pretty amazing job with the setting on high quality.  Also, you can record up to 33 hours with the line-in jack. 5. Transferring of files is easy since it is a UMS device, not an MTP one.  Drag and drop.  Couldn't be easier.  (I hate the fact that WMP11 forces you to use their sync when it's an MTP device.)  Also, the sound files do transfer fairly quick at about a second a MB.  CONS:  1. Really needs to be plugged directly into USB ports on your motherboard.  No hubs or front plugs or it will freeze up when transferring files. 2. Earlier firmware had the bass distorting like crazy.  Recent update fixes this problem. 3. Earbuds that come with it are so-so.  You'll want to replace these right away. 4. Songs fade in before they reach their full volume when switching.  Haven't figured out how to fix this yet or if there is a fix. 5. Although it does store TXT and JPG files, I don't really see myself using it for this.  I can't see myself squinting at the small screen to try and read or view anything. 6. Takes a long time initializing after you load up a LOT of sound files.  Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this player.  I'm like a lot of people and really in the anti-Ipod camp so I'm happy I found this device for the price.  5 gigs is MORE than enough storage for me and I really like the fact that I can use this as a portable recording device for live music with the portable docking station.  The touch sensitive slider is actually quite nice and I like the overall presentation of this player.
