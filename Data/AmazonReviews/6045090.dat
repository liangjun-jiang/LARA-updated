<Content>This isn't worth the money. Save your pennies for a few more weeks & buy a different MP3 player. This is little more than a toy included in a cereal box.

<Content>This is a very handy and easy to use tool. Just plug it directly to you USB port and download, erase, and reset, whatever you want.   The battery is a AAA that is easy to find and extremely easy to replace.   It has no belt clip but a small cell phone holder from the dollar store works fine.
