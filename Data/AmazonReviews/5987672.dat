<Title>Best iPod with one problem
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got this because love the color scheme of this iPod (Red and Black!) but I don't really want the autograph signings of "U2" on the back because then I feel like they're judging my music or even are loaning me their iPod or something (I bought it) and my favorite music is not "U2". I bought fine grade sandpaper (small grit) and gently worked their signatures off, which only took a few hours, and then after a few more hours of sanding with increasingly finer grades of sandpaper and ultra-fine steel wool and then buffing with cheesecloth for smoothing it all out, it looks almost like normal! Now I have the "bomb" looking iPod. I put one U2 song on it just for Karma, but I never listen to it. Get this now, and the sandpaper is available at Hardware stores (get the small grit kind).

<Title>Love it

<Content>This iPOD plays back video, but in a special format (MP4); and yes, you CAN see the video on your TV, just buy the A/V cables & in video settings choose "TV OUT" option. Everything you would expect from Apple and iPOD. Can charge from the wall outlet but with an adapter sold separetly. Gets soiled very easily with the touch of your hand, but it comes with a special pouch that can help keep it clean. Defective wise...well..3 months with it and no problems yet...

<Title>it rocks!

<Content>Okay, so this is my first ipod, which means I may be somewhat easily impressed. Regardless, I'm VERY happy with my purchase. My only complaint would be that I don't think the battery lasts nearly as long as advertised. Other than that, it rocks!

<Title>Woke up from where I was
<Date>Wed Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great.

<Title>U2 SE IPOD
<Date>Mon Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Excellent, I enjoy it a lot. Its a finger print magnet like others have said. Other wise I enjoy it especially being a fan of U2 and that it looks different from your normal IPODS this will get heads rolling.
