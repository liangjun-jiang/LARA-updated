<Title>I absolutely love mine
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did a lot of research into the different MP3 players before selecting this one almost a year ago. I wanted one that was small, had approximately 1-2 gigs of space and would be easy to use. It exceeded my expectations. I wouldn't trade it for a different mp3 player.

<Title>Great Gift
<Date>Thu Jan 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this for my 24 year old son for christmas. He loves it. It is easy to download music. He likes the size and all the features this player has. As I read in other reviews of this product, the ear buds are not the best, they won't stay in his ears very well.He purchased a different pair, but a great player for the price.If you are wanting to spend about this much it is well worth it.

<Title>Great player !
<Date>Mon Feb 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been using this player for a couple weeks now and I am amazed by the quality of the sound. 5 band equalizer is a great feature although it may cut from the player's battery life. Radio reception is good. It has a nice, bright colored (blue and yellow on black) screen. It comes with a very nice case so you don't have to worry about protecting it from getting scratched. Buttons feel a little cheap but overall it's a great purchase!

<Title>cute little player
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a pretty good little MP3 player, it is tiny. I kind of expected it to be larger, but it's really good none the less. It is so small you can conceal it in your palm. The sound quality is very good. I have not yet figured out how to get the music organized on it, but I haven't had a lot of time to play with it. I only have about 150 songs on it, so I don't know how many it will hold. This page shows that it comes with a leather case, but it really only comes with a plastic cover, which is perfectly fine with me. It is handy to have though, it protects the screen from scratches.

<Content>2 gigs for 60 bucks is a great deal, had to jump on it.  No DRM foolishness, the interface is straightforward, file transfer is easy, the sound is great.  Only complaint I would have is it's smaller than it looks in the pictures, but I got used to it quick.

<Title>Fantastic Product
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>One of the reasons I decided to purchase the Transcend T.sonic 610 is because of the reviews already submitted and I would echo them! It is an excellent MP3 Player and the FM radio totally meets my expectation! I haven't tried the other features yet but I have no doubt they will also perform as well as the rest. I also agree that Amazon could provide more info on this item to help potential customers. I am TOTALLY satisfied with my little Transcend T.sonic 610. I am very thankful to the customer who provided so much. And the turn around time on the shipment was excellent!

<Title>Much more than expected
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am throughly enjoying this device.  I am very impressed.  I was looking for just an MP3 player but when I saw this one had a radio and voice recorder I had to give it a try.  Even though the times I have tried to record the quality was not that great. It maybe the settings or I am not close enough to the subject I'm trying to record like a speaker or in choir rehearsals.  Even with that just the capacity it holds and the radio is worth the money.

<Title>Who needs an iPod?!
<Date>Wed May 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player is absolutely fantastic! It's pretty much plug n play - you can 'drag n drop' songs, files etc. Just plug it into the USB slot and it pretty much works like a flash drive and also charges automatically while plugged. I use it as storage too (since its 2 GB). Music quality is great (hint: fiddle with the equalizer to find the best match for you) and radio works fine, I haven't tested the recorder yet. I refuse to pay ~$120 more just to get a flashy look and a click wheel.

<Title>Great Little MP3 player 
<Date>Sat May 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>When I first plugged in the the ear-buds and listened I was just about shocked.   FWIW, I'm a musician with various types of headphones both for pleasure listening and critical monitoring. I was fully expecting to throw the ear-buds in the trash and use one of my sets of headphones and hope for best. Well, the ear-buds are perfectly matched to the 610 and together they sound excellent. Really excellent.  Pros: It sounds darned good with more than enough power for any relatively sensitive set of headphones - BUT - the ear-buds are perfectly matched and sound excellent and are very comfortable. Plug and play - hook it to your USB and drag the folders or individual files (or both ways at once) from your PC to the 610. It is very small and lightweight and can fit just about anywhere, i.e: in your shirt pocket without feeling like it's even there. It has a nice shape and this allows for the buttons to be a nice size - you don't need a pin to press them - they are big enough for your fingers. The colors a nice looking. Nice accessory pack to allow you to hook it, hang it, carry it just about anyway you'd want. Great bang for the buck!!!! In fact, among mp3 players, it just might be the best bang for the buck (and I'm picky and thrifty :) )  ****Con: There's only one but maybe I am missing something. How the heck can you scroll by folder and not just by song? That is, to get to songs three albums away, I have to skip through every song in between them to get there. Really, am I missing something or just impatient?   This keeps the device from receiving a 5 star rating for me.  If I'm missing something, please.......would someone tell me?****  Okay, I stopped listening long enough to figure out the way to do this. I anow give this player a 5 star rating.But one while you still can!!!!  Conclusion: The 610 is a great little MP3 player. For the money it can't be beat.

<Title>Good MP3 Player
<Date>Thu May 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you are looking for a small and basic mp3 player and great sound... This is the best choice. I like the player for the features: OLED display, intuitive navigation controls, equalizer presets, radio fm, voice recorder and the karaoke lyrics display during playback. I used the Lyrics3 Editor V1.22 to syncronize the lyrics of the mp3 files. This is useful when you are learning a foreigner language, listening and reading your lessons. The 4 stars are because the earphones begin to fail after a month, but you change  them for a new ones and solve the problem.  Also the navigation is slow when you are adding more files to the player.

<Title>Not that great...
<Date>Thu Aug 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been looking for an mp3 player other than an ipod for a really long time, and finally hopped upon this little one. Reading the reviews on Amazon, I truly expected more than I got.  The player itself seems ok. Music quality is good, but only if you get your own better headphones. Screen is perfectly functional, if a tad small. But there were some qualities that I did not particularly enjoy.  For example, to me the button felt really cheap. It moved around a lot, and I had to press it extra hard for it to do anything. Next, the menu itself is definitely nothing worth looking at. It was simply the same as you would have on your computer, with the same folders. The only difference was that on this one you needed to wait a minute for all your music to load up before you could press any buttons. Otherwise, you would just be back where you started.  Personally, I sent this one back, and am thinking of trying out a Zen.
