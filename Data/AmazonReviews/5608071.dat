<Title>Earlier version of this product

<Content>I own an earlier version of this product. It was wonderful while it lasted for 3 months. Even though it had a one year warranty the shop I bought it from refused take a look at it saying the original owner I bought it from is out of town (2-3 months) The manufacturer itself is in China, and replied I should take it to the seller, to use the warranty and get it fixed. Please check out on the warranty and understand what to do in case of failure, since the manufaturer is not in USA.
