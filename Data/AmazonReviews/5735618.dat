<Content>This little bugger is great.  While, like some of the other reviewers, I was torn at first with some of the bugs, I quickly downloaded the firmware updates from the Archos website.  It fixed every problem I had and I just love the way this thing does it all pretty well.  It's no camera or camcorder replacement, but the picture quality is better than most any cell phone camera.    The controls and UI are easy to understand and figure out with only minor exceptions (adding songs to an existing playlist took me a bit to figure out).    I downloaded the codec that allows you to play podcast and iTunes files for $20.  Well worth not having to convert all my music.   Only con is that it doesn't come with a charger.  It charges via the USB cable rather slowly, and the docking station/charger is sold seperately.  Considering what all this little thing does and its price, you can't really go wrong.  
<Overall>4
