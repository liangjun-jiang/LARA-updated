<Title>Electronic Moron Finds Love...
<Date>Thu May 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>So I have seen two pretty bad reviews here and let me tell you, those people are doing something wrong!  I have had my Sony Network Walkman for 2 days now and I LOVE IT!!   This is my first Mp3 player and being the technology idiot that I am, I was afraid that I would get this thing and it would take me days to figure out how to use it.  Well, within 15 minutes I was beginning the process of transfering the better part of my music collection onto this itsy bitsy tiny little thing.  It was so easy to use the software.  It even came with 5 free music downloads from SonicStage.  The thing I am most impressed with is the sound quality.  The only songs that suffered any quality (only a little bit) are songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs that are copies of songs.  Understandable.  But the rest of them are crystal clear.  You can adjust the eq only a little bit, but for me, its enough.  I like the bass a little heavy and this player satisfies that.   All in all, I believe that I got really got my money's worth.  This absolutely a great purchase, I love it, I love it, I love it!

<Title>Hard to go wrong with Sony, LOVE this one!
<Date>Wed Jun 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love this little tiny MP3 player. I really have no complaints about it. The software is easy to install and user friendly. The MP3 player itself is so small and lightweight yet easy to operate, even while running. It never skips either. I loaded music on it right away when I got it and was amazed at how easy it was to convert my music files to their sony software and then the transfer was a snap. The sound is great and I am using basic headphones from a previous Sony product. Possibly could be better with better headsets, but who knows, the sound is plenty for your ears. I highly recommend this one. For the price you can't beat it!

<Title>Make a smart informed choice instead of going with the flow
<Date>Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You can go with the flow and buy an iPod or you can be smart and buy this awesome device with superior technology.  Here's a side by side comparison with the 1gb iPod shuffle:  - Number of songs:  iPod (240), Sony (680) - Battery life:  iPod (12 hours), Sony (70 hours)  It's not even a contest!  You don't even need a brain to figure this one out.  You'll waste 6 batteries on a Shuffle for every one on Sony.  I've never listed to a Shuffle but I can say the quality of the music on here is awesome.  However, I must admit I do own stock in Apple because I know all those dumb people out there will continue buying them!

<Title>Excellent MP3 player overall
<Date>Sat Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Despite all the reviews out there warning about file transferring and sony mp3 players i decided to get this b/c it was the most banf for the buck.  The mp3 player and software are actually both pretty easy to use.  You just basically load the songs onto the software and transfer the songs onto the player.  Simple as that.  The software can convert the songs from mp3 format into atrac3-plus format when you are transferring songs, so that way the player can hold more songs.  I've uploaded a little over 500 songs onto my player at 64-kbps and the quality isnt noticeably different from my other mp3s.  Another good thing is that navigation is pretty easy on the mp3 player.  You basically organize your songs into "groups" and you name your groups, e.g. rock, sum 41, r&b, etc., and you can just browse to the group you want.  And you can shuffle/repeat the group you want or all the songs in the mp3 player.  You can also browse song-by-song, which doesnt take too long, the navigation goes pretty quickly when you hold down the buttons.  The battery life is also very good.  You can use the thing on one AAA for more than 40 hours.  The mp3 player also resumes the music you were playing immediately when turned on. So overall a great mp3 player, but for the following:  it takes a long time to organize and transfer songs onto the player, took me an entire day to do that.  Plus, although the group navigation kind of is adequate, i wish this player supported regular playlists.  I guess thats the drawback with flash mp3 players.  If you dont travel alot and can put up with charging, I would definitely suggest shelling out a few extra bucks for a mini harddrive player.  But this is a extremely good player for those taking trips where charging isnt covenient.  Another negative aspect as that the player is kind of flimsy.  Looks ok, but it doesnt seem to be extremely sturdy.  The player is extremely light, even with the battery installed, so goes good in your pocket or whereever.  I also own a larger 20GB harddrive mp3 player and I like this so much better.  It's lighter, and battery life is awesome, and just seems to be more hassle free.  Further, with the larger, i felt i was carrying around a ton of songs i never listened to, while with this, its always playing my favorite songs (sum 41 rules, btw).  Well, over all a terrific player.  Well worth its price.

<Title>Yes, it plays MP3 directly and yes, it supports drag-and-drop
<Date>Sun Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Some of the reviews here contain materially false information.   This player plays MP3 songs directly, without the need to convert them to ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus format. This is covered at great length in the manual.  This player supports drag-and-drop for MP3 files. The SonicStage software is only necessary if you want to work with ATRAC. Look online for the appropriate version of Sony's "MP3 File Manager" (version 2.0 as of this writing).  For those who want to work with ATRAC, SonicStage is a stable and reliable application, when used in a stable and reliable environment. It is best to use Windows XP, install the lastest updates, use virus-checking software, and avoid running software from untrusted sources.

<Title>Easy to use, great sound, lots of songs, what's not to like?
<Date>Tue Jul 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I really don't understand the hyperbolic criticism of Sony's SonicStage software.  It took me all of five minutes to figure it out, without even looking at the manual.  Clearly, some of the reviewers here have failed to read THEIR manual.  There's no requirement to use SonicStage;  your PC will see the NW-E107 as just another USB-connected storage device.  Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop your MP3's, if that's the format you like... this unit plays them just perfectly.  I suppose if you have a humongous library of MP3's, and for some reason you really really really wanted to be able to manipulate them through SonicStage, you would become frustrated that you had to first "transfer" them into the SonicStage library and put them in a playlist.  But this really isn't the best use for the included software.  The advantage with SonicStage is realized for someone just starting with assembling a collection of portable music files.  The ATRAC3/ATRAC3plus compression algorithms designed by Sony allow you to cram an incredible amount of music onto this tiny podlet.  It's really remarkable... I'm currently walking around with 27 full-length cd's on mine.  This is plenty for me to choose from when I go running, or have to get on an airplane, or have an extended stint at the old computer keyboard at work.  The unit weighs practically NOTHING; the packaging it comes in weighs more than it does.  Even with the AAA battery in, it simply disappears in a shirt pocket, you don't even feel it there.  It's great when working out; when I'm out running I just pop it in the pocket of my shorts.    The controls are simple and intuitive.  Is it "feature rich?"  Gee, I dunno... it plays the songs, lets me access them easily, lets me shape the treble and bass (you get three preset levels, one the flat factory setting, the other two user configurable... I have one setting for general use and one for inside the motorcycle helmet).  You can preset a volume level that will be your default whenever you fire it up.  There's some other stuff it does, but that's all I ever need, so I haven't spent too much time monkeying around with the other features (lots of byzantine repeat modes that I would never use in a million years).  I program computers all day, the last thing I want to do is have to program my personal stereo.  I'm giving four stars instead of five because the little plastic plug that covers the USB port is kind of tricky to pry open, and because there's no way to clip this thing onto your clothes if you happen to be without a convenient pocket.  Also, I'm not totally sold on the earpod headphones... but I have a pair of Sony PSYC headphones that I love, so no biggie.  Otherwise I am totally pleased with this purchase.  Under $150, and I have triple the song capacity and triple the battery life of a $300+ iPod.  For me, that's worth sacrificing all of the file-sharing-with-friends features that probably appeal more to kids in high school and college.  I just want to listen to music.  This little guy does the job for me.

<Title>The Truth According To Zowie
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>"Flawed Fatally" and "SonicStage Suicide" are pretty much right on in their appraisals.    The hardware is awesome.  I don't regret getting this gem.  I just squeezed 20 albums on this puppy with roughly 250+ songs.   And the battery life is spectacular - Sony must employ some of the best power management experts on the planet.    However, and this is the big frustrator, the Sonic software IS the worst piece of crap I've ever used, going back to the DOS days of the '80s.  It's horrendously slow (almost like watching the grass grow), weirdly inaccurate (in it's gauges showing transfers), unintuitive, and basically a scam (my opinion) to get you out to their website to sell you more music.   BTW, since the instruction manual says you can't drag-and-drop MP3s and have them play, and since I tried this and it in fact doesn't work just as the folks at Sony truthfully say, don't believe that you can despite what other reviewers here say.  What you can do is drag-and-drop files, so you could use this as a portable memory stick, but they really don't play... at least I haven't been able to get them to play.    In summary, however bad the software is, the hardware is still amazing and I hope that I won't have to interact with the software too often.  I even went out and downloaded the latest software from the 'net, so don't think this is just an outdated review and new software might be available.  I suggest to Sony that they skip from version 3.2 straight to 5.0, fire all the developers of the present software and go get a team who can whip off something worthwhile.  And, develop drag-and-drop for MP3s.

<Title>DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE CRY ON HERE THIS IS THE BEST EVER
<Date>Sat Aug 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>IM NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND WRITE A REVIEW THATS VERY DETAILED, SOME PEOPLE ALREADY DONE THAT SO WHAT IM GOING TO SAY IS SIMPLE AND EASY. THIS MP3 PLAYER SIMPLY RULES, THE HEAD PHONES IS SO SO. THE SONIC STAGE  SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH THE MP3 PLAYER IS SO EASY TO WORK, U SPEND 3 MINUTES READING THE CARD TO SHOW U HOW TO ATTACH THE MP3 PLAYER AND HOW TO COPY MUSIC FROM YOUR PC ETC. ITS SO EASY FOR ME I BOUGHT THIS CD PRETTY MUCH TO RIP MY CURRENT CDS ONTO THE PLAYER... IT WORKS GREAT ALL U GOTTA DO IS INSERT THE CD  AND IT READS IT STORES AND ALL VERY FAST.  IF U RIP A CD U BURNED U CLICK A SEPARATE BUTTON CLICK  IMPORT SONGS AND THATS IT U ARE DONE, LABEL THE FOLDER AND ITS FINISH. DONT SEE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CRYING CAUSE THEY CANT FIGURE THIS OUT. I DID TONS OF RESEARCH ON THE NET BEFORE I GOT THIS MP3 PLAYER AND IT SIMPLY ROCKS. ONLY THING THAT SUCKS IS IT DOES NOT COME WITH A NECK STRAP BUT I HAD A OLD DIGITAL CAMERA THAT HAD A NECK STRAP THAT I FIT ONTO THE MP3 PLAYER SO PROBLEM SOLVED. 5 STARS FOR THIS PLAYER

<Date>Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My Sony 1gb mp3 player does a lotts working time on one AAA battery. The music is super quality, though I suggest another headphone set! Connected with FM transmitter for car stereo & is great there as well. Only drawback it does not play WMA digital proteced rights managemet. Can be corrected to play with program called Tunebite Works with wma sound files etc.. Also could use a band or something to secure to your body Mark

<Content>If you're thinking of buying an I-pod Shuffle, get this instead.  It's cheaper, easy-to-use, has a screen so you can select songs/albums, and fits more music.  Oh, and it has a pretty good battery life.

<Title>Buy the Right Thing!!!
<Date>Mon Nov 27 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After some careful research comparing players, I decided this Sony was the right player for me because 1) I primarily want to add music from my CD collection, and this software, despite everyone's bellyaching, produces MUCH better sound than IPOD's.  I earned my living as a music critic for svereal years, and the SONY sound is absolutely excellent. For classical music there's no comparison. 2) I travel overseas a lot and the ease of changing a little AAA battery, which lasts for 50 - 60 hours, is wonderful.  I know I'll have my music because I'm not dependent on finding outlets with the right plugs and risking blowing up my player on a bad voltage connection.    Many of the complaints seem to arise from assumptions made about the player and capabilities it was not intended to feature, rather than product which doesn't live up to its claims.  I've just bought a new SOMY Walkman A3000 20 GB because I want more storage, but I will keep this little beauty because it's the only one I know that runs on a battery. I'll also replace it if I can, should it's life run out before a newer version is available.

<Title>Player is great... but don't count on finding armband
<Date>Thu Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have loved the unit itself.  I had a minor issue in which I had to send it off for warranty work a few months after the purchase.  It has worked great & I have enjoyed the quality of the MP3 player itself.  The problem is that after less than 2 years of it being out, it is no longer possible to find the armband to carry it in.  I have looked all over the Sony website & called their Sales department.  It is not available anywhere.  I have used the Google search engine looking for any place that might sell it.  Amazon has a listing for it, but does not have any to sell anymore.

<Title>Awesome little player but something goes wrong 6 mos later
<Date>Sun Jul 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I love this little MP3 player from Sony!I have two of them. They are perfect for working out...BUT something majorly malfunctions after about 6 mos of use! When the player gets ready to go haywire, the battery will go dead- which seems to be an easy fix;I've replaced them successfully numerous times before, but this time when the battery is replaced, the player seems to lose its mind! The display reads "Data Access" and will not stay on for more than ten seconds, and flashes Data access every  subsequent time it blacks out.Within an hour or 2 of this happening, it ceases to work at all.When this problem felled the second player of mine yesterday,it popped loudly. I happened to be listening to it at the time. Sony charges a flat rate of $77.00 on any repair plus whatever costs might arise if they fix it,so there's little point in trying to repair one of these since you can go buy a new one for about the same price.There is apparently some design flaw,but these little players are AWESOME while they last. Just wish Sony could get them perfected...

<Title>Great player...CAN transfer mp3s without using SonicStage
<Date>Sun Aug 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player works great. I have owned it for a little over a year now and it has been going strong. I wanted to clear up a few misconceptions that older reviews seem to focus on...this player DOES NOT have to be used with Sonic Stage software...at some point, Sony included a download in their updates section that allows you to download an mp3 transfer program. Although it's not as nice as the drag/drop format of a newer player, it sure beats importing to ATRAC and then converting to MP3. You can find this download on Sony's support site at:  http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=NWE107&upd_id=1936&os_id=99  For some, since this player doesn't have any functions like voice recording, fm player/recorder or sleep timer that some of the newer players now have it may not be worth it to buy this model. For people like me who just want a simple mp3 player, nothing else I've seen comes close to touching the 60 hours of playback time that I can get from one single AAA battery. (I also own a Sansa m240 mp3 player and only get 16 hours from the same size battery and can take the dead battery out of the Sansa and it will play another 5-6 hours in this Sony!)
