<Title>Finally a true mp3 sports player
<Date>Sun Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>I have been looking for a portable MP3 player to use at the gym for some time now, and this unit is the first that appears to be geared for the athelete.  For the most part the player fits the bill, providing a lightweight unit that fits snuggly into a flexible arm sleeve.  Here are the only downsides in my view:<p>1. The headphones while designed to stay out of the way with a cord that goes down your backside and around to the mp3 player on your arm is a little awkward.  Specifically the two earpieces are attached to one another via a plastic arm, which can dislodge if you are doing excercises where you lean your head back.<p>2. Software setup was not a breeze.  It took me a few attempts where my computer rebooted in the middle of accessing the unit for no apparant reason.<p>3. the headphone connector to the unit is a bit sensitve.  I have to wiggle the connector on mine when i attach to the mp3 player to get full stereo sound.  Another pair of headphones would probably solve the problem, but it would have been nice to have this work with no problem.<p>Having said all of this, i am happy with this thing.  The only improvement i would make would be a pair of wireless earpieces, but i guess i will have to wait a couple of years before those appear on the market.

<Title>All Good Things Don't Come In Small Packages
<Date>Wed Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is the first MP3 player I have owned.  It is a great size <br>for athletes to use during exercise.  I find it to be light weight and the arm band is very comfortable. The extension is nice but somewhat on the high maintenance end if you just want to put the player on and run.  Sound is good and skipping is not an issue.<br>Downsides I found were that it came with very limited instructions for downloading music and reinstallation of software is often necessary to get your computer to recognize the device.  After two weeks of ownership it has demagnitized twice despite taking all of the necessary precautions.  And good luck if you need customer support.  It only took 12 tries to get through to them.  Best to try at 7:00amEST.  <br>Overall, good size and fun to use, but downloading or changing your music can take some time.

<Title>NOT RECOMMENDED
<Date>Sat Mar 15 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>i was so excited when i recieved the item, but all that excitment quickly turned into frustration.  setup is confusing, there is no instruction booklet that comes with the player.  installing the program/driver seemed pretty straight forward but i had to refer to the nike/philips website a few times.  even after all that it still did not work.  i then tried to call the 1800 support number and they had no clue of how to do anything.  so finally i gave up on it and now i am waiting for philips to contact me back with a way of exchanging the item for another because they said it must be something wrong with the product.  regardless, i think this looks good but performs poorly if you can get it to perform.

<Title>The only exersize will be when you throw it against the wall
<Date>Sun Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Against the advice of the reviews I read on Amazon, I purchased this unit because there are not that many sports MP3 players. After six hours of trying to download songs to the device, I finally was able to get a few songs on though I have no idea how to do again. The real problem is the Musicmatch software which is very unstable. While it works fine for burning cds, not so for downloading to this device. <p>Now that I have some songs on it, I have to say the quality is good and the armband works well.<p>Would I recommend buying this unit? Yes, if your idea of exercise is burning calories through frustration and anger. If not, you would be better off humming while you run.

<Title>up & "running" in 5 minutes
<Date>Wed Apr 09 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>the reviews above made me worry - but as a sucker for "small electronics" and a runner I could not resist the nike-philips psa64 (psa[64 ???).<br>My experience was different from the reviews; I plugged the device in my PC (running XP) - loaded the CD&drivers; even ignored the recommended reboot - using Microsoft's Media Player 9 I could load a mix of MP3 and WMA-files and I was off in literally a couple of minutes. Easy!<p>I am not impressed by the instructions (no suggestion on what is required and what is mandatory - see WMP use) and the software install (not certified my MS and why ask to reboot if not needed?) - hence 4 stars, not 5...

<Title>difficult at first but worth it
<Date>Fri Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>Like everyone else, I had trouble at first downloading it. I then just followed the setup from the disk and then found it easy if I read everything. I have windows ME and had very little problems. It just took awhile due to the fact that there is not an instruction guide. In all, I am having no problems with it and it is great to work out with. The arm band is great and its easy to use once you get the hang of it.

<Title>Big Regrets!!!
<Date>Fri Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2003
<Content>This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made!  I am not that bothered by the 8 hours I spent trying to get the device to work.  The directions are awful; the software is terrible; and the effort required to download the first set of songs was hardly worth it!  Once I finally figured out how to download songs, things seemed OK.  The device was working well and the sound quality was pretty good.  <p>This lasted for 3 months and then one side of the headphones just stopped working.  Philips sent me new headphones, no questions asked, and I was up and running once again.  Things appeared to be going fine until another 7 months passed and one side of the new headphones stopped working.  OK . . .I figured I would just learn to live with this problem, but then the headphones just stopped working all together!  I called Philips.  They were supposed to send me new headphones a month ago and I still have not received them yet!  I haven't even had this product for one year!!<p>At this point I don't want new headphones.  Instead I am going to buy a different device.  My overall experience with this product was bad and I would therefore not recommend that anyone purchase this unit.  It is poorly made and I think Philips knows this!
