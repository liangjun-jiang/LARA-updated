<Title>Lots of stupid decisions

<Content>Audiovox's mp3 player (and I *hope* they've solved this by now) does not remember its place when it turns itself off (maybe 60 seconds of idle time).  So not only does it not know where in a track it is when it turns back on, it actually returns to the root directory, so it doesn't even remember what track, what disc, or what folder it was in.  This is just so easy to avoid and no one would use it the way it is.  I can't find any firmware updates to fix it either.  As it is it is next to useless.  The only thing that is nice is that it was a regular-sized USB connector in the batter compartment that folds out and makes it a USB drive -- aside from that it was a complete waste of money.  
<Overall>2
