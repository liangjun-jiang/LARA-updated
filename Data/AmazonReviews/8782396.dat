<Title>Wow!
<Date>Fri Dec 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I just got the 8GB black a couple of weeks ago as an early present and it is incredible! Great sound, great scratch-resistant screen, great UI and the biggest surprise, the software. Yes, it's simplistic, but it also works well and makes syncing up your collection a breeze. Wireless syncing works well too; as a test, I was able to sync up with my home PC and get the new Ministry album I ripped to my library in about 30 seconds. Oh yeah, the FM transmitter is a much-improved feature, it actually works very well. Highly recommended!

<Title>Best player so far, with interesting new features
<Date>Sat Dec 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my fourth portable music player since the first one 5+ years ago, a Rio S30, and it is the best so far (size, weight, capacity, quality, and features).  In addition to music, I always need a radio at the gym, both to listent o NPR but also to listen to the TVs, and the Zune has the best reception so far (and a nice interface to select from favorite radio stations).  I love the podcast functionality (subscribe from within the application and it syncs new downloads automatically, and removes the old ones), as well as the ability to sync over my wireless network at home.  I don't buy new songs every week, but new podcasts come out several times per week, and they get sync'ed to the Zune, without having to dock it.  And not just audio podcasts, but video as well (the NASA weekly ones being my favorite).  The player is easy to control and the display is very nice.  The earphones fit nicely and have a nice sound.  The PC software is simple and easy to use, very focused on the task of getting content to the player.  It is also easy to buy additional songs through the software, and I get to use the same points I use to buy things on the X Box.  There are some interesting social aspects to the player and software, for example being able to share your favorites and songs recently played with your friends.  8 GB (in red) was the right size for me.  The majority of the songs I like to listen to are now loaded in my Zune, with a nice variety of artists and genres. I also loaded a couple of my favorite photos, just to browse through them now and then.  Highly recommend it.

<Content>I own iPod before, and Zune is definitely better than iPod. I like the size, the user interface, the sync software(even it can be dificult to install at some times), the wireless sync, support for wma, 2-way media transfer (iTunes does not allow you to transfer music from iPod to PC).

<Title>I Would Give the Zune 0 Stars if I Could!  Don't Buy It!
<Date>Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought a Zune for my husband because all of our music files are in .WMA format, which is a Microsoft format. I have downloaded ALL of my music legally over the years in a .WMA format.  The ONLY REASON I bought the Zune was so that my Microsoft-formatted songs would be easily loaded onto the Microsoft Zune.  Imagine my surprise and distress when I discovered, after purchasing the Zune and attempting to load my LEGALLY purchased music, that it will not play ANY songs downloaded from any site OTHER than the Zune marketplace! In fact, when I called the Zune support line for support, they graciously offered to sell me all the songs that I have already LEGALLY downloaded and purchased from other sources! Isn't that generous of them?  SAVE YOURSELF HEARTACHE AND FRUSTRATION AND DO NOT BUY A ZUNE!

<Title>Great interface; semi-good player  (3.5 rather than 3 stars)
<Date>Mon Dec 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I completely skipped Zune's first outing but thought the redesign was worth a shot.  I upgraded from a Sony NW-S205F wanting something with more space and more features.    The best thing about this player is the interface - it's extremely intuitive and looks great (especially if you've downloaded the album art).  The 'squircicle' gives you the option to flick your thumb to scroll left/right and up/down OR simply press and hold the edges.  I liked the touch function, although I found it a little too sensitive and turned it off.  I also found it didn't always respond to button presses and occassionally i had to press a button more than once, but it never became annoying.  The software was pretty good, although I feel ALL mp3 players should offer drag-and-drop functionality.  Now for the bad stuff: where is the EQ???  To me this was the biggest problem.  Coming from the sony player (their mp3 players are notorious for their sound quality!), the music felt sort of plain - although I'm a fan of bass so this may not be an issue for you.  Also, there's no mass storage function so you can't move files - music or otherwise - which seems silly to me since its got 8G to play with.  And I found the battery life merely adequate (I got about 15-18 hours without WiFi).    **Speaking of the battery, I should note that on my third day of use, the battery completely drained itself without my knowledge (i had used it for 30 min, turned it off, and it wouldn't restart later).  There are a few noted cases of this which you can google or find on Engadget.  It didn't happen again, but it definitely took away my confidence**  Overall, I thought the Zune 8 was good, but not great and I ended up returning it.  However, if you don't need a lot of bass or a long battery life, it's definitely a good choice.

<Title>The One
<Date>Wed Dec 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Before I start talking about the Zune I have to say that I've had several mp3 players in the past, from flash-based to HD-based.  My newest one is this 8GB Zune.  I got my Zune about a week ago, after getting rid of my 3G 8GB Nano, that I was not happy with.  So this is why I'm more satisfied with the Zune vs. the Nano...  Hardware -Shape is easier to hold and use than WS Nano -LCD is glass, more durable and sharper than plastic on Nano -Zune Touch Pad is more responsive and precise vs. click wheel -Wireless sharing/syncing option -Built-in FM Tuner -Better sound quality even without EQ...I just hated how bad the Nano sounds even with Shure headphones   Software -Very simple and easy -Asthetically better than iTunes  User Interface -No Coverflow but interface is more organized and intuitive -Customizable background, not an option on Nano -Easier to read  I have not tested the battery life but it's rated close to the Nano so I'll live with whatever it really is.  One thing I haven't checked on but someone else wrote about was the Zune not being a UMS Device when plugged in.  Hopefully that's something Microsoft can/will change so that you can store other files on it.  Overall, I'm must more satisfied with this player than the Nano.

<Title>Great  little MP3 player
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>My only regret is that I did not buy the 30 or 80 GB Zune.  This device is easy to use, compact, and the software is even easier.  The picture quality is amazing for videos.  The only slight negative is the finger pad.  It can be a little touchy as your finger needs to be right in the middle in order to make a selection.

<Content>I wish I had a Zune to review! I ordered this well over a week ago with Amazon's *guarantee* to be delivered in time for Christmas! Well guess what ... it is now Christmas Eve and there is no Zune under my tree for my son. That is very poor service, Amazon! To follow up on this ... I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped another in its place which arrived in 2 days. I appreciated their efforts to make the best out of a misfortunate situation.

<Title>Cooler than iPod nano
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I used to own both an iPod Nano and Video 30GB and bought the flash Zune to replace them after losing them.   Style is certainly subjective, but I really think the Zune is much more attractive than the standard iPod, both on the exterior and the on-screen displays. The size is great and fits comfortably in the hand.    The Zune has an innovative user interface. Like iPod, it allows you to navigate songs by title, artist and album. But one key advantage is that once you start navigating in a certain dimension, you don't lose the previous context. For example, if you start scrolling vertically through the list of artists and select one, you surely see the albums displayed, but that previous list of artists is still visible and navigable, just transposed horizontally on the top of the screen.   The only negative mark I would give Zune is that it can sometimes be difficult to navigate without looking at the screen and the touch pad, to either change the song or adjust the volume, especially with gloves on.         The FM radio tuner is a great feature and reception is excellent.  The screen is sharp and although small, can play videos very nicely. Lastly, the Zune player and marketplace is beautifully designed and easy to use. There are some missing management features, but this program is without a doubt a lot more visually appealing than iTunes. The iTunes player is as fun as reading a spreadsheet.   If you're going to buy music online, iTunes still has the best selection. I'd recommend buying from Amazon, which is cheaper, and comes without any DRM.  I managed to find a clever way to import my iTunes-purchased songs into my Zune library, while still abiding by "FairUse" guidelines.  The Zune marketplace requires you to buy credits in preset increments. I like  having the ability to buy one song at a time rather than having to pay $25 up front. The songs on Zune have their own currency as well, which isn't pegged to the US Dollar.  You might as well be paying in Euros.  You pay 100 cents for every 80 credits you receive. As most songs are 79 credits it appears a bargain until you do the math. This seems a bit deceptive and for this reason, I will not buy music from Zune marketplace.  It's a still good experience for sampling new music, however.

<Title>Horrible priority software !!!  Do not purchase
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I must preface my comments by saying that I am a professional videographer and producer for 15 years.  I had no problems with calculus at 15 years old. For the most part I am fairly adept at getting around what most would consider problems on the computer.   The good: The design itself is excellent and attractive.  The bad: Almost everything else  The software is by download only. Don't buy this as a present for a friend in a country where high speed internet is uncommon. I spent hours trying to upload my very rare collection of classical CD's that I spent thousands on.  I tried every trick I could think of to organize the files.  Originally I bought a Samsung K3 for a friend and had no problem upload the music. I believe the K3 can even operate without the Samsung software. I thought I could not go wrong with a Microsoft player that was second generation and offered 8 gigs of storage. I could not have been more wrong.  Unless you are satisfied with music downloads only you are wasting your money on this device.  If you are so lucky as to be able to get your files into this player you will then find out that both the software and the player have minds of their own.  No matter how painstaking you may label you files they software will rename the music. I may even revert some of the names to things on the web which are often incorrect.  I have no idea where it was getting the info from.  Originally I wanted to load some Pimsleur language CD's on it and the player failed miserably.  it refused to recognize my WMA files that were burned from my personal discs on windows media player.  After an extended effort I got "most" of them to be seen but they were placed in a very odd order. it is unacceptable to be forced to go through anything close to the procedures I went through.  It should not be a requirement to trick the player to get the music on.  It is obvious that Microsoft wants you to spend the extra money to buy their music.  It was only after the fact by going on line at the Zune site with a problem that they state how resistant the player is to any file that is not one of theirs. Check this out for yourself. Quote from Zune web page: If you buy protected songs from someplace other than Zune Marketplace, for example, they won't work with Zune. If your content is in a format that doesn't work with Zune and it's not protected, you might be able to convert it.    What is up with "might" be able to convert?  I cannot describe the frustration as a result of the hours I wasted trying to make this work.  I hate to be defeated but that is not even the point here.  The near complete lack of organizational ability in conjunction with the restrictiveness of this unit are nothing less than appalling.  this is in no way a "personal" player.  It is an unwitting investment in Microsoft.  ...and yes, I am a PC user exclusively.  A last note is that it is very susceptible to fingerprints and they are hard to remove from the screen.

<Title>Defintion of amazing
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Zune 8 came as almost a complete surprise to me. When i opened the box, it was almost as if i couldn't believe that it could be that small and that light. It's super thin, has a huge screen for it's size and is amazingly easy to navigate around. I could go on for a long time about the greatest thing about this amazing product, but instead I'm going to address the main issue.   THE SOFTWARE BLOWS -and how to fix that...  The main problem with the software is that it's clunky, slow, and syncs when you don't want it to, sometimes creating fifteen copies of one song.  EASY SOLUTION. In the setting panel, before even connecting your device, select that you don't want it to automatically sync anything. That means that whatever you tell it to put on there, it will put it on there and nothing else. Other then that, if you're patient, the software is actually pretty nice. Its super easy to use and has really nice aesthetics to it.   BOTTOM LINE: If you want a small player that won't break on you, get the Zune 8. If you want a high capacity player, get the Zune 80, which is identical to the Zune 8, except it has a hard drive and is a little bigger. Apple had better be biting its nails.

<Title>Great Media Player
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought the Zune at Best Buy with my gift card.  After I unpacked it, I set it up immediately on my computer.  For the features:  Whenever I start playing a song, the sound quality is great, but it sounds very loud, so I have to the volume down.  The pictures look very sharp on the screen because the resolution of the screen is 320 by 240 pixels.  Also, the wireless syncing feature is great and about the same speed as syncing with the USB cable.  Furthermore, I even customized the menu background with one of my pictures stored on the device, and it looks fantastic.  Whenever I scroll with my thumb, it works very well, but I have to swipe my finger on the Zune pad several times in order to scroll very quickly.  However, I haven't tried the song/photo-sharing, radio, and podcast features yet, but I'll let you know about these features after I test them out.  Also, I haven't tested out the battery life yet, but I'll let you know after I find out.  One last thing:  I will be much happier if Microsoft added the feature where the Zune can display song lyrics, so I can sing anytime, anywhere without carrying a bunch of papers.  For the design:  It's very small and lightweight but a little bit thicker than my second generation iPod nano, which I use it to only record lectures because I already bought the Zune.  Besides, the body color red looks beautiful, but the surface still shows fingerprints.  One thing I really like is the lanyard hole, so I can wear it around my neck.  Therefore, I'm very happy with the design.  Overall, the Zune is a great product.  I will definitely recommend this product to people who want to buy something alternative to the iPod nano.

<Title>Never owner an iPod, Zen, or any other player
<Date>Mon Dec 24 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Having Never owned a MP3 player before I don't have anything to really compare it to, but I'm pretty happy with the Zune. There are some things the prevent it from being perfect in my mind, but it is well worth the money and works real well for music. For the most part I'm impressed.  I did a lot of research before buying an MP3 player and decided on the Zune for a few reasons. Some of these reasons turned out not to be as important as I thought and others didn't work right out of the box, but a couple of them are really impressive. I was really intrigued by the Automatic Wireless syncing, but to do this you'll need to buy a separate AC power cable. You can still sync wirelessly by going to the menu on the Zune, but this uses up a lot of batteries and the only included way to charge it is with the USB cable. So, unless you're going to go out and buy the power cable you don't really get wireless syncing. Another thing that was advertised was syncing with your recorded windows media TV shows. I've tried setting this up, but I couldn't figure out an easy way to do it in the Zune Program. It could still be possible but, if it is it isn't as simple as syncing with your music collection. The one feature that really works and sold me on the device is the Zune pad. I tried it out in the store and it is even better in practice. It is really easy to scroll though the long lists of artist/albums/songs on the Zune.  The Zune player itself seems pretty well built. Its small and light weight. The screen looks beautiful for the album art and for pictures. Video looks good too, but it is a little small. The Zune Pad that I mentioned before is a great feature. You can brush the pad to scroll through music and change the volume. It also responds to pressing it like a button. Overall the Unit is pretty nice. Battery life is good enough from my experience, I've never ran out of power when I needed it. However, like I mentioned before I don't have anything to compare it too.  The software, though downloaded separately is a pretty big portion of this player and, thankfully, it works real well. When you first load it up it should be able to find all the music and photos and videos, unless you store them in a weird place. If thats the case you'll have to tell the program where your media is before it will find it. Syncing is painless and you can set it up to sync all your media, or just your music, or specific items. There are a lot of options for what to sync and what not to. Using the software is pretty intuitive and I doubt any one would have trouble getting acclimated to it. The Zune Store isn't too bad either. It uses Microsoft Points, which is 80 points per dollar and is the biggest downside, but the quality of the music is better than the music from iTunes. There isn't as much selection as iTunes, but for me most of my favorite music was there. You can actually download the software and give it a try without buying a Zune, which is something I recommend doing.  There is also a social aspect to the Zune, but I wont go into it much. Right now it consists of a Zune Card that shows what songs you've played and a friends list where you can track the plays of your friends. Right now it can only be accessed by going to zune.net. Unless you have a lot of friends who also have a zune, I don't see this being very useful.  Overall, the Zune if very functional and fun. Although it didn't live up to all my expectations, I am still very happy. The Zune is a great looking very fun portable music player and I would encourage people  to give it some consideration for their next MP3 player purchase. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

I had my mom install it on the computer because when i tryed it was to annoying and i was in a rush to play guitar hero 3. It took my mom about 3 hours to install it because we had to upgrade programs and they weren't working but after a bit i came over and just went by the directions and bam! it worked. I have about 200 songs and 2 shows on it, its awsome. The image quality is mind blowing and trust me on this buy zunes over ipods.

I own the 30gb, 8gb and the 80gb and this is my favorite out of all of them, and this is why, the screen is very sharp and the sound quality is amazing, I dont go anywere with out this thing, it's much cooler then the nano I really don't like ipods.... at all With ipods you can impress a few kids at school, but that's about it. With this and all Zunes you can customize the background, makeing it your own style. The red looks nothing like the red on the box, it has a  much more glossy color. The interface is outstanding and the zune marketplace is very simple and actully has a subscription to it's music which ipod does not.  You will want to buy a new pair of earphones because the pair it comes with suck, I suggest you go to your local fye and pick up a ten buck pair of skullcandy earphones. Oh yeah, the screen does not scratch  easily because it's made of glass.The 30 gb Zune's screen was made of plastic and it scratched super easily.  thanks  for reading :)

<Title>Superb alternative to the iPod
<Date>Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This second generation Zune is a lot of fun to use.  In my opinion, the the touch-sensitive Zunepad is easier and more intuitive to use than the Ipod's scroll wheel.  The Zunepad allows you to "swipe" to scroll, which makes it a breeze to manage long song lists.  I also prefer the Zune's snazzy interface to the iPod's, which is getting a bit boring.  The Zune software is also a pleasure to use, and makes it fun to explore new music (especially if you use ZunePass, the [...] monthly music subscription service).   On the downside, the Zune does not play nice with [...]: it's currently not possible to play Audible files on the Zune.  A Zune-friendly alternative is audiobooks.com, which offers their titles in universally compatible mp3 files, but they do not seem to have as many titles as audible.com, so if you're an avid audiobook listener, this may be an issue for you.  The Zune 8GB is well-designed and feels solid in your hand.  It's a very worthy alternative to the aging iPod line.

<Content>I used to work at an Apple store and that experience was enough to convince me that I would be a fool to purchase an iPod. I just purchased the Zune 8 GB and I must say I am very pleased with my purchase. I decided to finally purchase an MP3 player because I am sick of packing CDs around with me. The Zune is so easy to use and the on-board radio is a definite plus.  I don't care much for the headphones the Zune came with because they don't fit well in my ears.

<Title>Good Portable Media Player , but lacks expected WMP 11 integration
<Date>Sat Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>First, I will admit that the Zune, by itself, is a pretty impressive PMP.  I like how I can customize the background, subscribe to podcasts, and the high quality of audio output.  I received this as a Christmas gift from my wife, and I had expected that it would easily integrate with Windows Media Player (WMP) 11--wrong! WMP can't even see the Zune but it can see my brother-in-law's lower-priced no-name media player.  I expected that Microsoft would, AT A MINIMUM, allow users the option to sync directly with their Zunes from WMP.  Honestly, I'm quite disappointed in that fact.  When I get electronic hardware/peripherals that come from the same company, I expect it to seamlessly integrate into what is already established on everything else I have.  I shouldn't be required to download software that stands alone from what I'm used to/enjoy using to use peripherals from the same company.  On another note, I didn't have to experience this fortunately, since I hadn't ripped my CDs onto my computer yet or purchased a large amount of music online, but I'm going to echo a caveat from another fellow consumer that stated she had problems with synching her songs that she legally purchased previously.  To sum it all up, it's a nice player, but integration truly stinks.

The technology has gotten so much better that the Zune 8GB is about 1/5 the size of my 10GB Ipod. And my Ipod doesn't play vids and has a black and white display.  I checked out what was out there in very small MP3/vid/FM stereo players I narrowed it down to the Zune, Ipod Nano and the Sansa View. I already had an Ipod and I wanted to try something new.  When opening the box you see the incredible cutting edge marketing that was involved in competing with Apple. So I was initially blown away by opening up the package.  But then I got into comparing some of the features and the Ipod Nano started looking better. I was like - where is the EQ on the Zune . . . there is none! The Nano has EQ and you can play TV shows and output to your TV with it. You have to watch all your video sideways on the Zune and then the controls work differently because it is on its side. Also, I went to buy and arm band for the Zune so I could ride bike and work out and there is nothing out there. And if you want peripherals and speakers and stuff, it seems like everything is made for the Nano.   And the software interface of Itunes is so much better than Zune.  So I took back the 8GB Zune and got the 8GB Nano.   Ignore the stars above I give it 3 stars.

<Content>I wanted an MP3 player, but I didn't want to fall into the IPod crowd.  This is great!  It holds all my CD's, plus podcasts, and all my pictures, with tons of space to spare!  Very easy to operate, and the software is very user-friendly as well.  Even my computer-ignorant Dad could use this little treasure.  Highly recommend this for any Apple haters!

<Title>Great MP3/MP4 player with excellent radio
<Date>Sun Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a great product. It plays MP3's and videos very well and the FM radio is one of the best I've seen.  The only difficult part was getting the Zune setup software to work. It would not load on my Windows XP Pro 64-bit machine because it is not supported yet.  So I tried loading the Zune setup on my laptop from work and I got a cryptic error code. After some searching on the web I found it was due to the firewall at work and changed the BITS registry setting down to zero.  Overall I think the hardware is 5 stars, but Zune(microsoft) needs to get their act together on the software for Zune setup.  I think the setup could frustrate most beginner/novice users that run into problems.

<Content>The sound is great.  The size is good; small.  The interface is good.  The touchpad/control works pretty good, but when trying to press the center to 'enter' it's easy to press left, right, up, or down instead.  The touch scroll seems to work fine.  In order to download files to the zune you have to download software from Microsoft.  The software works fine.

<Content>Absolutely love my 8 gig Zune! As a 80gb Ipod Classic owner, I like my Zune better, and am purchasing a 80gb Zune.  I was looking for a flash player to kick around with. I choose this over the Nano & am glad I did.  Pros:  Has a FM Tuner!! (That I did not have to pay extra for)  Ease of navigation.   Easy to read the bigger letters at a glance.  Zune marketplace seems to have songs that Itunes does not.  The software works flawlessly with Vista Ultimate.   Cons: The headphone jack is on the bottom.  Lack of accessories.  In summary, this Zune surpasses the Ipod Nano. I cannot wait to order my 80gb Zune!!

<Title>Love the Zune
<Date>Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After playing with the new Zune UI I'm totally convinced that this is just about "perfect" - of course there are other more full featured players out there like the (lame) iPod Touch; however for the money, purpose and size - the Zune 4/8 is fantastic.   You've probably all heard of the neat features they've (finally) added like Podcasting but they've also added some best in class items like Wireless Sync.  This one has proven to be an awesome addition to the mix.  Think of it this way.  You're just about to got to work for the day and you don't want to go plug the thing into your computer.  Simply sync wirelessly and all your latest downloads and Podcasts are there in just a minute or two.   Last but not least, I bit the bullet and purchased the Zune Pass.  The Zune Pass is a all knowing ticket to download as many songs as you want and as long as you keep your subscription you can play them on your computer or Zune as much as you want. Couple this with the ability to share tracks with other Zune users and it really opens up the world of new music.    I would gladly reccomend the Zune to anyone who wants a GREAT player for music, videos and Podcasts.

<Content>I bought my Zune a few weeks ago and after I figured out a few quirks with the software I completely loved the thing.  Its compact, has great sound, is easy to navigate, and has a long battery life.    I haven't tried all of the features and options at this point but I have really enjoyed the product.  Hopfeully there will be more accessories offered as the popularity of the Zune grows.

<Title>What a drag
<Date>Sat Feb 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The form factor for this device is great.  I like it as well if not better then any of the iPods I have had.  Unfortunately like iPod iTunes, you are forced to use the proprietary Microsoft Zune software to put media on the device.  This would be OK if the software was not kludgey and lacked settings that would be nice to have access to, such as the simple ability to refresh your media collection after pointing it to a new folder.  It took me an exceedingly long time to rip several audio books, language CD's, and have the software correctly and consistently read the data that I had to manually enter.  For example, a Spanish language CD that I ripped did have consistent file names, however the Zune software interpreted it as having multiple "unknown" album titles (therefore multiple albums to sync) and inconsistent song names (therefore lessons not in order).  I guess I am classified as an "old fart" now and missed the reason why I can't just "drag and drop" my songs onto my device using MS Explorer.  The ancient MP3 players I used to have were able to do that.  So if you just want to plug in and play digital music you own or rip the CD's you buy this is a great device.  If however you just want to put your obscure stuff on a device and listen to it the Zune is overkill.

<Title>Big Disappointment
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Other posts had mentioned before - First it takes FOREVER to charge, second the battery seemed to go out right away.  The info says a life of 12 hours, more like 12 minutes.  Seriously, after I play a couple of songs, I stop, turn it off, put it on hold, and the next time I come back to it, it's dead and in need of a re-charge.  I've only had it for less than 2 weeks, and I was experiencing these issues the first day.  This alone was enough to call on a return, but wait, theres more...  Also, the ZUNE MARKETPLACE, or whatever it's called, fails in comparsion with iTunes.  The program never takes up an entire window space, so it looks like a pop-up, organizing your songs is a pain (it does play mp4s, but mine were unprotected), it looks like they were more intrested in making it pretty (it's pink) than making it user-friendly.  For now, that's a small issue for a new-comer but microsoft better get their act together.  I know microsoft does not want to copy the ipod too much, but the wheel is the biggest pain of all.  It's just that one big button, one button that you have to use for your ups, downs, sideways and enter.  So if your finger is not on the excat spot its suppose to be, your going to up when you want enter, vloume down when you want to enter and so on.  And lasty, the radio turner was a bust.  Everything is static.  Scrolling was a pain.  I really had high hopes for this product.  It looked really nice, especially compared to the nano 3rd genreation I was picking between.  It has video and radio, how could anything go wrong right?  Well, too many things.  You would think that with a 2nd generation, microsoft would be on top of things...

It is the first mp3 player that my wife can use without asking me for help on how to get files on and off it.  With the ipod she couldn't figure it out and it itunes froze every computer we ever put it on.  I was so frustrated with the ipod that one day i just threw it out the window onto a busy street.

<Title>Great MP3 player
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This was my first mp3 player EVER, so I did my reasearch before I bought.  I'm very happy with the product and it sounds great-takes some getting used to, simply because I personally have never had one.  The only drawback is not the product itself, it is the marketplace-where you buy your music.  It advertises about 3 million + songs, however, it doesn't have alot of songs I am looking for-mostly dance music, as I wanted to use it for when I to my cardio workouts.  I was very disappointed also, when I couldn't take files from my computer and put them on the Zune-I tried many many ways, but just couldn't do it.  I will keep trying, there may be a secret to it-I just haven't figured it out yet.  There are ALOT of songs on the marketplace, don't get me wrong, but just not all the ones I was wanting!!!  Still a great product, tho!!!

<Title>Testing the portable media waters again
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>To be honest, when I got a Zune for Christmas, I wasn't too sure that I'd like it.  I had an iPod before, but like almost everyone I know, it broke  (non-mechanical failure, no less!) and simply wasn't worth repairing for $100+.  As a result, I decided I'd just be fine without an mp3 player during my workouts and such.  When I first opened the Zune, I was pleasantly surprised at the very small size.  It is comparable to my brother's older iPod Nano, but has a much larger screen.  The menus worked well and the touch sensitive scrolling is very simple.  The layout and operation are nice and easy, as expected for such a device.  After going through the installation process, I just highlighted all the artists in my music library and dragged them to sync.  It takes a while to put 8 gigs of music on to one of these, but that's to be expected, obviously.  I also tested out a video file just to see (I don't think I'll be keeping videos on this for the most part; I have too much music fighting for the space) and it looked great.  The subtitles were small but legible.  The radio works well - I didn't test the wireless stuff or the podcasts yet since I don't know anyone with a Zune.  The music quality is pretty much what you'd expect.  MP3s sound the about the same no matter what the source is.  The headphones are what makes the difference.  The earbuds that come with the Zune are fine if you like that style, but they always seem to fall out of my ears when I move my head (the iPod ones did too), so I spent 10 bucks on a cheapo pair of Philips headphones that clip onto your ears at Wal-mart.  If you've got problems with regular earbud headphones and aren't an audiophile, I'd recommend the simple, cheap, hook-on earbud-style headphones.  I can hear my music and the world around me (if I want to) without a problem.  The only complaint I have with the Zune is the lack of cases/accessories, but hopefully more will come once they become popular.  I've been hearing more and more positive reviews of the Zune and, I know a ton of people that are tired of their iPods breaking after only a year or so of casual use, so perhaps the iPod won't rule the world completely in the future.  I'm definitely very pleased with mine and would gladly recommend it to anyone.

<Title>Zune in, iPods out!
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I really like my Zune.  I use to have an iPod mini and eh, there was nothing special about it except the cost!  I've come to realize that if you don't want to pay for just a name, pass on the iPod.  The Zune I got has the most vibrant screen I've ever seen on an MP3 player, it does everything an iPod does but at half the cost, and it's much easier to use then the iPod.  I've had my Zune for about 2 weeks now and so far so good, it seems to do well against drops and scratches.  And the first time I hooked it to my computer and downloaded about 600 song to it, it took only 5 or 6 minutes.   Bottom line:  It's of better quality and price then an iPhone.  It sounds awesome and it plays forever before needing a charge again.

<Title>Move over iPod, Zune is in town
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>First I'll say I've used an iPod for over years. It's a nice player but I always struggled with certain features. Its restrictive in what you can do with it and every time a new update for iTunes came down the pike, it would take me what seemed like hours to get everything working again.  Anyway ...  My wife wants an MP3 to use for exercise. It MUST have an FM radio because several TV's are available in her exercise studio and the audio is broadcast on low power FM frequencies.  After looking around I decide to try the Zune. I am nothing but impressed.  First of course it has the FM tuner and reception is pretty good. After installing the Zune Marketplace software I see why no instructions are packed with the unit. You simply do not need any. The interface and features of both the Zune player and software are very simple and intuitive. My wife has tried other MP3 players and was always calling me to try and figure out how to do this or that. Within 30 minutes, she had mastered the Zune and hasn't called me one time to explained something to her.  She loves the LCD screen and how easy it is to add and remove photos. She loves how easy it is to create play lists and add new music. I gave her the 8GB model and last I heard, she had almost 50 albums and 100 photos on it and it was barely half full.  Ripping music from CD's is extremely easy and they rip in standard MP3 format. Nothing proprietary, music you can play on any thing or burn to CD.  It has a infrared transmitter so you can trade songs with friends.  Finally, its wireless. Again, my wife can update her music and photos on her PC, simply turn on the Zune, it connects to our wireless home network and automatically updates.  To be honest, Zune is by far the BEST MP3 player I have yet to see.  iPod gets a lot of hype but it must be good marketing, its sure not about features and usability.

<Title>Too static sensitive
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the Zune 8 Gb 2nd Generation in January of 2008.  I loved the product's features, particularly the FM radio with station and song identification.  The Zune software is well designed, and the wireless is OK, however, it's really just an "invisible" USB cable.  You still have to choose songs, etc., using your computer.   My Zune immediately started rebooting itself, randomly, once or twice per hour.  Web reviews said the problem is common, and is the result of static electricity.  I tried everything ... housing it in protective covers, and so on, but no result.  Microsoft tech support did not help either, and did not admit to any static electricity problems.   So ... I returned it.   If it had worked, this would have been a 5 star review.

<Title>Almost, but not quite
<Date>Thu Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>After having a couple of small mp3 players and being limited by their 1 and 2G sizes, I decided to bite the bullet and give the 8G Zune a try.  The good: Fantastic packaging and quality; when opening the box and handling the Zune for the first time, I felt like I was handling something special. The screen resolution is excellent and surprisingly useful. Once you play with it a little, operation and navigation is intuitive.  The Bad: I'll try not to be long-winded here... If you like your music and videos to be even somewhat organized, this thing will frustrate you to no end. I'm accustomed to the drag-n-drop convenience of my mp3 players, maintaining any directory structure and folders I create. Not so here; you are limited by the Zune software for syncing, and no organizational power is given. Zune doesn't know how to deal with my Jazz and classical sampler CD's, separating the tracks and scattering them about in a long "various artists" list. The software totally ignores some of my CD's and seems to be picky about video codecs, as it won't sync many of my mp4 and wmv videos. Other media software such as Media Monkey can't be used to sync either, not even Microsoft's own Windows Media Player! Also, forget using it for external storage; there is a hack to allow this, but it requires a routine every time you want to use it. Ugh. Oh, and just because your cheap mp3 player has useful features like an equalizer, don't expect to find it here, nope, no EQ.  So I took it back. I'll try again in a couple of years when MS figures it out. Perhaps MS should consider letting their clever package designers have a crack at product design...

<Title>Thank u Santa!
<Date>Fri Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this little item for myself for xmas and my daughter got the 4gb. Well, we are both happy, but speaking just for me, I am excited. It's got a lot of features that I am still learning about. See, I was using my 4gb creative zen plus and it's ok, but the Zune is a big step up for me.  First, it was simple to download the software, after that it was ready to go. I must admit though my daughter had to show me how to add songs to it but hey, we gotta learn somehow. Anyway, now I'm a pro.   Then the sound. It's GREAT! I have no complaints so far. My previous one(Zen) required me having to adjust and readjust the equalizer- alot of songs were staticky.(Not sure if it was the earbuds that came with it) But with the Zune- I am so happy. The songs are clear and sound really good. (I'm not sure if it has an equalizer, but so far I have no need for one)Also, now I can rewind and fast forward songs, which is not available on the Zen. Next, the radio. Very easy to preset stations. It provides the name of the artist and song that is playing at the time. Cool, I no longer have to guess. With my Zen, I never could figure out how to preset those darn stations and that urked me.  The social feature on the Zune is very different. You can share a song with a friend by sending it to them (Zune to Zune). And the song can be listened to by the receiver 3 times. It can then be added to a wishlist on their device which I haven't used yet so I'm not too sure how it works. Anyway, my daughter and I share songs and that part is simple to do- just click the song and press send. The device will search for a nearby zune user, u select who to send it to if more than one comes up by chance. Lastly, I can store photos, recorded video, podcasts(which I'm learning about too)These are small video clips (some are audio only) that are free(?) from the Zune website. Not sure if all are free but the ones that I looked at were free. I noticed that there are subscriptions available. They are categorized by interests/hobbies. Just select and download then sync to the device.There are already some preloaded. The screen is so clear,video and pictures look really good. Did I mention the color? Cute. As grown as I am even though I'm a bit of a tomboy, I couldn't deny the pink. The only thing that I'm not happy with is that I am having the hardest time finding accessories for this thing. Every where I go, ipod this and ipod that. Well I don't have an ipod and don't want one. All I want is a nice cover or case, it can be a belt clip or even a sports arm band- just something to protect it that doesn't look like crap.(After all I would like to protect my investment with something. I am careful, but it could fall then that would probably be the end of that) But the main thing is I like choices and so far I haven't really found any. That is the only downfall about owning this item for me. Other than that, I am very pleased with the features and style and would recommend this to anyone. Especially, if you are a gadget freak, like me.

<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>To be very short about it, It does what it suppose to do and does it good, the only problem with zune is some software problems, nothing big. Unless you have old DRM mp3 files, like msn music, then you F...ed, it doesn't support old DRMs. So better if your music is DRM free. My biggest problem was that the idea of small mp3 players like this, is to take it with you when you go workout. And for that, you will need armband/sportsband of some kind. You know what, there are none design for Flash Zune. I end up buying one for older ipod, from amazon, works not to bad. But thats where I would rather stick with ipod. There are hundreds of accessories with only very few for Zune. The Another thing I don't understand, why the is no clock? Ok maybe I wasn't that short :)
