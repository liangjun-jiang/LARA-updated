<Title>Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice 
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store.  I think this is the best iPod yet.  It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy.  An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen.  Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise.  There are some downsides.  The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit.  Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space. It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately.  Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available.  I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free! [...] This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few.  This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc.  I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!  Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!

<Title>What nobody has mentioned yet ... SOUND!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This isn't going to be long and boring because everything good/bad has been said so far. Good - size, flash memory, photo ability, etc..  Bad - I got black and it scratches VERY easily! I only had it 2 days and from carrying it in my pocket, the front looks very scratched like I had it a few years already.  Also, don't know why they put the headphone jack on the bottom ... and so far there's no belt clip for this.  Only a lanyard headphone or an armband.  I need a belt clip for the gym.  Anyway, the sound ...  I only listen to my players CRANKED!  Every MP3 player I've ever bought, including my previous 3 ipods, I listen to at full volume.  So, just to test, I got my 6 gb ipod mini and put it side by side with my new Nano.  I started "Walk" by Pantera simultaneously on both players and took my best pair of headphones going back and forth from one player to the other.  Well, the new Nano BLEW AWAY my 6 gb ipod!  Noticeably louder, deeper bass, and my favorite, much sharper and higher treble!  I hate to admit it, but it makes my 6 gb mini sound like crap. (Hello ebay!) I can't comment on the battery life yet at that volume, but I'm sure it will be much shorter than the 14 hours they say.  But if you buy this player for no other reason ... buy it for the SOUND!

<Title>I love it
<Date>Sun Sep 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had my iPod Nano for about a week now and I really like it.  My first impression of it was how small it was.  Small enough but not to small, they struck a good balance with the Nano.    The screen is a very resolution so it can show more information than the larger screen on the mini, not to mention that it's also in color.  The sound quality is great and it has a very good range of volume levels.  This player is another good one from Apple and an improvement over the mini.  My only problem I have with Nano is that any finger prints shows up on the black surface and the shiny metal back.  The black surface is very easy to scratch. But overall a great product.

<Title>Simply Brilliant
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had my nano for a week and a half now and am loving it.  It is so tiny that I can carry it in my wallet - but it is still sized well to hold comfortably in the hand.  The sound quality and output is excelent.  The black does show fingerprints and scratches easily, but it just looks way to cool.  It is comfortable to use and the screen (though slightly smaller than the other ipods) is very crisp and easy to read.  Navigation with the clickwheel is just as easy as the larger ipods.  And I actually like the headphone port on the bottom better than on top (and I don't use a lanyard) - it just makes more sense-it takes some getting use to, but once you do, you'll love it just as much as you like everything else about the Nano.  This thing is super durable and you don't need to worry about breaking it.  Some complain about the price, but really, it is an excellent buy - you're paying for:  4gb of flash storage (the 1st flash player anywhere near that much storage), the tiny size, the color screen, and the flatout beauty of this thing.  No other player comes even close.  Just buy it!

<Title>Using I-Pod Nano with USB 1.1 Macs
<Date>Mon Sep 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I purchased the nano from my local Fry's electronics.  4gig, black.  I'm using it with a 1Ghz Powerbook G4 15" 10/10/1000 ethernet, DVI, but NOT USB 2.0...  which poses a problem because the Nano does not support sync via firewire.(although it can be charged over firewire)  The lack of firewire, my only real complaint about the nano, and aside from that, there is very little to find fault in aside from an overly bright screen (see below).  I've overcome the lack of firewire compatability by upgrading my laptop to USB 2.0 through the purchase of a $24 USB 2.0 PCMCIA card from Fry's.  For about the same cost as what I would have had to pay for the firewire cable anyway (if it were useful for anything other than charging) I have a PCMCIA card that provides compatability in addition to fast USB for external hard disks, etc...  The mac (osx panther) recognized the card immediately, without the need for drivers, etc.  Sync was very very fast, transfering complete songs in less than 1 second per song in many cases.  FAST transfers.  Fry's had numerous models of cards, some with Firewire and USB 2.0, other's with just firewire, and still others with only USB.  I purchased the least expensive, USB 2.0 only card that, only on the back of the package in fine type did it mention macs... and it works almost perfectly.  (note unplug the card before closing the powerbook lid or it won't sleep, and won't wake up the monitor, forcing a restart... this is the only issue I've encountered)  Regarding the Nano.  Small, stupid small, almost too small...almost.  Click wheel works great, volume is powerful, songs are accessed immediatly with no delay (flash memory).  As there is no hard disk to be scrambled from impacts, it is able to take minor drops without issue.  And when it does fall, the thing is so light that it almost always falls softly.  Syncs are very very quick using USB 2.0.  (I frequently wipe all the songs and re-upload rather than poke through them when I want to make changes.  Uploading about 3 gigs of music takes around 30-40 seconds at most)  The unit is light weight enough that I often pick it up by the headphone cord with no fear of it unplugging and falling.  The stock earbuds sound great, but hurt my ears after extended listening.  I currently use some foam earbuds I already owned.  Others have no problems with the ear buds, so I think it's just dependant upon the shape of one's ears.  My only other complaint and I'm sure it can be overcome with a firmware upgrade, is that the white LED back light is blindingly bright at night.  When in the car using it, it actually almost hurts to look at it.  When the back light turns off, it does so by quickly fading out, so the capability to vary brightness is there, and needs to only have a menu option added to control it for low light use.  If I had to think up anything else wrong, I would say it the black moel shows fingerprints and smudges too easily. (but it looks sooo good in black)... but really, disregarding the lack of firewire which I'm sure would have added size, and since mose people already have USB 2.0 anyway could afford to be sacrificed... If the best complaints I can come up with are "a screen that's too bright", and "shows smudges", then this one is most certainly a winner.    -Jason

<Title>not perfect, but as good as you are gonna get for a while
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>style is everything as far as the ipod nano is concerned.  i went out and bought a 4gb black the day it came out, not knowing that it would be in such a short supply in later days.  after playing with it for a couple of weeks, i would say that it is the best mp3 player to date, all things considered.  yet, it is far from being perfect, and i don't ask for much.  i just want a recording feature, like a lot of the low end cheap mp3 players, but no ipod nano doesn't come with recording feature.  otherwise, ipod nano is the perfect companion to my 60gb ipod, which is getting heavier and bulkier by the day.

<Title>THE biggest revolution
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When Steve Jobs said the nano wiould be the biggest revolution since the original iPod, he wasn't kidding. The nano is the most impressive thing I have ever held in my hands. I was really into this product from the start, but certain aspects of the player never hit me until I actually held it.  The day I got mine, my jaw droppped. How could something so small be an iPod? Well, after using mine, I know this is by far the best mp3 player I have ever seen.  I wont go into the specs, as other reviewers already have.   But I will state some things that are wrong with it.  First, I was somewhat disapointed to hear it was USB 2.0 only. My old iPod was firewire, and since I have a mac computer, I never really ever used 2.0. The time to load music was noticable. While takes my 3rd gen Ipod to load my entire library only about 5 minutes, it took my nano about 8-10 minutes to lload only 800 songs. Its not that big a deal, but still...  The other thing is not really that big a deal either, but it is something i found wierd about the player. The headphone jack is on the bottom, instead of on top like it had been for 4 years. I mean, its not the end of the world, I just find that choice very odd.  One other thing a lot of people have talked about was value. Yes, this little guy is somewhat of a rip off. Why not just pay $50 more, and get an iPod with 5 times the space? Again, it comes down to "cool" factor, something the Nano drips of.  However, these "flaws" would by no means make me change my mind on my purchase. This is still THE mp3 product on the market. I bought mine becuase I love apple stuff, and my old one was dying on me. Im glad I bought this thing.

<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a great unit.  More memory than you could possibly need, plus the added bonus of picture viewing.  I've had this one since March 2006 with no technical issues, and I have heard that the new ones that come in different colors have problems so it's too bad they don't make this one anymore.  The menu is easy to navigate and finding the song you want is simple.  The do it yourself on-the-go playlist is great so you can change and add the songs you want to hear.  Great player, definitely buy a cheap wall charger and/or car charger for this because the color screen chews up the battery life.

<Title>What the shuffle should have been!
<Date>Sun Sep 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is exactly what Apple should have been working on instead of the Shuffle.  I've purchased several Shuffles for myself and my family, and absolutely love them.  But, I have the same compliants as everyone else, no screen, small capacity, different accessories from other iPods, etc.  The nano addresses all of these concerns without sacrificing the sound quality that first drew to the Shuffle.  The nano's small size, vibrant color screen, standard iPod connector, long battery life, and large song capacity make it the most attractive option in the iPod line.  The lack of moving parts inside improve the sound quality, battery life, and durability of the device (it uses solid-state memory like the Shuffle, instead of a micro-disk like the larger iPods).  Additionally, the color screen, photo llbrary, and built-in Podcast support are welcome features.  The nano does suffer from the one drawback inherited from it's larger cousins - the device is beautiful, but the case tarnishes and scratches easily.  I'm looking forward to purchasing the iPod nano "tubes" to cover and protect my nano once Apple releases them.  Overall, the best technology value I've encountered in a long time.

<Title>Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
<Date>Tue Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat.  Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.  The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer.  The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world.  In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini.  Why?  They had something better: the iPod Nano.  Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic."  While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.    Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute.  Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil.  In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle.   Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces.  Weight is another jaw-dropping figure.  The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.    Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable?  Don't be!  The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable.  Why?  The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player.  The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.    Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.  The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.  Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic.  It features a nice resolution, and color.  You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music.  There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.    Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.    Color - White is the traditional iPod color, but this black iPod nano is proving to be incredibly popular.  Just note that the black is more likely to show scratches and fingerprints.  Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano.  Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world.  Apple is one of those companies.  The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>I didn't think it was THAT small
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The iPod nano is the gutsy move by Apple to replace their bestselling iPod mini.  What will previous generation iPod and iPod mini owners think of the nano?  Pros:  * Flash memory, not hardrive based which means no moving parts and no skipping or momentary delays when selecting a new track  * Incredibly thin.  The commercials don't do it justice, you have to feel it to believe it  * Sexy new black option without including Bono worship  * Lots of new features, a world clock with all sorts of timezone, a screen lock to keep out iPod leeches, and a stopwatch.  * Lovely color screen  * Built tough, will survive all sorts of drops.  The exception is the scratching on the Lucite.  You most likely won't bend it sitting on it.  Cons:  * Shows scratches much more readily than the iPod mini's brushed steel look.   * Fairly expensive for the capacity.  2 gigs for $200 and 4 gigs for $250, a bit disappointing for those who were expecting a 6 gig flash release from Apple  * Screen is too small to show detail in pictures  * No firewire port  * No TV outlet for showing off pictures yet  * So thin you might leave it in your jeans... through the washer and dryer cycle.  I highly recommend buying the iPod nano, especially for iPod mini owners.  Its great for gym and travelling and other bumpy rides.  I also recommend getting a case for it so you don't get it all scratched up.

<Title>Sets a new bar for music players
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Have always been a loyal creative customer till now. Apple has redefined the mp3 player space, with this release. A 4gb flash player for 250 dollars is a really good deal, considering other vendors currently sell a 1 GB flash player for 120 bucks. Samsung has provided a sweet deal to Apple, allowing them to price the player at such aggressive terms. The biggest surprise of this player is the nice lcd screen that comes with it. It is very sharp and very clear. Apple should update the ipod nano, to allow it to host video clips on it. Nano has an included solitaire game , that is very sharp and clear on the LCD screen. Nano will shake up this space, and will quickly become the defacto king of music player space. Though in the long run, there is no reason, why cell phones will not have 4 GB flash chips to hold the songs, video clips etc. I bought the black nano, which interestingly was shipped directly from shenzen, china. I recommend the white nano instead, as the black color shows the fingerprint imprints very easily. Highly recommended. Apple should have included a case with it, as it is so small, that U can lose it very easily.

<Title>VERY cool...but not for everyone
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon. It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 80% of it away? Don't think so. I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now: I NEED to take my entire music collection around with me everywhere I go. It's as essential as my cell phone and Metro Card. But the Nano really is a cool machine, and I imagine it will overtake the higher capacity iPods in popularity shortly because of its size, price, and cool factor.  Here's what I consider the improvements to be: 1. First and foremost, the transition to flash memory. This enables the Nano to be smaller and operate quieter than iPods that are hard drive-based. Make no mistake, flash memory is the future of digital music players; 2. The size, duh. Apple has made the Nano smaller without compromising much of the bright colorful screen. As we all now by now, it is thinner than a number two pencil (my 20GB iPod Photo, on the other hand, is probably three pencils thick). But it's still too large and delicate to jog with, without an optional accessory or two (arm band, lanyard headphones); and 3. The Apple-brand accessories that have been released concurrently with the Nano are affordable and well-designed.  ...And what's not-so-great: 1. The price drop isn't that substantial, especially for what you get. For an extra $50, you can upgrade to a Photo that has 5x times the capacity; and 2. The headphone jack is on the bottom of the Nano. I'm not sure what the logic behind this is--it seems like making a change for the sake of making a change to me.  Some wonderful things about the color iPods in general: they're very easy to use; their petite size could hardly be improved upon; the color screen is beyond adequate for viewing photos and album art; the battery life is exceptional; making playlists and controlling iTunes are simple tasks; all are compatible with Mac or Windows; and if you use a Mac, you can sync your iPod with your address book, to do list, and calendar (this has come in handy for me a number of times when I'm traveling). Also, if you're a college student or an educator at any level, the Apple Store (both the b&m and online versions) gives discounts on just about everything. For iPods it's about $20, but for computers it's up to $300.  The bottom line on the Nano: it's a great entry-level MP3 player that will probably suffice for most listeners. However, if you're a music warrior who listens for many hours a day, many days a week, then 4GB is just too small to suit you--but of course you've had an iPod for three years now, and you already knew that.

<Title>Apple iPod Nano Review
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought this iPod nano 4GB Black on September 8th and I recieved it September 12th. I was expecting Apple not to discontinue the widely famous iPod mini but I guess they did. Rumors and speculations said that Apple was going to make a 8GB mini with a color screen but in the end they discontinued the line all together. The nano isn't perfect though. The gigabyte to price ratio is horrible and the battery life isn't that good. The 2GB nano is $99.50 per gigabyte while the 4GB nano is 62.25 per gigabyte. Much more than the iPod mini's. The battery life is rated at 14 hours. I got up to 16 to 17 hours which is good but my friends said their new iPod mini can get up to 23 hours! The design is sexy but, the smudges and scratches attract a second after you peel off the protective paper. The mini had a case that didn't deter any real scratches and smudges. You have to buy a case for this iPod while you didn't have to for the mini.  But, it's a fresh start with the iPod line and it's right now my personal favorite. 4GB holds around 1,000 songs, I have 939 songs (on various qualities, etc.). It comes with the iPod CD with iTunes 5 (the new one). iTunes 5 is nice cosmetically (Apple changed it a little bit) but, there is no major change. There are color choices with the nano: Black or White but black is a little bit better looking (but shows smudges and scratches more). The prices are $199.99 for 2GB (500 songs) and $249.99 for 4GB (1,000 songs). The screen lock is pretty cool I have to admit, I just set up my code and if someone tries to use my iPod, the iPod screen will be locked out. Another thing which is nice is the thickness. It's the smallest iPod in depth (.27") but it isn't the all around smallest iPod. The pictures are small but, this isn't a picture viewer to be honest with you. You should buy the accessory to put the pictures on our television instead. Another problem I have with this iPod is the accessories that come in the box. It just comes with the iPod nano, headphones, USB 2.0 cord, iPod CD, Manual, and a dock adapter. iPod has really been cutting back ever since they released the 4th Generation iPod but, atleast that came with FireWire while none of the iPod's now do. All together, this iPod is beautiful but if your a power user (like me) you will not like this so much. The iPod mini has some advantages over this one but, this iPod has advantages over the mini too. So, if you're getting a new iPod and you just have about 400-900 songs, this iPod will be perfect for you.

<Content>When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.   Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, "impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.   Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.   It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.   Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.   Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is the best value. It is only $50 more than the 2-gigabyte model, so you get twice as much storage, for only $50 more. Don't forget you can also backup important files to your iPod, so you may find some extra space valuable. The 4-gigaybtes is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs.   Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.   Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.   Color - White is the traditional iPod color, and the white-colored iPod Nano will match many other Apple products. However, the black iPod nano is an intense and sleek finish, beautiful in person. It might show scratches and fingerprints more easily, but it looks so great that it may be the most popular color choice of this new player.   Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.   Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

<Title>Nano vs Mini - not bad tradeoff
<Date>Sat Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>BACKGROUND: i currently own: 4gig Nano, 30gig Photo, 512mb Shuffle... Use PC & Mac... Note, I am NOT recommending the 2gig Nano @ $199.  =======  BOTTOM LINE =======  BUY THIS NOW IF: (1) need a `exercise' music player, (2) this is your second iPod, (3) don't need over 2-4gigs of music (500-1000 songs) (4) if you're NOT willing to wait till the holidays (Nov-05), cuz most likely you'll get a price drop... and a 4gig Nano at $199 is a NO BRAINER PURCHASE...way beyond 5 star rating, MORE LIKE 7 STARS!  WAIT TILL HOLIDAYS IF: (1) want to get the absolute best deal, (2) this is your first iPod, (3) you are buying this as a Christmas gift.  ***Keep in Mind***: 4gig Nano will most likely drop in price to $199 during holidays, while a newly introduced 6gig Nano should be $249 ***NEXT PRICE DROP DURING HOLIDAYS 2005*** nano 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $14/hour battery time &lt;highly recommended> nano 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $18/hour battery time &lt;recommended>  ===== VALUE ======= PROS: (1) size - amazing! (2) weight/portability - amazing! (3) color screen, (4) faster interface - due to flash memory, (4) unbelievably cool looking. CONS: (1) @ $249 for 4gigs, more expensive than Mini for storage and battery (per-gig and per hour battery), (2) No significant new innovation other than size/appearance, (3) no FireWire - slow updates, (4) no iTalk, iTrip, or any top-connecting accessories that use remote control port.   NOTE - CURRENT PRCING:  nano 2gig @ $199 =  $100/gig OR $14/hour battery time nano 4gig @ $249 = $62/gig OR $18/hour battery time mini 4gig @ $199 = $50/gig OR $11/hour battery time mini 6gig @ $249 = $40/gig OR $14/hour battery time  ===== DETAILS ======= 1) SIZE/WEIGHT: Simply amazing... you can see for yourself...I really cannot convey to you how much `coolness' is packed into this tiny lightweight package... Super thin... about half the thickness as the Motorola RAZR.   2) COSMETIC CHANGES & SCREEN: Color screen is smaller than other color models, fonts smaller, click wheel smaller, still scratches and smudges like the rest... headphone jack is on the bottom (a good thing) and still displays album art... screen resolution is clearly less than the iPod Photo  3) PHOTO QUALITY: Not very good, still syncs w/ my iPhoto and Adobe Elements... but pictures have less resolution when I compare my 30gig iPod photo and the Nano side-by-side. PHOTOS ON MY TV: Not available.  4) MUSIC: Really no improvements here... but no steps back either.  5) USB 2.0 UPDATE TIMES: Slow for initial load (full capacity)....normal FireWire iPod on Mac is about 1 second per song (no FireWire use on Nano) ...USB on Mac is 2.5 seconds/song... USB on PC is about 2-3 seconds/song... longest test was PC formatted Nano, updating on a Mac = 4-5sec/song!!! ... hopefully Apple will soon enable FireWire connectivity for Nano.   6) BATTERY LIFE: Didn't really run above spec in my tests: ~14hrs w/ no backlight.... 10hrs31min w/ backlight set at 5 seconds...and normal amount of navigation.   7) FUNNY QUERKS: (1) No FireWire updates, but seems to charge via-FireWire, (2) Screen "washes out" when viewed at an angle... same for the iPod Photo or Mini, but not as severe.   ===== SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX =====  A) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE: In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing photo albums automatically, etc..., you need to purchase or own iLife (iPhoto specifically) 4.03 or better.  If you have PC, you have to buy Adobe Photoshop Elements.   B) SLIDESHOWS: without the TV-output capability, there is no use for this on this iPod... sux.    D) ITUNES 5.0: Cool new feature is ability to create `folders' for your playlists... if you have too many playlists, then this feature is great... but the navigation does not translate to your iPod Nano... you still have to use a million playlists on the same scroll column.   E) NO AC ADAPTER: You must charge from a powered USB 2.0 port... note, most USB 1.0 ports are not powered, nor does a 1.0 port update your songs.

<Title>It would be five stars were it not for iTunes
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Wonderful design. Aesthetically appealing. The quality of the sound is excelllent. Size is amazing.... the screen is wonderful... the list goes on ...  HOWEVER..... in order to do anything, you have to go through iTunes, and there's no direct mapping of ripped files and folders to transfer... Album covers are not automatically retrieved like MS Media player.

<Title>Before you take the plunge ...
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I love the iPod. Always have. At home, we have five, including this one: the 4GB iPod nano black.  Before you leap, realize two things: (1) this iPod is extremely fragile compared to other iPods, particularly the tough-as-nails iPod mini (a drop of a couple of feet onto a linoleum floor took out the screen); and (2) the black version gets scratched very easily, and shows scratches far more than any white iPod I've owned (after a day and before dropping the damn thing, it already looked awful from scratching -- and it was treated with kid gloves).  Okay, if you can live with those caveats, and invest in a durable protector (we bought the arm-band holder, which does a lousy job of protecting the iPod nano)--none of which are out yet--then this new iPod is truly an amazing bit of technology. It's tiny (it feels even smaller than the photos suggest), has great sound quality (better, I think, than any other iPod I've owned), and the display is gorgeous (even though tiny).  For me, the mini (now defunct, but bargains still abound) is the better choice given its sturdiness. I'm not up for museum-relic care for my electronics, which would certainly help if you own one of these.  Another beautiful, functional gizmo from Apple.  Just know what you're getting.  Some websites claim the nano is sturdy. I can tell you, from first hand experience, it isn't.  So, you be the judge. (Sure, the thing still played, but replacing the screen will set you back at least $90, and, even on the web sites in question, the screen broke.)  (Oh, and if you see someone taking shots at the iTunes software, don't believe it. It's the best music software out there, and its integration with this--or any--iPod is a joy.)  __________  Follow up ... Apple has admitted a problem with some of the nano screens and is doing the right thing: replacing the units with new ones. BRAVO!

<Title>Is it fragile
<Date>Tue Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Anybody worry about breaking this one can go &lt;A HREF=http://feeds.feedburner.com/arstechnica/BAaf?m=932>Here&lt;/A> and read their review. A quote: "At this point we were astounded that the iPod nano was still working properly, albeit with a broken display. Because we had honestly expected the iPod nano to break by this time, we were forced to depart from our planned schedule of destruction and try and run over it with the car. Surely, we thought, it could never withstand the crushing power of German automotive engineering."...

<Title>CLOSE TO PERFECTION
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>WOW!  Everyone who has seen my black 4G ipod has ordered one, even those who hated ipods for no reason.  This is an amazing engineering feat, I have no idea how they fit all that in to a player the size of a credit card.    It's got a beautiful color screen, syncs with your outlook contacts and calendar, stores photos, games, clocks, and best of all it's got iTunes.  I really don;t see how they could improve on this besides maybe getting a protective coating on the black nano.  It does scratch real easy.  And contraty to what was posted, you can get 2 lines of free laser engraving when you order from the apple store online.  Also, the battery lasts plenty 14 hours, who wants to carry around bulky AAA batteries around all the time.  I think the competition might just have to close shop pretty soon.

<Title>Amazing technological leap doesn't even look real!
<Date>Wed Sep 21 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>You have to physically handle and hold the new iPod Nano to believe it is real. It is approximately 1 ounce in weight, so almost unnoticable on your person - whether it's in a pocket or an armband. The small color screen is stunningly brilliant in brightness and color definition.  The black iPod shows fingerprints more prominently than the white version - but ooh la la, it is most sexilicious to look at! I'd personally love to see one of these in red as well.  Because they are so new, third party vendors haven't had much of a chance to make cases and other products for the Nano.   There are only a handful of already existing products out there that are already compatible with the Nano...  Available FM Transmitters: Forget the iTrip and those of that ilk - current versions won't work with the Nano. Your choices for now are the Belkin (which is buggy) and the Monster iCar Play Plus. The Monster version isn't cheap, but it's an integrated charger and FM transmitter and is one of the best out there.   Available Cases: The Apple branded armband - looks like a glorified bandaid in the case, but looks decent when you wear it Apple branded Tubes - good luck finding one, most Apple Stores still haven't gotten any in stock Apple branded iPod Socks - designed for the older iPods, they work fine with the Nano - but can cause minor scratches  Available Speakers that Charge: The JBL OnStage - fits fine, sounds great The Bose Sound Dock - is visibly off-center, but fits fine, sounds freakin' awesome Altec Lancing's IM3 for full and mini - fits but sound is lackluster Klipsch - sounds great... Nano is greatly dwarfed, however by such large equipment... akin to building a superdome around a book of matches.  By the time you read this review, 10 other vendors will have probably already submitted their patents and copyrights to lawyers for new gizmos.  Apple has announced that the new configuration of how the Nano connection is set up will be the NEW standard for all forthcoming iPods... this will help vendors make products more quickly and without quaking in their boots that by the time they get something to market, it will be outdated - and should encourage lots of new development like we have yet to have seen thus far in the iPod accessory industry.  The Nano adds a World Clock, a stop watch and a combination lock to the "extras" menu. The famous silver back collects scratches and fingerprints exactly like its counterparts - but this is a known - get a case to protect your investment. Contrary to what another reviewer posted, the Nano is not "fragile" - far from it. There are no moving parts - so you could probably use this as a hacky-sack for an hour without fazing it.   At least one consumer has published their own abuse study of the Nano, running it over with a car and throwing it from a moving car at 55mph before finally rendering it useless after a 40 foot drop onto cement. The screen makes it a tad more vulnerable than the shuffle... but it's a sturdy piece of industrial art.  My less than perfect rating is for the following:  1.) No firewire support - even if you have a dock connector to firewire cable, you won't be able to use it - it is USB 2.0 only. What is Apple thinking? Hello! Remember your loyal Mac users who prefer FireWire?  2.) Sole earphone jack is too close to dock connector - using a splitter probably precludes charging it at the same time.  3.) No extra jack or connector on flipside so remote can be added while it charges... so if and when the vendors make recorders, remotes and other goodies for the Nano, you won't be able to use them in tandem with a charging solution.  4.) No bluetooth. Why is this an issue? More and more items are becoming BT enabled. One application I can think of right now is a Nano finder. The Nano is almost weightless and very thin - if you misplace it, how are you going to find it? If it had BT and you had (for example) a Nano finder on a keychain, clicking it could send a signal to your Nano to make audible clicks. Just an idea. This review loses a star for the other reasons, however, not this one... but come on, Apple!  5.)Still no way to get custom logo engraving via Apple unless you're a corporation with a large order... third party vendors are now doing laser engraving so you can put photos of pets, kids, yourself, your logo, etc. on the back of your iPod - but Apple offers no such solution. Considering that stamps.com allows you to make your own legal US postage with a photo of your pet, and they are able to prevent porn and other objectionable imagery through, there is no reason why Apple cannot make this accommodation.  6.) Limited (still!) photo capabilites. Compact Flash cards are like diamonds - the bigger they are, the more they are per carat (or rather, per MB). The iPod Photo camera connector connects a camera just fine - but not to the Nano! There is no explanation for this - it still uses a dock connector, but won't work w/ the Nano. The camera connector isn't that great to begin with, because you can ONLY use it to connect an iPod to a camera, not to a compact flash or multi reader... so if you're out in the field taking photos, you can't take them until your photos download and you waste your battery in your camera. If you could attach a card reader to the connector and download photos for storage on your iPod while simultaneously shooting more photos with your camera using a different card so you can swap without losing precious shooting time. Camera connector shortcomings notwithstanding, it doesn't work with the Nano. I know I already stated this, but I'm still frustrated.  The part of me that loves Apple's innovative technology and design wanted to give this incredible gizmo 5 stars - but there is still overt room for improvement and I know Apple can do this!

<Title>The Black Lacks?
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I just go the iPod Nano today, and so far I'm loving it! The whole thing looks surreal (to amazing to be real). The Nano plays like a dream. The controls and menus are the same as the original iPod and the iPod mini. The player is so small too, smaller then the pictures lead you to believe! I only have two really big complaints.  1) The black does show every minuet scratch, and scratching it is not hard. I haven't scratched mine yet, but a few of my friends have. I am going to try keeping the temporary clear plastic cover on the front of the player. Hopefully the scratched will only be on the plastic and when the Nano Tubs come out I can just peal off the plastic and slid it in. I think Apples decision to release the Nano Tubes 4 weeks after releasing the iPod Nano was a really stupid one!  2) The Black iPod nano comes with WHITE EAR BUDS!!! The ear buds are the same ones you get with all the other iPods. I mean come on, if you are going to make a black iPod Nano then at least make the ear buds match. It kind of ruins the whole black look when it has this white wire coming out of it. Everyone that has looked at it said, "What's up with the white buds? They don't go!"  It's easy to operate and fun to play around with. The thing does feel flimsy but I haven't accidentally test its durability yet so I'll have to get back to you on that one. Over all I do like my iPod Nano, I just wish I could protect it from getting damaged.  BEWARE THE BLACK IPOD NANO HAS WHITE EAR BUDS!!!!!

<Title>GREAT ITEM
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I'm sure many of you out there have ipods...it seems like everyone walking around these days has one. So as many of you that have them, most of you probably know how easily breakable the mini's and regular ipods were. The new nano's however has no movable parts, but still functions like the regular ipods. and because it only weighs 1.5 ounces, you can catch it by the earphones, so it will never clatter onto the ground and break (as did mine). Apple controls over 80% of the mp3 player market -normally, that is something which is impossible to hold on to. But introducing this item, they might have even strengthened their hold on the market. In fact, apple is so sure of the nano, that they are discontinuing their best selling product -the mini. Maybe there is a reason why everyone you see walking down the street is listening to an ipod. To see it, is to fall in love with it, credit cards -beware. [...]

<Title>Nano needs materials rethink
<Date>Thu Sep 22 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have just arranged to return my black nano due to the amazingly soft plastic that covers the front of the device.  This material scratches even when wiping with a soft cotton t-shirt.  The result is a device that looks as though it has been abused and neglected.  I had only peeled off the protective cover and wiped the grease marks away when I noticed the first scratches across the whole length of the front.  Damned annoying.  Apple have an issue with this device and they need to fix it.  Why should I be compelled to nuy a case that makes the player larger than it needs to be and why can't I put it, naked, in my pocket as advertised by Mr Jobs or wear it next to clothing?  My advice, go and look at a display device in a store and make sure it is one which has the protective cover removed.  You will love the size and the screen and the weight but you won't buy one.

<Date>Sat Sep 24 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>This ipod is by far the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.  It scratches soooo easily, it makes it look a year old after the first week.  It is ridiculously small, i almost lost it twice, why is it so small?  its so impractical.  A few other points, you can only charge it when your computer is on, which sucks if you or going on a vacation or something.  The earphone slot is on the bottom, which almost forces you to buy the ipod earphone accessories that apple sells, as well as the case and probably the dock as well... -.-  If you are going to buy this, don't count on the initial $249 being the final price. you will have to pay 30 for the cases 40 for the earphones and another thirty for the dock.  altogether it will be $349 plus tax >:( not good.  look but do not touch!!

<Content>I just got back from a trip to Europe and I must say I love almost everything about my nano.  The battery lasted the entire 12 hour journey with room to spare.  The size is terrific for travel--no larger than a small stack of business cards.  Sound is great and the flash allows for near instant response and mega durability.  The only negatives are that it scratches a tad easily and I wish the screen was a bit bigger or it had video out...next version I hope.  All in all, I'm really happy I bought my nano.

<Title>Get This Instead of The Nano!!!
<Date>Mon Mar 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I will try to make this short and sweet. This is about the Sansa E200 Series Mp3 Players.  The ipods can't even compare to this...   -Superb mp3/wma playback and features  (includes custom eq,album art,playlists)   -FM radio (includes radio recording with pause and resume function)   -Voice recording (with pause and resume function)   -Picture viewer  (includes thumbnail view, indivdual view, slideshow with song playback)   -Video playback - don't worry about any problems because the videos are SUPERB quality  (includes video converter,play/pause,fast fwd./rew.,depending on what video you put on the player,they can be either fullscreen or widescreen)   -1.8" screen! (almost double the size of the ipod's)   -colorful screen and menus (who wants basic white like the ipod's)   -battery life (average of 20 hours)   -replaceable battery (in case it dies/doesn't work, you can get a new one, unlike the ipods)   -scroll wheel (works very wheel, and it's large enough to use)   -other buttons (don't worry about them being small,they're just the right size)   -ways to put data on the sansa (can be windows media player or by dragging and dropping files onto the sansa's drive/folder)   -size (about same size as Ipod Nano,but a little thicker so it's easier to hold in your hand)   -price ($150 for 2gb Ipod Nano, $160-$190 dollars for 8GB VERSION WITH ALL OF THESE FEATURES!!!! Even if they both did the same things,you get 4 times the memory for about $15 more!!)   If you don't know what mp3 player to get, get this one, you will NOT be dissapointed.   NOTE: the only con is that the Sansa may get finger-printed because it's smooth/glossy.  NOTE: if you take care of the Sansa, it willl NOT break or scratch.

<Title>Frustrating because of ITunes software and support
<Date>Sat Apr 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>You can only load music into the Apple Ipod Nano through your computer on a program called ITunes. Loading the software onto your computer can be a major problem. I downloaded it and it refused to open. Apple's literature and online "support" was useless. Simply stated it is not user friendly, it does not tell you what to do in plain English. As usual a GOOGLE search with a few key words produced a number of boards loaded with people with the same problem. Thank goodness these people are kind enough to post solutions. In this case it has to do with the fact that the ITunes software has to operate with another program, a player called Quicktime. If both of these programs are not properly installed you will have a problem. The solution seems to be to first remove both programs entirely, restart your computer, and then install Quicktime (alone without ITunes) first before installing Itunes (alone without Quicktime). That's how I got it to work after 2 hours of repairing, installing, uninstalling, etc. Another problem is that it will not work (that means WORK after installation) unless it is installed and operates with "administrator privileges" meaning that if a child is using it they must have "administrator privileges" on the computer.  Second problem- After you finally get ITunes to run you learn that once files are downloaded onto the Ipod Nano the only way that they can be removed is through Itunes with the Ipod connected to the computer. You cannot delete them directly from the Ipod. Again instructions and support are not user friendly. They tell you to look somewhere on the screen (they are not specific) for the Ipod icon to start the delete process. What they don't tell you is that it only appears for a limited time upon the initial connection of the Ipod to the computer. If you don't find it before it disappears, you must disconnect and reconnect for it to reappear again, there is no way of just bringing it up on the screen again. And the deletion process is far from simple once you find the Ipod icon.  Basically this thing is nothing more that a portable computer jukebox. The process of loading and changing songs in it shouldn't be so difficult.

<Content>I have been waiting for years to get an iPod, and since my recent purchase of the nano, I am extremely content with it. The features the iPod offers are limitless and I can finally carry around my music without switching CDs or waiting for a song to come on the radio. This is one of the best things I ever purchased in my life and I am completely not exaggerating!

<Title>Fact - iPods Do Not Play Mp3s!
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I don't really feel like going into a lot of detail about the problems I had with this horrible product, since I'm sure all of the iPod-attics will rain down thier bizarre cult-like craziness on me, but here goes anyway.  The first set of problems came when I found that you can't just plug the player into your computer and drag and drop files onto it - like every other mp3 in the world.  You are forced to use iTunes, which changes the file format of the mp3's into a special Apple file format.  This angered me, as one of the reasons I bought the thing is so I could transfer the mp3s that I loaded onto it onto all of my friends computers.  But that's not possible thanks to Apple's insistance on changing my mp3s into thier own speacial file format.  This led me to the realization that marketing this product as an mp3 player, is false avertising, because it does not actually play mp3s.  Next, after deciding to do what the iPod told me to do, I had to update the software 10 times before I could get a song to play on it.  I tried to call customer support for help at one point and..... let me just put it this way, there is no customer support.  After many hours I got the thing working and got some songs on there.  At this point I was actually excited about the product, because I was under the impression my problems were over.  After a couple of days the battery started going dead after only 1 hour of use, even when fully charged.  Grudgingly I called Apple back and, after waiting 2 hours on the phone, was authorized to send it back for a replacement.  When the new one arrived I had the exact same problems setting it up that I had had the first time.  10 days later the unit stopped working all together and would not even power on.  I am still in the process of trying to get another replacement and I'm beginning to think that I'm not getting one.  This has been an absolute NIGHTMARE!  Never buy anything from Apple, they suck and they are crooks!

<Title>What i've been waiting for.
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I bought an ipod nano at Best Buy, a 4gb one that costs 250$. I bought the insurance and bought the holder so it wouldn't break. It looked awsome and i was ready to jam! I hooked it up to my comp, loaded on about 500 or more song and a few pictures and started jamming, it rules. When u played a song u could look at the album cover, play games, or look at pictures u put in there. It was the best ipod yet. But then i realized it is fragile. Without a case if u drop it on a carpet it will scratch it or might ever crack it. But i always keep the protective case on. With the case this thing is the best ipod yet, and it holds just the right amount of songs, 1,000 songs. All in all i think its awsome. I highly reccomend it to any one who wants to update there ipod or wants an ipod nano, but make sure u BUY! the protective case or u will end up breaking it. If u want something cheaper get an ipod mini 6 or 4 gb, they are still good and are very sturdy.

<Content>I always envied the size of the mini, but I enjoyed my album art too much to make that trade down. Hauling the 20GB around was cumbersome when I just wanted to run a quick errand while listening to music. With the nano, I get the lightweight and album art. It's so perfect that I didn't even wait to sell my 20GB before purchasing one. I couldn't wait.

<Content>This is gorgeous and beautiful piece of art to look at but there's a major flaw: it scratches too easily.  It scratches easily when in a pocket with nothing else and eventually makes the screen unreadable in short time.  Look up discussions at the Apple support website or ipodlounge.  I recommend waiting until the second generation on this one.  All the best.

<Title>Great device
<Date>Sun Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>[...]  The nano scratches no more easily than any previous iPod.  I have had mine for a couple of weeks and have yet to see a blemish on it.  If you take care of your iPod, it will take care of you.  Keep it in a safe place, store it in a case or a cloth bag of some sort when you aren't using it, and clean it occasionally with a microfiber cloth -- these are the steps I have taken to keep the various iPods I have owned clean and blemish-free.  Common sense will keep it (and all of your electronics, for that matter) healthy and easy on the eyes!  An example:  Two nights ago, I was sitting on my couch with my laptop in front of me and my nano plugged into a USB port to charge.  It was wrapped inside of a cloth Sony Minidisc bag at the time.  My dog, an 8 pound Yorkie, decided that now would be an awesome time to play.  She hopped up on the couch and severly trounced my new iPod.  Her weight and her claws, however, did no damage to the iPod because it was inside of something designed to protect it from such things.  If my dog couldn't damage the nano while it was inside of a thin cloth case, then I have a hard time believing that someone managed to mangle their nano's screen by leaving it in the pocket of their blue jeans or a cotton hoodie.  At any rate, this is a fantastic device worthy of the name iPod.  The sound quality is wonderful, the screen is sharp, and the click wheel makes it instantly familiar to anyone who has used an iPod in the past.  Thanks to the flash memory, photos and music load quickly, and the menus are snappy.  I have not been disappointed with the nano.  Highly recommended!

<Title>Save the waiting and your money,buy an iPod photo or mini!!!
<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod nano no longer than a week ago, it is amazing absolutley fantastic, its a beautiful piece of machinery.... but it sucks. Its great in sound quality, etc but the second day i had it the screen scratched, im ok with that I was pretty pissed but i got over it. The 5th day i had it it scratched the screen again. And the final straw was when the screen cracked completely and ruined the whole thing. this was because my cat jumped on the table it was on and it happened to fall off. So great all my money is gone to waste, i demanded a refund and got my money back. I went out and bought an iPod mini. Ill wait until I know for sure that these nanos are gonna be safe to walk around with. All the iPods are superior in holding up with a little abuse. But when you make silly mistakes like leaving in on a table that happens to fall apart it really makes you angry because you wish these things had some durabilty... The only reason im not completely panning this fragile electronic is because it looks good, it sounds good, and the battery is ok. On the other hand its as fragile as an eggshell. How can you carry that around everywhere? Stick with the iPod Photo or Mini for now.... you'd wish you had when your nano turns to a scratched up cracked mess.  Wait a year or so I say.   By the way.... that tv ad for the nano where the hand is playing around with the nano with his fingers flipping it around, is bs!! If that dropped your screwed, so I dont reccomend you do what the hand is doing in that ad!!

<Date>Mon Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>If you are pondering whether or not to get the Nano...JUST GET IT.  It is worth it.  Everything about it is better than other mp3 players out there.  Yes it scratches, but you can always buy a case.  With the case, the Nano is still small.  Sound is good.  Extremely easy to use.  Expensive, but well priced when you consider its capabilities and its the first of its kind.  Ignore the negative reviews, this is the best that is available.  I would only not recommend this if you had over 5 gigs of music.  Even so, this is still a good product if you can narrow your songs to 1,000.  Again, there isn't anything else better than the Nano...

<Content>Why would I want anything more? It holds 1,000 songs. Ever thought how long it would take you to listen to 1,000 songs? I can store millions on my PC and change the Nano's content when ever I need to. If I want to watch video I will watch it on my TV. This versatile little item takes a lot of licks, holds more than enough music form my purposes and is extremly light. Best of all I can plug it up to noise cancelling headphones when on flights, my car stereo and my sound system at home.  My only concern is how to get the battery changed when it needs to be. But I guess the Apple Store will sort that one out when it comes time.

I've got 2 iPods and 1 mini and they are all scratched.  Even the two that came with the old slide case that Apple used to put in the box.  Fact is, if you buy an iPod it will get scratched.  End of story.  As a matter of fact anything you buy that will be a portable item will get scratched.  Don't believe all of these people when they tell you it is fragile.  One person complained it broke when it fell of a table.  Well DUH?  There was an idiot a few years ago mad because he dropped his 17" Powerbook off the table on its power cord and broke.  I want to drop these people on their heads and see if they break.  Maybe I can take them to the hospital and trade them in for something a little more durable.  An anvil perhaps.

<Content>NO STARS! MINUS SEVERAL BILLION STARS ACTUALLY. The demand for smaller and smaller devices has finally come to a dead-end. This product is way too fragile for the consumer market. Indeed using it as displayed in the advertising will get you a damaged Nano with Apple saying - 'Yes, well we may advertise people putting in their pocket, but we never expected anybody would. I'm afraid keeping the Nano in your pocket is considered abuse of the product and therefore *NO* WARENTEED replacement or FREE REPAIR is available. DON'T buy it or any other Apple product until they stop screwing the public like this.

<Content>This is a cool device. You will love it for the featues and the size.   I told myself I wouldn't mind the scuffing and scratching that comes from everyday usage, but I became upset when I decided to wipe the unit clean using my breath and my cotton t-shirt (like I do frequently with my sunglasses) and ended up with scratches all over the screen!  I've owned cell phones, pda's, and all kinds of electronic portable devices, and I have NEVER seen something so succeptible to scratching! It's only been two weeks. I can only imagine how bad it will be after a year.  To the skeptics out there who own one, try it!  If you get this unit, be sure to apply some sort of protector or the screen will be illegible in a few months of everday usage.

<Content>Interesting...I love this thing. It kinda fit with my lifestyle. I have one MD player and it's kinda too big for me so i think my next MD or MP3 player should be sth small.I was gonna buy MINI but when i went back to apple weasite again i saw a new little creature NANO and i fell in love with it :). 1000 songs are kinda a lot for me. If i would like to listen over tnan that, i'd rather stay at home with my stero :)   - fragile : i guess so... smaller things always more fragile than biger things:). I'm a dog lover as i know smaller dogs also more fragile than bigger dogs ..Same as Ipod :). when we accept to deal with it (Adopt a small dog or buy a Nano) just carefully use it i think it wouldn't be a problem :). A golden rule for using any electronic devices  "DON'T DROP IT, IT'S TOO FRAGILE TO BE DROPPED" :)   - Scratch so easy: i'm kinda think it depends on each individual. So how easy of scratching is depends on how careful the user is , as well.  Relax & Enjoy the innovation  Have fun....Love dog & Peace (^_^)V

I recieved my iPod nano today; From me not even touching the box i knew it was a great product. The box is a simple very small box with a picture of it on it. All the accesories are in it and the Nano. The Nano is smaller then you'd inmagine from the pictures. The sound qualitly made me dumbfounded, its just beutiful, vivid and rich. The screen quality is great not as good as a PSP's but very good. The only downside is probably that when you transfer photos from a PC all the photos have to been in one folder or it will write over the old ones. Im very happy and recomend it.

<Content>This was my first mp3 player.  I sort of waited and watched things develop.  No complaints.  I like the size, sound and user interface.  A few things to remember when buying an ipod - the purpose of this player is to sell itunes, it does not support drag and drop of mp3 files from your hard drive.  You must use the itunes software to load your mp3 rips on to the ipod in order for the ipod to recognize them.  Also the size (at least of the 4 GB model) is a lie.  You only have 3.7 GB of free space for music/pics and other files.  Great player if you don't mind having to use itunes software.

<Content>I love the ipod.I've had an iphoto for a while now and its great. I got a "nano" expecting the same quality albeit with a little less memory and bulk.It works but after only a short time 4(days)it looks like its been through a war.Despite treating very carefully the thing is covered in marks and scratches.I disagree with some of the other comments listed here where people ask what do you expect.I expect after four days that something I pay over $200 for looks relatively unused.I'll be returning mine.Hopefully I'll get my money back.Don't get me wrong, I love ipods but this is a disappointment....at least the screen didn't crack as a friends allegedly did.

<Content>Creative et al may as well give up now heh heh. To think Bill Gates said the iPod fad will die down, well no-one, but no-one has got has got the Apple cool factor right now. And it has style AND substance.
