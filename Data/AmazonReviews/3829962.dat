<Title>Definitely an iPOD killer
<Date>Sun Jul 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This a very nice mp3 player.  I have the 4gb one.  This definitey tops iPOD for a number of reasons which most consumers dont really care much of but I do. Here are my favorites; The sound processor on this player is much brighter and more powerful than ipod.  60mw of power (because I love listening at high levels which I usually set the max 25 out of the 40 volume levels, it's pretty damn loud) and it has a max. of 95db vs. 90db for ipod. The reason why is I use Shure's e2 sound isolated earphones. If you remove all the ambient background sounds ie, cars driving by, or fire trucks testing their sirens or just people bitching and complainging you just hear your music.  And the louder you go the more lively it sounds. Drag and drop files may be considered an old thing but who wants to use a software just to transfer files.  The problem I really dont like about ipods is that your music has to be perfectly tagged in order to view it right in ipod. In addition, you have to browse it in a sequence.  This one actually views your music exactly like Windows Explorer.  Simple and right to the point.  Your music can be read by the file name or by it's tagged which is really nice. Another cool thing about it is that it uses the universal usb mini-b cable. The really nice thing is it charges as well.  The battery life is 5 stars. The rated is 20 hours I get alot more.  When it's tested by consumer companies like cnet, they use standard levels of use.  I use the sound processors alot which equals more battery power.  So trust me the battery lasts really long. Since it's only 4gb I love to change my music every often.  This way it keeps the music fresh and doesnt get boring. Most people who own an ipod keep their music their permanantley like it's their sanctuary. Okay, most people dont lose their ipods but because they have moving parts, care is top of the list ie. dropping it for example.  I can drop mine or throw it at someone who really piss me off and it's totally fine.  I've noticed most players today are favored in flash based.  Quick, simple and not fragile. The player is very very stable. It doesnt crash and the startup is very fast.  Well I said enough.  If you buy this through Amazon, you'll most likely buy it directly from Cowon's Jet Audio store.  Great place to buy it and the customer service is really quick and responsive. Contact by email or live chat! Dig that.  I hope Cowon keeps these features in the future but with much larger size memory and adding features that other mp3 players dont have :)

<Title>The wife loves it!
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>We already have two Cowon products (60 GB and 1 GB U2) and it was time to get a slightly roomier mp3 player for my wife. She loves the drag and drop feature. She was quite surprized at how small the F2 player is - pretty much the same size as U2, even though the dimensions are posted. However, she was disappointed that the package did not contain a carrying case and/or the necklace, which came with U2. As for the technical review, it may follow, since she hasn't had a chance to use it yet (it's charging at the moment). However, since we love our other Cowon mp3 players, I am sure she'll love it too. The screen has very nice colors and resolution, and looks very sharp and clear.  Update from the wife: While I love the mp3 player overall, I don't like the buttons, they are very small. I liked the joystick feature on my other Cowon much more. Other than that - very intuitive, didn't use any software with it, has been working diligently and problem free so far (just over a half a year). Would like to have more than one Playlist.

<Title>A little giant in sound
<Date>Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Very lite and amazing sound lot of battery life excellent for long trips. The radio has poor reception but you really don't need use it. I would recomend this for somebody that wants to get into the MP3 devices for the first time and is not expensive to get it if you buy it on the internet.

<Title>Cowon F2
<Date>Mon Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This player provides excellent sound and convenience. For some reason, Amazon doesn't include the carrying case and A/C charger, which you will receive by ordering from Cowon's store (Jetmall).  Positives: The sound quality is fantastic. The audio enhancement features work very well, and give the sound richness and fullness. At very high volume the sound will become distorted, but there's no audible distortion at reasonable listening levels. Unlike ipod and almost all other mp3 players, there's no need to install any software on your computer in order to transfer songs to the F2. The F2 acts as a USB drive, so you can copy files to it just like to any other disk drive. Battery life is also very good. The F2 can be charged either by connecting it to the computer or by plugging it into the A/C charger.  Negatives: The buttons are a little small. If the player is inside the carrying case, you have to press the buttons through the clear plastic case. That's fine unless you need to be able to operate the device by feel without looking at it, for example if it's strapped to your waist and you're running. These are really minor problems.  I don't use the F2 to watch videos so I can't comment on that feature, except to say that before you can watch a video it must be converted to the F2's format using supplied software. The screen isn't large enough to be useful for videos in my opinion.
