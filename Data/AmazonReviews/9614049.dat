<Title>Another Sansa winner?
<Date>Tue Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this product tonight to use with the SanDisk FM transmitter for use in my car. I store a lot of streaming audio, plays, books, radio talks, etc., from the BBC and NPR, and they're great to use on a long car journey.  The player was a refurb and cost me all of $17.00 - gotta be great value, especially with the ability to use a 2GB card. Some people have complained about the sound quality - I wonder if they've discovered the equalizer and WOW sound augmentation system. And I use it with a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones as well, so flights are a breeze.  Only negative so far is those floppy covers for the MP3 and mem card slots.  But for the price, you can't beat it.

<Title>Rip OFF!!
<Date>Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased this Mp3 player a year or so ago.  The first time I left it in my care over night when it was between 45-55 degrees.  It never came back on.  I then returned the product because I had bought the extended warranty so I got a replacement.  I then gave the replacement to my father in law.  He used it inside and when he went to use it the next day the same thing happened.   These are cheap and terrible.

<Title>Terrible product. Poorly designed, poorly made, don't buy!!!
<Date>Tue Jul 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My wife owns the Sandisk 256k (red) flash player which is great, so I figured I'd try this one. After all, it's the same company. Plus, it's a 512k flash player plus expansion at virtually the same price as the standard 512k flash player. What a mistake! The standard Sandisk flash player is solidly built, has an intuitive design, easy to use buttons (even if small), a clear bright blue display, and great sound quality (even when using MP3s at 128kbs). The Sansa has none of these virtues. It is incredibly flimsy; the buttons are nearly impossible to use, the battery door is made of tissue thin plastic and constantly falls off, the sound quality is rotten, and once you put the plastic case on you'll never get if off. Further, while the SanDisk MP3 Flash player plays tracks in the order you place them in the player (very efficient), The Sansa seems incapable of playing songs in anything but alphabetical order, a real problem for someone like myself who likes eclectic music: (one track "Paint It Black" by the Stones; next track "The Prophecy" from "The Fellowship of The Rings Soundtrack"!) On top of this my unit was defective. The lock would lock the sound volume only temporarily. Suddenly music would blare out and nearly bust my eardrums; next I could barely hear a thing. Pure garbage. Get the regular Sandisk MP3 Flash player or get an iPod for twice the price and a thousand times the value. This product is pure junk!!!!

<Title>Not great, but works for me.
<Date>Mon Jul 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Tight case and terrible headphones aside, for 81.00 dollars, I was pleased with the product. Using a different pair of headphone I thought the sound quality was good.  I stretched out the case alittle and have no problems there.I generally use mp3 that are 160 or higher so I was pleased with the sound.  A firmware upgrade would make it a better player. I have contacted sandisk about the upgrade. Hope they are listening. Great for playing audible books on tape (you can use the highest quality file format). Transferring all files was quick and easy. I'm using a 512 mg card that I already owned and can fit tons of songs. The sd cards can be found for low prices if you shop around. All in all for the price I am very pleased with the player.

<Title>Not as bad as I thought at first
<Date>Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I still like the their joystick players better, but I need to modify some of my previous comments: 1. The sound quality is pretty good - after you replace the headphones and fiddle with the equalizer and SRS settings. 2. The click wheel for changing volume and settings operates raggedly.  3. It is much clumsier when strapped to your arm than the joystick player. 4.It is extremely difficult to get out of its clear plastic case without damaging the case - but you can correct this by wiping a very fine layer of talcum powder on the inside (got that from a forum).  5.Most annoyingly, whenever you turn it off and back on it forgets all of it's settings.  You have to reset the volume, the equalizer, and the play order - you can correct this by reformatting the flash memory.  It must be formatted in FAT 32.  It comes natively formatted in FAT 16   I'd bump it up to 3.5 stars but they won't let me change that on an edit.

<Title>good quality, good value, great "starter" mp3 player
<Date>Sat Aug 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have had the sansa for 3.5 months now, and have had no major complaints. Works well, easy to use, battery life is above average(I am still on 1st battery, and I use mp3 all the time). It is great for running or working out, won't skip like some hard disk mp3 players.   Is it the best sound in the world? No. But it is adequate, and other buds or headphones can be purchased. The only thing I would change is the playlist function. But putting songs in folders in order and renaming can fix this. It really does not bother me at all. How many entire albums are you going to listen to in a row anyway? Most times it is used while exercising, on the subway, on a plane, etc.  Overall, I highly recommend this little guy, you won't be disappointed!

<Title>Simple to use, inexpensive, and good
<Date>Mon Aug 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>After reading some of the reviews, I hesitated before buying this.  I've been looking for a flash drive to store more audible files and finally decided to buy this. I haven't had it long but I'm delighted with it.  The player is simple to work without looking at the manual.  It uses only 1 battery. I've replaced the enclosed earplugs with better quality ones and the sound is excellent.      I know some have complained about the wheel.  This is the first player I've had with a wheel and, possibly because of this, I've had no problem with how it feels.  My other flash player is an Iriver which has some additional features but is more complicated to use and far less intuitive.      The player is very light.  There are few parts to break and it seems sturdy. It also comes with a one year warranty.  Most other players I've checked out have a much shorter one.      A final plus is its exapandability.  I've been using a  512mb player for some time and haven't needed more space.  If I ever do, it's nice to know I can add it.  Addendum:  I've been using the player daily.  I still love it and find it easier than my iriver.  There is 1 glitch I've found re auto-resume.  Several times, while listening to an audible book, the player has come on back at the initial index instead of where I left off in the book.  It appears that to auto resume the book I need to press the start button very briefly.  If I press it for several seconds, the player opens at the settings index instead. Those having problems with auto resume might try this.

<Title>Sandisk Digital Audio player
<Date>Thu Aug 18 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been satisfied with this product. It was simple to load songs on to the player. The operation is very straight forward and easy to understand as well as implement. The ear buds were different than I was previously acquainted with but after a short time, they were comfortable. They also provided an excellent quality of sound reproduction. All in all I am very happy with my purchase and would make this same purchase again if I had the need to do so.

<Title>Nice little player...
<Date>Fri Aug 19 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Nice mp3 player, gets the job done. The FM tuner is a definite plus. The user navigation is ok. There is an upper right click-wheel is for scrolling and another button on the side to select a menu option, and the buttons on the front for song/radio navigation. Call me spoiled but I've gotten use to the consolidated buttons and menu navigation of my Ipod. I'm more comfortable navigating this with two hands, but that doesn't bother me.  The size is small; it fits in the palm of my hand. I actually like how this player looks. The main reason I got this was because it is flash-based and I can work out with it without worrying about jostling parts. And also because it's expandable. I use it with a 1GB SD card. That's a BIG plus.  Drawbacks are ones that have already been mentioned by other readers, e.g. doesn't have an auto-resume reader, but I don't listen to audiobooks so that's not a big issue for me. One minor annoyance is how the songs are automatically sorted by song name ascending. I know I can rename the songs with a number in the track title like others have mentioned, but that requires more work than I'd like. Also, I haven't figured out how to create a playlist, or if that can even be done. It allows the user to choose from album, artist, songs, and some other options, so I don't think there's a way to make a mix of various songs. If anyone has figured it out, please post it.  Uploading songs is simply enough. Connect the USB cable from player to PC and create folders and just drag and drops songs with Windows Explorer. You can also copy songs off the player back to PC, which is nice.  Battery life is fine with me. I used up the batteries that shipped with this in about a day I think and shortly after got NIMH rechargeable AAAs. If you use this with an external SD card, it's going to consume more battery power...  Headphones are ok; I've never been a fan on the in-ear design though.  The plastic case that came with the player drove me nuts the first week or so. It was skin-tight and I almost ripped the case the first few times trying to get the player out to change the batteries. But now it's loosened up and works fine. I'm withholding a star on this review for lack of belt clip on the case. This might sound minor, but I'm not a fan of the included arm band when working out and so I have to put it in my pocket or hold it. It's small but not ultracompact so a belt clip would have been nice. I haven't found another case that would fit this that includes a belt clip either. If Sandisk offered one, I would purchase it.  And something I found out when I first got it...you need to leave about 4MB of space from the Sandisk 512MB that's included on the player for its software to work. (And note to Sandisk: you have a spelling error on the error message that comes up if there isn't enough space).  Let's see what else...I took the plastic port and SD card covers off, those aren't going to stay on, but no biggie. It also comes with a stopwatch function in the software. I like the Sound Effect and Equalizer features of the software, and that it can also play WMA files. And I don't know if I am the only one experiencing this but sometimes when I listen to the radio, the volume level seems to drop about two levels on its own. It happens rarely though; not yet to the point where it's become an issue.  Overall, I like this player. I looked at various models before deciding on this one because it had both an FM tuner and was expandable. Compared to other players in its price range, the included features are great. I would purchase it again.

<Title>Poor Quality
<Date>Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I was quite disappointed with my purchase.  Cons: 1) I could not figure out how to control the order of the song playing.  It would only play in random or alphabetical order.  I would have to change the file names for all the music files to make sure that the files play in the same order as the CD. 2) The SD slot was practically useless.  I have a 1GB chip and everytime the player powered-up it would spend about 5 minutes examining the files on the SD looking for new files. 3) This is the big one.  I was listening to the player in the car when I dropped it on the carpetted floor - it went dark and has not worked since.  New batteries could not bring it to life.  After spending a hundred on this, I have a dead MP3 player.
