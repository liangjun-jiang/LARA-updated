<Title>its okay....but not like the Ipod

<Content>Its small, but if you got any rap songs that contains large ammounts of minutes, then be sure you got other rap songs that are under that large song you got. You can store 256Mb, BUT  you need a Memory card where you put in the back of the unit, Which is Not included.Theres the VERY small buttons to change the songs and the volume. In my opinion you can break it if you push it hard. The Sound is good IF you go to the menu of the unit and go to EQ. Comes with headphones and a AA battery. If you want a cheap Mp3 player then get this, If you got 350 or 450 dollars then get the Ipod.  
<Overall>3
