<Title>Something's wrong with mine...
<Date>Thu Sep 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Today, when I was trying to turn on the player, it kept turning off. I was disappointed b/c I wanted to listen to music on the commute home. I thought the battery just died. After charging it, it wouldn't turn on again so I had to reset and reformat the player. If I have to do this again, I'm going to return it. Other than what happened, it's a great player with great sound.  Update: 9/14/07 I spent a long time last night putting 270 songs onto my player. It worked fine last night. I plugged it back to my computer for charging. Today I turned it on, I saw the creative logo and then it just shut off. What gives???  UPDATE: 10/14/07 Do not leave the stone connected to computer when it's off. i think that was the root of the problem.  Update: 11/8/07: it happened again. I don't know if this is what you call getting locked up. when i plugged it into my computer, the creative media lite software didn't show any songs or folders. So i had to format it again. urgghhh..

<Title>Good Little MP3
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I paid more for the Zen Stone Plus over the Zen Stone because I wanted a screen. However, only the song title is displayed. The player doesn't automatically shuffle songs like my last player but it is okay. The headphones aren't the greatest. After getting new headphones, the sound quality was great. Navigation is easy and not too confusing.  Overall, a great player for the size and price.

<Title>Very cool because it's ridiculously small but works almost like the IPOD shuffle when navigating

<Content>Very cool because it's ridiculously small but works almost like the IPOD shuffle when navigating. I would like it better if it was just a bit easier to get from say song one to song thirty. I recommend the keychain add on. The headphones are flimsy.

<Title>Okay player with some problems
<Date>Thu Oct 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Cute player, amazingly tiny. Very easy to use. Sound is good. Display is very readable.  Problems: as noted elsewhere, the browse function does not let you select specific tracks, just folders and then you can use the skip function to find the desired track.  Minor annoyance (especially when driving) -- to start up and shut down, you have to hold down the button for about 5 seconds.  If you're listening to books, it's good that it does remember where you left off. However, you cannot specify multiple bookmarks so if you want to take a break and listen to music for a while, you've lost your place in the book.  The main problem I have with this is that it has locked up several times. You can insert a pin or clip in the reset slot, but that's hard to do while you're driving and, by the way, it also loses your time and any other settings.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player.
<Date>Thu Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I did some research on different players and didn't want something big or something 40GB in size.  So for $50 I went for the Stone and it's really impressed me.  2GB fit approx 30 CD's, 9 hours of music or there abouts.  The battery life is really good and the one feature that really made my go for it was the Stopwatch.  I run a lot and am training for a Marathon so this feature was just a plus really. I was a little disappointed that it didn't have a split time but I can live with it.  There is a shortcut button that you can setup to point to any menu item which is a great feature.  I have mine set to the Stopwatch so I can review it while I am running. The size of the player is very impressive as well, people have seen it on my arm before I put the ear phones in and ask me what it is, they can't believe it's a MP3 player.  The FM Radio is OK, you have to be in a good reception area.  I have tried out the Voice Recordings yet.  Another neat trick of the player if you buy the arm band is that you can place the player on your arm either with the control buttons on the right side of the player as you'd look at it or on the left, but one of the ways would make the screen appear upside down, well you can change the orientation of the screen 180 degrees. Anyway, I am very happy with it.  I now see people with iPods and they look bulky and knowing they paid 4 times the price of the Stone.

<Title>A very nice, little MP3 player
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've been a fan of Creative for almost a decade now. I've had quite a few of their products and have liked them all - Jukebox, Muvo, ZEN Nano. The Stone plus is great. I bought one for me and one for my wife and we both love them. One great thing about Creative is that you don't have to install any special software on your computer to get MP3s onto to the Stone if you don't want to. And I don't. It acts just like a portable drive - no muss, no fuss. The interface is easy to use, clear - even in bright sun with sunglasses on, and has all the needed functions. It is tiny and durable and with the armband this is a great player for workouts - especially bouldering. The battery life is adequate and carries me through most activities. No complaints. An easy five stars. Thanks again, Creative Labs, for giving us an alternative to those fruit players.

<Title>Great little player with a screen
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros: -easy to read screen -cheap -small -light  Cons: -no dedicated hold button (you have to select it through the menu) -doesn't come with ac adapter just a usb cable -Doesn't work correctly with Winamp  Other thoughts: The hold button isn't really that necessary since the buttons don't usually get accidentally pressed. The only software that I could get to work with this player was Creative Media Lite which is free to download off the Creative site. It's a pretty basic piece of software, but it works .

<Title>Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB - Decent Value and Performance!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Creative Zen Stone Plus 2GB doubles the size of the iPod Shuffle and adds a monochrome screen for viewing track names and settings.  Add in the functionality of a built-in FM tuner and voice recorder at $65 and you have a great value.  Pros -  + good stereo sound  + nice capacity for a decent price + light-weight  + FM tuner with 32 presets ( though it's just average )  + voice recording   + simple design (no more click wheel!) with more color options + great navigation and sorting features  + Nice format compatibility (MP3, WAV, WMA, Audible) + USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity  + Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage + Can sync music with drag & drop or via Creative software  Cons  - average battery life of 10 hours (OLED screen sucks the battery) - mediocre backlight ( but it can be disabled )  - some DRM song transfer issues with some firmware versions  - not expandable - few size options 1GB and 2GB - Creative software is buggy - larger than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles  Creative's Zen Stone line was meant to be the upgrade to the Zen nano, aka Muvo mini.  Unfortunately, the 1GB Zen Stone had some quality issues.  With the new 2GB Zen Stone Plus, Creative has tried to improve on previous models and compete with the Sandisk Sansas.  I love the new Sandisk Sansa's.  The Sansa Express has the advantage that you can plug it directly into your USB port without a cable.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OV74CC/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">SanDisk Sansa Express 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a>  Still, the  Creative Zen Stone feels nicer in the hand. It's not as sleek as the Sansa Express and doesn't have all the cool cache' of an iPod shuffle or iPod nano.  But it is priced very attractively and has some NICE features.  It's good for a starter, workout unit, or gift for a kid.  The Creative Zen Stone Plus is lighter than the competition, but is still larger than the new iPod Shuffle 2nd and 3rd generations. Unlike the shuffle, you can actually see your track names! The OLED screen is perfect for a player this size but does suck more power and shorten the battery life.   The controls are an improvement from the Zen nano days.  While I didn't mind the toggle wheel, it has been replaced by intuitive buttons for the standard functions (select, up, down, play, pause, forward or reverse).  There's a headphone jack, microphone hole, and a USB port.   Another change from the Zen nano days is the Lithium Ion battery, which gives you about 10 hours if your lucky.  This is less versatile than the old battery operated unit, but more convenient.  What about sound? The sound is great, and it comes through in pure stereo. As usual, you will hear complaints about the earbuds. Most people replace their standard earbuds so I won't hold that against Creative.   The Zen Stone doesn't have larger storage options. For those needing more space, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sandisk Sansa or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EU6/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Creative Zen 4 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UV4EUG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Creative Zen 8 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVBDRS/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Creative Zen 16 GB (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETVKHE/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Sandisk SDMX4-4096 Sansa e260 4 GB MP3 Player with SD Expansion Slot</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZ9CCA/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO7PIM/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (3rd Generation)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JO3N3S/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-6470418-5255836">Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)</a>    This unit is ideal as a player and not for those who primarily want to use it for recording. The built-in microphone is nice for short reminders.   The price isn't a give-away, and the plastic case could be more durable.  Still, this is a nice starter unit that can last you a while. Check it out.  Enjoy!!!

<Title>Great for the Gym 
<Date>Fri Feb 15 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have the 1 GB Zen stone player which I filled up pretty quickly. So I ordered the 2 GB because it holds about 500 songs.  Just like the 1 GB player it sounds GREAT.  I don't care for the head phones that come with it. I use a good pair of Sony Earbuds, which I recommend. This is a GREAT player for the money, and it works well when I workout(at the Gym). Well worth your money.

<Content>I was very impressed with the sound from the ZEN Plus Stone!! I did have to purchase different earbuds because the ones that came with it didn't stay in my ears. (I ended up buying the kind that wrap around your ears, and highly recommend them!)  The software for the player is VERY simple to use...a plus for me!! Being my first MP3 player, I had to download the directions from the internet because printed DETAILED directions do NOT come packaged with the player. I highly recommend the ZEN Stone Plus. It's a great little player for a great price!

<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This is a very good product.  Works very well for jogging etc.  perfect if you have a bunch of mp3 files.  It records voices too.  The instructions were very lacking, and it took a while to even figure out how to turn it on.  The instruction booklet was worthless.  Now I love this and the price was great!!
