<Title>No power No music
<Date>Sun Feb 03 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>My girlfriend purchased the Sandisk this for me for Christmas. I was excited and loaded the entire space used for about a month then couldn't get it to charge on anyone's computer try mine hers and others no go.  I will spend a little more money and get something that won't break in a month. I had one that worked with Triple A batteries but only 128 MB buts its still ticking.   Not a very good product very disappointed. Not sure I will purchase another of this brand.

<Title>Works well when it doesn't reset.
<Date>Tue Feb 05 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I bought this player because I needed a small FM radio to listen while at work. The tuner works fine but not perfect. It picks up reception from the headphone cord which is the reason for the so-so reception.  I like that the player connects and charges through a standard USB plug instead of a mini-USB socket that needs a small USB cable to use. The player recharges fine with any wall charger with a USB port. The cover for the USB plug fits firmly and blends with the rest of the player.   I also like the style of the OLED screen. There is a microphone and an option to record a FM station, but I never use those options.   My major problem with this player is that it resets all of its settings and preset FM stations randomly. Sometimes the player will be stable for a week, and sometimes the player will reset 1 or 2 times in a day. It's very frustrating to search and preset all of my favorite stations after a random reset.  Another problem I have is that the "Play All" option for MP3 music automatically sorts the songs by the reverse order that they were loaded into the player. This makes for a tedious time loading up multiple parts of a podcast in correct order to the player.   An obscure problem that I ran into was that it makes Winamp crash while it was plugged into one of the computer's USB socket. Deleting a file in Winamp that syncs it to MP3 players solves that problem.  The player claims to have 15 hours on a full battery recharge. The most time that I'm used the player on one fully-charged battery is about 11 hours.  This player had great potential to be a great MP3 player, but too many problems had ruined that opportunity. Overall, if I had a second chance, I would not buy this player again.

<Title>Nice, small, but annoying
<Date>Tue Feb 12 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I like this MP3 player a lot because it fills my needs, but it has numerous minor issues that really makes it the most annoying electronic device I own.  I was looking for a simple and small MP3 player to use while exercising.  I didn't need half a TB of internal storage for all the MP3s I own.  I wanted an internal battery and an easy means of adding songs to the device.  The Sansa Express with its 1GB space and built-in UBS plug fits those needs.  The battery has a long life too.  Where the Sansa fails is in the little details: It's obnoxious.  It's always doing what you don't want it to do.  For example: (*) Most of the time when I turn it on it forces me to select my language instead of continuing the last track it was playing.  (*) It's difficult to turn off.  OK, manufacturers refuse to use a switch for turning off electronics anymore but why must I hold the power button for so damn long just to turn it off?  Turning this thing off is often a battle of wills between man and machine.  (*) After adding new songs to the player it's difficult to actually play them because they don't show up in the default playlist until you explicitly play them somehow. This is very annoying if you load some songs then go for a run because you'll find that you can't get those new songs to play without playing in the menu using a screen that's hard to read in the sunlight while moving.  (*) FF and REV are poorly implemented  (*) Connect the player to the PC using the USB drive and then remove it.  The device will immediately begin playing audio!  After removing the device from the USB port it should turn itself off.  What's strange is that this automatic playback function is what should happen when you manually turn on the player, but when you do that it goes into the language select menu.  So not only does removing it from the PC turn it on, it turns it on in a way that's better than the actual on button!   I suppose I could read the manual to see if any of these annoyances can be avoided, but a device like this should be intuitive and self-explanatory.

<Title>Terrible, just terrible!
<Date>Wed Feb 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased my Sansa Express 1 GB six months ago. I am sending the unit back for the third time. They just keep dying and dying and dying. The first unit was the best - it worked for almost six weeks. Initial problems with unit number one were related to software/firmware upgrades but by the sixth week it just quit working. This unit was not abused - it probably had a total of 20 hours actual playing time.   Sansa support is relatively good but don't call them. When I first had problems I would call and talk to a tech but there was a significant language barrior. In one instance, the tech kept telling me to 'press the silver bullet...., press the silver bullet...' After a minute or two, I realized he was talking about the small, square metallic looking button on the front of the unit. After that, I strictly communicated by written message.   Customer support is good but turnaround times are slow. First you have to get them to agree to a replacement. Then you have to get a RMA, ship the old unit back before they send a replacement unit. All together I've managed to use my Sansa Express (and replacements), maybe, 30 hours in six months. - If someone gives you a Sansa Express it is because they hate you. 'nuff said.

<Title>Doesn't fit me
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had this for a few months and while it works as advertised, I haven't been overly happy with it. I've tried it with both XP and OSX and can't get it to work correctly with either. It won't unmount from either system and I haven't been able to get the firmware updater to run. However,  I haven't lost any data by pulling it out from the USB -- yet. I listen to mostly OTR shows, usually 15 - 30 minutes long and 5-8MB in size. I listen to a show and then delete it - however, the Sansa doesn't allow any way to delete except when plugged into a computer.   And maybe it's my age, (however a good design should work for everyone) but I've never been able to figure out exactly how the buttons work. Sometimes it will fastforward through a selection and the next time it seems to skip to the next selection. In addition, the Sansa seems to be of its own mind when organizing OTR files. Artist and album come from some metadata tag that I haven't discovered yet.  I've had no problems with charging and use a cheap set of earphones - OTRs aren't known for hi-fidelity, so I don't lose anything there. Putting the lanyard clip on the cap is almost criminally stupid. If you wear it around your neck, you're going to save the $1 cap and lose the $40 player when it gets loose.  All I want is a cheap player, 1GB or less, AAA powered, that will let me listen to long-playing, low-memory intensive files one-at-a-time. I don't need FM, voice recording, fancy graphics, multi-colored screens or rechargeable batteries that can't be replaced.

<Title>Great MP3 Player!
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 Player is really, really nice.  It is sleek, small, and the sound is amazing!  It holds around 250 songs.  You can record you voice!  The voice recording feature is actually really nice and it doesn't sound scratchy like some do. It can also play FM Radio that it picks up well off the air.  It is very easy to download songs on to it also.  Downloading is extreamly fast, it takes anywhere from two seconds through fifteen seconds to download a song.  It also fits in your pocket perfectly.  Here is what I rate for different things.     Sleekness: 5 Stars  Size: 4 1/2 Stars Shape: 5 Stars Sound: 5 Stars Radio pickup: 4 1/2 Stars  Over all: 5 Stars   If you are looking for an inexpensive, sleek, small MP3 player that sounds great, then this is for you!

<Title>Why Im VERY HAPPY with my Sansa Express
<Date>Sat May 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I really enjoy the express because it's a direct connection. I used to have the original apple shuffle which was also "express" in that you didn't need a dock or cable. Thats why I liked it, however it didn't have FM or expansion capabilities and was pretty bare bones. On the bright side, the original shuffle did have good sound unlike the 2nd iteration. So basically I was looking for a direct connection player without wires and for whatever reason Apple's new shuffle was not direct connection so it wasn't a candidate. I heard about the sansa express and took a chance on it because it was direct like my old shuffle which was very convenient. The sandisk sansa express has exceeded my expectations and to be honest I use it more than my other players now. Its like the original direct usb connection shuffle but not bare bones. I couldnt be happier to have a first generation shuffle like player WITH a screen and FM. No wires, no hassle and now that I use yahoo for podcasts, no more itunes. Itunes took forever to recognize my old shuffle for some reason so that nightmare is over. Don't get me wrong, I still like some Apple players like the video iPod, but back to sansa express: The sansa express also can be expanded so for few bucks more, you have a bigger capacity player thanks to the SD card slot and the cheap sandisk micro cards. So to summarize, its easy to use, can be affordably expanded to hold more songs or books etc., has really great sound quality, has FM and a sensible menu system, and is relatively inexpensive. Next time you get out all your wires with your Mp3 player, think about just plugging it in directly to the usb slot on the computer and filling it up in seconds... trust me, its a lot nicer to have a direct connection...very convenient for travel and working out or anytime,  because really, who wants the hassle of cords ?  Added: I wanted to add that the FM reception is excellent and that the player looks great and is designed with high quality components and casing. IMO, this is by far the best small sized mp3 player available today for the money.

<Title>Sleek, slim, but awful shuffle support
<Date>Sun May 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Sansa Express last week as I was looking for a very compact flash-based music player with a screen. The Sansa Express was the only one that really fit the bill.  I'm very happy with the size and storage capacity. I'm supremely annoyed by the shuffle support. One of the other reviewers mentioned it as well, but it's worth repeating: the Shuffle functionality is terrible. If you play all music and turn shuffle on, you'll wind up hearing the same subset of songs over and over again. I have 1GB of music loaded up, but keep getting the same 15-20 songs played. As far as I can tell it has something to do with powering off the unit in the middle of the playlist. When powered on it doesn't pick up where it left off: rather, it goes back to an earlier portion of the song list.  It's a shame, because otherwise it would be such a great player :(

<Title>Linux-compatible, inexpensive, expandable, but no ogg...
<Date>Wed May 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Okay.    I bought this because it was inexpensive, had lots of features including a nice display, was small, and would work for travel without lugging cables.  I believe the sound is very acceptable and I have no problem with the included headphones.  I wish it supported ogg, but it does work without any difficulty on Ubuntu Linux.  Note that if you go to delete files from the player under Ubuntu (and perhaps under any Linux distro) it will actually create a hidden file on the player called ".trash-" rather than immediately destroying the file.  So you have to click on View-Show Hidden Files to see it next to the Music directory.  If you delete that directory, it will really go away freeing up space on your player.  As for fingerprints, sure, they can be seen, but I personally don't find them a problem.    A good player so far.

<Title>Very disappointed
<Date>Sat May 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is a below average MP3 player.  The radio reception is poor, as is the sound quality.  Note that you can NOT delete files directly from the Sansa Express!  You must first connect it to a computer's USB port to delete any files.  I confirmed this with the online instruction booklet that curiously does not come with the device.  This means that if you record voice or audio on the road and you're not near a computer, once the device is full, that's it -- no more recording because you can't delete anything from the player itself.  Also, note that the player only recharges when it's attached to a USB port.  It takes about 2 hours to recharge (and about half that to discharge), which means that your computer has to be powered up and running for the time it takes to recharge!    The player will not recharge when plugged into a USB port if the computer is shut down or in sleep mode.  This is a waste of time and certainly not an environmentally friendly way of recharging.  There are so many other good MP3 players out there, in my opinion, this one is a curiosity and no more.

<Title>I previously loved this player but a few days later....
<Date>Sun May 20 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Sorry, the menu button on the player jammed after only 4-5 days of very occasional use! The style and functionality of this player is awesome but the buttons on it are tacky and wear out way to fast! As much as I want to keep or exchange it, I'm returning it and sticking to my screenless 2nd gen shuffle. The buttons on that feel much better and I guess I don't really need a screen because those usually distract me from actually listening to a song instead of constantly picking one to listen to!

<Title>I've gone through 2 of these
<Date>Mon May 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Beware of this player!  I loved this thing until it broke (wouldn't power on).  I loved the size, the fact that it had a full-on USB connection, the PM tuner.  So, I returned it and bought another... mistake!  My second one lasted 2 days.  I didn't abuse it or anything, so I can't help but think it must be an issue with the Sansa Express product line (or perhaps a bad batch?)  Someone else mentioned that you can "overchage the unit" on their review.  This sounds bizarre.  I can't imagine that this can be true, but either way, this unit is not the one for me.  I'm returning the second and going with something else...

<Title>Terrible for podcasts; lousy lousy firmware.
<Date>Fri May 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This might be a decent product for listening to a few songs, but it's very difficult to listen to podcasts on this device. The hardware is fine, but the software is just terrible and includes a buggy USB implementation that isn't fully compatible with Macs.  Starting with the last point, the player does mount as a normal USB mass storage device and you can easily copy files (and whole directory hierarchies) to it. When you try to unmount the drive, however, it disappears for a moment and then immediately re-mounts. Under MacOS X there's doesn't seem to be any way (other then clever timing) to remove the drive without getting a warning from the operating system.  Add to this the fact that the only firmware updater available from Sansa is an .exe file that only runs on Windows machines, and it becomes clear that this player is only intended for Windows users. Mac and Linux types should look elsewhere.  The first annoyance in actual usage is that this player only allows you to navigate using its own internal database (which it appears to re-build from ID3 tags every time the player is turned on). You can browse by artist and album and song name, which might be all right for music (assuming all your songs are tagged correctly), but fails miserably on most of the podcasts which use these fields in idiosyncratic ways. Organizing your files into directories (grouped by podcast subscription, for example) doesn't work, because the software doesn't let you navigate the file hierarchy on the drive: it's their database or nothing.  Further, even if your files are tagged in the way the player expects (such that one podcast subscription corresponds with a single artist or album) the order that files are played appears to be arbitrary. Having files named such that episode file names sort in chronological order doesn't help at all: again; the player insists on playing files its own way. If you have five days of news updates, there's no way to listen to them in order.  The player also fails to save any state at all when it is turned off; if you're twenty minutes into a sixty minute podcast you'll lose your place. (In fact, you'll probably entirely forget which file you were listening to.) Even if you remember exactly what file you were listening to, are able to find it in the player's crazy database, and also remember exactly how far into it you were, you'll have a hard time getting to that spot. The player's fast-forward feature operates at barely five or ten times real speed. To get twenty minues into a podcast you'll be left holding the fast-forward button down (while hearing absolutely nothing) for at least two minutes. The player is hopeless for listening to long podcasts in small chunks.  Of course, all the intelligent design that has made products like the iPod so popular are missing. There's a power button, a stop button, and a pause button. How do you know which one to choose? I have no idea. There's a button which a picture of a few lines on it, there's a central "action" button, and there's a "menu" button. Which one do you use to browse the player to look for the next thing to listen to without stopping the current track playing? It's not at all intuitive. Not that I found any feature for "queueing" tracks to play in the current playlist, anyway.  For me at least, this player was a complete waste of money.  Sandisk---please just open-source your firmware and let us fix your lousy product for you.

<Title>Won't power on anymore!
<Date>Fri May 25 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've owned this player for about 2-3 weeks and have been generally very happy with it...  Until today that is...  Like some other have reported my player will no longer power on.  In my case it is not due to overcharging, I was using the player and it was almost fully charged.  Just in case I just tried to charge it, but it won't even begin to charge.  The problem happened when I chose a song to play, instead of the song starting to play normally it suddenly started playing the music funny (like super fast-forward) then it powered off and won't turn back on.    I didn't buy a protection plan so I guess I am going to have to contact Sandisk for support.  I didn't see anything on their website about this issue.  Before this problem I would have rated this player with 4 stars

<Content>I am very pleased with my mp3 player. Yes, it only holds 250 songs but thats more than enough for the average person, I think. The menu is easy to navigate and the device is very easy to use with Windows Media Player. My only issues are the headphones which do not stay in the ear. I will probably replace them. And, the screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight. Otherwise, this is a good player for the money. Also, the delivery of my item was very quick.
