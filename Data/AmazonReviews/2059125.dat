<Content>Great product! Slim design! I'm a loyal SONY fan, and I was actually quite disappointed when I first saw this product online. However, I still went to Sony Style store to check out the actual product. What a surprise! In fact, this walkman is a little wider than iPod nano, it is very slim and small! The design is GREAT! It looks way better than what is shown in the pitures online.  The video function is great, very clear image!  The largest this can get is 8GB, which is too small for movies/anime collections; however, it is good enough for me to save 6 episodes of anime at a time for a 2GB one.   Also, as compared to iPod, it is smaller than the new iPod nano that allow you to watch video! Honestly, I've never liked iPod... I've had one long time ago, but I had to sent back after 3 months...yeah... Apple has great services, which I was able to get a new one.  I've never had any problems using SONY products for years (All my "entertainment-use" electronic products are SONY). Well, of course, I take good care of all my electronic products, but still...  I highly recommend this product to anyone who prefer non-iPod MP3 players! The price is reasonable! The design is stylish! The functions are excellent! Also, the battery life is really long, way better than iPod!  I absolutely love it! SONY never let me down!   The only negative about it would still be the software. Even though SONY has finally got rid of the annoying SonicStage software, Windows Media Player 11 is not much better than SonicStage, and no way to be comparable to iTune. However, you can still just drag and drop to add songs, videos and images.

<Content>I like this player very much. I bought this player to use when I exercise, it is small, lite weight and very easy to use.  Another reason I chose it was for the headphones, they are just what I wanted...very comfortable and they put out great sound.  I have a much larger player made by Creative, which is still going strong, but is much too big for what I needed it for.  The only area of discontent is the storage capacity. Sony will tell you that it holds up to 2000+ songs, but those songs all have to be about 2 minutes long.  I have close to 700 songs and I am almost out of space because most of my songs are 3-6 minutes long. Make sure you chose the right capacity, beyond that this is a great player, you can't go wrong.

<Content>This is my 4th mp3 player in past 3 years,and it's definitely the best. Well designed, easy to use, great sound quality, long battery life. It comes with much better than average earphones.   I only hope it lasts longer than my previous players.
