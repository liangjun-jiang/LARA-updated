<Title>Virtually Flawless
<Date>Mon Dec 26 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Well, im gonna start off by sayin that this MP3 player is absolutely amazing. It has a color screen, touch sensative pad, and the instalation software is incredibly easy. It could display photos, and has a voice and FM radio recorder. and ofcoarse it has its own FM radio tuner, which has a pretty damn good reciever. The only flaws that i have seen with it is that it is very prone to finger prints makin it very had 2 keep all shiny but its easy to clean, and the seperate carryin case eliminates that problem. The only other problem is that seenin as though it is a relatively new product, there are not many accessories for it.

<Title>Finally, an mp3 player worth every penny
<Date>Tue Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I have been wanting an mp3 player for 3 years, but due to a lack of a job or cash, I was unable to get one worth its salt. I started working at Kroger a few weeks ago(from the time I wrote this), so I finally have an income. Thus, the search for an mp3 player began.   I looked at the iPod video, and was set on getting that one for awhile. I mean how cool would it be to carry around videos, music, photos, and anything else you could think of, in one pocket-sized gadget? Apple at that point had another willing customer. But then, after more research, I realized just how lame it would be to have to really take care of it, as it does indeed, scratch ultra-easy, and before long, your screen will look like a cat attacked it after a few trips in your pocket. It would get so burdensome, I think, to have to deal with that.  I went to Wal Mart a couple of weeks back, and my eyes caught a small black mp3 player in the display case...This was the Philips GoGear 6 GB. I was instantly attracted to its sleek design and just how wicked cool it looked. I also noticed that it was a little over $100 cheaper than the iPod. Sure, it didn't have near as much space, or video capability, but it still had a nice variety of features. I'll describe them now:  FM Radio: You can listen to the radio on the GoGear, and for such a small item, it picks up a NICE signal. I have 2 rock-station presets on mine(the only rock stations in my area) that both come in crystal-clear. When tuning for a station, you slide your thumb up or down on the touchpad, and a little indicator shows where you're at, much like an alarm clock or small radio's tuning device.   FM Radio Recording: I haven't fiddled with this feature yet, but you can record what you are listening to on the radio, and it's quite easy to do so.   Protective Rubber Case: Included in the package is a rubber case that does actually protect the player, and has a nice feel to it. You might want to cut a small hole in the center of the top of it, because it blocks the headphone jack. A minor, easily fixable flaw.   Earbuds: The included earbuds are a bit new to me, feel-wise, but they look awesome, and sound great! They could compare to the seemingly-perfect sounding white iPod earbuds. These things put out some killer sound.   Voice Recording: This to me, is a really fun and useful feature. You can record messages to yourself(when you have nothing better to do...lol), record your friends' saying things, or even take them to class and record a lecture. I have roughly 3.5 gigs of space taken up on my GoGear, and there is still 3 hours of voice recording available.   Pictures: It took me a while to figure out how to get pictures to show up on the GoGear. They would transfer with ease, (you must use Windows Media Player, you cannot use Windows Explorer)but would not be detected in the player itself. Also, the picture files must be in JPEG format. My pictures were in that format, but still would not show up in the player. I then came up with this seemingly bogus idea of just transferring my pictures to My Documents, to see what that would do. Low and behold, it worked! So remember, when you want to transfer pictures, transfer them from My Documents, not My Pictures. If I'm the only one that had this problem....Forgive me, lol.   Charging Time: Somehow, when I plugged it into the wall for the first time(to charge it, obviously), it was already charged! Every book and site I've seen about this player says to charge it first, before you do anything, and that when it is charging, there will be a battery charging animation on the screen, and it will stop when it is fully charged. I plugged it in, no animation started, and the battery indicated FULL! I still have no idea how that happened, but I've been listening to it for 3 hours now, and it has not failed on me. Perhaps it really is charged...lol. But initially, it takes 4 hours to charge it fully, or there is a 1 hour(70%) fast charge. For a first time use, a full 4 hour charge is highly recommended, unless you are like me, and get one that is fully charged in the package....I still have no idea how that happened.   I hope this narrative of a review has helped you make your decision, and I say this player is indeed, worth every penny. You won't think twice.

<Title>Loved it til it quit completely on day 3
<Date>Thu Dec 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The color is great, blue light is definitely sexy.  Touch navigation was sensitive and easy to use.  Uploading music was a breeze.  Sound was great, even the color display was equal to my cell phone.  Options for saving battery life (backlight timing, skin options, etc) nice touch.  Slipped right into my pocket while shopping.  Well all that is past tense because today (the 3rd day) I attempt to turn it on to fully discharge the battery before recharging and it will not even power up.  I figure it was in need of charging, so I plug it in to the wall... no life.  Change outlets, no life.  I plug it into the USB and it shows nothing.  I'm so sad.  I love this little thing and now I may have to get an iPod which makes me feel like a sell out.  If anyone else had this problem and it is easily fixed, drop me a line.  I want to keep it, but only if it will work.

<Title>Skip it, buy anything but this one... except for looks
<Date>Fri Dec 30 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Ok, I give it to Philips for the killer good design: this thing looks awesome; i.e. if you like looking at mp3 players, buy it.  However, if you actually like listening to music, go buy a 20$ CD player from Wal-Mart, it will do a better job.  First, the sound is horrible: I bet that the earbuds are to blame (yeah, they look really cool too, but sound like crap), but never got to really buying an upgrade.  Second, the installation software won't even run, unless you have your XP upgraded with every patch imaginable: annoying.  Third, during the very first load, after getting about 130 songs on it, the device froze. I restarted it, added about 40 more and left on a vacation the next day. Guess what? When I turned it on, I had only the last 40 songs on it...   Finally, the device crashed for no reason whatsoever after being turned on and off three times and it took me about 20 minutes to reboot it.  I returned it after 5 days and do not plan on buying another Philips mp3 player any time soon: it's a pitty, it is the best looking player I have seen. It also has three times the capacity of similarly priced players, stores pictures, and has an FM tuner... If the designers would stay and the programmers at Philips would be fired, I would wait in line to get their next product.

<Title>Nice Player
<Date>Sun Jan 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is a nice little 6gb player. The touch pad is very touchy and takes a bit to get used to it. Sound is good and may be better than my old Ipod. The only real down side is that unless you have another program the people at philips leave you with media player 10 which is not the best for managing media files.  You need WinXP SP1 to run this thing and it is drag and drop ready from there which is very nice to have. Its the size of a cedit card and fits nicely into my pockets. The navigation menues are nice and the touch pad makes it a breeze to select all the options. It has several different power and lighting settings to save battery life. I havent let it run down but the most I have gotten is 14hrs on a full charge with the display settings all set in the mid range.  I would recommend this mp3 player for anyone looking at this size HD it is solid player with good looks and sound.   As for the reviewer that had the player die on them, you can do a soft reset by holding the power and + volume keys at the same time for a few seconds and then just power it up.

<Title>Great Little MP3 Player
<Date>Mon Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought this for myself. I have an archos 6 gig mp3 player that needs to be fixed it stopped charging after awhile, well  i decided on a whim i wanted another mp3 player. so i looked at a few online at walmart's site. I was all set to get the 4 gig archos one, but i decided that i wanted a radio in it also. I loved the look of the philips one.  well i ended up going the next day to get it. (that was this past thursday) It is now sunday and i love this thing. I have decided that in a few months when i can save up i am going to save up for the  30 gig version. I listen to alot of music, and have alot of it on my computer. If you do have this mp3 player don't use the earbuds that come with it they sound like crap. I bought a pair of sony ones awhile back that i just adore that i use with this player.  I haven't really had any problems with this player so far. i like the touch scrolling and the touch controls but as previously stated they do take some getting used to. I just use a light touch to get where i want to go.  i do really love having the option to listen to the radio, after years of using my other mp3 player i was just so out of touch with the radio since whenever i went anywhere i'd use my mp3 player. Now i can at least have the option to turn the radio on and have my presets at my finger tips. and i do love the little recording feature i havent really used that yet but i am sure if i have something important enough to remember i will. I also really love equalizer and the different presets i have kept it on the srs wow setting but i think i will have to customize it :), i like that you get a custom option. most of my music isn't in wma format so i have just over 1500 songs on it at the moment, and since i have over 3000 songs on my computer i have to rotate my music quite a bit but i have to say that syncing with the windows media player doesn't take all that long. I am so glad that this player is so much smaller and lighter than my archos that thing was just a pain to lug around but since it's been a few years it makes sense that they've gotten so much smaller lighter and more portable.  I would recommend this player to anyone with a moderate music collection, who doesn't have as many songs as i do (but then when i can i am upgrading to the 30 gig gogear lol).  great player for the price, if u are looking for multitasking in your devices this is a good one don't go for an overpriced over-rated ipod, the gogear can also store data files for transfering to other computers another thing i was looking for in my mp3 player.

<Title>Great new player
<Date>Wed Jan 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this recently and so far I am loving it. It has lots of features and is easy to use.  I like that you can use Media Player to import songs or you can just copy and paste your mp3 songs directly to it by opening it from My computer(which is the way I'm used to), they don't tell you how in the instructions, but it's easy to figure out. The menu response is a little bit slow, but honestly I usually don't notice it.  The radio reception is great and radio encoding feature is nice.  You can also use it as a data storage device, which is also a feature I use, but you have to have the cable with you if you want to move the data to another computer.  Great player overall.

<Title>WORTHLESS
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>the one star is because i cant give a negative i bought this mp3 thinking it would be awesome. 6 gigs, color screen, touch sensitive...for 200 dollars too good to be true, and it is. ive had 2 of these players. the fisrt: i loaded my songs, around 600 or so, and let it charge for around half an hour, i admit-a bad idea, but it powered and the battery showed half full, so i took it with me to a friends house to listen to. after about 15 minutes, i turned it off. a little later when i wanted to turn it on it would not come on. i tried charging it over night, it still wouldnt power. so the next day i returned it and got a second player. i charged it for the recommmended five hours, plus one for good luck, and put all my songs on it again. this player worked fine for about a week. until the exact thing happened as did with the first. i went to turn it on, after listening to it less than an hour before, and it would power up. so i brought it home, charged it for about an hour and it still wouldnt work.  the moral of the story....philips isnt as good as i had expected, although the headphones are nice, and the touch sensitive is cool.....it doesnt work, atleast mine didnt. please try to find anothr alternative...

<Title>Performs great - battery doesn't last
<Date>Tue May 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was torn between buying the Phillips GoGear and an IPOD.  I chose the Phillips because it was less expensive and I liked the looks.  I really like the way the Phillips performs, I've got it loaded with about 1000 songs.  The only complaint I have, and that's why I gave it only 3 stars, is that my battery only lasts about 3 hours.  It seems like even though the player is off, it's using up power.  I have even charged it overnight and the power still runs out.  Maybe the one I have is defective.  Other than that the buttons are easy to use, sometimes a little too touchy.

<Title>IPOD beats it even though this is cheaper
<Date>Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had ipod video and I have been listening and reading about ipod hype. People say there are so many things offered by samsung and philips at lower cost. So I decided lets try one. The audio quality I heard was as good as ipod for mp3s and gogear offers FM, FM recording, voice recording etc. Its even smaller than ipod. It works as HDD which is cool because you can store/backup files; ipod doesn't. I compared to samsung and decided gogear is better for sound. It was a wrong decision but its the decision that gave me reasons why ipod sales beats these other mp3 players by huge margin. Top most reason is simplicity. I started setting up gogear Saturday morning and its sunday evening now its going thru last sync I thing everything will be as I need it. I spent 10 hrs and I know computers well.  First of all, the setup CDs provided are useless. When I put those CDs in, I got message 'recommend newer version for EasyCD connect to internet?'. If you say 'No', setup exits. If you say 'yes' it takes you to microsoft website for windows media player 11. But no download link. Since I have WMP 10, I thoght its asking for version 11. I upgraded to WMP11. It synced fine but started other troubles. Pic were not synced. Then I spent a lot of time on philips support website to fix it. Here is what I found -  1. You will need WMP 10 not 11. Philips provided a plugin for Gogear to version 10. 2. Firmware/Device manager upgrade is must if you are below what they have on there site. 3. I had to install philips device manager. Why??? This thing is suppose to work on standard windows and no need additional software(like itunes). I had to repair using Philips device manager. 4. Adding picture is thruogh WMP sync and its not smooth process. I found that documentation on support. May be its on CD but I was not able to install through CD. 5. On the good side, it has all the additional features I mentioned before. They work fine. FM play and recording is cool. I don't understand how come copyrights companies did not say anything about that. 5. The navigation is confusing. The ff button is same as choose button. Other buttons menu, view are not that user friendly.  Overall, spend more money on IPOD if you do not have intermediate level computer knowledge or time or help. I am sure you will spend few hours setting up. I am giving 3 stars because these additional features I mentioned before. This player has potential but...

<Title>The Nano vs. The GoGear
<Date>Fri Jan 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have been using this little mp3 player now for a while and I feel I can give it an accurate assessment. I'm going to compare it with the ever popular Ipod Nano just in case you find yourself like I did, stuck between two heavyweight champs.  -Appearance: I found myself taken right away with the gogear. It's about the same height of the nano but definitely thicker. The entire player is a reflective midnight black with silver plating on the sides. It fits nicely in the hand and looks stunning. It shows fingerprints, but those wipe away easily. It doesn't seem to scratch too easily, unlike its opponent which scratches at the lightest of touches. I knew someone that kept his nano in a cloth case and it still found a way to show scratches. Albeit, the Ipod nano is incredibly small and aesthetically pleasing, but the darn thing just can't take its punches. The screen is prone to cracking and I've never seen an Ipod nano that didn't have a million battle scars on it. Which one you like better is a personal choice, but in my books, this round goes to the GoGear if only because it doesn't scratch so easily.   -Functionality, Playback and Features: Let me start by saying duh! Who would buy an mp3 player that only has a capacity of 2gb when they could get a different one at the same price that has 6gb of storage. I call this a nobrainer but whatever floats your boat. You could shell out an extra 50 to get the superior nano, but it still falls short of the GoGear by 2gb. The GoGear is extremely straightforward in its design. My computer had no trouble detecting it. I quickly and easily synched my music library to the GoGear using Windows Media Player. The main menu has 5 options to chose from: music, radio, pictures, recordings and settings. Everything is pretty easy to find. The touch navigation is pretty good. I sometimes have a problem with it going two clicks instead of one, but that's a small annoyance. The playback on this player is good. It has a couple of different equalizer settings to chose from. Hip Hop is my personal favorite. It has   dedicated volume, power and menu buttons on the side. I do wish there was a button that took you directly back to the main menu. As it is designed, you kinda have to backtrack through to find the main menu. Again, this isn't really a big deal. One thing I really do like about this player is the fact that it has an Am/Fm tuner. The nano lacks this in its feature set, and it is sorely missed. The navigation on the GoGear is pretty comparable to the  nano, though I feel the GoGear is a little more easy to navigate in. Again this is a personal choice, but I feel the GoGear won this round as well. My main complaint with the nano is that it doesn't have a radio tuner. Who dropped the ball on that one?   -Battery Life: I haven't had enough experience with the Nano to really declare one better than the other, but I'll tell you what I know. The battery on the Philips seems to last a while. I would call its 17 hour rating a pretty accurate statement, give or take a little bit. I do know that the Nano is infamous for its suspectable battery life. Most users complain that it just doesn't have the endurance to make it through the day. I'm going to call this round a draw because of the simple fact that I just don't have enough experience with the Nano. Though from other reviews, I would say the GoGear has again bested the Nano.  -What I didn't like about the GoGear: My main complaints about the GoGear were about the accessories. The rubber case that comes  with it is more like a rubber sleeve that outlines the edges. It does nothing to protect the front of the player, but I guess Philips didn't have to supply a case at all. I also couldn't stand the headphones supplied with it. They just wouldn't fit comfortably in my ear. Again though, Philips didn't have to supply earphones at all, so I guess I shouldn't complain. These are minor complaints and they don't impact my music experience with the GoGear.   -The Verdict: In the end, the GoGear is the clear winner. It looks good, it works and plays well, and it has 6gb of storage 6gb as opposed to 2gb the equally priced nano gives you. This amounts to about a 1000 more songs, more or less. There are only two reason why anyone would chose the nano over the GoGear: 1) they are ill-informed consumers that just wanted to buy the popular mp3 player instead of researching the issue or 2) they just really couldn't get over the size of the nano. The Nano may win on the coolness factor by a slight margin, but it just can't compete with the features of the GoGear. Do yourself a favor, and put your money on the ultra sleek GoGear.

<Title>Frustrating software, but great player
<Date>Sun Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this at walmart after reading reviews for it online. I was intruiged that it showed pics, played tons of music, recorded sounds, AND could receive Fm radio. All of that for the same price of a nano. I got home and it took me a while to sync my song, because the media player is hard to work with. But with that done, I tried to put on pictures. I have Windows XP SP2, and those dang pics would get synced, but not show up on my device. I tried 15 different pictures, all jpgs. After redoing this for hours, I reset everything to factory settings and reinstalled the software. No avail. I checked the troubleshooting section of the Philips site, and it just gave me things I had already done. I decided to call Philips, and the customer support basically read from the manual. They could not diagnose a thing. I am returning this mp3 player for the same one, and hopefull this one will work. I still don't know whether it is a problem with the device or my computer. However, the music sounds great and the color screen rules. I would reccomend this to someone, although they may be taking a risk like I did.

<Title>Dancin' to the beat ... As I shuffle with my feet !
<Date>Mon Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've read all the reviews on many sites regarding this MP3 player. But we all have our own opinions and without those life would be dull. Like the previous reviewer below my review I got my Philips at Wal*Mart also. Although I didn't seem to have any problems loading pictures into my player or songs. I do have to agree with the sync part being a bit hassle. I accidentally hit auto sync instead of manually sync which is a mistake on my part. Should of read the installation manual first so when I sync my songs into the player it took my Default PC sound effects and any other sound files on my computer from games, etc. I have a hard time figuring out how to get rid of those but after uninstall and reinstall I got it figured out. Overall this is an excellent MP3 player. My older brother paid about the same for his 3GB Archos player and he says mine was a good value. Now if it had a Video player to boot it might just slap iPod Nanos in the screen. Sound quality is excellent and battery life ... I have to say I need to properly charge it first. I only charged it for one hour since I opened it from the packaging. It recommends a 5 hr. or something charge. Overall it's a great player for the price. I'd buy it and compare to your friends iPod they tie overall.

<Title>piece of crap
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i received this player as a christmas gift and since christmas i have spent maybe forty hours transferring songs onto the computer and then onto the player.  the computer i use isn't mine so i erase the music after transfer onto the player.  well, after three weeks of using the thing and just as the storage capacity is close to full it no longer recognizes the five gigabytes of music on it!  i can access the music through windows explorer and media player but the player says that it is empty.  i tried to reset the thing (which erases all of the music) but it gave me an error message.  i tried everything i had patience left to try with this thing to restore it but i've had it.  the documentation     that comes with the thing says that you can register online but the philips web site says that online registration is not available in my area - useless website.  my other major complaint with it is the fact that you have to use windows media player for effective song transfer.  i f*cking hate windows media player.  it puts gaps between your tracks that don't exist on the cd and i have tried every setting in the player that relates to this, it also adds cracks and pops in the beginning of the tracks that sound like you pushed the record button on a tape recorder.   screw this thing, for another hundred dollars i can get twenty four more gigabytes with an ipod.

<Title>Perfection marred by crappy software
<Date>Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Philips HDD1630 6gb is a lovely Mp3 player.  Sleek design, small size, lightweight, great sound. Unfortunately, the fact that this player is tied down to Windows Media Player AND ONLY Windows XP SP2, makes on NOT want to purchase this unit.    The player itself is nice.  The screen is bright, colorful and SKINNABLE.  So hopefully in the future we'll be able to download more skins for the UI of the players screen.  It pumps out good volume and the different equalizer settings will keep you jamming that much longer.  I personally didn't use any of the EQ settings and it still sounded great.  Navigating through the menus is quick and painfree, thanks to the simplified interface.  There are only two small complaints and that's the 1 or 2 pause between songs when you skip tracks, makes it almost feel like a CD player.  Second is the photo loading takes a bit longer than you might expect, but over all its an enjoyable experince.  UNTIL you get to the software! I know Windows Media Player LOOKS like a good way to use your music, but its not.  At first I thought it was just me and I was just a jaded person since i used an iPod before.  But i gave it to my sister, who has NEVER used an mp3 player, for a couple of days to use.  From her non-computer saavy perspective she said it was terrible to use.  I don't even want to get into all the craziness that I had with the software!  And I've been in the computing world for 17 years.  This would be an iPod killer.. but the software just ruins your experince.  Pros:  Great battery life small screen, nice screen, great features ON the player itself, the menu on the player is easy to navigate and the buttons look cool, skinnable UI on the player.  Cons: skipping songs on the player has a cd-player feel where it takes 1 - 2 seconds to load the next song.  Software is HORRIBLE!! The USB transfer cable / power cord could definitely use some redesigning.

<Title>BEST LOOKING PLAYER, but buggy design
<Date>Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've have done quite a bit of research and now have pretty good experience with several of the latest MP3 players. This is by far the best looking MP3 player in our ipod dominated world. I have used SanDisk Sansa M240 1gb, IRiver 1gb U10, the Creative Labs Micro Photo 8gb and this player.  PRO: 1) Looks. Sleek and shiny with a good screen. Nice blue lighted effects with the slider. 2) Good battery life. 3) Price. 4) Fairly decent headphones included. 5) SRS WOW - 3D sound, great on surround systems. 6) Touch Slider - All that I've tried seemed to be pretty tricky to get used to.  This is probally the best one I've used that comes close to the ipod.    CON: 1) Sound quality a little meager compared to what I've heard with other MP3 players better than the SanDisk but volume even on max setting is pretty low. 2) Buttons. I do agree its hard to make something look nice and be pretty functional. Because of being so sleek, with no tactile feedback, its can be hard navigate the player while doing other things such as driving or working out. I found this more as a little annoyance. 3) My biggest concern was the buggy interface on player itself. I believe it has problems with DRM windows media files, these are the files you download from the "All you can eat buffet" from subscription services. (Yahoo, Napster, & Real Rhapsody) This player would lockup or pause for an eternity several times and be unresponsive even to turn it off. I exchanged it for another one which came with exact same problems. My experience lockups occur more frequently while using playlists.  RECAP: To me this was a love hate relationship.  I loved how it looked and could see the potential of this player. But until they fix these bugs I would have a very hard time to recommend this product.  I almost kept it in hopes that Phillips may make a better firmware upgrade. I eventually went with the Creative Labs Micro Photo that has performed awesome. It just does not have the shiny finish and it is couple clicks lower on the "I'm Cool!" scale. Before you decide to buy, try searching for "HDD1630 freeze" and you will see variety of comments of this model and it's larger cousin that shares the same firmware HDD6330. I believe comments left here and many other reviews have not used the product at all or fully, I had used it for 2 weeks.

<Title>Style over substance, flash over function, etc.
<Date>Fri Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I recommend a healthy dose of skepticism with regards to this player's high average review score on Amazon.  The Philips' HDD1630 is high on looks and low in price (compared to similarly equipped players), but is unstable, behaves erratically, is often slow to respond or unresponsive altogether, illogically designed, and the sound quality isn't that good either (especially the bass).  After a month and a half of use, my own player started randomly adding the current song to the default playlist when I pressed *any* button, and even a system restore via the included software could not fix this problem.  It's certainly possible that some people own HDD1630s that are not buggy at all, but the apparently high probability of getting a buggy one (given the dissenting reviews) makes purchasing this player something of a crapshoot, so beware.  Instability: The player I owned periodically froze up, perhaps a couple times a week.  (This is a fairly negligible problem on its own, but within the player's larger constellation of flaws, is just another reason to stay away.)  Erratic behavior: More often than the player froze up, I would encounter strange problems with loading and playing songs.  For instance, the player might list a song twice, when I had only loaded it once.  It would often skip over certain songs, despite listing them, and would refuse to play them until I had reloaded them.  I think this is a problem with how the player constructs its database of songs.  Fwiw, I relied mainly on dragging files to the device through Windows Explorer, rather than using Media Player, though I believe the same problems occurred when I used Media Player.  Interface is slow to respond, unresponsive: The touch-sensitive "buttons" are very frequently unresponsive.  While the buttons themselves would consistently light up in response to a swipe of my thumb, the player itself would often not register any command.  Additionally, navigating through menus is awkwardly slow when music is playing.  You might hit a button and not receive any feedback until over a second has passed, and the menus themselves scroll slowly.  A second's delay doesn't sound like much, but in the world of electronic interfaces, such a delay constantly forces us to worry whether we need to repeat a command.  Well designed interfaces offer prompt, nigh-instantaneous feedback.  Perhaps if Philips had cut down on the graphical content, the player might've been able to do so.  Mediocre sound quality: Having recently purchased an iPod shuffle, I found it remarkable how much better the sound quality was in comparison to the Philips HDD1630 (using the same pair of headphones).  The shuffle's sound is much richer and offers high quality bass, whereas the HDD1630 sounds mechanically produced in comparison, and the bass level cannot be much increased from its default setting without generating noticeable distortion.  On the plus side, the player does not scratch easily: I carried it unprotected in my pocket (making sure not to put any abrasive objects next to it) for as long as I owned it, and it failed to scratch at all.  All things considered, though, I'd rather have a scratched yet stable player than a cosmetically flawless and buggy one.  Don't be fooled by its good looks or tempted by its low price.  I *strongly* advise looking (or waiting) for a different player.

<Title>Absolutely LOVE this player
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have no idea why some other reviewers don't like this player.  I've had no problems at all.... so here's my complete review.  I've done a lot of research while searching for my next Digital Audio Player.  I had a Creative Muvo 256 mb player (my first DAP) which I was looking to upgrade because I wanted A LOT more space.  When searching for a new one I knew I wanted these features:  Color screen, at least 5 GB of space, FM, jpeg display, album art display, and voice recording capabilities.  Looks were at the bottom of my list, but I admit, this is a great looking player.    I knew the ipods were going to be WAY out of my price range and they don't have all the features I wanted anyway.  Originally, I ran into what I thought was a deal on a $95 5GB DAP, the japanese NHJ VHD-5100.  That was the crappiest player to ever exist.  It locked up on me literally hours after taking it out of the box so I returned it.  (Do NOT buy that one if you happen to find it somewhere).  You get what you pay for, so my search began for better one.  I decided on the Philips GoGear HDD1630 because it had all the features I wanted so I decided to fork out the extra $80 bucks after returning the VHD-5100.  MONEY WELL SPENT.  WHAT I LIKE: - Plenty of space for my music (currently have about 800 songs with lots of room to spare) - Looks sleek, I like the black color, has the neat blue touch-sensitive lighted controls - The sound is MUCH better than my Creative Muvo - I LOVE the headphones supplied with the player.  I have smaller ears and they fit perfectly and sound great - Album art displays with each song (kind of small but there nonetheless) - FM radio, w/ FM recording feature - Voice recording (I like to record my husband snoring and let him hear how ANNOYING he is - LOL) - Slide show jpeg display... I like to show off my kids every once in a while :-) - Great battery life - The price (you get A LOT for your money)  WHAT I DON'T LIKE (very little): - The front of the player smudges a lot (not a big deal to me) - The sound settings are a little strange, some of them sound muffled.  I've had the best luck with the SRS WOW setting. - No case w/ belt clip supplied with the player.  But you can buy a leather Philips one at Wal-Mart for $9.88.  LOADING SONGS ONTO THE PLAYER: VERY EASY.  Despite what others have said, the player was CAKE to load with my 800 songs.  Windows Media Player is NOT that hard to use.  A monkey could do it.  I have no idea what kind of person could not figure this out.  And even if you don't like WMP, you can also drag & drop through Windows Explorer.    ALBUM ART TIP: Some of my album art did not display initially.  A quick visit to the FAQ on the Philips site solved the issue.  All you need to do is place the album art jpeg file in the album folder using windows explorer, and name it "Album Art.jpg".  That simple.  It works best if you make sure your jpeg file is less than 4k, that way it displays on the player quicker.   BOTTOM LINE: This player far exceeded my expectations.  It was simple to use and very easy to load songs on.  If you're not an idiot and do it correctly in the first place, IT IS VERY USER-FRIENDLY.  I would definitely recommend this player to anyone.

<Title>tough and nice
<Date>Thu Nov 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I have had this mp3 for almost a year now.  i got this as a gift from my girlfriend before i got deployed to Iraq.  i am very pleased with it.  this little thing has gone into hell and came out great.  it has made it working around heavy equipment, sand, heat, and my clumsy hands.  it also survived a roadside bomb where i found it later under the drivers seat from where the impact threw it crossed the truck. And surprisingly there is only a couple scratches on it  the only downfall is the case it comes with is nothing but for looks. i have had problems with it freezing up on me, but the reset has always worked.  i have had the problem once where it erased all my music but then again i just reloaded everything onto it and it has worked ever since.   i am very pleased with it and would buy it agian.

<Title>Decent MP3 player
<Date>Tue Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While I really prefer listening to music on actual CDs, I bought this MP3 player for the convenience of being able to take several albums of music with me in a small player rather lugging around a bulky CD wallet. I'm not a fan of ipods at all, and the Philips player is a nice alternative. The player itself, while not as compact as an ipod, is certainly small enough to fit inside your pocket or backpack. Also, the player itself feels very sturdy, and it can handle getting knocked around better than some other players out there on the market.  The interface is easy enough to navigate, although the touch-sensor buttons are a little too touchy, but that's nothing serious. The sound quality is just fine, although you might want to invest in some bigger headphones to get a fuller sound. The installation was very easy, and there was no problem loading the player with songs. The player I bought has 8 GB, not 6, which is more than enough space. I don't see how anyone could really need 30-80 gigs of music with them, except if they just like the novelty of having an insane amount of music with them.  The only issue I have with the player is it seems to occasionally have problems playing protected files. Most of the time it plays fine, but every so often it freezes up or takes several minutes to load a protected song. This is a non-issue if you just rip CDs to it, but if you use any sort of online service, it may freeze up from time to time. It usually unfreezes by itself, although a couple times I had to reformat the hard drive, and once had to just let the battery die out.  Despite this, the player plays fine 99% of the time. The Philips player is a fine alternative to the overpriced ipod.

<Title>Poor battery life, "blotchy" appearance
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I loved this MP3 player when I first received it - I thought it sounded great and looked very cool. BUT I was unhappy to discover how "blotchy" it looks after even minimal handling - it vividly shows every single fingerprint & smudge on every surface of the player. AND despite boasting a robust battery life, I could never get it to play longer than 2+ hours without needed to recharge it (even after trying every suggestion in the owner's manual and on the Philips website). I decided to return it and get an iRiver, which has worked great.

<Title>Same problem as someone above - A piece of junk
<Date>Wed Feb 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>At first the thing worked fine. I liked the way it looked, the color are very nice and vivid, everything was good. Occasionally it would freeze up and then I would get it reset and everything was ok. Then the other day when I turned it on I heard a clicking sound and then received an error message that said "plug the player into the computer". It was the first time I received that message so I got a little suspicious. I plugged it in and nothing happened. I went on the website and uninstalled and re-installed a ton of stuff. I downloaded stuff from the site and NOTHING worked. Days of this and now I'm about to throw this piece of junk away. I'm on amazon right now looking for another mp3 player

<Title>Had to send for repairs twice
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This player has a problem that requires it to be sent for service to the repair center.  Occasionally, on a power down, and then the subsequent power on, the Philips GOGEAR will become frozen with the advise to plug your GOGEAR to your PC.  And when you attach the GOGEAR to the PC the Device Manager will not recognize the MP3 player.  Therefore you cannot repair the GOGEAR.  A soft reset will not work (power button and volume + button at same time).  You call customer service and they are helpful, but the only thing that you can do in this situation is send the GOGEAR to the repair center.  This is the second time this has happened to me.  Once with the PHILIPS 6 GB HDD1630/17 and now the second time with the replacement model they sent me HDD1635/17.  The only reason I give this item 2 stars is because when it works it is great.  And the customer service representative is helpful.  But that being said it is frustrating having to repair the items.  I was under warrenty and have not had to pay anything outside  the shipping and handling to get the GOGEAR to the repair center.  But I am not sure I would pay anymore money on an item that is cronically breaking.

<Title>Love it when it works (aka MOST of the time)
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my Go Gear for over a year and most of the time its wonderful. The battery lasts me all day, sound is great, no problem with navigation. Then there are the times when it acts up...For some reason, and I can't identify any cause, there are times when the battery doesn't charge fully and when navigating back to the main menu doesn't work smoothly.  There have been a few times when the player has frozen up, but these are pretty rare and were resolved with the soft reset (pwr + up vol). The rubber cover that comes with the player is all but useless, so I wish I had purchased the control case from the start so my player wouldn't have the few scratches it has on the front. With the control case, the player is fully protected and can be hung on a belt loop or pack. Over all, I really like this player. It has been a great alternative to the iPOD empire and I would buy Philips again.

<Title>A pretty good mp3 player
<Date>Sun Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this mp3 player about a year ago, and its been a pretty good one so far. It has excellent picture quality and the scrolling bar in the middle is very nice. I have 2 complaints about it.   1. I have had to send it back because when i turned it on, it gave me an error message and i couldn't do anything on it. After they sent me a new one it worked just fine.  2. Once you put a lot of songs on it (close to 1,000 or so) it starts to perform slowly. For example if i choose to play a song, it will take at least 5 seconds to start playing, and then another 20 seconds to load up the songs information. And it gets really annoying.  All in all i think it is a pretty good mp3 player for the price, but i would suggest (if u dont want an ipod) to get Creative because that is the other mp3 player i had, and i am thinking of getting another one from Creative.

<Title>Absolute Junk
<Date>Wed Apr 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This has got to be the worst player I've ever purchased.  I bought the 8gig version from Wal-Mart and returned it 3 days later.  I spent the first day trying to get Windows Media player to recognize the device.  After finally doing that, this thing too 16 HOURS to transfer 6.5 gigs worth of music.  And to top things off, after the transfer, not all the songs were on the device and some of the songs were only partially there. (they would play for 30 seconds or so and that was it.)  The interface isn't the greatest either.  It was slow and sometimes froze up for several seconds.  I highly DO NOT recommend this product.  I ended up purchasing the 30gig IPOD.  MUCH better product.  Only took 10 mins to transfer the same amount of songs.  The layout and interface is easier to navigate and see also.
