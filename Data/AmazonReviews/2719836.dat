<Title>wish i hadn't lost it!

<Content>I had this player for about 2 years. Used it some for running/exercise. it's VERY lightweight and pretty easy to use once you figure out the center toggle. I put a 2 GB card in it and that worked great (despite it claiming that only up to a 256 would work!). Lost the card along with it - had some stuff i'd recorded during a trip to Egypt, sadly.  anyway, i recommend it. When you up or download files to it you burn through battery fast. Otherwise it will get near the claimed 18 hrs from one AAA.   
<Overall>5
