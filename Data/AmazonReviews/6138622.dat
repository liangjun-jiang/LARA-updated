<Title>At least it looks nice
<Date>Tue Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had my 605 for about a week now and I'm seriously considering returning it.  As said in other reviews, it has a wonderful screen and lots of space but that's about it as far as positives go.      The first thing that really bothered me was that the battery life is nowhere close to what Archos advertises.  17 hours for music playback? The most I've managed to get before it dies is 7. Not even half. As far as Video goes, you'll be lucky to get 2 hours on a complete charge.    The audio quality is what Really makes me want to return it. Not only is it quiet, but the EQ is not a true EQ. It actually attenuates one frequency when another is turned up, so it doesn't really boost the frequency you want, it just appears to be boosted by lowering other frequencies.  The sound quality is a Big step back from even my old Archos Jukebox Recorder V2 and it gives me headaches after a while, which is something that has never happened to me while listening to music before.  Pros- Excellent screen, lots of space, easy file transfer  Cons- Sub-par to Bad sound quality, Horrible battery life

<Title>Very good PMP
<Date>Wed Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 Wi-Fi is a great PMP. You almost don't have to worry about video or audio formats, it will play pretty much anything (mainstream, that is). All you have to do is copy it to the specified folder in the internal HD and that's it. No boring conversions. It works pretty well with Windows Media Player and will sync without a glitch.  The user interface is good and the touch-screen works flawlessly. I was even amazed by how easy it was to type in the touch-screen based keyboard - to the point that I wish it had some sort of text editor in it, so I could take notes.  It is not perfect, though. The battery is just ok - it will play around 4:30 hours of video in good days. If you need an extra juice, you have to buy an external battery, that looks somewhat bulky.  I don't like that it does not have an expansion port for memory cards nor a video-out connection (it comes with the optional DVR Station, which is a must have). And while I also don't like that the web-browser and other video formats are optional, I understand that it is a reasonable way to cut costs, since it is not everyone that need them.  The thing I miss the most is a way to search for music. With 80GB of songs, it is at least boring to go through folders. Since the keyboard works so well, there should be a search function. It is so obvious that maybe there is one and I couldn't find it...

<Title>It's not perfect, but I'm happy with it
<Date>Fri Oct 19 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to replace a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CS7U1C/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/105-6560660-1602060">Creative Zen Vision:M 30 GB MP3 and Video Player (Black)</a> that had been stolen. I really liked my Zen, but I wanted to see what new stuff had come out in the time since I bought it. This led me to getting the Archos 605 80GB instead, mainly because of the optional TV hookups. I've never liked to watch movies or TV shows (or even music videos) on my PC monitor because I can't relax and enjoy something passive while I'm at my computer. I'd also never used the Zen's video capabilities much because the screen was too small. The Archos 605, on the other hand, could be hooked up to a TV (with the DVR station or other accessories--I bought the DVR station), which would allow me to watch downloaded TV shows and movies in comfort--and even better, with other people (it's difficult to crowd around a computer desk to watch a movie), plus I'd be able to watch stuff on the go with its larger screen.  The wifi access, web browser plug-in and PDF reader also helped sell me on the Archos 605. I particularly looked forward to being able to read ebooks in PDF format.  So when I ordered the Archos 605, I was thinking of it as an MP3 "with benefits."  When the Archos 605 arrived, I found out that its screen was totally large enough to watch video comfortably. Shortly after I got it, I watched two and a half seasons of Weeds on it. It's fantastic! I can carry a TV show into the kitchen to grab a snack, etc. When I'm home alone, I'm even able to rely on the built-in speaker--for TV shows, I don't need fantastic sound quality; I just need to be able to hear what they're saying. It's very cool; I'm very addicted. :)  Like I said, I bought the DVR station with it. I had wondered how a video file from the Archos would hold up enlarged on a TV screen, but no worries--the picture quality is good (we have a 32" set). I've recorded some stuff from our TiVo onto the Archos, and the picture quality is good in that direction, too. Since we do have a TiVo, I haven't used the Archos as a DVR (with the downloaded TV listings and scheduled recordings), so I can't say how easy that is to use, but it's definitely easy to manually record something, and I was happy to see that I could tell it how long to record for.  As an MP3 player, it's not as good as the Zen, simply because it's not, primarily, an MP3.   One way the Zen (and probably most other MP3 players) is a better MP3 player than the Archos is that if you power the Archos 605 off while you're playing music, it doesn't automatically start up where you left off when you turn it back on. Instead you boot up to the main screen, and then you have to tap the "resume" icon; otherwise nothing happens. In this way it's less "plug and go" than my Zen was; sometimes if I'm only going to be driving for a few minutes (like a hop from the grocery store to the gas station), I won't bother starting it up at all. Also, the way you lock the controls takes a few seconds longer than the Zen did. With the Zen, you just slid the switch to the lock position. With the Archos, you hold down the TV button until the lock icon appears on the screen.  If you're playing from a playlist when you turn the unit off, and then you hit "resume" after you turn it back on, it doesn't seem to resume the playlist--it does indeed play the song you were on, but it's playing it from the album instead of the playlist, so the next song after that is the next song on the album, not the next song on the playlist. Possibly this is glitch that will be fixed in a firmware update (or perhaps has been--I haven't updated my firmware in a couple weeks).  Finally, changing the play mode (normal, shuffle, repeat one, repeat all), takes a lot more navigating around than it did on the Zen. It really shouldn't take that many clicks.  Sound-wise, the Archos is good as the Zen was, and its drawbacks as an MP3 player aren't so onerous that I'd consider buying a separate MP3 player. The Archos does well enough.  The PDF reader, however, turned out to be a disappointment. First, it takes several (loooong) seconds to go to the next page. Second, there's no way to bookmark where you are so that you can pick up where you left off. I figured I could just remember what page I was on and use the Go To Page feature to get back to it, but  the Go To Page feature uses a slider, which is nowhere near as quick as if they'd let me type in a page number, and it takes a long freaking time for it to then load that page. Ugh. So this thing definitely hasn't replaced my Palm Tungsten for e-reading.  I haven't used the web browser or wireless much. It seemed pretty slow the times I have, and there's no "tap feedback" in the Content Portal, so when you tap on a link, you often don't know whether the tap has registered or not because the screen stays the same while the Archos (slooooowly) downloads the data for the next screen. That's frustrating. The web wasn't as frustrating as the Content Portal; I just haven't had much of a need to use it.  Another downside is that there aren't any cases for it that will protect the unit while allowing you direct, immediate access to it, the way the skin I had for my Zen did. Instead it comes with a padded, envelope-like case that you have to slip the unit completely out of if you want to use it. (To be fair, it's much better than the cloth pouch that came with the Zen.) Leather case options are limited, and all the ones I've seen require you to open the case in order to view the screen or access the navigation. The one from Archos won't even let you turn it off with the case closed, which isn't very handy if you're listening to audio and want to shut it off quickly.   I don't know how many hours I'm getting out of my battery. I did listen to music for 10 hours on a recent road trip without it giving out on me, but I didn't keep going to see how much more I could get out of it. I've also watched a couple hours of video without it running out of juice--and again, I ended up dropping it in the DVR station (which charges it) before it did run out, so all I can say about the battery is that it's  lasting long enough for my needs.   Despite the caveats I've listed above, I LOVE my Archos 605. I love being able to take TV shows and movies with me everywhere. I love that I can finally  watch bootleg concerts and other stuff I've downloaded on the "big screen." It's easy to use. The DVR station is easy to use. The two work together seamlessly. The Archos holds a ton off stuff. It plays my music. It lets me browse the web if I need to.   I'm happy with it, definitely. And I'm keeping my fingers crossed that future firmware updates will make me even happier with it.

<Date>Fri Oct 26 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had the Archos 605 80 GB for about a month now, and have been very happy with it.  I was upgrading from the Archos Jukebox 20 Recorder (which has served me well for about 5 years now) and that's why I wanted to stay with Archos. The few times that I have used an IPOD I really have not liked it.  The main reason for upgrading was to get more hard drive space. The Jukebox only had 20 GB, which filled up pretty quickly. I didn't think I needed 160 GB, but 80 GB seemed reasonable.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting to use this for video playing, but, as a nice surprise, the screen is very watchable, and makes for easy watching if you are on a plane or somewhere like that.  Upgrade the firmware (to 1.3.52 or later) as soon as you get the unit - with the installed firmware I had an issue where after a while of playback, the sound would start crackling. 1.3.52 fixed that.  Pros:  - 80 GB of space, and not too bulky or heavy - no need for itunes or special software, just plug it in via USB and it appears like an external hard drive - can record inbound audio/video (but requires DVR station - which is a must buy, by the way) - can also also browse via directories on the hard drive itself (my preference), or via artist/album/title/etc - playlists are reasonably easy to create on the unit itself (though not so easy to do on a computer and then transfer the created playlist to the archos, that doesn't seem to work) - has a 'lock' feature so that it can be carried around in a pocket - the DVR player can be plugged in anywhere in the world (100 - 240 V) - touch screen - charge via USB  Cons:  - no voice recording feature like the Jukebox 20 had (used to use the Jukebox 20 as a dictaphone). though this might be possible using the DVR recorder and a microphone, which I have not tried - battery life - as noted here, the battery life doesn't seem to be quite what is advertised, music about 10 hours, video about 4 (though this is with the occasional suspend and resume). The battery dock seems to be a necessary purchase (have not purchased yet) - why is the earphone jack on the opposite side of the player from the control buttons? If I am carrying this thing in my jacket pocket, I need to take it out of my pocket and out of the carrying case to change tracks, volume, etc - not quite sure why there is an external speaker on the unit? seems unnecessary - since it has a touch screen I really don't use the buttons very often - not really a con, but I liked the fact that the Jukebox 20 had removable AA batteries, the archos 605 is an internal battery that cannot be removed  Wish list:  - would be nice if this unit had those headphones where it has some of the controls in the headphone cable itself (like some portable CD players have the headphones where in the cable there is a control for volume, change tracks, etc) so wouldn't have to take the thing out of my pocket to do this  Have not tried yet:  - WiFi web browsing - video recording  Highly recommended unit!

<Title>Great potential... a little 'buggie'
<Date>Sun Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This has everything we wanted.  We can get rid of all those ugly CD cases cluttering up the living room, show our summer pictures on TV;  record TV shows we want to watch and even surf the net without having to go downstairs to get the laptop.  Sounds great... if it would all work... It's a new product so expect to call the help line.. Though most things download from Windows media player without a hitch, the playlists don't come through nor do the album covers. I hope they are working on that.  I have called the help line 4 times and recieved 4 different solutions; none have works so far. And for a while I was not able to download the  Opera web browser.  I understand the Channel guide, needed to record TV shows is still having problems but as of this writing I haven't tried to use it yet.  That is the down side.  Upside - a great little device with a good screen and terrific potential.  If you want a total smooth installation wait a few months.  But if your willing to put up with a little fussing this is a wonderful device!  Either way I would certainly buy it again.

<Title>Ipod touch has nothing on this.
<Date>Sun Nov 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased my Archos 605 about 2 days after it was released and couldn't be happier.  I'll admit, I had never heard of Archos products before until I started to do a little bit of research on PVP's.  Most of my friends have the various forms of Ipods that exist and my little sister has a Zune, both are okay but have very small screens and less than stellar resolution.  The Archos 605 provides a much larger size screen (4.3") with great resolution (800x480) for such a relatively small product (I will however admit, the 605 80G is a little bulkier than the other two products previously mentioned). Being WiFi accessible makes it a sweet investment too, I've taken it on several trips and have been able to sign into any open wifi connection for high speed access, something that the Ipod/Iphone and Zune can not do with their limited technology.  I didn't even mind paying the extra cost for the add-ons (Opera Browser and Video player).  Everytime I have my Archos in hand people ask me what it is, I think the screen and the wifi accessible perks people's interest, it sure suckered me in....I'm definately hooked.

<Content>This is a real good PVP player except for the battery life.  The video quality is great and the Wifi features makes it all worth it for the price.  The only bad thing is that you have to pay extra for plug-ins that should have already been included.  Also, battery life is not very good. Watching 1 movie might be enough to drain your battery life completely.  (DVR STATION IS A MUST HAVE - to access the product,s full capability)

<Title>Definitely satisfies the gadget freak in me
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Archos 605 is a good device.  Not perfect, but what is?  Comparing it to it's obvious competitor, the iTouch, it is nowhere near as slick.  No 2 finger zoom, no automatic switching between vertical and horizontal orientation (unnecessary with the large screen of the Archos), not even in the same league in terms of user interface.  The Apple wins hands down...  ...but where the Archos blows away the Apple is in features and functionality, 2 things near and dear to my heart.    Multiple audio formats, multiple video formats, a real browser (additional $30 purchase, an absolute must) that you can actually see and read either in full screen or zoomed.  Zooming is just a double click of the touch screen away which is fine with me.  Browser displays flash too (iTouch doesn't).  Favorites are easy to set and get to, a keyboard automatically pops up when you click into a text field.  Unfortunately you can't listen to music and browse at the same time and I find that quite odd.  Who knows, Archos may (please, please, please) fix that in a later firmware version.  If not then they should have put in a better processor/ram to overcome this obvious deficiency.  You can view photos and listen to music though.  I love that I can just plug my Archos in via USB and copy files over to it using Windows Explorer.  I could also use Windows Media player, but one of my computers is running Windows 2000 and so has an old version of Media player that I don't think syncs devices.  Haven't tried and don't care.  I prefer the former method, but thank you Archos for the CHOICE.  I use the buttons sometimes, though I don't think you can do everything via the buttons only.  Again, haven't tried, thanks for the choice.  I use the stylus for most operations.  I hope I don't lose it because there's no place to store it in the unit.  I guess that's why they gave me 2.  You can also stream video, images and music from a wi-fi connected computer.  Useful if you have one of the smaller GB players, but with the 80gb probably not necessary.  If you leave all your media on your base computer, it won't be available when you leave your house.  Did I mention 80GB (or 30 or 160!)?  Exactly 5x (or 2x or 10x) larger than the iTouch which would hold less than half my music collection.  I need access to it all because I use it as my digital music receiver at home.  I looked for a long time and couldn't find a better device.  I have all my CDs ripped to mp3 format and the CDs are in a box in the basement for backup.  With the DVR device which is available as an optional accessory (again a must have for me), I can place the unit in the DVR and with the included DVR remote, control every function of the 605 and have the screen from the 605 projected to my TV.  This also allows you to surf the web with the remote and see it on the TV.  Also watch videos, YouTube, photos/slideshows & music.  The DVR is a digital media receiver that actually works.  The DVR is just that too (a DVR!), with the ability to download a tv guide and just click on the show you want to watch.  The Archos will record it.  Setup is a little cumbersome and so I will probably not use it for that purpose.  I use it for the docking/charging/video-to-tv option.  If the battery doesn't last long enough for you, you can buy the battery dock which is nice and small and probably doubles the battery life.  There are numerous additional work-arounds people have come up with for additional battery life as well as charging (archosfans forum).  The USB charger is really slow apparently.  This is because USB inherently provides very little power and the battery is relatively large.  So it takes a long time to charge.  Do yourself a favor and decide in advance which of the 4 docks you find most useful and purchase one when you buy the 605.  Any of the docks charges faster than USB.  It has a tiny little speaker that does work in a pinch, and is great for showing someone a video or slideshow with music.  Not something you'd want to use regularly.  Get it.  Now.

<Content>I think this archos player is a nice product.  I bought an ipod classic, but the screen is just to small to be a video player so returned it.  I took it on long trip and it came in handy.  The interface is no apple design, but gets the job done.  Didn't like I had to buy $80 in upgrades to get what I needed, but I guess that's why the price to buy is somewhat reasonable.

<Title>Excellent Product - Not a Great Sync Partner
<Date>Sun Nov 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased the 80GB 605 WiFi a little over a month ago because I absolutely can not stand iTunes.  My music library is shared from a central server at my house, and iTunes can not handle a network localized music library very well.  So I was looking for a media player that could play movies and handle my entire library.    The screen resolution of the 605 is nothing short of amazing.  The picture is ultra crisp and it plays xVid and Divx compressed movies flawlessly.  The 605 is very simple and straight forward in it's ability to handle music also.  The playlist creation leaves a bit to be desired, which is where I run into the only problem I have found with the 605 so far.  The 605 doesn't sync playlists with Windows Media Player running on Vista Home Premium.  It attepmts to create your playlists on the PMP, but they do not work.  There is also an issue when music is synced with WMP, initially, the release year of many media files changes to 1969.  This normally wouldn't be a problem, I could care less what the release year of a song is that's stored on my PMP, but the next time you sync, it changes any songs you played on your PMP to release year 1969 in your library.  This can be fixed with a repair tool on the 605.  When you run the repair tool, although the release year tags get repaired, it erases your ratings of all music files.  I have read extensively regarding this issue, and I believe it is an issue with the 605 firmware that I hope Archos can resolve soon.  Others have mentioned that this doesn't occur with other media players, but I have tried Media Monkey and it does the same thing, so I'm not convinced it's a WMP problem.  The 605 is very intuitive with it's handling of pictures.  Resolution and color is excellent and the touch screen scrolling feature is not only very easy to use, but is also a great wow factor when showing the 605 to friends.  Speaking of the touch screen, it so far has worked flawlessly for me.  I have pretty fat fingers, and I have no problem selecting anything on the screen.  Even though you know your finger is touching buttons other than what you are selecting, it selects the button that has the majority of your finger pressure.  I know there have been mixed reviews of the purchased plugin model, but personally for me it made perfect sense.  I have purchased the Web Browser plugin and the additional video codec plugin.  The two of those combined are $50 in addition to what I paid for the 605, and I still consider it to be one of the best technology buys I have made in the last 10 years.  The 605 browses the web decent.  It is a little slow, but there are very few web sites out there the Opera browser can not load properly.  With the 605's screen resolution, it displays web pages very nicely, and if you need to zoom in to a certain portion of a web page, you simply double tap the screen to zoom and double tap again for the original zoom level.  All in all, the 605 is an excellent product for someone who wants to listen to music and view movies on the go, but wants their PMP to fit in their shirt pocket.  The WiFi and web capabilities are just an added bonus in my opinion.

<Title>feature packed
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>So this device has a number of really useful features packed into a great portable device. I can#t really say whether the quality will last the test of time. I've had it for 2 months now. Initially there were some glitches with sound, these were fixed by a software update, and I haven't had too manhy issues since.   Generally the device works well. It exposes multiple features in a usable fashion. The navigation menu's and overall usability of the device isn't very user friendly. It's not as intuitive to use as some other players on the market. However all the features are there and more.  Try and think of a portable device that can surf 95% of web pages and truly supports flash content. 99% of pda's can't boast that. It has a number of extra "soft" features such as wireless streaming from a computer through the player.  If you really want to fully feel the force of the player, you will need to purchase the extra plugins and the dvr station. For around $75 the dvr station does a really good job for the price!! It's not much more than ipod video out cables and it allows this plus much more. Make recordings of any program, stream content from a desktop pc through the player and dvr onto your tv with ease. Surf the web on your TV and watch youtube and google videos through it. This is one of the most amazing things, and the quality isn't too bad, especially with youtube videos!!  I'll need more time to see whether the device continues to perform well to judge whether it will last. It's not the sort of portable you'd want to take on a short road/rail/bus trip as it's not as portable as a simple mp3 player and is more purposeful as a video player. You are likely to use it more as a portable video on long haul journeys, and in this class it performs great.   My one major gripe with the product is the lack of tv tuner thus relying on the digital cable boxes to perform the tuning and making channel control difficult (although the feature is available it doesn't seem to work with my setup). This means if I want to record 2 seperate programs on 2 seperate channels I'd need to manually switch channels.  Not the optimum thing to do when recording overnight. A little trick around this would be to use the cable auto program tuning features if you have such available to force the cable box to autotune to the different channels for recording. This should work but is definitely annoying and unwelcome.  All in all great device, does what it says and performs reasonable well at it.

<Title>A fine piece of kit, with the usual Archos eccentricities
<Date>Thu Nov 29 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Initial experiences after 3 weeks of ownership of Archos 605 WiFi 80GB - In short, I love it. Extreme geek tech heaven. Why I bought it:  I own an Archos Gmini120. Apple products are trendy, well built and aesthetically pleasing but way too much money for the functionality they offer. I also think iTunes is hideous. The iPod touch is the best of that bunch, but the screen is only just big enough and 16GB isn't enough for me.  I was considering the Creative Zen Vision W 60GB Slim, but it seemed expensive considering no WiFi and a much lower res, lower colour depth screen. Also, a Compact Flash slot is fairly useless nowadays.  People complain about Archos' customer support and product reliability, but I never had problems with my Gmini and the build quality on that is terrible. It is now 3.5 years old and still going strong, after a DIY battery replacement. I hope the A605 lasts as long.  - Size/Weight portability-  It's fairly slim, but quite heavy. I can put it in my shirt pocket, but wouldn't want to. Measured at 10.5 oz, which is 1.5oz heavier than my old 'brick' Gmini. The one I saw in Circuit City was lighter and thinner - must have been the SD card / Flash only version. The HDD version has a dark grey expanse sitting out the back of the unit, unlike the one I saw, which was totally silver.  There is a single metal leg that folds out the back of the unit, which stands it up perfectly on a hard, flat surface. However, plug in the USB power adapater and the leg becomes useless. I wish they'd included a mini USB socket.  The build quality looks pretty nice. No sharp edges or misaligned case parts like the Gmini. I think the case is all plastic, except for the HDD back cover and screen bezel. It has already picked up a little ding in the bezel. Don't know how it got there because I am meticulously careful with this kind of kit. I have also noticed that the paint finish on the rear cover is wearing through where the 4 little feet bumps are. White plastic underneath - eek!  - HDD -  The HDD is quite noisy - I can't hear it without sticking my ear on the case, but can feel the vibration through the player. It shuts down completely when it gets bored while playing MP3s, videos or web browsing. The HDD appears to get quite warm, since the case is cool when playing MP3s or just charging the battery. HDD activity when playing movies varies, dependant on encoded data rate. Playing DVD .VOB files directly is the worst.  - Battery / Power -  Battery life appears to be pretty bad, as expected. This doesn't seem to be one of Archos's strong points. The Gmini was advertised as 10hrs but the most I've ever got is 6. Creative and Apple seem to go the other way; underestimating their battery life. Of the 5 segments in the battery meter, the first disappears after a few minutes of use. Only 0.5 hour of use and the 2nd bar is gone. 2 hours of .VOB video playing and it's in the red. The WiFi doesn't clobber it as much as video. I got a 4AA to USB battery pack for $10 from Walmart which helps, but the power drain while watching videos exceeds what can be replaced via USB. I have the mini Dock, but that takes a 5V DC 2.1mm mini jack for power. It charges way faster than from USB, but still takes ~3 hours for a full charge.  There are several shutdown modes. When externally powered it will only shut down the HDD and screen. HDD shuts down when no activity as a USB storage device. When on battery power you can 'suspend' or switch off completely. It boots almost instantly from a suspend but takes about 30s from 'off'. Annoyingly, you cannot 'suspend' when on ext. power, so you have to chew a few seconds worth of battery charge to power it down after a full charge.  I wasn't too bothered about the lack of removable battery pack, since I already replaced the one in my Gmini. The A605 actually has screws on the case, so it should be a cinch once someone on eBay starts selling replacement batteries. It would have been nice to be able to buy two (or more) batteries and swap them when one runs out. Advantage: Zen Vision W.  - WiFi -  The Wifi is not as sensitive as a typical PC, but not surprising since there is no external antenna on the A605. Also the WiFi 'Available Networks' UI is a bit annoying, as it keeps shuffling the list of access points, dependant on signal strength. This makes it tricky to connect to any particular one, since they keep jumping around in the list! Several times I've tried connecting to the wrong access point due to this. Fortunately it remembers your default AP setting.  - Streaming A/V files from a server -  This works perfectly. I haven't tried streaming from Windows Media player, because I hate using extraneous software. I can stream directly from my Linksys NSLU2 NAS device (original firmware). Player finds all devices on my LAN and even lets me login to the NSLU2 with my username/password. Then it's just a matter of browsing to the folder you want and playing the files.  - Plug ins -  Player can connect to the Archos server without you buying the Opera plug-in, but I couldn't buy the plugins from there. Resorted to doing it on my desktop PC and transferring the .AOS update files to the A605 via USB. The Archos website was annoying in that although I'd entered all my personal details when signing up for a user account, the plug-in buying pages were not linked to my account info. I had to type it all in again to buy the codecs. I didn't get the AAC codec because I hate iTunes and own no iPods nor AAC files.  - Video quality -  I've played .FLV, .MPEG and DVD folders (.VOB) on it so far. Screen resolution is pin sharp. Black levels/contrast aren't as good as my $1800 Samsung LCD TV, but it's perfectly watchable in most situations. Is not watchable when sitting outside in the sun however. LCD backlight has only 3 brightness levels; the lowest of which isn't really low enough to prevent eye strain when viewing in the dark. Tweaks to the contrast, brightness and gamma controls improve that.  - Sound quality -  Sound quality is pretty good but not awesome. There's a slight hiss noticeable when no audio is playing, which is a shame. My ancient Gmini didn't do that. I can't hear any HDD-induced noise that others have reported. I can however hear substantial noise induced by the WiFi chattering. This makes listening to streamed content from the headphone socket useless. The mini dock A/V output is immune from the WiFi noise.  The built-in speaker is surprisingly clear for its size, but doesn't play that loud. You need a quiet room. Headphone level is perfectly OK for efficient headphones; not quite enough with cheap 'on-ear' headphones in an aircraft. I use some cheap Koss 'The Plug' earbuds most of the time, since they are LOUD and block out most external noise.  - User interface / Firmware usability -  Intuitive UI - no need for a user guide for that. There's a home page with icons for the various things you can do - Video, Music, Photos, Web, etc. You can browse the hard disk folders or use the 'ARC library' (music library) to select content to play. The library sometimes updates itself automatically and you can get it to manually update.  When you plug the USB cable in (to a power supply or PC) the A605 asks whether you want to enable the USB or just charge the battery. This is very useful, since you can't do anything on the A605 itself when it has a data connection to a PC. You can choose to have the A605 be a media player compatible with Windows or a generic USB mass storage device. I chose the latter, because I like to be in full control of my files and don't need automatic syncing. It's also great that you don't have to segregate part of your HDD to work as a USB mass storage device - the whole thing is one!  The user interface is fast enough, but not super fast. It locked up once on me and I had to do a hard reset (pin up the tiny hole in the bottom of the case). It was having trouble connecting to my WiFi AP at the time - low signal strength and I got impatient and did too much clicking. A hard reset means it boots up again from scratch, and loses the time setting. The A605 can set the system time from the Internet incidentally, which is a nifty feature. It has rebooted itself a few other times - e.g. when playing a screwed up video file.  The device plays MP3s in a folder sequentially, without a playlist, but annoyingly makes a very short glitchy sound when changing tracks. My Gmini doesn't do this.  The device automatically bookmarks the last media file that you stopped playing. if you hit the resume icon on the main menu, it starts playing from that point. You can also manually set bookmarks in up to 32 files, but have no access to the list of bookmarks. To access them, you have to browse to a file you bookmarked, then hit resume on that file.  Other, minor annoyances -  * When the device has the keylock on, it still accepts inputs from the keys or touchscreen. The LCD backlight comes on, an egg timer appears and then a message to tell you the lock is on. This is pointless, since if you put the device in your pocket while listening to MP3s, your battery will still get drained by the LCD coming on.  * Volume levels 1 thru 4 (out of 33) are actually all level 0.  * If you leave the player on pause, it will never shut down. Bye bye battery!  * There is no sleep timer. Most MP3 players nowadays can power themselves down after a set period while playing. Useful for bedtime listening.  Hopefully these issues will be fixed in future firmware updates. For me, owning an Archos is like owning a British sports car. It's a fine machine but definitely an enthusiast's product. You have to accept that some quirkiness comes as part of the deal.

<Title>Archos 605 WiFi reviewed!
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was highly anticipating the arrival of my Archos 605!  But after using the device for 1 week, I returned it.  Here's why:  1. It is PAINFUL to charge this unit. It took me a whomping 6-9hrs via USB cable to PC to fully charge this thing. (BTW, no battery level indicator when charging) :(   2. Poor battery life. At max charge, I got only 4hrs 20 minutes worth of Video usuage. Way below what they advertise.   3. I can deal with #1 & #2 but the real kicker as to why I returned it: You CAN NOT view video content and charge this unit at the same time. Reason is, USB limits power to 5vt, 500mA. Simply stated, 500mA is not enough juice for the Archos 605.   So you're left with having to buy an external power supply for a poorly designed PMP. Archos should have supplied one! More money out of your pocket...   4. A la cart plugins? After spending $330 on this thing, it seems like every button you press on the Archos directs you to buy a plugin; $20 or $30 here and there really starts to add up! The sad thing is that all these plugins are already loaded on the unit! You are just paying to get the key to unlock them.  5. Poor technical support. They outsource!   On to the Pros, this thing does have some.   1. An AWESOME screen. The resolution was great! I was very happy watching videos and viewing photos.  2. Touchscreen! Very nice and I found it very easy to navigate.  3. Supported video formats like AVI!   The Archos 605 WiFi had sooooo much potential but it fell short. Battery charge time, battery life, a la cart plugins really start to outweigh all the benefits. It did for me.   If you really want to MAX the capabilities of this unit, be ready to pay an additional $100-$200 for plugins, external power, DVR. Too steep for me!

<Title>Napster - to - Go WORKS on the 605....
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Had a great deal of trouble finding out if Napsters protected To-Go content worked with the 605 - finally got mine and they do indeed work (have to sync through WMP of course.)  This is a great do-it-all player for those looking for something a bit more robust than the iTouch'es.  We'll probably never see the day when Apple allows us to record video content directly to an iTouch so for me this is about a thousand times more usefull - why pay .99 an episode for Lost when I can simply set my 605 up to record the entire season for free?  Do your own research, actually look at the pro's/con's of this unit and don't purchase blindly.  Too many user reviews here state things they returned the unit for that have information readily available on the web.  This unit does cost extra for features/plugins - thats not a negative, only for those of you that did no research would it be a problem.  Knowing the cost for the features I wanted helped me pick this unit out, huge hard disc, incredibly speedy video playback (compared to my wifes Zen and my old Zen Vision M) and the ability to record AUDIO and VIDEO from any source.  I use this unit mostly for video, however 60 gigs of Napster to-go tracks come with as well - I also record audio from live DJ sets directly to the device, all of which are handled insanely well by this unit.  I give it 8/10 heres my breakdown:  PROS: -Insanely nice screen, viewing angle is great compared to other similair products -Huge hard drive -DVR Features (extra $$ for the dock) -Web portal is nice for when you are out and about  CONS: -non-standard USB jack -no place for stylus on unit

<Title>Great for the patient, Frustrating for others
<Date>Fri Dec 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got my Archos 605 in the mail yesterday and am in general happy with it.  However, a few things that you need to know if you buy this product: 1) Make the leap to firefox.  Technical support finally directed me to this; apparently the Archos website and store just don't work well with IE. 2) Prepare to spend a good amount of time setting this up.  It's not an iPod, with the happy iTunes plug and play features.  This is a powerful system that is not trivial to get what you want to do.  If you're the type who likes puzzles and configuring software, this is the product for you.  If  you didn't like programming your tivo, I would suggest another product. 3) What people are saying about the plugins are right -- you totally have to buy multiple plugins to do what you want. 4) If you are an audible user...audible files aren't going to play on this thing.  AAC files will, so your audiobooks you bought on iTunes will work. 5) Take the plunge and invest in a battery dock of some sort from Archos.  You will definitely need it because the battery life is just not that great.  On the other hand, the web browser is really nice, and the interface is pretty intuitive to use.  I like how I can pretty much put anything I want on it (granted, plugins may be required) and that things aren't locked down like Apple.  Hope that helps!

<Content>This is an amazing Portable media player. Once you get the firmware update (which if you don't get it seems like a paperweight) then you have many options at your hand. This PMP gets pricy after plug-in and other optional add-ons that seem like they should have come with it. I bought the Mini-Dock shortly after I bought the 605 because if you use it while charging USB it will die and it doesn't come with an AC charger. The Wifi is really simple to setup and use with the on screen QWERTY keyboard. After the plug-ins and external devices you can get, this is an amazing media player but to unlock it's potential, you'll need to fork up a pretty penny.

<Title>DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU WANT TO SYNC MUSIC PLAYLISTS FROM WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER!
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>This could be a fantastic media player.  Its got lots of features and is a pretty good value, although you have to buy software "plugins" to unlock a lot of features, and have to buy the DVR station if you want to record any external input.  I bought it mostly to store and play a large music collection which I have arranged, and for which I have already created many playlists, in Windows Media Player.  Nothing on Archos' website or in the manual tells you this, BUT YOU CANNOT SYNC YOUR PLAYLISTS FROM WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER TO THE DEVICE.  You can sync your content, but the playlists will not transfer in a readable format.  That means that you would have to recreate all your playlists again for use on the Archos device.  No thanks.  I have had three other media players and every one of them synced fine.  This is a simple software feature that Archos could add, but for some reason has chose not to.  What a shame.  With this one feature, the player could have been great.  As is -- NOT.

<Title>Excellent for the most part
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Pros: -Picture Quality -All the add ons -Price to storage ratio -Stand (Believe me, this is great when using video)  Cons: -Battery Life (not quite close to what is advertised; I have gotten 5 hours of mixed usage: Video and Audio when I should be getting 5 hours of Video) -Weight -The included Cover -Proprietary Cable (no mini-USB)  I think this is a fairly honest review, and do feel that despite the magnificent player this is (I have the 80gb one), the cons make me give this 4 stars.  I think that if the cons are covered, this player (which I already think sets the benchmark for PMPs) would be as close to perfect as possible.  One warning, as you might have discovered, this is a modular design in that the price you see is not the price you should expect for every one of those functionalities to work (the TV station, Codecs for movies, certain MP3s, and wifi Internet will cost *extra*).

<Date>Tue Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Archos 605 80G for almost a month now and enjoying every bit of it. As many reviewers have indicated, the battery life needs improvement and there should be a wall charger included in the package. The product is also quite masculine - and lacks physical appeal. Apart from those three complaints, I am satisfied with the product and it's capabilities.   Archos need to step up there advertising because I knew virtually nothing about this product until I was reading some reviews while deciding whether or not I should purchase the iPod Touch 16G. Alas! I was more convinced that the Archos better suited my needs (taping my tv shows and the video capabilities).   Now I need to figure out how to keep my husband from using it more than I do ;).

<Title>Good Device But Bad Marketing Killed It
<Date>Sat Jan 26 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the Archos 605 because its features fit what I needed, which was for portable entertainment and watching training videos. The only downsides to the device in my opinion are its flimsy buttons, proprietary USB cable, and choppy slow wifi.   Now for the real downside... their marketing folks probably thought it'd be a good idea to leave out stuff, so customers can pay for it later. For instance, I ended up paying an extra $70 to get the H.264 Video Podcast, MPEG Cinema, and Opera Browser plugins. If I know how bad the wifi was, I wouldn't have shelled out the $29 for the browser plugin.  But that's not the worse part. The hoops you have go through to get the plugins are a pain. They make you go through a four step order process, which includes getting your 605 serial number and product key. But that's not all, I had to grind over the order process four times -- filling out all the forms each time -- to  run my perfectly valid credit card through.  In all, I'm not impressed... no... I'm not happy with the experience. The Archos 605 would have been a four star if it weren't for the poorly thought out end-to-end product offering. With all things considered, I give it a 1 star piece of **** rating.

<Title>Forget the wifi streaming feature
<Date>Tue Jan 29 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I have just bought the 605 with the dvr dock and am not that happy with some of the functionality: 1. the unit 'freezes' quite often (I have only had it a few days), sometimes a reset is required by pressing and holding the 'on' button. 2. playing a movie file from another device on the network is theorectically possible but in practice the picture freezes quite soon after starting and that's that. Using the UPnP server feature via Windows Media Player is much better but then the picture appears ever so slightly 'jerky' which is particularly noticeable when smooth motion is supposed to be taking place. Basically the movie plays but is very annoying to watch 3. sometimes the unit just 'pauses' when you are navigating around in the menus, this is very irritating especially when combined with the other things.  All in all I would not recommned this device for anything except playing media which is on it's local hard drive and web browsing via the wifi connection (browser costs another 30 usd). The streaming features sound good but just get an Apple TV or Archos TV instead then either get and Ipod touch or the 4 gb solid state version of the 605 for media on the go

<Content>I did my research, lookin' at all alternatives (Ipods, etc.), but my conclusion was that the feature-rich Archos 605 fit the bill best of all: music, photos, (or, anything you might wish to store), and a digital video recorder with which I can record favorite movies and shows, directly from the TV...  The big PLUS is the WIFI with the Opera browser. This put it over the top, I travel extensively and really want to be able to check mail, make reservations, etc., but don't want to schlep a laptop ...   I can do everything with the Archos. Sound and video are remarkable, as is the build quality.

<Title>It has its shares of flaws... but nonetheless a great device
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had my Archos 605, which I now refer to as my media brick, for a few months now and I decided to write a review and throw in my 2 cents worth for people who sit there and read all the reviews before they buy.    First off, you really do need the web browser, video plugins, and some sort of dock (I went with the minidock) in order to get the full benefits of this thing. Yes it's more money to spend but overall the price is still  reasonable for the features it provides.  I got the 80gb for 260 off of Amazon, which was an amazing deal.  The user interface is not that slick but it gets the job done, very straightforward.  One thing I must point out is that I didn't read the manual at all and I figured out to work this thing just fine.  Some people complained about it being hard to use and the interface being complicated and what not and it makes me think that these people must live in caves and this is their first electronic device or something.  Yes it's not dummy-downed like an Ipod but jeez it's not rocket science.    The Screen and Video: The size is very viewable The 800x480 resolution is really amazing and can not be beat Touch-screen works perfectly and is very responsive (I was worried because I watched the youtube video of the archos and itouch side by side but it's totally false) I really wish they took the buttons away since I feel there's no need for them and make this thing a bit smaller.  Then I would be more in love with it than I am now. My minidock allows me to output video to my tv and the quality is dvd-like so I'm very happy with that Viewing high resolution pictures and videos on the archos is pretty much breathtaking Out in sunlight it's kinda hard to see the screen and you really have to turn the lcd light and brightness up. The video sizing feature is nice because there will be a setting that will allow the whole picture to be viewed no matter the resolution. I wished auto would resize the video so that it fits perfect on the archos screen without cropping but it doesn't always. It also allows you to adjust gamma, brightness, contrast, so you can really customize what's easy on your eyes With the extra video plug ins you can watch most video formats  Audio: The external speaker is a plus and I use it often If you like your music than you will need to dump the headphones and get some nice ones (I bought some v-moda vibes). The audio output is not that loud so some good headphones with high efficiency would be best (with my v-moda vibes I don't even listen at full volume) so it's not really an issue.  I just notice that other audio devices the limit is ear-deafening while this is not. If you're using the audio output to some external source, change the sound setting to SPDIF, it will boost the volume and you can adjust the sound with your external source. The sound quality is pretty good, the only thing is it lacks a little bass and the bass boost doesn't really enhance the bass but instead just muddies the sound. But without the bass boost all the way up, there is exceptional clarity and that is important to me. The equalizer is pretty effective, i find myself adjusting it a lot because when I listen to a song I like it to sound just right and the presets do not suffice. Overall, I'm happy with the sound quality because I'm not really a bass head anyways. Music is easy to organize and play.  (I use mediamonkey to sort my music, edit tags and get album covers, and it's free) Sometimes ARCupdate does not reorganize the files the way it should and you just have to take that folder out, update, put it back in, update. Easy to create playlists.   I wish I could listen to music while browsing the internet.   Internet (optional) Easy to browse and navigate A little slugglish but doesn't bother me, unless you're really have impatient issues.  I would say browsing is faster than a 56k modem but far from highspeed. However, the streaming videos load at highspeed so there is no lag what so ever.  I love watching my anime on my archos.  The only complaints here are that you can't skip through the video even though it has downloaded farther than where you are it.  And that the flash player is an older version and does not work with some sites.  Youtube and Dailymotion works but no VEOH or megauploads videos.    Streaming videos over wifi network works like a charm and is definitely useful.  I can even transfer files over wifi if I wanted to.  Battery life sucks but charging to full is pretty fast with a minidock.  If you're just playing music then it will be good enough but it's not enough for watching more than 2 movies or browsing the internet for long periods of time (the lcd really sucks up battery life).  It will fit in your back pocket, and front pocket if your jeans are loose.  It's not that heavy but it is a little bit bulky.    Even though I mentioned some negative points in this review, I still gave it a 5 because it really is amazing what this thing has to offer.  Being able to browse the internet and watch videos online, listen to music and watch movies on an 80gb hard drive with a hi resolution screen all in the palm of your hand is really a huge step forward in technology.  Wifi networking, pdf viewer, widgets, flash games, use as portable hard drive.  This thing is extraordinary.  I feel like I own a tiny laptop more than a media player. I always have it with me and I will never be able to live again without it.  I know that if you purchase this device you will fall in love with it, forgive it for all its shortcomings and won't be able to detach yourself from it.  So in order to highly recommend the purchase of the archos 605, I can not give it anything less.  Last note, there are a bunch of linux guys hacking this and they have a linux os running smoothly on the archos.  There is so much potential for the archos.  Maybe a new slick interface, or a full blown mini pc is just around the corner.

<Content>The only drawback that I find is that it is a little bulky but the big screen really helps while browsing the internet, watching videos or pictures. The user interface is not the most friendly one either but its just a matter of getting used to it. Overall, it is a great product.

<Title>ARCHOS, read this and you can double your sales...
<Date>Fri Feb 08 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Problem # 1:  The process of buying the separate plug-ins is painstaking and will leave a bad taste in your mouth afterward. The only "out of the box" experience customers are having is one that says, "Nice, I can't use any of the features that made me want to buy this thing in the first place until I buy and install all the extra plug-ins" (which are NOT easy to install until you talk to tech support, btw).  Solution:   Bundle them in the unit - even if you have to increase the retail price. I'd gladly pay more to not go through what I did for installing plug-ins.  Problem # 2   The design of the Archos 605 feels and looks cheap. This is astonishing to consider when your main rivals (and market leaders iPod, Creative, etc.) all have cheaply-produced (yet slick and cool-looking) molded plastic outfits. The worse part is the rough-finished, sharp-angled, powder coated faceplate that surrounds the display on the 605.   Solution:  Smooth out the sharp edges and rough, grabby finish around the display. Remember, that's where people's fingers will be doing the most work. Bottom line...you should make a unit that looks good and feels good to hold or NO ONE will buy it over your competition (ESPECIALLY WOMEN).  Problem # 3:  The lack of a proper charger to accompany a $300+ unit is madness. I know the highest margin items are all the add-ons and accessories, but this is going too far. Right now, I've had this unit two days and the long USB charging time is only increasing my dissatisfaction with your product and company.  Solution: Include a damn charger!    Finally, even though I may have harsh comments for the unit (Archos 605, 80GB) and Archos' marketing angle, it's only because I think the 605 has the guts of a REAL iPod killer. The video is awesome and the features blow Apple's Touch away. I'm only adding my two cents as a picky, impatient consumer who wants to see a unit that he can actually recommend to friends, family, and everyone else.  Come on guys, make it happen so I can buy a Gen 6 and make my iPod  Touch-owning friends weep with jealousy! When you do, your sales will DOUBLE because electronic junkies like me will tell anyone and everyone to buy one.

<Title>A great portable video player
<Date>Sat Feb 09 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I got the 605 wifi about a month ago together with the DVR. I mostly use it on my commute to watch movies, videos recorded using the DVR function and listen to music. I found it to be a very capable PVP. I came from a 3rd generation iPod. So the 605 is quite a bit bigger and heavier. I will not be carrying it in my pants pocket to walk in the park. But nowadays, many  device can play music. I can use my motorola V3i to provide 2 hours of music. For my commuting use, I can easily put it in my bag so it is not a problem. I may get a flash music player if I want it for some other activities. With the bigger size, it comes with a great screen! It is clear, sharp and color display is excellent. I have played with iPod Touch (which I had also considered at the time of purchase) and the iPhone in Apple Store. Their screen clarity are all wonderful. When I use the 605 on the train with bright light from overhead, I've found that there is little reflection on the screen, which is good. So with the 80 gb capacity and the DVR TV recording capability (no transcoding required) I went with the 605 instead of the iPod Touch. The touch  screen control and the buttons on the unit are very responsive. Volume is a bit low for my train ride. I usually have to set to 3/4 of max. and use a Sennheiser noise cancellation headphone for my viewing. The bookmark feature is good because it lets you set one bookmark on each video. Not just the video currently playing. I can jump around to different videos and resume where I left off. I did not buy the browser plug-in so I have not use the wifi feature yet. It should have been included in the first place. I have tried to view photos on the 605. It displays large jpg pictures relatively quick. The brightness and color are also  very good. The finger-flipping control on the touch screen is cool and works pretty well. May be I have the screen protector on, it is not as sensitive as I would like it to be. I have mp3s in Chinese title. The 605 can display them properly. But the way I get it to work is to change the language setting to Chinese. Then all the menu controls are in Chinese, which is not what I want.  It is just a little annoying. And from time to time, the hard drive spins up for a few seconds, the video I am playing will stutter for a second. Then it will resume playing smoothly. It doesn't bother me that much but it may to somebody. The DVR Tv recording is relatively simple. The quality is quite acceptable. It is very convenient though. I was considering the iPod Touch. But that option, I will have to get an EyeTV (which records in MP2), transfer to MP4 (time consuming), then transfer to the device. The 605 does it in one setting. But, I found out that it uses the DVR's IR emitter to control my VCR for on/off, duration and channels switching. I need to input those information with the 605 and DVR facing me, then I have to turn them around so it faces my VCR's IR receiver before I walk away. Perhaps I haven't figure out a better way yet. It can also moonlight to be a portable storage device, PSD--I am planning to get the mini dock or battery dock for photo storage while on vacation. With it USB host capability, I can offload photo from memory cards to the 605 either as a back up or empty the memory card for more photos. All in all, I found it to be a great portable video player, a capable PVR.

<Content>This is the 2nd Archos I've bought.  Bought the 500 couple of years ago, it came with everything but the movies.  The 605, does not have all the add-on you need.  Missing is a cover, remote control, docking station, drivers for internet and various movies/audio format. The older version was excellent value for the money, this model does not provide the same value. Hope Archos re-bundle all the add on in the future models.

<Title>Well-made unit, pricey extras..
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I've had several PMPs over the years, including an original Archos Jukebox, a Zune, a Nokia tablet, and various Apple products.  My newest is the Archos 605 Wi-Fi. The 605 packs a tremendous amount of functionality in a relatively small package for a reasonable* price. Physically the unit is heavy, but comes with an integrated (and somewhat sharp) kickstand. The GUI is well laid-out, and is duplicated in a row of buttons on the right-hand side. These are understandably small, though have no backlighting. There is a sculpted curve across their face in an attempt to make them easy to differentiate by touch, but if you use this unit under low lighting conditions be prepared to hit the wrong button a few times. Oddly, the direction keys (arrow up, down etc.) are not arranged in a logical pattern; in future versions this might be best served with a small joystick or 4-axis touchpad. The touchscreen works well, though the unit had no provision for storing the stylus. A fingertip works also, but not the best choice if you want to avoid smearing the screen. The resolution is superb, and I've been able to play movie files of several different types without conversion hassles (but see note below).  The only negative for me were the "plugins." The device is marketed as the 605 "Wi-Fi," but in order to utilize the built-in Opera browser, you need to purchase a $29.95 license to enable it.  Additionally, to view .MPG files (unless you want to convert them beforehand) you need to buy the $19.95 cinema plug-in. So budget up front for these items if you want the functionality. Other oddities: the volume is on a bit of an odd curve; the sound ceases abruptly before the volume is all the way down, and the highest setting is not terribly loud. That might be good, however, if you're giving it as a gift to a child whose hearing you wish to protect. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. I'd make a few changes to the next version, but this is a solid, reliable piece of gear with plenty of attractive features.

<Title>Archos is a solid performer, and I like it
<Date>Mon Jan 07 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>The Archos player is pretty cool.  Not as cool as it could be, but cool enough.  Here are my observations: a. Awesome video quality.  The fact that the screen is bigger really helps. b. Multiple file formats supported.  That by itself beats out the iPod and other players.  You can drop divx, mpeg and a host of other formats onto the device and they will play just nicely. c. It is really easy to use.  Drag and drop is the way to go.  The only thing that you will have to pay attention to is editing video that you record from TV.  If you screw it up it could be painful. d.  Archos support has not been bad.  It will take them about a day to answer your emails.  If you are patient you can call the hotline.  The folks there were really helpful.  So I don't have a problem with them. e.  The battery sucks so bad it is sad.  You can barley turn the damn thing on without it losing 2 bars on the energy indicator.  So if you are doing a lot of traveling you will need to buy the battery pack (whichever one you want). f.  They nickel and dime you on the plugins and other stuff.  That is really frustrating.  I shelled out $70 for the internet, podcast and video plugin.  These functions should be inherent to the device.  If each player came with these features out of the box I am sure Archos would gain a greater market share. g.  The DVR station is a must.  Correction...don't buy the DVR station buy the travel one.  It is cheaper and does the same thing.  Either way you are going to want that capability.  It ain't cheap.  The DVR station was another $80 or $90 bucks.  I recorded a show the other day and edited out the commercials on the device.  Worked like a charm and now I am hooked. h.  I bought the 80g version.  I have loaded about 50 music videos, 10-15 movies and a bunch of music and I still have about/or more than 40 gigs left.  If you are going to DVR a lot of stuff you will need to get the 160gig.  You can basically put your whole collection of stuff on the 160gig player.  You won't play much of it due to the battery life. i.  Don't buy the leather case from the archos website.  It is the one with Archos stamped on it.  If you are going to buy a case buy the one that has the stylus holder on it.  I think it is about $50 from Amazon. It is a better leather case.  A better buy is to pick up a $10 case logic case from best buy.  They sell them for holding external hard drives.   j.  You need to buy a screen protector.  I have not but I will. k. The wifi thing is kind of overrated.  It works and works pretty well.  But I don't use it very much.  If it were like the iPhone it would be better.  If you can't use the internet on the go, outside of the house, it does not do much for you.   l.  Also, no one has really talked about any security issues either.  I am not sure how much we are at risk when using this thing in public.

<Content>I rather like my Archos.  While haven't played with the WiFi yet, I am enthused about the music, video, and file storage.  The picture quality is brilliant even when watching battle scenes in .avi.  I wish the menus were a little easier to navigate, but that's hardly an issue.  Even the battery holds up well enough.  All in all, I have no major gripes.

<Content>I purchased the Archos 605 (80GB) as an xmas present for myself.  I love the features, however, the user manual leaves a lot to be desired.  Since I got the unit at such a great price, I didn't mind buying a couple of the plug ins.  The unit is a little slow.  As I figure out how to use more and more of the features the more excited I am about the unit.  I'm enjoying it.

<Title>4 MONTHS OF FRUSTRATION - MANY PROBLEMS
<Date>Fri Jan 18 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Bought this in Oct 07. While the product is good in some ways, in most it is just plain awful. Every review I read prior to buying said it was great. These reviewers should have lived with the 605 for a while first and also reviewed the CS aspect too. I loved it for the first few hours too! Then it went downhill... MP3 - not great. Weak volume, useless EQ. Big for just an MP3 too. Picture Viewer - sucks. Open a file and it takes forever for it to display the thumbnails, doesn't open them at all if they are over 5 mpixel. WiFi - Can't download the $30 web browser. C/service no help. TV Recording - SUCKS!!! The TV guide is still "down" according to Archos CS. It's been 4 months now. Battery Life - as bad as everyone says it is. Value - poor. For a big, chunky MP3 player it's too expensive. You have to pay extra to use the other functions (which don't even work in my case), then it's just plain over priced. Buy a iPod touch and a DVD recorder, it's cheaper.  The customer support is DEPRESSING! Tried to load the TV Guide, but kept getting an error msg..... Then it's the classic tail of a 45+ minutes on hold listening to crappy music only to be left steaming mad by an tech who wants you to call back tomorrow when they should have fixed the problem. Of course 4 months later that problem still isn't fixed! Tried the email route - 3 emails requiring additional info each time(!) and 2 days for each reply. Only to get this responce, "Unfortunately the TV Guide server has been undergoing some maintenance, so the download was unable to process.  It should be up by the end of the week." 4 MONTHS LATER - STILL DOWN!  Bought my wife the iPod Touch for Christmas... a much better product and service. AT LEAST IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL.

<Content>After receiving an email titled " Best MP3 Player you never heard of " I reasearched the Archos 605 MP3 Player. It was hard to find anything negitive about the 605. I purchased the Archos 605 about 1 month ago and now can confirm that it trully is the best MP3 Player on the market. There is nothing that cant be done with the 605, from Wi-Fi internet browsing to music to the best quality video of any player today.

<Title>So Many Bugs and Glitches, Poor Tech Support
<Date>Sat Jan 19 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>If the product worked correctly consistantly and if thier support line and email support were of any help at all, this would be a very impressive product, easily worthy of all 5 stars.  But it doesnt, and they're not,  so it's not.  My unit randomly resets itself when i try to watch movies or play music.  It often corrupts data or needs me to erase all user settings to respond to my commands.  The help on the phone often sounds like they're too busy surfing to help me, other times they just are of no help.  The email support ducks questions and when i began asking about exchanging my item for a new one that works (26 days after purchase) they stopped answering me.  I would never suggest buying anything from archos in the future.  poor.

<Title>It is ok... But not for me
<Date>Sun Jan 20 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>I purchased the archos 605 after researching on several web sites. I returned it after having it for two weeks due to the following: 1. The user interface was difficult to use. Navigation required too many key presses and many menus were confusing. 2. The battery life seemed quite a bit shorter than promised. 3. Synching with windows media player was a little mysterious. 4. A useful storage case wasn't provided with the unit and what seemed like a reasonable one on the archos web site wasn't available for purchase (out of stock). 5. Fit and finish were okay but the entire look was "old school" 6. The charge cable comes out of the bottom of the unit making it difficult for the unit to stand up while watching a movie. 7. Copying files to the unit took too long. 8. The unit had password issues on some wireless networks. 9. The web browser was not usable for me. 10. No place to store the stylus.  What I liked: 1. The screen was really nice. Watching a movie was pleasurable. 2. Copying files to the appropriate directories was easy 3. Buttons so you don't have to touch the screen. 4. Built in speaker for those times you would like to share a video.  My intended use: International air flights for music and video entertainment. I'll wait for the next generation of products.
