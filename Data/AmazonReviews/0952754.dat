<Content>Product worked only two months.  Would not recommend buying this product. I only put 1 star because it wouldn't let me put 0 or a negative number.

<Content>I bought two of these as birthday presents for kids.  I wasn't expecting them to be the best made products (seeing as how I was buying them for children).  However, I did expect them to last more than 1 week.  Both of them quit working almost immediately!  Definitely not worth the 1 star, but I can't rate it any lower than that!
