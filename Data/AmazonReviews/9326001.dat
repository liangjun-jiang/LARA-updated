<Title>How can you go wrong?
<Date>Mon Sep 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Two weeks before the 80GB came out my wife purchased the 60GB. Fortunately, Apple has a great return policy that allows 14 days to return product. We returned the 60GB and immediately ordered the 80GB and so glad we did!   It was $50 cheaper than the older one and holds 20GB more! Love the new functionality and the brighter display really does help during daytime use. The new search functionality is cool and they did improve batterly life. (We recently took a 14 hour drive down the CA coast and that iPod ran smoothly all day WITHOUT a car charger)  Love it. Highly recommend to anyone in the market.

<Title>Simply the best MP3 player around!!!
<Date>Thu Sep 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I've owned the 60GB Video iPod for close to a year now and with 11,000 tracks, 10 (Music) videos, and about 30 photos on it, I had 2.13GB free and was wondering what to do for more space.  Then along came the 80GB video iPod. More than enough room for my growing music collection, well at least for another year or so. Meant for those with large music collections.  Exactly the same size as the 60GB model, this too comes in black (which I got) and white, and it is cheaper than the 60GB model was when it came out.  It seems Apple finally acknowledged complaints about the earphones as they have been redesigned and fit better and less painfully in the ear for a long period of time, something I could never bear to do with the previous earphones. Oh, and sound quality is great too!!  I'll move right to the major changes with this version. First up is gapless playback of tracks. No more gaps between your tracks on Madonna's 'Confessions On A Dancefloor', or those Donna Summer 70s albums, or your live albums. Note, if you update the software on your 'older' video iPods, gapless playback works on those too.  Next is the new search method, you can now search for artists/albums by alphabet or numbers, still by using the scroll wheel to type out the names. This makes it much easier for someone like me with over 1000 albums stored.  Battery life has been improved for video playback, to 6 and a half hours. The screen resolution is brighter and sharper, making viewing of videos and images an even greater joy.  And finally, iTunes has also been updated. Among other things is a new interface, showing at a glance, how much space music, photos, and videos each take up, and space left. You can also set it to search the internet for CD artwork for CDs you've ripped yourself.  Still remaining are all the usual cool iPod features: You can attach CD artwork (doesn't make the iPod sluggish, or even skip like it used to), include individual track lyrics (both of which are essential to a music buff like me), screen lock, contacts, stopwatch, video playback (this responds faster now and resolution has been increased), photo display (you can do a slideshow of your photos while music plays) and downloadable games. You can also use it as a removeable hard drive, for backing up your data.  You definitely must get a case for your iPod, if you don't want it looking like your cat's scratch post within a week of use. There are loads of cases out there; rubber, leather, to clear hard plastic, the latter which I favour as it protects better, and you still get to see your iPod in all it's glory. XtremeMac, and agent18 (do a google search) make great tough plastic cases which snap on and off with ease, and protect all parts, especially the screen.  Also on the downside, as well as still scrimping on a wall charger (it charges by USB), there isn't an iTunes CD in the pack. You must now download iTunes (for free) from the internet.  Still, this is definitely my favourite gadget of the moment (it feels awesome to be holding over 1000 CDs in the palm of my hand), and yet again raises the bar for other MP3 players.

<Title>I'm really glad I waited!!!
<Date>Sat Sep 30 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When the 60 GB iPod came out one of my best friends got one and gave me his old 10 GB one for me to become familiarized with it, and thus decide if I really wanted an iPod.  After a couple of weeks I was really tempted to get one of the cool-looking black 60 GB myself, but when I was done uploading all of my music into my computer it came to almost 15,000 songs (59.35GB), so I decided to wait for a bigger iPod instead. I'm so glad that I waited!  My new 80 GB black iPod arrived today! I've just uploaded all of my music into it (it took me almost three hours to do it), and I love the huge improvements that this new iPod has (especially when compared to my old 10GB one!).  I just love the fact that I will finally be able to carry all of my music collection with me, wherever I go! And, that I will be able to find whatever I'm looking for, easier than before (thanks to this iPod's new "search" feature, which works really great!). The screen is so much easier to navigate, and so intuitive! Besides, its sharpness and brightness are really amazing. Even the new ear-phones are quite an improvement over the old ones, they are much more comfortable!  I know that it will take me some time to fill the remaining 20 GB in my new iPod. When that happens I will probably be ready for the iPod's succesor. In the meantime, I'm ready to enjoy my gorgeous new iPod!

<Title>Minor improvements makes this a great player
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>First of all, this is, to my knowledge, the cheapest 80GB Hard Drive MP3 player on the market, and with a name like Apple backing it up, this rendition of the iPod is well worth your time to look at.  *Technically this is still not the iPod Video, this is still an iPod with video playback; rumors are still buzzing about a Widescreen iPod, but still no official word*  NEW: -Longer battery life -Games -iTunes 7 has movies -Search feature -Larger capacity -Brighter screen  GOOD: -Great GB/$$ ratio -Great build -Bright screen -Battery life on video is double what it was before -Great interface -Innovative search -Games are pretty fun -Excellent design -Minimal buttons -Oodles of potential accessories  BAD: -Still scratches easily -Prone to fingerprints -Sometimes a little sluggish (not as much as before) -Battery isn't removable -Still no FM tuner, line-in, or voice record -Expensive accessories (not many in box) -Cheap earbuds  BOTTOM LINE: If you are too hardcore for the 30GB version, than this is definately your cup of tea. This is the perfect MP3 player for any causual music and video enjoyer's needs!

<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is my third iPod and this is the best one yet. This is my first video capable and this is a huge addition now with the brighter screen. One thing that may be a no-brainer or not; I suggest you "restore" your iPod first thing. I started dumping tunes and stuff on it immediately and had playback and rebooting  issues. However I "restored" it with iTunes 7.1 and this thing with all the bells and whistles is more responsive than my 30gb 4G model was!!! Oh and don't be cheap get the 80gb model. You will not regret it!!!

<Title>iPod Convert here. . .
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Before this, I had a 20gb iRiver that lasted me 3 1/2 years.  My iRiver died a few months back and I decided to take the iPod plunge since there was no non-iPod high capacity player (>= 60GB) that met my requirements.  My huge CD collection (~500 - 600) had already been ripped to .wma which was a huge concern for me.  I read so much about "you can't convert lossy to lossy (wma to aac)" that I really tried to NOT go with an iPod.    Finally I decided to download iTunes and convert a few of my 192kbps wmas to 160kbps aac.  I couldn't tell the difference!!  I picked up the black 80GB (on sale) and really like it.  It took about 36 hrs to convert my old .wmas to aac and only about 2 hours to synch up the iPod after that.  I love the fact that I can use the Shuffle feature to listen to non-repeating GOOD music for days on end!!  I really like the fact that all my actions (playcount & skips) and ratings are synched to iTunes (and vice-versa) whenever I plug the iPod back in.  I also like the huge aftermarket for iPod stuff.    Movies are very cool on this.  I converted Back To The Future and have watched it a couple of times on this iPod.  I can't believe the detail on this!  I didn't purchase this iPod because of the video, I really wanted to be able to store my entire music collection on it and carry it wherever I go.  I can do that and more now. . .   *** Update *** A few months into owning this and my review stands.  I've used this a lot more than I used my iRiver.  What I really like about this is that when I buy a new (well, used) CD, I put the CD in the PC Drive, click 'yes' to "Do you want to rip this?".  When I plug my iPod in, all the new music is synched, all my play & skip counts are updated, etc.  I don't have to think about folder structures!!  I bought an FM tuner for it shortly after writing the original review.  Since then I've not listened to normal radio (save for the very few times I forgot the iPod).    This has now been on a couple of trips, one cross country & a trip to Europe.  Battery life has never really been stressed (nice to say after 12 hours of flying/layovers).  I have a pair of Sure e3cn's which really bring out the sound.  To date, I've only ripped one movie (Back To The Future) and have gotten stuck on The Matrix.  I never really bought this to watch movies anyway so it doesn't change my opinion of the iPod...

<Title>Not a simple to use device -- maddening problems
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>If you plan to buy this item, be aware that you need to buy a docking station with it, and an FM transmitter for your car (if you want hands free operation.  I bought the Apple i-Pod with 80 gigabytes.  You need the docking station to load your CD's effortlessly -- otherwise you may never be able to load them.  Then the i-Tunes software is frustrating.  I loaded three (3) CD's that were "The Definitive Collection" of the artists.  They were jumbled together on i-Tunes.    I have a CD entitled "Wagner's Greatest Hits" which i-Tunes loaded as multiple CD's. "The Most Relaxing Piano Album in the World . . . Ever" was loaded as multiple albums rather than one album.  I have not tried to play anything directly from the i-Pod when it was not in the docking station.  I fear that when I try to play an entire opera CD, I will have to play one song, then the next, requiring me to bring the booklet with me if I want to listen to a continuous opera on a plane.     If i-Tunes names your album, then you cannot change the name of the album (at least no way known to this sophisticated computer user).  There are no instructions on how to bring pieces back into one album.  Also if you want artwork for your album, Apple's i-Tunes store will tell you that there is no artwork available to you for your purchased CD even though there is artwork for downloadable CD's, just not for you who purchased your CD before you purchased it before you purchased your i-Pod.  These problems need to be address by Apple for the adult user, who buys CD's and has a collection of CD's, and who wants to load them on the i-Pod.  Why would I want 80 gigabytes of storage?  I would rate the i-Pod okay, but it needs improvements for adults.

<Title>King of Portable Media Devices for a Reason
<Date>Mon Oct 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The latest flagship of the iPod lineup has only marginal differences between it's prior generation. Yet, the changes are exactly the little things that every wanted out of the prior models. iPod now has a much brighter screen with better resolution, it has the kind of space that allows you to tote quite a few movies, TV shows, and still have room for your whole music collection. The unspoken charm of this device is the simplicity of the interface and controls. The iPod is really a marvelous example of market research. How do consumers use their device, what is the average assumption of intuitive? The iPod hits that nail on the head.   Then there is the software. If you've never seen or used iTunes you probably take residence under a rock. To recap; however, it sports the same simplicity and intuitive and easy use as the Mac platform is famous for, and the iPod subscribes to. None of the features are cut from the Windows version of the software, giving it appeal on both PC and Mac.  I've used many media stores, including Urge, and iTunes is undoubtedly the best in selection, the easiest to use, and the easiest to navigate. Having developed the iPod side by side with iTunes, the iPod and iTunes sync with that hand and glove perfection that allows you to never worry about what problems you might encounter. Unless of course you jump on their upgrades too quickly. You'll want to give Apple time to work out the bugs on new releases of iTunes before you upgrade. Trust me!  The new games are fun for time-killing, but they really aren't meant for anything more. They are a selection of games that you could comfortably spend 5 minutes playing while you are on your break, or waiting for your wife to get ready for 45 minutes as she checks in with you every 5 saying she's just about ready... but anyway. The games have lush graphics, I would consider them Gameboy Advance quality graphics. There's a very limited array of games, and I seriously wouldn't recommend the iPod if your sole interest in it is of gaming with it.  Pros of the new iPod, and iPods in general: -Not just music, but movies, TV, games, calander appointments, to do, stopwatch, contacts with pictures -TV out quality is excellent. DVD-like even. -Audio quality has improved over prior generations -Ability to save documents as simple text and read them on the go, which is great for emails -Can be used as a portable storage device. At 80gb, that's quite an attractive feature. -My favorite feature over other audio devices is that it saves your place. For instance, if you start watching a movie on iTunes, then sync it to your iPod, the iPod will start the movie from where you left off in it on your computer.  Cons: -Screen Size is still too small for an honestly ideal mobile viewing experience. I think it's great for a 15 at work, but I'd hate to have my eyes strained on it for a 5 hour car trip. -Battery life just isn't there for the video veiwing. If you use the highest brightness settings you are looking at just over an hour of video. -Touch pad can take some getting used to. It's pretty sensitive. -iTunes only carries Disney and it's sub-studios for Movie content. -DRM, of course, is always a bitch.

<Title>Good for music, video, and pictures
<Date>Wed Oct 18 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Most of the reviews have done a better job than I could about the details of the good and bad about the 80GB iPod, so I'll talk to the people like me: Mac owners with loads of pictures, a number of songs, and a few videos.  My primary purpose in getting the 80GB iPod was to take around my collection of photos from iPhoto for family gatherings and the like; also some of the short family videos I've done. (Obviously for this I also needed Apple's AV cable, not included, which handles video and stereo audio.) I agonized over the choice between the 60GB and 30GB models; when the new 80GB came out (for a lower price!) it seemed like a sign to go with the higher capacity.  Good choice. Within a week of getting the iPod I had filled it to over 60GB with files that I would have had to delete from my hard drive otherwise in the course of a video project; it makes an *excellent* spare drive in a pinch. And even after finishing the project and moving the files back to the computer, I have 32GB of photos, music, and video. So if you have to choose a size, go with 80GB -- it will be less space than you think sooner than you think.  Synching from iPhoto is as automatic and excellent as the synchs from iTunes. The iPod keeps track of how the photos are organized, making it easy to find groups and sort through them by date. Note, however, that if you are not organized in iPhoto, you won't have an easy time finding things on the iPod.  Video playback is excellent, both on the small screen and on the TV (we have SD, not HD -- I would not expect the HD screen to be kind to the 640x480 output). Slideshows are also very good, although I wish it were easier to customize the tunes that go with different sets of pictures. And now I have six years of photos (over 8,000 pictures) that fit into my pocket.  One thing I did not anticipate was need a remote control for the video and slideshows. So far I have not seen a product on the market that has not been slammed by reviewers.  Side note: using the AV cable, I was able to capture video and audio output from the iPod to my digital camcorder. This let me take a snippet from an iTunes music video and include it on a DVD video project I did for my nephew. Not the best quality, obviously, but the object wasn't to strip off the copy protection, I just wanted to get enough of the video to add some flavor to the other video I was creating.  I haven't given the battery a solid test yet (that will come with an overseas flight in a couple weeks), but while waiting in a store while my wife clothes shopped I went through a couple hours of video podcasts without the battery meter taking a noticeable hit.

<Title>Apple shipping iPods with computer viruses
<Date>Fri Oct 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I purchased this Apple 80 GB iPod with Video Playback as a Christmas gift for my daughter, so it is still shrinkwrapped. Reuters reported this week that Apple recently shipped iPods which contain computer viruses. Amazon cannot (or will not) confirm whether my iPod is safe to give my daughter; instead I was provided an 800 number to call Apple which is on par with calling the Bureau of Motor Vehicles.  After dropping $350 for a reasonably nice gift, my joy of giving is now obviously hampered because I don't know if on Christmas morning my daughter will unleash a computer virus on whatever computer or network into which she plugs her shiny new iPod. Amazon and Apple are two of the most prestigious companies in the world, and they really need to step up to resolve this latest debacle. I need to know if this bad Apple is going to spoil the whole bunch, and I need to know now.

<Title>Great for Audio (when not frozen), TERRIBLE FOR VIDEO
<Date>Wed Nov 28 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have the 80gb Generation 5.5 iPod with video. I have had it for about a month now, & every time I have ever tried to play a video it would play for about a second, then get corrupted & freeze. When I go "back", trying to get to the menu, the entire iPod then FREEZES & no matter what you do it is completely unresolvably FROZEN until it runs out of juice and you plug it in to recharge it. This is pretty awful, since this is undoubtedly shortening the life of the battery considerably. Worse than that, the only fix anyone online has had for me so far was "Wait until the battery dies and then recharge it & it'll be fine", which I was - you can imagine - less than pleased with hearing, since I'd figured that much out frustratingly on my own. There has to be a better answer than that, or I'm going to feel pretty ripped off.

<Content>While the newest 6G iPod Classic offers some new features and a slim profile, this older 5.5G iPod is the best one currently available (12/24/07).  With a Wolfson DAC, a component not featured in new "classic" iPods, this 80GB iPod features the sound quality that made iPod a viable music listening platform. It also has a bright screen, good battery life, and the ability to play videos, photos, songs, games and more! It plays entire albums flawlessly with no gaps between tracks, a problem that plagued older iPods for years.  Finding a good deal on this unit is the best possible 80GB iPod purchase you can make until Apple hopefully fixes the 6G iPod sound problems. Let's keep our fingers crossed for the upcoming 7th generation.

<Title>It's a library that I can carry in my hand
<Date>Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I finally fell for the siren call of owning an Apple iPod.  I already own a Toshiba Gigabeat for music, but it is getting outdated and I wanted something different to download all of my audiobooks so when I travel I wouldn't be carrying pounds of printed material or loads of disks. I probably went overboard on storage space with my 80gb iPod Classic, but I have found I can download from the iTunes store, the different vendors like Audible and Alibris as well as copy from the audio cds I own.  It's like walking around with a library that fits in the palm of my hand.  The downsides to the iPod are the earbuds that came with it (I just substituted the Phillips earbuds I use with the Gigabeat) and I would like more control on how things are downloaded.  My audiobook cds all want to be saved into Music and not the audiobooks section of the iPod.  I use playlists extensively in order not to have to scroll down all the titles when I am looking for the book I want.  And yes, now that I have used the iPod for a while, I am also adding music to it.  With a USB adaptor for charging the iPod this player goes anywhere and gives great sound.

They are too big and do not stay secure in my ears, so I will be purchasing some other kind in the near future.  I purchased a refurbished model of this IPod and found the description to be very honest and detailed. The only thing that wasn't mentioned was that there were quite a few tiny scratches(from previous usage) on the back of the casing. Otherwise it was in perfect conditon and packaged nicely. Thank you, Amazon for a terrific buying experience! I will not hesitate to do further business with you in the future!!!

<Title>Apple iPod 80GB
<Date>Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Great product but there are a few glitches if you are not carefull.  I have not bought any songs, I downloaded all my own CD's using my Windows XP computer.  I soon realized I needed to move my itunes library to an external drive to free up the space on my c:drive.   Now if I try to use my song library I get error message "files not found do you want to search" If I search I can find the song in Windows but have to find each song individually, I can then add it to the library at the new drive location.   I have 2600 songs I burned from my CD collection and I have now started this time consuming task to be able to use my itunes library.   Meanwhile I cannot attach my iPod to the computer as I am told this will clear the iPod drive.  So if you buy this great item be careful if you need to move your songs to another drive or computer. There is a way to do it, but it is not the most obvious way.

<Date>Sat Oct 21 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Apple needs to get there enginers to make a player with a little bit different design if look at it, it looks like any other ipod. you cant tell the difference between any of them only size, it gets boring and the finish on it is tarrible it scrtches and to me its very uncoftrible in my big hands. Any body that is going to buy this dont because there are to many problems with ipods and for starters the constomer service is terrable if something goes wrong with your ipod dont bother sending it in under the warrenty because you may not get it back for atleast 2 months. Apple tries to get the warrenty to go out then fix it and charge you that is what happened to me. I said just keep it because there is no point in having a broken ipod. So i switched over to creative which has much better survises player has had no problems. Ipod is over rated and it wasn't even the first creative was with there muvo jukebox. Would you rather have an ipod that has problems and cost more or you could a creative spend less and get better mp3 such as the creative zen v which i have now i spent 120 on a 2 GB while an apple nano costs 150 not a huge difference but its still a difference. I almost forgot my player holds 1000 songs because i use WMA and a two GB nano will hold 500 to get a player that would hold as much as mine does it would cost 180. Now that is a big difference stick with creative not Apple. Other than those problems it is not a taribble player, as long as it works.

<Title>Buy two, your going to need them in the long run.
<Date>Tue Oct 24 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>(Ryan Gonce)-About 2 years ago I bought my first Ipod for $375. Within a year the hard drive crashed. Luckily I was able to send it in to Apple and receive a "new" Ipod. These presses took about 6 weeks to complete. I was so happy to receive, what I thought, was a brand new scratch free Ipod. Though it was scratch free, I later found out that it was only a refurbished Ipod which was thrown together and sent back to me. Within another year the hard drive crashed again. Two times was enough for me. I called Apple and told them the issue I was having. Their exact words were, "You're better off buying a new one!" They told me that it would be $260 to repair an Ipod that they had thrown together for me. To me this was ridiculous. If your car broke down within a year, wouldn't you want a new one? Not a refurbished POS someone had just returned. After waiting on the customer service line from 4:30pm-6:00pm on hold all they could tell me was that I was screwed. They stated that they didn't have to tell me it was refurbished and that they could do nothing for me. I am telling you this as a warning. My girlfriend also purchased an Ipod about a year after mine. Within a year it began to freeze and would randomly stop playing her music. She sent it in 3 times to have then said there was nothing wrong with it. I'm not sure what Apples customer service is trying to do, but it is definite lost a customer. I was an Ipod owner, loved my Ipod, but not enough to spend $250-350 on a new one every two years. If you do happen to buy an Ipod I wish you luck in the years to come. I'll be investing some time into the Microsoft zune.

<Title>It keeps getting better (still with the same old problems though)
<Date>Wed Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I don't know about you but I have a pretty abusive relationship with my Ipod. I started off with my first Ipod, a 20gb back in 2004. A year later, it crashed and burned and went to Ipod heaven. Which takes us to 2005. I replaced my 20gb with a 30gb. One year later, can we guess what happens now? You bet that baby did the same thing. crash/burn/heaven. Which now takes us to two weeks ago. I went to best buy and made the jump from 30gb to 80gb. The screen, is brighter and the battery life is so much better (thankfully) Also, the size is really why I went for it. Being that I listen to music that normally have longer song lengths, I could only get maybe 5,250 on my 30 gb on a good day. Whenever i'd get to that point, i'd have to delete songs just to add new ones and basically, it was just a real pain. So now, I no longer have that problem and doubt I will for a while now. again though, I don't exspect it to last more than a year, plus with them being over 300 dollars, having an Ipod is going to be a long term pain basically. It still is very much worth it as music is a huge part of my life. now all I have to do is rip my albums to itunes and add them to my Ipod. My biggest complaint, is not that it scratches, or smudge marks. I am very much used to that, plus that isn't  something a case couldn't easily fix. The fact that, in the two weeks I have owned my ipod. It has frozen on me twice. Then there is the annoying action of having to wait for the battery to die and having to let it charge again. Other than that, the positive as usual outweigh the negative with the Ipod. So, if you have the cash and can deal with the annoying aspects of it, this is very much worth it. Enjoy.

<Content>ALL of the ipods (except for the Nano and this 5th generation model) allowed for transfer of data via Firewire. In fact, some earlier versions even came with firewire cables. Considering the fact that Apple computers have many firewire ports and emphasizes the value of firewire, it's a [...]that this 'best' version doesn't support firewire data transfer.  [...]

<Content>First of all, I have to say how much I absolutely love my iPod.  I am really enjoying using it and having all of my cd's on there (and I have many, many, many cd's).  It's such an amazing product and I only wish I'd bought one earlier. Secondly, I have to tell people out there that if you are like me (or what I used to be like), don't think that this is some complex piece of equipment that you won't be able to use.  My biggest concern had always been how to download music onto it and everyone kept telling me just how easy it was to do that.  I never believed anyone because everyone swears by how easy it is and I've heard that all before without it actually being easy.  This however ... is super easy to use.  Just put your cd into the computer and itunes asks you if you want to import the cd.  You say yes (untick any songs you don't want) and after you've done a few cd's, you plug the iPod into the computer and sit back while it downloads for you.  I wish I'd known earlier. Itunes is easy too to use.  The only problem I have with it here in Australia, is the variety is poor and minimal.  We don't have great R&B or hip hop music to download, and no movies or new TV shows.  I wish Australia would get with the program and move their behinds. The quality in the sound and picture (for music videos) are both superb and I really really enjoy this.  I have downloaded close to over 650 cd's and I'm not even halfway through my capacity.  It's the best invention of late and I hope that people who think it's complex to operate would read this and understand that if I can do it; anyone can.  I hope you love your iPod as much as me.  And PS. ... Black is the only way to go.

<Title>this was definitely worth the wait!
<Date>Sat Oct 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i started out with a 64mb diamond rio pmp500 in 2000, then a 256mb samsung yp55 in 2003.  I pretty much held out on buying an ipod because of the price and not having a mac.  Well that changed when i bought a powerbook g4 last winter and the ipod prices dropped this past september... i just had to get an ipod.  First off, the great thing about the ipod is not the hardware itself, but it's the software that really makes the ipod shine.  Yes the ipod is really nice and has great features, but itunes allows the ipod to become the complete package in audio/video portability.  You can carry all your music, photos, contacts, videos, calender info, etc on the ipod.  You can even use it to store files if you've run out of space on your computer.  Although the screen is only 2.5" big watching movies on it isnt a problem at all... it comes out nice and clear.    I have no regrets buying my ipod, it's everything i wanted and more!  But be warned, you'll probably want to buy a mac after getting this.

<Title>FIX THIS DEVICE!
<Date>Sun Oct 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Want to buy this new one, as my old one is crapping out, (the central "select" button is wearing out), but cannot quite bring myself to part with the money.  Should my $300+ device be worn out in a year?  And what about the battery that is not really replaceable and is too small, and the problems with iTunes?  I was looking for an improvement in the new iPods, not just refinements in the size!  iTunes does not work well.  It garbles information, esp when downloading cds, but sometimes at random, and now refuses to play whenever another program is running.  The battery needs to be a rechargeable/renewable.  It could just as easily take AA batteries, or a clip type battery like old cell phones?  How about making the unit compatable with other providers?  If Apple is determined to have it all; service, hardware,operating system, consumer sales, then it had better get it's act together.  It's not enough to just show up.

<Content>I just got the 80GB iPod, it's my first iPod or MP3 player of any type.  I find the design simple, elegant, and functional.  I love it.  It took a few days to get all my CDs loaded, but it's been working flawlessly.  After reading about problems others had with scratching the surface, and seeing that the junky little carrying case included in the box is sub-standard, I went online and found an excellent protective case (the ToughSkin case made by Speck), which is a tough rubberized case with a clear protective cover for the iPod's video screen.  Now I'm a happy little camper.

<Title>Very convenient, but the sound quality underwhelms
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After hearing so much about iPod from people I respect and reviews galore, I finally broke down and bought one.  Not sure I'll keep it, I must say.  I've had this for a few days and listened to a LOT of varied music, ranging from new recordings of Mahler symphonies to Cassandra Wilson to the Chemical Brothers.  I give the iPod an "A" for convenience.  But the bottom line for a portable audio device (still iPod's primary function) is the quality of the sound.  And even with reasonable (though not audiophile) earbuds (Sennheiser CX300-B), the sound quality is not that great.  On this iPod, even uncompressed WAV files lack the sound depth that I heard (with the same earbuds) on my old iRiver SlimX CD player.  And if you listen to something with challenging bass demands (e.g., Chemical Brothers), harmonic distortion is inescapable.  It's pretty frustrating.  A related irritation is the absence of the obvious feature for addressing the sound quality issue:  a user-configurable EQ setting.  iPod offers a bunch of pre-defined settings (e.g., "rock", "dance") that supposedly optimize the sound for an Apple engineer's conception of the genre.  But imagine a digital camera that offered only the pre-defined combinations of aperture and shutter speed settings for various types of pictures (e.g., "portrait", "sports") without even giving the user the option of adjusting these settings himself/herself.  That's effectively what iPod sticks us with.  There is much to like about iPods.  The convenience is undeniable.  The form factor is elegant.  And the user interface, integration with iTunes, etc. warrant the praise they've received.  But for heaven's sake:  I wish that SOMEBODY who makes portable audio devices would remember that job number 1 is _sound quality_.  At least so far, iPod's sound quality is its worst feature, and this new model only continues the broader decline of quality standards among portable audio products.

<Title>My First Ipod
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The high price was the only thing that held me back on buying an Ipod before. I've had my Ipod for a couple of weeks now and I can't think of a product that made a better impression on me than the Ipod. It's a joy unpacking the thing (How could they stuff it all in that small box?) from the very start it feels like your unpacking something special. A review isn't complete without at least one point of comment though: a very labor intensive activity is to keep your music library organized by adding artwork (Album covers) and assigning Genres etc. to the songs. The problem is that the only thing you can do from the Ipod is to rate the songs. The only way you can change/delete your files is from the pc and I don't spend much time listening to my music while behind the pc so this would be a very useful feature on the Ipod that I hope will be available on a future firmware update. (Fingers crossed) If you are thinking of buying an Ipod and considering an alternative make, I advise you to stop wasting your time. The Ipod will not disappoint. Promise!

So far I got almost 4000 songs and I still have tons of room left  (+) Great battery life; nice, vibrant colors on screen; easy to use (-) no external battery; no external AC adapter    I would recommend purchasing a sturdy protective case to protect your expensive investment, along with an external AC adapter

<Title>do not buy. I want my money back
<Date>Sat Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Instead of paying my car bill, I chose to buy the ipod 5th gen 80gb. that was not the right thing to do. purchase it from wal-mart, drove to my  house and could not wait to start. problems problems problems.  1. plug it to my computer, the light came on once and never to be seen again. rush to walt-mart, they gave me another one.   2. Plug it in to my brandnew macbook. the light came on "yippie" this time itune wont read, have to download itune. no problem. do not disconnect sign never came off. at this point i'm just sad. called Apple, support staff are CLUELESS. took it back to wal-mart, manager at wal-mart looks at me funny. they gave me another one.   3. working. YES. download a stack of song, am very happy. two days later. lights will not come on. lost my receipt. wal-mart manager will not exchange, called apple, i was sent to apple store 1hr away from my house. staff ignored me. finally they zap it with something and it work while i was in the car.  4. at home will not work. called apple, after reset and reboot. NOTHING. finally apple agree for me to send it to them for another one. at this point i'm thinking the gods are laughing at me for spending so much money on such stupid thing, hell i could've send it to a country that needed it for food or something.   5. true to their word, they sent me a box free shipping. two days later got my new apple. so far this is my 4th one and none are working. very quickly apple sent me my new ipod. it works until two days later I get a very low battery sign. let it sign for 10hrs, same thing. At this poing I want to cry. went on apple website, there are many people complaining about the same thing. WTF. no response from apple.   6. called apple, pleaded with them to give me at least 1/2 of my money back. i dont want this anymore. apple agreed to sent another free shipping box to get my apple fix. at this point i dont care.   The apple people must know they are feeding us items that are not fit to be sold because it was too easy for them to say that they will replace it for me. how many times can you replace one item. honestly one day another reliable company will come up with something better than apple that will wipe them out of the competition. i'm a hugh apple fan. now when i go to the computer store and see something by apple i move away from it. i keep begging for my money back but can get it back. if the next one they send me doesnt work i will go straight to the lake by house and throw it there.   will keep you posted  if i still have the energy. by the way own three computer at home plus a mac book. my computers work fine.

<Title>Not for Classical
<Date>Mon Nov 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>If you're into rock, hip hop, jazz ect, generally any music except for classical you will love your ipod. I put all my non classical cd's in it, and I had in it with no problem Dave Matthews, U2 so on and so forth. It goes and gets the cd artwork and info from the cd; it's great for this.   BUT the biggest part of my musical addiction is classical. I have a 40gb IRiver H340 that the battery is going on and is no longer working correctly. All the files are WMA not MP3, so they either have to be converted to work in the ipod or reinstalled. I have about 500 cd's of classical music from A-Zelenka, and the thought of having to reinstall all the information in the correct order has me about to pull my hair out. FYI It doesn't convert a file it converts one piece of music at a time. This means you have to manually click on each piece to convert. And it displays them in itunes in what I would call a "random order". I'm not a classical snob but I want the information displayed on the screen of the ipod to at least be correct. It either picks the wrong information for the cd, or it doesn't group the whole cd as one cd. And I don't want to see U2 or Enya listed as a composer. I like U2 but Musica Antiqua Cologne under Reinhard Goebel is a little different then U2. Yea yea I know its differentiated by genres, WRONG. J.P. Rameau's Les Fetes d'Hebe was listed as alternative & punk not classical. Just another thing I'll have to fix. Apple won the MP3 war, but my war with my ipod is just starting.

<Title>Works Great for Classical, Podcast playback could improve
<Date>Thu Nov 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got this 5.5 generation iPod after reading the that 6th generation is a lemon.  This has probably to do with Apple changing the internal components to lower the price.  Everything got up and running easily.  Since I already have iTunes and a 3rd generation hard-drive iPod, I just used the charger that came with that one to charge my new one.  Syncing with iTunes 7.5 was easy, and mysteriously it named my iPod after my husband because the Windows PC has his name as default.  The only glitch is that I could not eject my iPod 5.5 Gen (like I can my 3rd Gen) from iTunes.  Windows complains that some file on the iPod is being accessed.  What I had to do was to go to the Explorer, select the drive letter that was assigned to the iPod and "eject" there.  Then go to the Stop devices and stop that device.  In any case, the iPod "Do not Disconnect" was gone, and I unplugged it, even though Windows complains that it could not stop the device.  The clickwheel is slightly different than the touchwheel on my 3rd generation which feels more responsive.  But it works okay.  Regarding the comment on Classical music, if the albums you import have ID tags online, then all of it imports correctly, including artist, song title, etc.  I have lots of classical albums and it works fine.  Also, if you want the iPod to remember where it was, you need to go to "Get Info"->"Options" tab, and check the box "Remember Playback Position".  This way if you're in the middle of a long symphony and you turn off your iPod, you can get back to it.  What I can't believe is that the iPod software is so lame when it comes to Podcasts.  Each Podcast episode is "1 of 1", and listed in reverse chronological order.  This means that if you want to listen to it in chronological order, you must scroll all the way to the end.  Then you select the episode, and as soon as it is finished, it pops back to the main menu, and you have to click and scroll all over again to get to the second episode.  If you select the Title of the Podcast category, and click "play", you'll get the last episode, after which it jumps back to the main menu.  You'd think that Apple, the inventor of podcasts would by default create a chronologically ordered playlist by default of any podcast and allow you to play it as a collection starting at "1 of 100", with the back and next buttons allowing you to go back and forth.  In anycase after more research I found out that you have to go to iTunes on the PC and create a playlist.  You can then drag/drop the episodes in the order you want to hear it.  Or you can create a "Smart Playlist", and it'll create one in alphabetical order, which usually works out to be in chronological order (but not always, depends on naming convention of the Podcaster).  I could not figure out how to make a "Smart Playlist" go in chronological order, so if someone knows how, please comment.
