<Content>I was initially pleased with the ease and low cost of this unit.  But, as they say, you get what you pay for.  In two weeks time I found myself constantly interrupting my workouts to turn it back on.  It would just die, for no apparent reason.  Sometimes it would last 30 minutes.  Sometimes 30 seconds.  I changed the batteries.  I checked the menu options.  It made no difference.  For its replacement, I've paid more attention to the reviews and less to the price tag.

<Content>I have had this MP3 player for about 4 months and couldn't be happier.It came with an AAA battery which lasts from 15 to 20 hours.The sound during my exercise periods is excellent.It is easy to download music using a USB mini cable which attaches to the MP3 and will even let you know if you made duplicate selections. The small size in no way compromises the fidelity of the music.  I would strongly recommend this MP3 player for its value, acoustics and size.
