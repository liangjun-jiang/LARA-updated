<Title>Getting Better all the time
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I started out with Sony walkman(Cassette Player), then went to the CD player. Both were noticable(heavy) when I was running. (Radio reception was terrible). I graduated to the MP-3 player, psyc. Small and light, but needed to change the batteries. Then I went to the Jelly bean style. Very Happy with this, but needed more room(1gb). So now I have Sony NW-205F with 2 gb. It gives you playlists or artists albums. It doesn't have the entire list shuffle, which the jelly bean does. The sounds are fantastic. However I am still experimenting with the headphones. The ear buds, pop out every once in a while. The behind the ear hoop, keeps them in place. But the cable gets pulled from the armband to the noggin'. I just ordered the clip on style. So the jury hasn't seen the evidence on this yet. But all the mp-3s are easy to download. Easy to remove songs etc...I haven't had a run where the batts have died, but if with age the batt can't hold a charge for a long period time, then time will tell.

<Title>Fantastic Music to My Ears
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I could start this review by telling you some annoying quirk of this unit or that Sonic Stage software could be better.  Everything is gray-everything!  Even electronic devices!    What I really like is how the Sony proprietary Atrac 3 audio compression makes music sound.  That's why I still use the not so popular mini-disc and now this flash device.    If I wanted to be hip-I could have an I-pod but the sound reproduction does not match Atrac 3-not even close.    So this neat little device can pump music to my ears or through my $2500 stereo system.  1350 songs using 48K sampling rate in 2Giga bites is a lot of music.  This 3-4 times the comparable amount for a I-pod using Mp3 or WMA compression.   No hard disc to crash.   A hard to beat combination  Sony and GREAT SOUNDING music.  Easy to use-what more could one ask for?

<Title>Great sports mp3
<Date>Sun Jan 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I have always been a fan of the "sporty" mp3 players vs the larger multi gig "hard drive" mp3 players or even mid-side ipod-ish style mp3 players.  Pros -Great display. -Decent radio -Great charging options (as it says a very short charge will get you good to go for a good workout period no problem) -Awesome design, looks sleek. -Nice armband, protects, solid, looks good. -Cool features i.e. "shuffle shake" or sports mode, (plays different playlists based on your speed), stopwatch. -Software is kinda nice how all the navigation/downloading features are all in one program. -Unique twist navigation (that little silver band on the player) can be slid up and down on the top of the player as well as twisted left and right to navigate. Pretty simple.  Cons -They let you sort by album/artist/title etc, but even then it can be tedious flipping through them if you want to get to certain songs. -Like an ipod in that there's no way to get the battery out, not an issue for a long time, but something to keep in mind... -There isn't really an explanation for the different features on the player itself, some reading required. -Sony's music format, oma or something like that, pretty lame. Not really recommended to download from the sony site if you can get mp3 format somewhere else. That being said if you research it, you can convert oma to mp3.  Overall, very nice for working out, if you want an mp3 player to house your 40gig collection and leave in your car, not really the mp3 player for you. If you are a little tech savvy and want one for on the go, and especially working out, then HIGHLY recommended.

<Title>Excellent MP3 player
<Date>Sun Feb 04 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I've had mine for 3 weeks now primarily for using in the gym and I really like it. It is tiny, slick and classy. I have WOWed people with this. They were shocked that there are other cool MP3 players besides iPod.  Here is the breakdown of what I like and dont like:  Pros:  Small well-made Good battery life Sounds great The display is just right.  I am amazed how great the user interface is given minimum number of buttons and controls. Radio tuner (it's an extra $50 to add it to iPod) No need to look at it to change songs. The silver ring on top is the control; you skip songs with that. Way cool. The armband is super handy and well made; Perfect for working out; just perfect. Did I mention small and stylish?  Cons:  Battery not replaceable; pretty much like almost all other MP3 players, however by the time the battery goes, you wanna buy a new one anyway. The earphones: This is pretty much why I am giving this player a 4 star instead of 5. Although they are around the ear sets, but these particular ones don't fit well. I have another Sony around the ear sets that fit great and I was disappointed to find out these suck big time. It could be that I have big ears, but still.  Music software: It is pretty bad. Don't forget to update the software which makes it easier to use, but still sub par. I figured, since I am not gonna upload music to it so often, it shouldn't bother me, and I was right.

<Title>Better players are out there
<Date>Sun Feb 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>As a heavy gym user who has sweated several MP3 (and headphones) into the trash, I thought this was the answer. But after using it for several weeks, I hate the thing. My biggest gripes: 1) The Sonic Stage program seems not to be able to find and import the vast majority of .wma format files that I have never had a problem using on my other players. The program seems like a shill to force you to use Sony's Connect Store. Cheaper MP3 players allow you to drag and drop files direct to the player, I don't want another program just for this device. 2) The entire industrial design of the player depends on one small keyway on the back of the plastic case, which in my case was deformed after one week and would no longer hold the player in one position. Without the keyway, you have a round player that is free to spin in the round holder which make this impossible to use without tying up both hands. 3) Even when the keyway was working, the controls are not easy to use when you are working out. The armband positions the player so that the rear of the twist knob digs into your arm and makes it hard to navigate the controls with one hand while running. It is almost like no one actually tried to use this while running in the design phase. This is a case of a cool looking industrial design that does not serve the market it was meant for, avoid this player!

<Title>Tried hard to like it
<Date>Fri Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The software is terrible, slow and glitchy. I have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player. The operators manual is just under 100 pages, so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls. Granted, the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive--assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual.

<Title>A disappointment
<Date>Sat Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was pretty excited about this player, having read about it in Runners' World. There are a lot of problems with it, however. While it is advertised as a sports MP3 player, in a lot of respects it isn't very convenient for someone who buys it for sports. My issues are: - Headphones are not at all appropriate for sports, particularly running.. they keep falling off, so I had to invest in a better pair of headphones. Kind of weird since it's supposed to be a sports player. Also, I spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before I could use them. - Hard to change music while running, and it often ends up doing something I don't want it to. You can't change the music without removing the MP3 player from the armband, which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can't tell from any picture. - Not easy to figure out the features of the player, such as the stopwatch, pedometer. Also hard to use once you do figure it out. - Software is a pain to use. - Organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player.  That being said, I still use it. There are some good features: - Long battery life, recharges super quick - Very cool-looking player - Very easy to carry around.. can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size.   I would not recommend this player and if given a choice, I would not buy it again.

<Content>I received this for christmas and I'm not thrilled with it.  It can only be charged through a USB cord, with a computer, so if you're traveling without a computer, you're out of luck.  The FM feature and stopwatch are great for a long run, but the headphones aren't that comfortable.  I wasn't happy to have to use their clunky music software either.

<Title>Excellent Hardware - Horrible Software
<Date>Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I am an avid runner, mountainbiker and climber, and have been using Walkmans and MP3 players since the early '80s. Still have my very first Sony Dolby B/C automatic reverse cassette player (what a blast that was - too bad it broke down about 15 years ago). That said, here are my comments:  - Love the battery live, looks, minimal weight, but most of all, the EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY.   - Hate the software. SONY, SONY, SONY, get rid of these guys (the guys that wrote the Sonicstage software)! Drag and drop compatible with Windows is all we want!   - Forget about the included earbuds or any earbuds - buy Sennheiser. The sports PMX (green) sound awesome but unfortenately are inadequate in outdoor enviroments (cannot handle water), the PMX 60 are noisy for neighbors but are virtually indestructible.  That said, enjoy everyone!!

<Title>excellent little player
<Date>Fri Apr 06 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The more I use this player, the more I like it.  I see at least a couple of reviews of unhappy users who have either unrealistic expectations or haven't yet learned it's features.  True, it's not the most intuitive player for advanced features, but basic features are easily picked up and if you play around with it, you can figure it out the more advanced features quite easily.  This coming from a guy who thought he was getting left behind in technology.    To the person who had difficulty changing songs while running. Easily addressed in two ways.  1- Run with it in your hand, it's small and fits well in a loose griped hand. or 2- learn to set up play lists.  You really should be concentrating on looking where you are going and what's around you (especially when your hearing is somewhat impaired), not flipping through songs. I find it appropriate for it's intended use (excercise, activity), maybe not for the car or trying to DJ with it. Software is not that bad, but defenitely not the best.  It's managable, I've certainly seen worse. Maybe because I want to, but I think I can hear a slight difference between the SONY ATRAC and MP3 formats.  The Sony does sound better. Yeah, needing a computer to charge it can blow, but the battery life is very good and how often are you away from a computer.  I'll find out how good the battery life really is soon on a trip to South America. Also there are not a lot of accessories.  No car charger/transmitter for this model (that I've seen), but again, you have to consider this model's intended purpose and it definitely shines in this area.  Would you rather take a full size IPOD or this thing running/biking?

<Title>BEWARE Software is TERRIBLE!!!
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I was so excited to get this, but the software is sloooooooow and buggy.  I have never seen a piece of software that is this unstable in a long time.  I thought downloading the latest drivers would help, but did not help a bit.  Also, why would any company create another MP3, other than Apple, that uses proprietary software and does not treat it as a removable drive or a USB device that you drag and drop to?  I like ITUNES, but most proprietary software sucks!!  Ahhhhhhhhhh,  I am about to pull my hair out!!  It goes back tomorrow.  I really liked it, but the software is a dud!!

The software is a little slow, but it's easy to use. Just  drag and drop songs onto the player. This is a great mp3 player for workout fans.

<Date>Thu Jun 07 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Love this MP3!!!  It is very portable, the screen is easy to read, and is not too difficult to figure out by flipping through the menu.  The functions cover everything I need as I use it for walking, and because of the multi-functions, I don't have to carry anything else.  I had no problem using the Sonic Music program, and find it quite user friendly.  I did switch the earphones for another pair as they are a bit bulky and do not stay in place if your moving at a good pace, but other than that, I love it!  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an MP3 to use while exercising.

<Title>probably repeat
<Date>Sat Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Probably just repeating what others have said, but I love the music player itself, only Sony's proprietary format and required software take this from 5 stars to 2.    I told myself I'd never buy another Sony product after the rootkit fiasco, but I did anyway and I regret it.  Why couldn't they just go with the mp3 format and let the player be recognized as a flash drive?  It takes me an hour to delete music and add back different music I want, when it should take less than 10 minutes, like with my old mp3 player.  Personally I would buy another real "mp3" player that acts as a flash drive when interfacing with a computer.

<Title>The better mp3 player
<Date>Mon Jul 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The pros 1)  It charges quickly.   2)  Nice crisp sound.   3)  The controls are intuitive.   4)  It comes with a nice arm strap.   5)  Does not reset itself every third or forth use (like the rio sport I had previously).   6)  Nice and small.  The cons 1)  The ear buds don't stay put if you get sweaty.  I run 15-25 miles a week so this is a problem for me. Fortunately, I already had the ear buds from the Rio I just tossed. 2)  The battery is not replaceable.  If it dies, you toss the unit. 3)  You have to use their software to load music on the player.  No coping mp3 files right to the player.  This was anoying to me as they seem to want you to also use their software to play mp3's on your computer as well.  Grr.  This is perhaps my biggest complaint.  All in all a nice unit.  Beats my old Rio hands down...

<Title>Great sports mp3 player
<Date>Tue Jul 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Pros  Great design, slim look, the OLED is cool looking and helpful and support Asian characters.  It have a build-in timer that let you play the music and stop playing when you meet your set goal (Your desired total calories burned, or time you worked out) build-in FM Turner (battery lasts 5 hours if you are listening to FM only) that is very easy to use  The G-Sensor detects steps and speed and automatically calculate calories burned and distance walked or ran, you can even shake the mp3 player 3 times to shuffle the songs.  It is also very cheap, you can get it at circuit city website for 79 dollars.  It is water resistant (at least that's what the manual said, I haven't tried to run with it in the rain yet.)  The battery life is exceptional(18 hours). Fully charge it only takes 45min.  The quick charge feature also let you charge it for only 3min, and get 3 hours of playback time. The sound quality is also excellent, plus this mp3 player features a equalizer that includes pre-set sound qualities and is even user customize-able.  It supports play in order of playlist, artists, album, folder.  It even have a search function to find the exact song you are looking for, very helpful feature.  2GB is sufficient for most uses.  When pluged into machine with a USB cable, it also acts as a 2gb thumb drive.  Cons  No Drag & Drop Play, SonicStage CP Software does not support Mac OS, and it does not support some personal built PCs because it requires you to go online and authorize your PC to be used with the software. The same software is also required to upload music to the player.  It is a pain to use and slow to operate, it is not un-useable, it's just not user-friendly.    Also one cannot select individual songs in a playlist, one have to play and wait untill the songs you want to listen comes up in alphabetic order after 10 tracks, that is just horrible.  It also use a special USB Cable which have a longer prone to connect to MP3 player than a regular USB cable, so don't lose the cable comes with it..   Additional Thoughts  Despite the horrible design and lack of feature of the Sonicstage CP software, as long as the music is loaded into your NW-S205F, it is fully feature packed and ready to rock with you onto your next gem/outdoor adventure without any problem.

The Sony Bean took some learning but with the ring around the mp3 player to controls are almost innate.  The sports functions, the pedometer and the calorie counter are also easy to use and understand.  Sometimes the more functions an mp3 player is the harder it is to use but not  this one.  With the armband included the mp3 player is ready to use once you get your music loaded.

<Title>No Drag and Drop!
<Date>Mon Jul 30 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Others have commented on the main problem I have with this device. Unfortunately, I didn't read enough reviews, and bought this thing. I wish I hadn't. Please heed this warning. I need to feel passionately a product to review it, and I hate what Sony has done with the player. The player itself it actually a very nice piece of hardware, and I have never operated a music device that is as aesthetically pleasing as this one. It is just plain cool to look at, operate, and the sound is great. However, the software kills that package. Or rather, the fact that you absolutely, positively MUST use the software is what kills the package. Not wanting to take the Steve Jobs route, I have purchased two Samsung players in the past. Both of those players allowed you to (gasp!) take your .mp3s and place them directly on the player for instant playback on the device. Pop out the cable, plug in the headphones, and you could listen to your music. Logical, correct? So, I take this thing out of the package and put some Modest Mouse on, pop out the cable and plug in my headphones. To my surprise, all I got was silence and a "NO DATA" notification on the display. The terrible bands that were preloaded onto this thing played wonderfully though.     Yes, I read the quickstart manual and it stated that to transfer music to the player, you might want to do it in SonicStage. I put a folder of music on the drive. Nothing. I took the .mp3s out and placed them directly on the drive. Nothing. I put a folder full of music in the ominous folders that were preloaded with the device. Nothing. Finally, I decided to give up and use SonicStage for the file transfer. I transferred my music in SonicStage, popped out the cable, stuck in my headphones and...music. Dang...do I really need to do this every time I want to load music onto this thing? As far as I can tell, the answer is yes. That means no taking this thing to my brother's house and effortlessly loading some of his songs onto it. I'd need to bring my Sony software with me. Want to hear something even more flabbergasting? The music that is loaded onto the player is invisible. Putting songs directly onto this thing makes them viewable, but not playable. Loading them on in SonicStage makes them playable, but they are nowhere in sight. Perhaps my player is possessed by El Diablo, or something.     Okay, I'm not a baby. I would be (sort of) okay with being forced to use SonicStage if the file transfer didn't take FOREVER. Here is a funfact for you: transferring 1.8 gigs of music to the player in SonicStage will take 26 minutes. Now, granted, I don't have the most up to date computer around, but 1.8 gigs is certainly not taking 26 minutes if I drag the music straight onto the player. I guess what I am trying to say with this cautionary tale of woe is that you should only purchase this if you are able to deal with its digital bureaucracy. If you can overlook the restrictions (yes, RESTRICTIONS on a device that you purchased for your own personal enjoyment), you might be able to enjoy using this player.

<Title>Best player for working out hands down
<Date>Sun Sep 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>After destroying several mp3 players while working out, from iPods to cheap Chinese imitations, this is the only player that survives the sweat, the heat, and the beating of constant heavy gym use. Another terrific quality, is the quick charge feature: you will never run out of battery in your work out session since you can just plug it for a couple of minutes to have enough juice for a couple of hours (this is an awesome feature for me, as I hated to have my past mp3 players die while I was working out, which was quite common).  What I hate is Sony's continuous persistency in not listening to their customers and always wanting to force their proprietary standards like ATRAC, SonicStage, etc. I wish I could just use Windows Media 11 to synch. (I need to have libraries in 3 softwares: Windows Media for Xbox access, iTunes for iPod, and SonicStage for this!) Other than that, an excellent player.

<Title>it's what you expect
<Date>Wed Sep 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The player isn't difficult to figure out but the only problem is with the software one can't transfer any music from their media player but you have to recopy your cds to the system they give you,soundstage.It's good for everything they say it is although it takes a while to get used to navigation.

<Title>CLUNKY
<Date>Tue Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This player epitomizes Sony's clunky proprietary style.  From the 93-page user manual to the breath-takingly awful SonicStage software, it is difficult to enjoy this device.  I purchased the player specifically for the "music pacer" function and was supremely disappointed to discover that it does not match your running cadence with a like-tempo song - that would be far too cool  ... instead, this piece merely decides whether you are running or walking and then opens your pre-defined playlist of "running" songs or "walking" songs ... stupid.

<Title>Hardware is ace, software not so much
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I dig the player. Sound quality is good, player is small (basically an oversized MD in-line remote), controls are intuitive and there are plenty of options such as EQ settings, display orientation, order of play etc.  The display is very clear but is a little "deeper" than I expected, it feels like peering into something under a layer of thick glass. I didn't expect the viewing angle to be great (because of the depth) but I can read it when wearing the included armband, so I guess it's ok.  In what's basically a recurring theme for all of Sony's portable digital audio offerings, SonicStage is the weakest link. It needs a lot of work to catch up to iTunes but I have found that it is not so bad in managing albums, which is mostly what I do. My library is about 7 GB right now and is mostly WMA that I imported. SonicStage stores native WMA and will convert into ATRAC (Sony's codec) when synchronizing to MiniDisc or other Sony players, which tends to be a slow process. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the NW-S205F does support direct WMA playback in its hardware and SonicStage syncs pretty quickly (meaning that it does not convert), so I'm definitely glad about that.   The included headphones don't seem to fit my ears very well. In any case, they seem to be designed for sport so I supplied my own - the MDR-EX71SL. The short cord seems to be a perfect match for this player when its sitting in the armband or my shirt pocket. I'm already using this player more than any other I have but I think I'll use it more when I get the accessory neck strap for it. That product appears to be out in Japan but still not out here. Another nice accessory that is included in the Japanese package appears to be belt/shirt clip. I hope that is available for purchase soon too, it will certainly be useful when using the unit as a pedometer alone.  I have not used the unit in direct sunlight, nor have I tried the calorie counter, pedometer functions but I hope to try that out pretty soon. Maybe I'll update this review then.

<Title>love it
<Date>Sat Oct 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>what is not to like? once you get over the sonic stage software,it is great.those who complain are just apple lovers.i have 4 ipods and still love this sony best.i have so far gotten 31 hours on a single charge.it does everything sony says it will and i find it is really easy to navigate,especially if you have an external drive full of music.i currently have 30gb of music on my external and all you have to do is click on the song you want on your sony mp3 and it instantly downloads it on your player.just takes a little longer than an ipod.get over it.if apple never existed,you would love it.how important are you that you can't spend another nano second to download a selection.all in all i completely love it,although i do still use my shuffles,nano's and 30gb's on occassion,if i could only pick one,it would be my sony nw-s205f

<Title>The best...after software change.
<Date>Tue Oct 17 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After installing the drvoid software (look around, you will find it if you want it)this is the best player that I have ever owned.  Previous favorite was a sony NW-E507 using the onboard filemanager...anything to avoid that unnamed monstrocity that sony would like to inflict.

<Title>no more ipod
<Date>Mon Oct 23 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>i bought it a week ago, and i must say it is way better than my nano. better battery life, not as brittle it's water resistent and i am not afraid to take it the gym, the software although takes longer, if you change the settings to atrac at 48kbps it fits about 1400 songs on 2 gb. more than my nano, and the sound quality is awesome. no more ipod for me..

<Title>BATTERY IS EVERYTHING
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I do not actually own this product but i really wanted to get one. Why am i reviewing it?  I gave it 4 stars so it would not affect the rating much.  Anyways the biggest problem in players today is INTERNAL BATTERY.  I talked to sony about it and it is NOT REPLACEABLE.  This applies to almost every osom mp3 player in the market (zen,nano,cowon,samsung..etc) and this is a HUGE PROBLEM for us (buyers).  You may not think it is a bad thing now but wait after couple years or so.  I really think that if one were to buy a device for more than 100$, one can count on the longevity of the product.   Anyways i really hope ppl will think before buying this product (or others with embedded battery).  I know that it is hard to power bright screens with out lithium ion batteries but WHY DONT THEY MAKE IT EXTERNAL LIKE SANDISK DOES (e200 series).   Other options to consider are Panasonic, their new 2gb flash (almost 70+ hours!!!!) is very good, D sound tech is amazing.  Iriver T10 2gb (50 hours!!) is good as well.

<Title>For Gym only.
<Date>Thu Nov 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought mine two weeks ago at Circuit City, I paid $139.99 before FL taxes. Pros: - Design, - Armband, - Easy to use while running, - Waterproof, - FM and - Weight. Contras: - Battery: does not last 18 hours. Using 192 kbits/s files you will get around 8 hours. - Display: Sony says that you can see it in angle, i don't agree. The display is too deep inside the glass, so it is hard to read it in angle. - Accessories: forget it! It does not exist, not even Sony provides accessories for this model. - Headset not waterproof, - Calories Counter, G sensor: It is far far far from being precise. I turn it off to save battery. P.S.: I had to return it because stop working in less than 2 weeks without a reason. Yesterday I got a new one at Circuit City. Conclusions: Do not buy it if you don't go to the gym often. Maybe it is a good choice for people that already have an IPOD and want to have one just to use in the GYM. Otherwise that are plenty of better options in the market.

<Title>Great Player!  Highly Recommended!!!
<Date>Fri Nov 10 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought this player a few weeks ago and have really enjoyed it so far. It's super small and light, one-line display is easy to read and visible in bright sunlight, FM radio has good reception, good batterly life, navigation is extremely easy and it didn't take long to learn how to set everything up.  Even with the lower/smaller audio format bit rates (ATRAC 48kbps), which is supposed to have the lesser sound quality, the sound is great.  I read some complaints in the online reviews about Sonic Stage, Sony's software. However, I haven't had any trouble with it. I've found it very easy to use, CD's import quickly as well as transfer to the player quickly. I'm not sure about the playlist feature because I'm old school and prefer to listen CD's in their entirety.  The sports related features are very helpful.  A really great buy and I would highly recommened it to anyone!

<Title>Sony 2 GB NW-205F Digital Music Player
<Date>Fri Dec 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME. I bought this player and the an Apple 4GB iPod from Amazon on the same order. The Sony was an impluse buy because of I thought I needed a sports player, the thought being that the iPOD would not be good in that role. WRONG, both have a stop watch function, but the iPOD is so much easier to use than the SONY. Loading and playing music on the iPOD is a breeze compared to the SONY. The music software for the SONY is TERRIBLE. Searching for songs on this thing is next to impossible and I consider myself somewhat of a geek (I think sometimes I have singlehandly financed the entire electronics industry)I do like how quickly it charges from the USB port, of little use though when you have to fumble with its impossible user interface.  Besides it would be so much better if all these players would agree to use one same music interface, not to mention the number of different connections and adapters...ugh!!!  I could have bought a 2 GB iPod for what I paid for the Sony. I just wish I could get my money back. Maybe I'll regift it, seems a shame to dump this shoddy rig on a friend though.

<Title>Great for Running and Working Out
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Good physical design.  Works great for running and working out.  SonicStage is the software that comes with it that is required to upload music to the player.  SonicStage is in need of many updates, but it functions.  It would be nice if you could upload MP3s from Windows Media Player. Overall, great Sony product.
