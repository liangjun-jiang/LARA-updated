<Title>The Meizu M6 as a Portable Media Player
<Date>Thu Mar 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>The Meizu M6 works with any modern operating system, and does not require any drivers (Windows 98 being the exception). To upload your files, is just a matter of drag and drop. Playback supports various formats, such as OGG, MP3, Wav, FLAC, AVI, etc. It is the perfect companion for any UNIX based operating system such as Linux and Mac OS X; it uses usb-mass storage. The battery is said to last 24 hours, and it is true. If you don't want to purchase a charger, you can use any free USB port on your system to charge the Meizu.

<Title>An Electronics Fan

<Content>I own the 8gb version, had it now for a week.  In my collection is the venerable iRiver iHP-140, the iPod 4th generation, iPod 2gb Nano, and I've played around with the Archos 504 80gb and the Iubi Blue.  I decided what I needed was a large-capacity player, for which I don't have a solution yet: the Archos 160gb fits the bill in terms of size, but doesn't support the formats I like (OGG, Flac).  The Iubi Blue is fantastic, but is limited by its size (60gb - although I hear there is a 100gb version of something - the s60 maybe - coming soon).  The search continues.  But my search for a second, lighter, flash-based player that I could wear while jogging, using an arm-band, that had good sound and that supported the audio formats I wanted, has ended!  I'm slightly surprised and happy to say that the Meizu M6 is fantastic in almost every way:  1. Many formats supported 2. Video, though I don't plan on using it much, is surprisingly crisp and easy on the eyes (read that encoding to an acceptable format requires a little bit of tweaking and patience the first time around until you get the hang of it) 3. Good UI with easy-to-operate controls: the touchpad was the right level of sensitivity and I could manipulate it easily while driving.  You can also choose what appears on your main menu, if you like it less cluttered 4. Excellent battery life: I haven't charged it in a week, other than connecting it a few times for a few minutes to transfer some additional content (read that others are getting close to the rated 24 hours for audio) 5. Light, but solid: doesn't feel cheap, looks like it could withstand a few drops.  With a player of this size, you're bound to drop it at some point, so that's helpful 6. Works seamlessly with MediaMonkey and Windows Media Player, haven't tried it yet with Winamp or MusicMatch, sure it works fine.  You can also manage it like a hard drive and update the music library manually if you prefer 7. Records only at 128kbps, 64kbps, or 32kbps in MP3, which is more than adequate for voice, but if I wanted to record concerts and such, I'd probably use my iRiver iHP-140.  At 128kbps, you get roughly 2 hours of recording time with 8gb and obviously less with the 4gb and 2gb versions 8. Customizable backgrounds, skins, etc.  I really like the highly customizable Rockbox interface for my iHP-140, so being able to natively customize the Meizu M6 is a plus  That's all I can think of right now in terms of features and usability.  For those of you who care, there is definitely an envy factor involved, too, as I've been asked what it was and where it could be purchased.

<Title>Wonderful portable MP3/Ogg/movie player

<Content>I love my Miezu.  Works awesome under linux/windows/mac because it acts as a mass storage device.  Just drop your music (mp3,ogg,wav) and you are good to go.  It has a file browse based navigation so you can organize your music into folders and take advantage of that when looking to play things.  It also comes with a easy to use movie converter that converts your movies into a native format for the Meizu.  Works great.  I've watched a whole season of subtitled Anime on the thing.
