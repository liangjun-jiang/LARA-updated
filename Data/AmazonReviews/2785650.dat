<Content>I received the Coby MP-C541 MP3 player as a gift and I love it.  It comes with 125 MB of built in Flash Memory, but can use an additional SD memory card of up to 512 MB.  The 128 of memory is plenty for me.  I switch my music out every few weeks, with the USB cable it came with.  Music is pretty easy to download onto the player and I like that each song displays the title and artist on the LCD screen.  The volume is on the side, there is a lock button on the back that slides up or down.  There is a very simple menu to navigate, the navigation button is a joystick type controller.  This is the first MP3 player I have ever used, besides a palm pilot, and I don't plan on getting a different one until this one dies.  It also can record vioce as a digital recorder and when you play it back it sounds very good.  It's nice for memos or other such things.  The only thing that keeps this product from rating a 5 is the earphones it came with.  The earphones don't fit in my ears and the necktrap/earphone combo is great, only I can't use it.  I called Coby Customer Support and the guy had a magazine in front of him with the same pictures I found on the Coby's product website.  He couldn't really reccommend a set of earphones that came with a neckstrap that I could purchase seprately.  Other than that, it is a great MP3 player, if you have big ear canals for the earphones, lol.
