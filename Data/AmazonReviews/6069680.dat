<Content>Great quality product, great sound and excellent design. I'm a little concerned about the sliding cover for the usb connector though. I guess it's not such a great deal! :D

<Title>Bad mp3 player Ideas
<Date>Sat Apr 15 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The only way to power this mp3 is to plug it into a computer. If your battery is low, you must get your computer NOT another battery, or battery charger to fully charge the Network Walkman. The cost of running a computer for power of a Walkman is Madness. It's cheaper to buy a lot of new batteries or a battery charger. It just so happens that the power company and the vga monitor, etc... does not support the Bean. The sliding cover is difficult to control, since it acts as part of the charging, playback and hold options. The Bean design is to hold in your hand palm between fingers. If you put it in your pocket, there goes that sliding cover. So one should walk around holding the bean in their hand. When I charged the bean and left it unused for a couple weeks, it discharged fully and I needed my vga monitor, Intel processor chip, the mother board, USB port, power supply etc...computer again. It also has a very unfriendly user interface. No neck strap (except China model)

<Title>Love it
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I received this as a gift just yesterday and fell in love with it. I had been searching for the right Mp3 player for months when I happened upon a walkman bean ad in a fashion magazine I was reading. Its look was unique, it stood out from the others I had looked at. Although pink is not my favorite color, (I would have preferred blue had it come in the one-gigabyte format) this pink is irredescent and pleasently between shouting hot pink and icky baby pink, and I have to say, I don't mind carrying around (and flaunting) my pink bean. Anyhow, onto more important specs. I was a teeny bit worried when I read all those "reviews" about the bean having hissy audio, but, after using mine non-stop for the past day, I can say that is not an actual issue. The only time my music is hissy is when it's supposed to be (Shiina Ringo). Another rumor being that it is made unusable by a two-foot drop is also false. Accidentally, of course, my bean fell out of my pocket (a good three feet from the ground), made hard contact with the floor, yet, with my headphones still on my head and attached to the bean, I could hear there was no halt in the music, nor degradation of performance. All the buttons still functioned. And I let out a sigh of relief. The screen is high-contrast and easily read from two feet away. My bean also has two "screensavers", quite a surprise to me, as they were never mentioned in any reveiw or by sony themselves. Yet it is one of my favorite things about the bean. The first screen has strawberries, cherries, bananas, grapes, apples AND oranges skimming across the screen. That one always puts a smile on my face. The one that really made my day though, was the sky screen. When you set the time on your bean, as the day progresses, you get a different screen. In the morning, you get a little sunshine with fat little birds flying past. At midday, the sun is shining with clouds and jet planes flying past. During the evening, the sun sets, with thin, foggy clouds floating past and seagulls flapping into said sunset. Once it hits 7 p.m., or 19:00 (depending on you preference), The crescent moon comes out and stars sparkle behind it as little clouds whiz by. The last screen is the time-and-date display, which are shown inside bubbles. The bean can repeat and shuffle, which I have mine set on all the time. However, now for the sad points. It is   advertised as being able to hold 695 songs. Mine has 194 with enough room left over for four more songs, but that's on high-quality. I'm sure it can hold more if you're NOT an audiophile such as myself. Also, as I have read in other reveiws, the hold button is a pain. That's because it is not a button of its own, rather, it is the difference between closing the usb-port's cover most of the way and all the way. Not a major problem, but it can drive you buggy until you're used to it. Now, the only terrible problems I had in this experience were not about the bean itself, but what came with it (the earbuds included with my bean were lop-sided, the 5 free music downloads included had an illegible redemption code), and I have to say, I wouldn't trade it for anything! I love it more than the hi-fi cd player that it's replacing (believe it or not)! The SonicStage software needed to use the bean is an easy setup, not the best, but better than others I've sampled. Overall, I find this to be a great Mp3 player and reccommend it to anyone, who, like me, would rather not buy an iPod. This is the first, and probably the only Mp3 player that I will own or even want to own. I sleep with it under my pillow. If it wasn't so small, I'd give it a hug.

<Title>The Best mp3 player(it really ROCKS)
<Date>Sun May 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>well i m a big fan of sony and sony has proved it is the best my making such a stylish and flexible mp3 player bean.its very lovely.and sony music format atrac3plus provides good sound quality and smooth music than mp3.i have encoded my songs to 64kbps and even 48kbps  u can feel a bit difference at 48kbps just slight but at 64kbps u cant differenciate the sound difference and mine has hold 305 songs at 64kbps hm still i have many space for my songs hm most probably 200 songs i can load but i dont have time to.well still i have 300mb plus free space and also it can hold data files also.hm sony has never compramised on the soundquality it is heavy in bass and also good in treble.The feautre why i ask for it is that its battery is unbeatable as compare to others.u will get tired but it wont.just intially charge it for 2 hrs or less untill full then all the time it will charge in 3 mins.which is quiet amazing if u use supersave mode then u r battery will last for ever.hm onc thing that i wish it should have that sound equlizer should be in fm too.well it is flash memory based and is quiet fast and easy to acess then others.it has a display orientation to handle it in right or left hand.well the sound quality amazing battery stamina unbelievable unstopped music hole day.and sonicstage software is very easy just searching of tracks in the software is bit difficult and conversion takses a little time.but u can put more music in it.u can put 35hrs of music in it at 64kbps and 45hrs on 48kbps.hm it is unbelievable so the choice is yours.well i dont compromise on soundquality and it is very difficult to find the difference between the 128kbps mp3 and atrac3 plus at 64kbps i would say that sony digital format is very compatible even u can play ur atrac3plus music files with windows media player.what else u want go and get one for u r self and usb is also not frimsy neither it is breakable mine i have to hang it with my usb and it stays.hanging its made in malaysia i love it in pink.best mp3 player ever.one more feautere which i forget to write is AVLS system which is sony best system which prevents u from hearing damage to u r hears by limitting the max volume.sony is simply the best no one like sony bean is awesome bcoz its made by sony in short bean is pack with the power of sony multimedia in a very elegant and fashionable style.well a thing which i meantion to tell is that its shuffle really moves u by playing the tracks which u have ever wanted to listen automatically it really rocks.well the sonicstage is no problem its quiet easy but u should have a sound knowledge u should read manual.hm still if u cant figure out then u can live chat with sony customer support without the need of call hm they are there to help u wich they helped me alot.hm nice customer support.

<Title>SKIP IT
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This Bean should not be allowed to carry the legendary Sony Walkman title. This thing is awful! The proprietary software wont allow you to play the MP3 files on another computer, you can upload MP3s without using the software to transfer files, but the Bean wont let you play them. Also whoever signed off on the design should have their head checked, I dont mean the bean shape, I'm talking about the clasp/mode-selector/flappy thingy...its flimsy and breaks easily. When it gets bent outta place through normal use, it is ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING to try to find the files, folders and to even switch it off! Forget it and save your beans for something else.

<Title>Disappointed about the OLED screen  
<Date>Mon Jun 12 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I bought my Sony Bean 3 months ago, I thought that it was a very good MP3 Player, but now I can see that the screen of the Sony Company are soooooooo bad, I bought this MP3 player because it had 50 hours of playback, 1 GB, it had FM tunner, It was small and I liked the shape of it, also because I read many good reviews about this Sony Bean, but now the sceen looks very misty and the brightness of the scrren is very low. So if you are going to buy this Sony Bean or onother product Sony MP3 Player you will know this information, if it happens to me, it can happen to you or onother person........

<Title>Everything I expected & then some :)
<Date>Tue Jul 04 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>After much contemplation and reading both horrible and raving reviews on this player, I decided to take the risk and buy one.  I just couldn't resist the tiny size (fits in the palm of my hand), bean shape and with me being so girly, the pink color of course;)  After using an old Intel Personal Audio Player 3000 for the last 4 yrs that only held 50 mp3 songs (that was with a 128 memory stick added!) anything was going to be a definate upgrade!  All I have to say is this: If you can read an instruction manual, and are even half way computer savvy with installing some software (very easy to use - no installation errors either!) and following prompts, you will have no trouble with this player!  I have no idea why all these people are tearing it to shreds saying it sucks and is hard to use.  With most electronics I've ever bought, you normally do sit down with the instruction manual to figure out how to use all the functions!  When I got my last cell phone I spent at least an hour playing with it to figure everything out, and basically that's the same thing you will do with this.  Like a gal said a couple comments below mine, the slider cover is not a big deal, it's not "loose and wobbly", if you happen to flick it in the hold position, flick it back!  The entire hour I fiddled with it, it never slipped into that position anways!  As for the hissing complaint, I hear none!  The only way you would, would be if your mp3 track was ripped and recorded onto your computer/downloaded off the internet with a hiss in it - it's all about the quality of the tracks you are putting on it! Or if you are listening to the radio and certain commercials have a hiss - which a lot do as well (when songs came on it sounded perfect).  Otherwise it was dead silent switching between tracks.  It has awesome sound, however I knew I wouldn't like the ear phones that came with it, as they were the hard plastic earbuds.  I opted to buy the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia headphones instead.  They even come in a silverish pink color and match the player!  Plus they have super nice silicone covered buds in different sizes that fit snug and feel wonderful like they aren't even in your ears!  You can also purchase the Sony Bean CSE31ARM armband so you don't have to carry it around and worry about dropping it!  And one last thing - the screen savers are my favorite part...the floating fruits, sky, water are so dang cute:)  Ok, if you are a guy you obviously won't care;)  But for a girl this is the ultimate girly mp3 player!  I'd take this over an Ipod anyday, since they are bigger (even the minis) and because everyone has one!  I like to be unique and haven't seen anyone carrying around one of these yet.  I give this player and the fontopia ear phones an A++++++++++   Go buy one now! :)

<Title>Should've saved for an iPod mini :(
<Date>Thu Jul 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I was very excited about ordering this mp3 player (even if it was refurbished).  I was disappointed, maybe because of my anticipation?  The downloading software didn't work for me on the first day, and it chooses to act up at random times.  I didn't see why I couldn't just drag-and-drop mp3 files from folder to folder like I was so accustomed to.  True, it does have a 695-song capacity, but if I had had the chance to do it again, I would've saved for an iPod mini--which is alot sleeker and less little-girl-play-toy looking.  This is a nice mp3 player, though, and a nice one to have if you're not willing to spend alot of money (I got my refurbished one for $80).  A nice little trinket for pre-teens, but not sophisticated enough for "older young adults."  Also, it makes this annoying beeping sound (I don't know if I'm doing it wrong?) whenever I try to skip or play back a song.  Is that normal?

<Date>Fri Jul 07 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The size of the player fits perfectly in my hand and the pink color is cute too. The menu button is easy to use except the hold feature is little bit annoying. I am still trying to figure out how to use the SonicStage software. But for anyone who wants to listen MP3 format music, it is better to download the MP3 file manager software from Sony website. You can use the drag and drop feature once you download the software to your player. But I am only able to drag music files from my MP3 music CD which I don't know why. Overall the player works great once you figure out how to load music to it.

<Title>not usable due to SonicStage
<Date>Tue Jul 11 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.  I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1.  (if you don't believe SonicStage is B A D then google it up or look at the other Sony player reviews since they all use the same SonicStage)

<Content>I really enjoyed running and going to the pool with my previous Bean that had the same 1GB storage.  It fits perfectly in my hand and never gave me any trouble until I dropped really hard on the concrete, which was all my fault.  I had, had it forever and missed it so much that I ordered the same one, but in a new color.  I have found it easy to use and copy music onto.  I would definitely recommend the Bean!

<Content>The Sony Bean is junk; the access door is weak and breaks easily. Mine broke after using for 2 months, the warranty is 3 months but since this was a Christmas present, the warranty had expired. Sony offered to do a exchange for the unit at a price that exceed the purchase price by $30. I would never purchase a Sony Bean again. Additionally I am very disappointed is Sony's proposed resolution to the issue.  I now have an Ipod - it works great

<Title>Not a long term mp3
<Date>Sat Jul 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this MP3 in 2005 when it first came out because I thought it was cute... and it sure is cute but that's pretty much all it has going for it. It does have amazing battery life. I remember being able to charge it for five minutes and it would last for hours. The built in USB plug is handy but the issue I had with it was that the cover that hides the USB is very flimsy. In fact, this was the first thing that broke. I had this MP3 for less than a year when the cover was on the verge of falling off and the main button that is used to control the volume and tracks was jammed. If I attempted to raise the volume, it would switch to another song. Soon after that I was unable to turn it off because of the jamming button and I was unable to keep it charged for long.   This is a great MP3 only if you take special care of it and this is very hard to do since it very easily gets damaged (mine was damaged because I used to carry it in my bag all the time).  I loved the sony bean, but it just is not practical.

<Title>Tiny! Super easy to use! On The GO!
<Date>Wed Jul 18 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I Love this thing! Had it for over a year now. It pretty much did what I needed it for. Totally portable fits in my hand. Shaped as a cute bean. The size of the mp3 player was rather convenient for me. I just stuff it in my pocket and there it stays. I also like the built in USB. College student, so whenever I am running low on batteries I could always recharge it at a computer. Super fast charge as well, 3 minute charge gave me about 3 hours of music play. Fully charged it lasted for days. I listen to this thing everyday usually in 2 weeks I need to recharge it again. I also like the ear buds that came with it. Asymmetrical cord allowed me to have the ear buds around my neck instead of putting them away all the time. Pretty nice I recommend this to people that are on the go and want something super light.  Holds a nice amount of music.    Downside is the program that comes with it. Converts all the mp3s to an Ogg file. Its a bit annoying. I use this program only to transfer songs onto the mp3 player other then that I don't use it.

<Title>Better than my daughters Ipod
<Date>Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>*I just want to edit my review here real quick. A little update. My daughters IPOD died a couple of weeks ago. After all the trouble we had over the past year, now it is done for good. I reset it (Yet again), and then the next day it completely crapped out. We took it back to the store (still under warranty), and they had to replace it.... Wouldn't trade my Sony "Bean" for anything...  Now back to my original review...*   My g/'s daughter has an Ipod nano. My friend at work has an Ipod nano. I do all the music for them. The Ipod is ok, and all, but this has been far better in my opinion. I got this as a gift 2 years ago. The Battery life is stll awesome.   I am not sure how so many people are having trouble keeping theirs together. The USB cover is not that flimsy. Just don't beat it up, and it will last plenty long enough.   I have never had a problem with a song being corupt. My G/f daughters Ipod is constantly found to be corrupt, and I have to reset it back to factory conditions, and reload the music... She is having that problem again, but is at her dad's house. This is the 3rd time since last Christmas...  The ear buds suck, but so do about every pair I have ever tried... Sound great, but are very uncomfortable. My g/f's bean has 500 songs on it. I use a higher quality file, so mine will probably hold 350, but I don't even have that many songs I want on it right now...  Take care of it like you should anything like this, and it will last a LONG time...  Plus the FM radio function is great. Try that on an Ipod without paying the extra 45-50 bucks for the FM radio add on...  Oh,  and 2 years later, my controls still work like brand new... Treat it right and it is a far better but than Ipod...

<Date>Sun Sep 23 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I had a Sony bean for about 18 months until I dropped it and broke the volume/song selector toggle.  Actually, that was the fourth or fifth time that I had dropped it, but the only time that did any damage.  I really wish that this device was still available, as it seems that Sony discontinued it.  Mine didn't have a ton of memory, but it was unbelievably easy to use.    I loved how easy it was to switch between songs, playlists, and repeat styles on the go, no need to even take it out of my pocket.  I have not found a single other mp3 player that lets me use it on the go without pulling it out and looking through things.  I hate the design of iPods and the newer Sony players are nowhere near as easy to use on the go.

<Title>Sony Bean Sucks
<Date>Wed Dec 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>Buying this product was a huge mistake.  I urge you to refrain from buying any type of Sony product that uses Sony Connect.  It is the worst software when it comes to adding music to the player.   The player itself was okay, great battery life, so-so screen, great idea with the USB connect.  All of this is washed out because of Sony Connect.  It makes adding music to the player because of share rights.  Basically CD's that you own and burn to your computer are useless.  Customer service is terrible.  That's right Sony, I am calling you out of your hole.  I will never buy another Sony product (which I consider their other proucts great) because of my distaste for Sony Connect. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I HATE YOU SONY!
