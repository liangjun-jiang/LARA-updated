<Content>This thing is a great lightweight, tiny in size powerhouse. Easy to add music and sound is superb, although I recomend jvc earbuds as the included dont hit the highs as well. This things perfect for use while at the gym. Worth the price and will be ordering some for Christmas gifts as well.

<Title>Great design and quality
<Date>Wed Nov 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought a few different kinds of little MP3 players after I killed my ipod nano. This is the best overall. I use it fishing on the Pacifc Ocean and for me an MP3 player needs to be able to stay out of my way as I bounce around and off of things. I clip this on the back of my baseball cap where it adjusts. It is thin enough to be comfortable and one charge usually gets me through a day of fishing. Having it on my head it needs to be light weight and it is. I also like that it is inexpensive because there is a good chance I will destroy it while I am fishing.   I am using the buds that came with it and they work fine for me. The ONLY thing I would like to see changed is for them to make the USB adapter a little longer so it doesn't fight with the headphone plug in. 1GB is perfect for me because I can just buy a few and have each one hold a playlist.   This order is my 2nd one, which was supposed to be Black but looks like it will be Silver *again* which isn't going to help me keep them apart... It turns out none of my early concerns about it were valid. The spring has held up to heavy use and abuse and I think I'd rather have more than bigger or with a heavier battery. I'll probably buy a few more for myself after Christmas and I'll be getting a few of them as gifts for people next year (I have to get them switched over to digital music first!) I don't normally gush over material objects, but these things are about perfect IMO.

<Title>Not bad, does the job.

<Content>All I can say is - not bad.  It is smaller than I expected, literally not much bigger than your thumb, and very lightweight.  Still, it has stood up to the heavy handedness of an 8 and 10 year old for a week of post-Christmas play. It hooks to your computer with an included USB adapter, which means another small part to potentially get lost.  It says it has a 2.5mm headphone jack, but ours came with a 3.5mm headphone jack - no adapter needed to switch to replacement headphones.  The silver one we bought (same model) has 2.5mm jack.  Identical in every other way.  Sometimes your headphone plug comes a little loose and suddenly you can't hear anything thru the earphones until you jigger the plug back in.  Has rechargable battery that is charged when the unit is plugged into the USB.  Simple plug and play, no software to install.  Drag and drop files in Windows explorer, or WMP recognizes it as a device.  Make sure the Hold switch (the little switch on the side with a picture of a padlock) is off when you try to sync or you'll get a disk error message. An "okay" player for an okay price.

<Title>Coby Clip good idea, but a dud !!!
<Date>Wed Jan 02 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>There have been so many problems with this little mp3 player I don't know where to begin.  I gave this to my 8 year old son for Christmas thinking the clip would be great for him so he didn't have to carry it around.  While the 'clip' part works great, the rest of it is a big disappointment.           Starting out with charging.  It comes with a rechargeable battery which is great because if you've ever owned one that takes alkaline batteries you find out real quick that you'll go thru batteries in a hurry.  The thing is it doesn't have any indication that is was charging, so your left wondering for quite a while if anything is even happening.  Also if you only have usb ports in the back of the computer your going to have a tough time because the connector they send is only about 2 inches long, not a cord like most of the others I have had, I had to pull my system out from the desk to charge.            Next problem was actually downloading music to it!  MAJOR problems here!!!!  I got errors several times before we finally got it to accept anything at all.  Then we downloaded several songs to it and took it out and my son was listening to it and realized several of the songs we thought we had downloaded to it were not playing.  Pulled the computer back out and tried loading them again and again they didn't work.  Went to Coby site and they said problem was on our end...corrupt files or something.  Funny thing is tho, songs work fine on 4 other players we have.  Songs from personal cds worked fine on it, songs from walmart download site and similar places are the ones we can't play.  Even though their site says we can play those types of songs fine on this player.            The buttons on the Clip player are also a pain, the forward works fine.  The back button gets you to the beginning of the current song your listening to, but we couldn't get it to go any further than that.  Also, in case you didn't notice there is no screen on this player to tell you what song your playing, etc.....I knew this and was fine with it for my son, he likes listening to them all so he doesn't really care which one is playing now or next.  We have now owned two Coby mp3 players.  The first one was a learning experience....this one, the 2nd, was just stupidity on my part, should have known better after owning the first one.  To me this little player isn't worth much, especially not the $20 I paid for it....should have been more like five!

<Title>Good MP3 Player

<Content><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PIVVTG/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-4516772-7535962">Coby MP-C582 Clip MP3 Player 1 GB - Black</a> I purchased this MP3 player for my husband.  He works construction and the clip style works great for him.  The only thing that we don't really like is that it has to be connected to the computer via a USB connection in order to be recharged making it hard to take on the road with him.

<Title>Nice little MP3 player!

<Content>I just received my player today. Easy to install and setup. Windows Media Player 11 had no trouble seeing it. Drag and drop playlist or albums right to it and it only took about 6 minutes to transfer three albums. My only con is the player charges with a USB hook-up but there is no indication if it is fully charged or not. The little red light stays on while charging but never shuts off after three or four hours. I guess when it dies it needs to be recharged.
