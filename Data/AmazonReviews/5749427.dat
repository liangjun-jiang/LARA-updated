<Title>An exercise in frustration
<Date>Sat Nov 17 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought the 405 in September and the docking station shortly thereafter.  To record t.v. you need the docking station and to download a proprietary t.v. program guide using the company supplied Archoslink software.  The problem is that you can't download the tv program guide due to some defect in the Archoslink software.  Archos has only told me that they have referred this problem to the engineers but I have heard nothing for a month  I am not sure if this problem also effects the WiFi versions, but I would definitely not recommend buying this item until they have worked things out.  Even then, the interface it very confusing and difficult to use particularly from the machine.  The navigation is not at all intuitive and even once you learn the quirky system you still make a lot of mistakes at is that poorly designed.    The company web site shares the software's poor design.  For example to download the Archoslink software you need to search create an account with the serial and model numbers of both the machine and the docking station, and then confirm you information and search around for the software.  The web site does not save your log in and when you click on a download the archoslink software link it takes you back to the log in page.  The website has not have a search function and the software is not under the downloads link where you would expect it.    The device also seems quite limited in they format of files it will play.  You even need to purchase a codex to common types of files and many are not supported.  There seem to be a number of similar devices out there that make a better choice.  Do not be fooled by what at first seems like a low price for such a device.  The added cost of the docking station and the necessary codex software significantly raise the cost and the time it takes to set up and frustration to use really add up.

<Title>The DVR function will not work.

<Content>The problem with the Archoslink software has still not been corrected. Archos advises that they know of the problem but has no idea when it will be fixed. Based on other reviews, this problem has been going on for a very long time. If you want to use the Archos 405 as a DVR it simply will not work due to the defect in the Archoslink software.

<Title>nice toy
<Date>Sun Jan 13 00:00:00 CST 2008
<Content>Received player as a gift and I'm very happy with it. I mainly use it for my pics and some music so if there is any problems with video/recording I'm not aware of it. It works great for my purpose, perfect size for "to go", easy to use, I did not even need to read the manual. No problem at all to run update from Archos website or downloading pics and music from PC. Little bit time consuming creating folders but I had fun doing it with little keyboard that pops up on your screen. Resolution is not the best but good enough for 3.5" screen size. Overall good value for $130.

<Title>Good but you could hope for more

<Content>I bought this Archos for my mother, since Ive owned 5 archos (3 models and 2 dead) but I have had good experience with returned archos... (actually with the ones sent back)...   Anyway it is really good mp3 player, pretty good movie and video player but I like the controls on my av500 better (besides the fact that im used to it, it is actually faster to get things done with menus and stuff)... Knowing this was a flash drive I thought the battery would hve been improve from the 4th generation of this model... but i was wrong... i actually think they put a smaller (mAh) battery... Cause even after many cycles my mom havent got near to the claimed 16 hours for mp3 (that is about 12 hours of normal usage) or 5 hours for video (yet to be tested) anyway... she gets more like 8 hours... and the charging time is really bad...   Im waiting for the mini dock to arrive so she can charge it directly to the wall... and to see if the battery improve...  Great set of features that is: sdhc compatibility, mini usb standard plug and capability to record with additional dock.. but i wish they would have let the other details that makes my av500 special (built in speaker, voice/line in recorder, removable battery, video out directly from the headphone plug)
