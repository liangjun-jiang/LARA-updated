<Title>Short lived product
<Date>Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This product worked well for 5 workouts.  Then the buttons stopped working.  New batteries didn't help. Still, it was cheap and I understand the whole MP3 thing now.  I'll buy something better next.

<Title>perfect for what i wanted
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>this is the perfect product for what i needed. i wanted an inexpensive "i-pod" for my younger children ages 10, 8, and 7. they liked listening the the older kids music, but aren't responsible enough to keep up as well with something so small.  this holds plenty songs, easy to put music on, and simple to use.

<Title>Don't buy this!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I purchased 5 of these as gifts for my family members for Christmas. I spent a great deal of time trying to download songs on them. There were no detailed instructions in the package explaining the download. I had to contact the company for instructions and when they were followed I still could not download songs on them. I own an IPod and a Dell MP3. I had no problems with them at all. Also, when I tried to return the product to the company I purchased them from, I had to get an RA number before returning them. I called the company several times before I actually got a person to get an RA number from.

<Title>not too shabby!
<Date>Tue Jan 09 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>For a budget mp3 player it isn't too bad a deal. Definately a no frills device, but if you want to use it for working out, as I did, you can't beat the value.

<Title>Proper instructions would have been nice
<Date>Wed Jan 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This item had a very good price and my expectations were based on what information I read about it, but on receiving the item and attempting to use it, I found the instructions were not at all helpful.  I was unable to make it work.  So it sits in a drawer for now.  I feel my money was wasted on this item..not because the item was not a good piece of technology, but because I did not recieve instructions on it's use that made sense.

<Title>nice basic MP3 player
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>While overall I think this is a great MP3 player for its price, I'm giving it only three stars because of these two complaints:  1. The included neck strap speakers are crap.  At first I thought the player itself was outputting a lousy signal, but then I tried it with the headphones I use with my computer and it sounded just fine.  Just throw away the included ear buds.  If you don't already have a set of headphones, you'll need to get some to use with this player if you ever want to play music on it.  Factor that into the cost.  2. The volume control buttons are reversed.  The button on the left increases volume while the one on the right decreases it.  This takes some time to get used to.  On the plus side, interfacing it with my computer couldn't have been easier.  It's a standard USB mass storage device, so it will work with most systems even without the driver disc.  It's USB 2.0, so file transfers are quick if your computer also has USB 2.0.  While you can plug the device directly into a USB port, it also includes an extension cable.  There is no LCD display, but I consider this a plus since it would just cut down the battery life for this simple player.  Get this player if you're on a budget and all you need is a basic portable MP3 player that can hold a few hours of music.  It's perfect for taking walks in the park.

<Title>good MP3 player  for the kids
<Date>Thu Jan 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>It has a decent memory, is not difficult to figure out and fairly small in size.  You also don't have to worry about losing it because a new one definitely won't break the bank.  The ear buds are all but useless, but there are hundreds of aftermarket buds that are likewise rather inexpensive and far better.  I bought 3 for my kids aged 6, 6, and 4.  They love them and have no problem using them.

<Title>Great little gizmo
<Date>Fri Jan 12 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought 7 of these to give as gifts for the male coworkers of my husband.  I always have a harder time choosing gifts for young men than I do for women.  Anyways, they were thrilled with this item (beats a crappy coffee mug anyday!).  I ordered one too many and thus it went to my daughter...so I got to use it, too. I liked it so much I am here to buy 2 more for myself and my son. I agree that the instructions are pretty much useless.  I just plugged it in an pasted mp3 files into it from my files in windows explorer. Windows recognized it right away and automatically installed it (there is also a cd for drivers on win 98).  No biggie.  I am certainly not whatcha call a techie.  I guess if you have no program at all to change .wav files from your cds into mp3s then you would have a problem, but you can get these free shareware type programs on the internet.  I did notice it "skipped" a tiny bit here and there.  I am not sure if that was from my files, from the flash based media, or this player in particular.    It is about 3 inches long and one inch wide.  It is a little thick for only 128 mb, but that is likely because of the battery compartment (it takes one AAA) The big button on the front of the thing is fake, it doesn't do anything.  The 3 "real" buttons are on top.  The first is a step back/volume up button, second is a step forward/volume down button, and the third is a pause/stop button.  Click the button to do the first thing (e.g., step back, step forward, pause) and push and hold the button to do the other function. Hold the stop button to turn it off. It plugs directly into your usb port.  They also include a wire, too if you want, and some little in-your-ear earphones.  That's it.    No, it doesn't display titles/artists, have any bass/treble stuff, bookmarks, etc.  I realize it only holds about 30 songs, but it is cheap and simple.  We old people used to make cassette tapes of our favorite songs so we could take them on the fly. This is the same sort of thing.  It is simple to plug in and put on a few songs for the car ride to work (you'll of course need some device to plug it into your car..corded cassette, fm transmitter, you know the items) or for a workout, walk, take to the beach, or keep your kids occupied for a little while.  Simple to change songs when you want..it is just like putting them in a file on your computer.  Then if you drop it in the ocean or your kid drops it in his milkshake or whatever, you wont go crazy that they ruined it.  I don't even like carrying my ipod too many places, scared I might drop it or get sand in it. The battery is a regular old battery, no waiting for recharges.  This is no 300 dollar item, but it is a great little take along you won't be afraid to actually bang around.

<Title>Used at the Gym
<Date>Thu May 10 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought this to use at the gym.  I'm glad I bought it.  The most important thing is to use good headphones.  I used it with some cheap headphones at first and it was nails on a chalkboard, then I plugged in my Audio Technica ATH-M30's into it and it was a completely different story.  If you put songs on it for the gym and can hit play and just let them go this player will work well for you.  If you need to adjust the volume or change the song every 4 minutes this probably isn't the best thing to get.  Overall I think it's a really good value.

<Title>So Far, So Good
<Date>Thu Jun 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This is my 1st MP3 player. It was the cheapest one with the best ratings I could find. I didn't want to pay for features I didn't need. I had an initial problem getting it to work...turned out to be my mistake...I hadn't noticed that the battery came in a shrink-wrapped sleeve that had to removed(duh). But after that, it was fine. I use it primarily for quick&easy data file transfer between our two PC's, but the sound is fine through my Etymotic head phones for music, too. It did freeze up once (couldn't get the buttons to respond). I removed the battery, put it right back and then everything worked fine again. If not for that, I would have given it 5 stars. I'm a little nervous about the few reviewers who say the thing broke down quickly, but if this thing lasts a year, it will be worth it.

<Title>Totally Fair for the Price
<Date>Tue Aug 14 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I bought mine over a year ago.  I've changed out the music three times, run through several battery changes and even dropped it once. It still works perfectly.  I did throw away the really crappy earphones that come with it, replaced them with a better quality set, about $20, which I can always use in other ways if this gadget finally does die.  The buttons all work, just the basic stuff: skip forward, skip back, +vol, -vol and off. What else do I really need? The sound is fine, too. Like someone else, I took away one star for a temporary freeze-up, but like him, it started up again just fine with a battery change.  (Strange, though, because the first battery was new, and had plenty of juice.) Overall it sounds like they have some quality control issues, as a lot of people are getting units that just plain don't work, BUT if you dodge that bullet, you get a very decent little mp3 player for an amazingly good price.
