<Title>Another Winner from Apple
<Date>Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I purchased my iPod Mini two days after it was released and I must admit, I am blown away by the functionality and style of Apple's newest creation.  Just as a background, I also own a 20 GB third generation iPod, so my comparisons and observations are from a first hand perspective.<p>So, why on earth did I buy a Mini?  Quite simply, I was so impressed with this device that I had to have one.  First off, the scroll wheel is vastly improved over the standard iPod.  The wheel is still touch sensitive for scrolling, but the functionality of the four buttons has been placed around the wheel and can be clicked.  This makes for much easier one handed operation.  The screen is razor sharp and the backlighting is awesome.  The exterior shell is all aluminum and the screen is recessed in the front of the case.  This ipod feels much more durable and resisitant to scratching than my standard iPod.  The battery life is also improved.  This mini played for nearly 8 hours on the first charge.  I typically never get more than 4.5-6 out of my standard iPod.  The biggest difference is the form factor of the device (size and the weight).  At only 3.6 ounces this iPod can be carried in the pocket without noticing it is there.  As small as my standard iPod is, somehow, you always know it is there.  The Mini solves this problem.  After all, what good is an iPod that holds all of my music, if it is not quite small enough to have with me all the time.<p>Perhaps one of the coolest parts is the interaction with iTunes.  My Library is 7.4 GB, which exceeds the capacity of the Mini.  However, when you connect it for the first time, it automatically knows this and creates an &quot;iPod Mini Playlist&quot; that serves as a second library just for my Mini.  Just drag and drop from your main library and the songs transfer to the Mini in a snap.<p>Now, I know what you are all thinking . . . why pay $249 for 4 GB, when you can have 15 GB for only $50 more?  The answer is quite simple.  In life, purchasing decisions are made with emotion and justified with logic.  On paper, there is no disputing the fact that you get far more GB per dollar by going with the standard iPod; and the standard iPod is a terrific piece of equipment.  But beyond the logical considerations lies the iPod Mini.  The way it feels in your hand, the enhanced functionality of the scroll wheel, the great form factor, and the cool aluminum finish.  All of these intangibles create a product that transcends a strict price per GB comparison and makes this iPod worth every penny of its $249 price tag.<p>The bottom line . . . I have 1050 songs on my Mini with room to spare.  I bought the Mini because it puts a smile on my face every time I use it and it is just too darn cool to pass up.  I highly recommend this device.

<Title>The best player on the market
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Its amazing. I love it. I have the 40 GB Gen 3 and I want my wife's mini. The case is very well constructed, it feels solid. The whole thing is made of anondized aluminum and it feels super sturdy. The screen is crystal clear and the perfect size. The clickwheel is WAY better than the current Ipod configuration of 4 buttons above the scroll wheel. The clickwheel feels solid and the clicking is crisp. The wheel doesnt rotate but Im sure you coulda figured that out already. Its touch sensitive for scrolling with the select button still in the middle. And yes you can scroll thru songs super fast like a normal Ipod The color is vibrant and the mini is just the right size. <p>This thing fits in your pocket and you dont even know its there. I put my big ipod in my pocket and it feels like im smuggling a pack of cards. If you got the means, get this player. It doesnt disappoint.   Its like the Prada of the electronics world.<p>And dont let the nonsense you hear about battery life sway you.  The battery is fine, I regularly get 8 hours of play out of it.  Of course in a few years you will have to replace the battery for $59 but thats the nature of ALL rechargeable batteries.  They eventually die over their lifetime.  Its just a scientific fact.  <p>Get the ipod mini now...A++ would buy another one . This thing has COOL dripping off it

<Title>Way Cooler Than Expected
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After all the anti-hype surrounding Apple's &quot;overpriced&quot; low-end iPod, I expected to be very disappointed by this, especially since we already on a full 40G current-generation model; but I was very pleasantly surprised. <p>The mini's smaller size is far more of an advantage than I had expected, making it the first truly pocketable iPod, and one of the nicest pocketable MP3 players ever. The smaller display (which omits album name) is crisp and clear, and the new control, which combines the wheel and select control of the current generation iPods with the four function buttons, is actually an improvement over the full-sized version's controls.<p>In every other respect the mini is indistinguishable from its (surprisingly much) larger cousins, except for two: (1) it is still a bit overpriced (but those who must have one need not hesitate) and (2) it's much smaller capacity may not work for many users.

<Title>Great.. when it works
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I got my mini the first day it came out at my local store.  I've waited 3 years to buy a player of this caliber, and thought this finally was the one I wanted.<p>It's been 5 days, and its broken!!  It stopped in the middle of a song and froze.  There is no re-set button on this, and the battery is not one that can be removed.   Translation:  needs to be taken back.  This is the problem I feared when I saw that the battery was built in, and my fear was realized not even 1 week into it.<p>When it worked, it did sound great.  I had it hooked up with my Bose headphones and the sound was equal of that to my home stereo system, which is impressive.  <p>My gut feeling here is that it's new and the software probably has some bugs.  I'm going to exchange it and get a new one, and see if this problem recurs.  <p>My only other knock is itunes.  I just don't care for the s/w.. it's not very user friendly.

<Title>WOW.....thats a lot of money
<Date>Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player.  I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more.  It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style.  I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion.  I just want to listen to music!!!!!

<Title>HERE IS THE SKINNY ON MY MINI
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been waiting for this to arrive and now I have it so let me share with you what I know. This is my first ipod and I am glad I waited. To start with I love the look of it. Pink is the color that I have it is sooooo cute. It dose not hold as many songs as the other ipods so that is something you should know right off. For the price I do think it should hold more. If you are using this with a PC you must have Windows 2000 or XP. It works smoothly and great sound so far, I am very pleased with it.<p>PROS:<p>1. The size, it is easy to carry or put in your pocket and you can wear it around your neck also.<p>2. If you buy this from the Mac store online you can get it personalized free. Wayyyyy cool<p>3.  Ease of operation and good customer help if you need it.<p>4.  You can download books as well as music from MAC.COM<p>CONS:<p>1.  It is pricey for something that can only hold 1000 songs.<p>2.   Would have liked to have  seen a color screen, something I am sure they can do.<p>3.   Headphones could be better. I don't like earplugs.<p>4.   Battery life is only 8 hours.

<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Either I got a defective one, but after 4 hours with 7 different techs on the phone and calls to Apple Corporate, someone has agreed to exhange my unit for another one.<p>My i-Tunes would load all the songs on to the i-pod, and you could pick a song, but it would never play, just go blank.<br>Waited a month, had it engraved, now I have to wait for a box to return it, and then wait for another one and start over.  I think it may be advisable to wait to they get the bugs worked out.  7 different techs could not figure it out.  Or, maybe I got a bad one.

<Title>P.O.S.
<Date>Fri Jun 02 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman.

<Title>Great except when it sucks
<Date>Thu Jun 29 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I loved it when it was working right, but 6 months after I first got it, Itunes crashed while updating the ipod and the hard drive got corrupted.  Luckily, you can still buy the AppleCare protection if it's been less than a year so I got it and they sent me a new Ipod.    That worked great for almost a year but then my battery life got really short (1 hour or so).  I sent it back again, since I was still covered by AppleCare, but they told me they wouldnt cover it because it was caused by abuse!  I never did anything "abusive" to it, I dropped it maybe once or twice, and I dont see how that would cause it to work fine except for the reduced battery life.  I realize they dont make this model anymore, but I'm definitely goign to look around at the other makers before I get my next MP3 player.  And apparently it's barely worth getting applecare for the battery issue alone.

<Title>The First Colorful iPod
<Date>Fri Oct 13 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Mini was the first iPod that came in colors. So, it was the first iPod I bought--It was pink. I could not resist.  When I first got the iPod, it was flawless performance and exactly what I wanted. The earphones work fabulously, I had all my favorite music, it was small and durable. Some people talk about glitches in it, and yes, mine had some. But my Applecare free warranty was still intact, so I sent it back and was sent a brand-new iPod in 2 days. That works for me!  The screen is old-fashioned nowadays, yes, but its low-key and still fabulous. Sadly my Mini got stolen, so now I'll be needing a pink Nano.   In conclusion, an amazing machine with plenty of memory and good looks to go with it.

<Title>Great....if you don't mind glitches
<Date>Thu Dec 28 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>When I first got this pink iPod mini for my birthday last year I was thrilled. The battery life was never ending, it was easy to use, and it looked cute and withstanded constant torture. However, a year later I am deeply dissapointed in this Apple product. I started noticing during the summer it downloaded songs very slowly and constantly froze on itunes. After disconnecting it from the USB it would freeze, just simply switching from song to song froze it. I noticed that the batter was much less than the promised hours and after a full charge the battery would go down after about 5 minutes of use. If I was to leave it alone a couple of days after a full charge when I would turn it back on the battery would be half gone. The earphones that are included with the iPod, just forget them, they are comeplete crap, they crack and break open, and the sound comes through all fuzzy. If the battery was to be completey gone and I would plug it into the computer to charge it would freeze right there and not chrage at all. I would suggest moving on to the more new and improved iPod's that work better and last longer. iPod mini's last a year, two at the most.

<Title>Not Happy with it
<Date>Sun Feb 11 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I got a Green iPod mini for my birthday in July 2005. I loved the easy to use clickwheel, and the shiny green color. But around October of that year, it started to have glitches and it would freeze up after being on for only 2 minutes! I took it to Apple and they gave me a new one because of a problem. Then in February 2006, the replacement mini died. It wasn't recognized on iTunes, and it finally showed the sad iPod icon. I put it in Diagnostic Mode (Press Select and Previous) and I did a HDD scan. The scan failed and when I reset it, it turned on to the sad iPod again and the hard drive started clicking and it sounded like it was abour to explode. I went to Apple again and they gave me another one. When I got home (thankfully Apple store only 15 minutes away from me) I charged it, and it worked fine. Now it's February 2007, and the warranty expired today. When I turned it on when I woke up, it wouldn't turn on.   What a waste of time. This is the most UNRELIABLE iPod out there. And Apple says they can only repair it for a fee of $[...]. That's how much I paid for it in the beginning! I'm just going to buy a new iPod nano.

<Date>Thu Feb 22 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>This MP3 player is a good basic unit.  The controls are a bit touchy.  You have to get the hang of skimming you finger around the touch circle.  You also have to remeber to lock the controls while you are listening, or a slight brush on the control surface will change settings.  The iTunes software is nice.  The autosynch feature is easy to use.  Overall, a good unit for the price.

<Content>This was the worst electronics puchase I've ever made.  When I first got the mini it was great, looked nice and sounded great.  Within about 6 months battery life started to go way down, after a year it was down to nothing, didn't work properly, would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes.  If you're going to take a chance on an iPod, definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one.

It is very easy to use and unbelievably cool.  I use the firewire and the I-tunes software that came supplied with the player. For a first-timer in digital audio, this product makes it quite easy to rip a cd to your computer or download a song, and then put it on the I-pod (which is automatically done for you). Product design is flawless.  This is my first Apple product, and I am very impressed.  I've had no trouble using it with Windows XP home ed..  This product is well worth the price.  If you are considering one, buy it if you can.(I was lucky enough to pick one up the first day they went on sale)  You will certainly not be disappointed

<Title>Small in Size not in Functionality
<Date>Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The iPod mini is built from the ground up as a portable device for people with fast-paced lives.  It's small and lightweight physical dimensions are perfectly suited to be being placed in a pants or shirt pocket without being a burden.<p>But don't let its light weight fool you into thinking the iPod mini is a pushover.  The 4GB hard drive (3.7 GB actual) can hold about 1,000 songs - enough to last almost three full days.  The installed software includes four games; calendar; notepad; contact database; clock; backlight with timer; alarm clock; and the abilities to customize the main menu; create playlists; and rate songs.  All this is in addition to being able to be used as an external hard drive.<p>However, the most revolutionary aspect of the iPod mini (aside from it's size and weight) is its control interface.  Incorporating the `Menu', `Pause/Play', `Forward' and `Back' buttons directly to the touch sensitive scroll wheel not only creates simplicity from a design standpoint, but form a user one as well.  Accessing these controls is a breeze.  Thankfully the touch wheel is designed well enough that accidental pressing of a control is unlikely to occur since you have to press down a bit to activate the button.  I'd actually like to see the entire iPod line adopt this interface.<p>Some people complain that the iPod mini is only slightly cheaper than the 20 GB iPod and offers a lot less storage space.  But what you loose in storage space you gain in portability.  It is also important to consider that compared to other players of its size and weight, the iPod mini offers much more storage space, many more features, and a better music jukebox in iTunes 4.0.<p>I want to carry the most music I can in the smallest possible device that offers the best interface and features.  For me, that device is unquestionably the iPod mini.  If you have similar demands of a portable music device, the iPod mini is sure to become a permanent accessory to your lifestyle.

<Title>Apple has hit another home run!!!!!!!!!!
<Date>Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I had been reading about the iPod Mini for months, and with each passing week wanted one more and more.  I was lucky enough to live near an Apple store, and bought mine the second day they came out -- 2/21/04.  While I've only had my Mini a week, it looks to be a tremendous product.  The price may be a little higher than you'd like, but for an extra $50 or so compared to smaller MP3 players, you get more capacity than you really need -- I have over 750 songs on mine (about 36 hours worth!), a beautiful design (I got the blue one and it gets a lot of compliments), a small size that easily fits in a pocket unlike the bigger iPod's, and good battery life (I haven't really checked the 8 hour claim, but I got over 5 hours of continuous playing on just the quick charge which takes about an hour).  I installed iTunes 4.2 and the download from there to the Mini was done in about 10 minutes.  No problems with the download and no software/hardware problems either.  I have a Dell 4600, and iTunes and the Mini work perfectly with it.  RECOMMENDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY!!

<Title>iPod Mini in PINK!
<Date>Sat Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I bought one of these for my wife and she loves it.  I find it terribly over-rated.<p>I especially hate the software under Windows - it was probably the worst installation procedure I have ever seen - not allowing you to customize what or where it is installed. Its like they thought we all want to be Mac users and just automatically do everything for us even though we would like control!<p>It's also real buggy under Windows - always appearing to hang. And it is not ergonomic to update the iPod with new songs - it has to plugged in and out again constantly.  It will not recognize new CDs unless you restart the software. My advise is to have the iPod unplugged all the time until you are ready to update the songs.<p>There is a long way Apple has to go with this before it is as good as some of the other brands designed for Windows.

<Title>Ipod Mini
<Date>Sat Feb 28 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>[The Ipod Mini]- The image and design of the Ipod mini is everything that it is hyped up to be. Once you buy it, and hold it in your hands, the design will send a chill through your body. The software is easy to install on the PC and the MAC and navigation of songs and other features are simple to use in both Itunes and in the Ipod mini.<p>[The main concern]- if you buy the Ipod would be the battery life. 8 Hours for the Ipod mini is a little short. If you play games, use the backlight or other functions, the battery life will wear out even faster. Leaving the Ipod mini off for a period of time will also drain the battery. In addition, the Ipod mini is slow to charge up. Although it takes 1 hour to charge it up to about 80%, it will take 4 hours to fully charge the mini. If you use your computer's firewire or usb cable to charge up the mini, it will take even longer, although I have not really been patient enough to see how long that takes, but whatever it is, its too long. The only way that your songs can be uploaded is through Itunes, and the Ipod mini does not play wma music files although you can easy convert those yourself with third party software.<p>[A little tip]- Keep in mind that by default Itunes will automatically update your Ipod mini. It will be important to know that if you delete songs in your library, the next time you connect the Ipod mini to Itunes, the songs in your Ipod will be deleted automatically. If you don't want that to happen, you should definitely turn that feature off. There are also a lot of awesome accessories for the Ipod mini and you should definitely go check it out in Amazon's recommendations

<Title>Mini iPOD is perfect in my eyes!
<Date>Sun Feb 29 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>After spending hours searching for a mini iPod in stock, I finally located one at a local CompUSA and ran down to purchase it in my favorite color, blue.  After owning a 3G 20GB iPod for only about 2 months (after discovering the beauty of the iTunes Music Store), I wasn't really planning on buying the mini.  But after seeing them at an Apple Store a few days back, I was in love.  The sound quality is the same, amazing, syncing is easy as all things Apple, the design is gorgeous, the screen is beautiful (and I prefer it to the 3G because it's smaller and SHARPER, as well as brighter).  4GB of music is more than enough for me, and the style, quality (build is excellent), ITMS, and Apple name all justify the $250 price tag.  Worthy of being in anyone's pocket.

<Title>Joy to my ears
<Date>Mon Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>This is a great little device.  I should start by saying that I never owned the original iPod, so the only comparison I can make to the bigger one is the size, since I held both in a local store.  The iPod mini just feels great in your hand--the design engineers for Apple deserve an award for this thing.  Its a good bit smaller than the original, and oh yes, that clickwheel.  That is another design marvel, and one that I'm sure will eventually be on all iPods.  Setup was easy as well, just hooked up the Firewire cable to my Win XP machine (USB 2.0 is included as well), installed the software, and transferred my music.  Sound is very good, though I'm not a fan of the included earbud headphones (I much prefer my Grado ones instead).  As for people who complain about it being too expensive for its capacity, well they just haven't used it, plain and simple.  Apple has hit a home run, and its sure to strengthen their market share for MP3 devices.  Worth every penny.

<Title>i-pod mini is the best
<Date>Mon Mar 01 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The i-pod mini is compact, and easy to use.  The software is also very easy to use.  I can download an entire album in under 30 seconds.  It is awesome!  The only bad thing is that the earbud headphones sometimes come out of my ears. In my mind, the problem is a small price to pay for the excellent sound that comes out of them.  Overall, this is a very good product.  Well worth the cost.

<Title>As much art as it is science!
<Date>Tue Mar 02 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I have been an iPod evangalist since I first turned on the 5GB.  As you may know from my reviews of the 5, 15, 20, and 40GB models, I've owned (or given as gifts) just about every incarnation of this glorious device.  So, when Apple announced that it was releasing a dramatically redesigned version of the iPod, I knew right away it would at least be a hit, perhaps even enjoy the almost &quot;cult-like&quot; status of its larger parent.<p>So I pre-ordered 3 of them; one for each of my sisters and myself.  They arrived about a week ago and I'm happy to report that Apple has done it again with the release of the iPod Mini.  It totally ROCKS!  <p>There are allot of things I like about this model, but before I get into them A VERY IMPORTANT WARNING TO THOSE THAT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT:<p>YOU MUST CHARGE AT LEAST 4 HOURS BEFORE USE!<p>I, like so many I'm sure, was very eager to &quot;plug and play&quot;.  I did, without fully charging them, and they experienced all kinds of impossible to resolve errors.  <p>Now, in the event you've already bought one, or simply can't help yourself, there is a little known &quot;reset feature&quot; on the mini that will come in handy whenever you have an issue.<p>TO RESET THE MINI, PRESS AND HOLD THE MENU AND SELECT BUTTON (the middle round button) FOR SIX SECONDS.  <p>That'll bring your baby back to life.<p>The colors are awesome (I have the blue, silver, and pink), look very stylish, and will likely show less wear.  If you have the patience, consider having Apple engrave them for you (looks very cool).<p>The sound is excellent.  I don't have a testing lab, but I could swear that the sound quality is better; and I'm almost certain that they can play at a higher volume.<p>Another important improvement is the fact that when skipping forward more than a handful of songs the mini doesn't stall (for a second or two) like it's predecessors.<p>So, in conclusion, this is a wonderful new player that'll be sure to WOW everyone that owns it, and create envious spectators out of those that don't.<p>Hope this was helpful.<p>Christian Hunter<br>Santa Barbara, CA.

<Title>The ipod mini is awesome, but must be handled with care
<Date>Thu Jan 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The ipods definitely outrank any other mp3 player in quality. I know because I have had 3 mp3 players before this one. But the fact of the mattter is that the ipod mini is a hard drive player, meaning it has parts that move inside of the thing. Therefore, significant force will cause the hard drive to work improperly. But the ipod mini is incredibly strudy, so if you get one, don't TOSS it in your purse, or run 1o miles with it like these other idiots and you should be fine in the event of minor tremors. They wonder, "oh why is my ipod not working," well that's because you treat the thing like a frickin' baseball. If you want an mp3 to accompany you in an activity that will require a LOT of movement, then get the flash based ipod nano or shuffle, where there are no moving parts, but a smaller storage. But if you have a huge assortment of songs, then hard drives will sure as hell be able to hold all those songs. And that's the difference between flash based mp3s and hard drive mp3s. So, if you are willing to buy the mini, you have to understand that difference and the fact that the mini, despite how sturdy, will crash if you disrupt the hard drive inside by slamming it, trhowing it, dropping it every ten minutes, etc. And the batery, just get the third gen. minis that have an 18 hour battery life, and if it dies for good, buy a battery pack for about 30 dollars. That's all there is to it. Just treat your mini like you would a child and distrust these people who say their's doesn't work. That is only because they make it not work, not Apple.

<Title>Nice MP3 player, but it has some cons
<Date>Sun Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I had my ipod mini for almost a year. I got it on my 18th b-day, I have a pink one. I love my ipod mini, but it has some cons. Ipod mini is very easy to mess up, so if your a clumsy person you might want to get another mp3, another thing it freezes or cuts off every now and then and the battery life isn't all that good. I love that the ipod mini can hold a lot of music, it comes in nice colors, and has many accessories for it, you can put numbers in it, used it as a organizer, and play games on it, etc. Overall I give it 3 stars cause I just adore it and a lot of people are jealous of me cause I have one,and plus it's pink.

<Title>It;s my baby!
<Date>Sat Apr 01 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple's part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.  It holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it's still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother's mp3 player, needing to press "next" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it's job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.  Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod "family" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that's how much I love it!  For having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it's amazing!

<Title>How did I live without it?
<Date>Tue May 16 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>It was nearly one year ago when I first recieved a Green Ipod Mini for my birthday. Since then I am rarely without it. I'd been warned by a number of people that the batteries broke easily and that they got scratched like anything, but even so I decided it was the gadget for me. The risk payed off.  Holding 1,000 songs makes for a great deal of hours listening to music or podcasts. I am absolutely addicted to music and this li'l gem changed my life forever. The sound has stayed crips and clear, the volume is great and I haven't needed to replace the earphones. For me, this is absolute perfection.   The battery lasts for a LONG time and charging is simple and quick. Scratch wise, I invested in a good quality cover which stays on it all the time, so I have had no problems with scratches. The iPod is sturdy, (I admit to dropping it a couple of times) and the buttons and menus are easy and quick.  Downloading songs is also a piece of cake. Just plug your iPod into your computer or laptop and with iTunes I have been able to simply change around my songs, delete, add more, to my hearts content.  If you want something cute, colourful, stylish, easy-to-use and very VERY reliable, then go for an iPod mini. And with music downloading being so easy, it's more than likely that it will replace your CD's forever! So buy one, you will not regret it.

<Title>Mini IPOD - batter poop out
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an IPOD mini in February 2005.  Overall I have no complaints except for the battery life.  I have had five replacements since I bought the IPOD mini earlier this year.  The batter slowly looses charge incrementally, so by 2.5 months the batter time is down from its best of 4.5 hours down to 30 minutes.  When I brought the IPOD mini back to an APPLE STORE at the Genius Bar, I was told I was using the IPOD mini incorrectly, that it had to be my computer, which I bought in January 2005 (DELL), or it is my outlet socket, or that I am not following instructions.  The deal is this, they know that they have a defective product with IPOD mini with a 8 hour battery life, when I bought it they never told me that the upgraded IPOD mini was to be marketing very shortly with an 18 hour battery life.  In any event, they replaced the battery depleted IPODS, with refurbished IPOD minis that had the exact same problem and stated, and they clearly stated that there is no problems with the battery life.  My question is why do they have such a huge stock of refurbished replacement IPOD mini units, if there is no problem.  One replacement was a complete disaster, the wheel did not work, it was broken although it had been refurbished.  So yesterday I went back for unit number six, as it's battery has died over 6 weeks this time.  Well IPOD minis are no longer being sold as new by Apple, they have replaced with IPOD nano, etc, etc this month.  Poor folks who bought they IPOD mini last month and have defective battery problems also.  In any event, they replaced my IPOD mini again yesterday with a IPOD mini with a battery life of 18 hours, because they are no longer selling them.  So far, the battery life is much improved with the first trial with the 18 hour battery - but I cannot speak for 1 week to six months.  SO BEWARE if you are going to spend money on a new or refurbished IPOD mini, THINK TWICE, THREE TIMES, FOUR TIMES, and how ever long it takes to give up on this foolish idea.  I cannot speak for the newest IPOD's - nano, photo, etc.  But I am sure the batter problem continues.  There is no way to get the battery out yourself and replace it.  There are other brands of MP3's with replaceable batteries, you open the case, by a new battery for around $45 dollars, replace the battery and go on into the night with an MP3 player that works.  Apple please design units with replaceable batteries, and top lying to your customers.  Also there has been a class action suite filed against Apple whichshe lost, because of defective batter problems, and overclaims of battery longevity on early IPOD versions, that supposedly preceded the IPOD minis.

<Title>nice little thing
<Date>Sun Oct 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>ipod minis are really neat and cute. they're also small and fit in my pocket, as well as being relatively lightweight. i like the way they come in a variety of colors because it makes them much more interesting than if they were just plain white. the sound quality is decent and i can hear my music just fine, even when the volume is turned down. i like the way i'm able to organize my songs and create different playlists made up of certain songs. it's very costly to purchase songs from itunes, though, and the battery life could be better. mine is the older version and is meant to have a battery life of 8 hours. i skip around a lot and battery life for me is more like 4 or 5 hours. overall, the ipod mini is a decent mp3 player, if thats what you would call it.

However, for an artist like me, it lacks some features, none of them a big deal.  - Lack of recording options. - So so Bass quality of sound. - Tightly tied to Itunes, which is a great software, but for one who needs some flexibility, well... Anyways, still a great product. No Doubt to be Recomended

<Title>Mmm not so good a product....
<Date>Tue Oct 25 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got an iPod mini last in 04 for Christmas. It was so awesome then!! So pretty and good-working. Then about 2 months later i carried it around with me in my backpack in a special little makeup bag type thing and it didn't hold up very well even though i didn't move around a whole lot. Well i opened the bag up to listen to it on the bus and the entire screen looked awful!!! There was a HUGE crack line down the front and the screen had an awful weird blackish line down it and a few tiny black lines too. I was shocked because i thought it would hold up better! So luckily I got a replacement. But then about 4 months after i got the replacement, the battery life slowly dwindled down to about 1 and a half - 2 hours! I was on a plane for vacation and it died halfway through the flight! I brought my charger with me and charged it at the hotel, though. But i turned it on to listen to it, only to find that it only played 4 songs!! The 4 songs just happened to be the only ones on my iPod that i didn't buy and my friend later told me (after i got home) that i needed to plug it in the computer to fix that problem. But i didn't have my PC with me on vacation, obviously. And i don't have a laptop. So yes. I did that and it was all better! But as soon as i plugged it in my other charger and took it off after it was fully charged, it did the same thing again!! So unfortunately i have to live with it that way and take off my purchased music, otherwise, it's just wasted space. So I've ended up with an iPod that: - Can only last for 2 hours - Skips over all my purchased music and plays only non-purchased music - Takes 4 hrs to charge but only plays 2 hrs! So it's pretty much obsolete in my mind. I am sort of weary to buy the Nano, seeing as how it has had lawsuits filed on account of it, because of the easily crackable screen and it'd probably snap in my pocket. I am kinda leaning toward the video iPod even though it's huge and i'll never need 30 GB of music. But if i bought a battery pack for my iPod mini, it'd cost me an extra 80 or 90 bucks and it'd be double the size it is now, so why don't i just get a brand spanking new one?  I don't know. Apple is just sort of.......mmm.  So many problems!!! and since Apple makes you pay like 100 bucks for insurance and warranties and stuff it's like what's the point? I'm basically banking on the fact that it'll blow. Oh well. I don't know what to do. I have a useless iPod on my hands! Whoopie!

<Content>Let me start by saying, I am a Mac nut. I have an iMac, iSight, an iPhoto, iPod and two minis. I had the company I bought my car from, hook up my iPod in the glove compartment, oh how happy I am! I have never had a problem with the iPod and my car...never! I recently swopped my iPod with my sons mini as he has ten times the amount of music. Since I hooked the mini to my car, it has frozen more then 20 times. What a pain, it takes a good 5 minutes to unfreeze the silly thing everytime I get in the car!!! So I would recommend spending that bit extra on the iPod as I have never had a bit of trouble with that model.......... I shall be taking the mini back to the store. Another thing I can say is that Apple have good cust.serv. So mini freezes in cars, get an iPod!

<Date>Fri Dec 09 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I got a pink iPod mini for my birthday in April, and the only problem I had was this: On the way to Florida on the plane, my ipod just started skipping through songs and wouldn't play anything. So we got to Florida,I charged my ipod up (the battery was dead, too) with the wall charger, and it worked fine.. until the flight home. Same thing happened. I reset it with holding down the menu and select buttons, and it worked fine. Until about 2 weeks ago. I left my ipod mini in my glove compartment of my car for about an hour (I live in Wisconsin and it's really cold right now in December). I got back in my car and tried to get it to play, and no luck. I reset it and figured it would be fine, but I looked and the battery was dead even though I charged it before I left. So I recharged my ipod for a few hours when I got home, but ever since it's been working half the time and just freezing up the other half. I'm so fed up I'm thinking about buying a new iPod.. maybe the nano but I hear the screen cracks. Hmm.

<Content>I own a 10 GB iPod and it is an amazing machine. It has many great features that help me. Who wants to carry around a bunch of cds or only carry a couple? With the Ipod you have a vast amount of songs at your disposal. The great thing about the Ipod mini is <br>1. Smaller<br>2. Harder to scratch up (happened to me with my original Ipod. The originals get scratched easily) <br>3. More Durable<br>4. Has that Arm clip thing<br>5. Longer Battery Life<br>6. And the click wheel/touch wheel is awesome. At first, I couldn't understand the concept of this. I will carify since I have tested it out myself. To scroll, you rub the wheel around in a circle just like the original Ipod. But to access the buttons, you press down and click in the four cardnal directions.<br>It doesn't matter that it only holds 1000 songs because I personally  thought I would use that space up like that. But it actually holds a lot more. Its 1000 3 minute songs. So if a song is 1 minute, 3 of them will fit into 1 song memory-wise

<Title>this is too cool!
<Date>Wed Mar 03 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>The manufacturers explain all the specs very well, but if you're reading these reviews, you probably want to hear from someone who had used the mini.  I have been waiting for an iPod, but didn't want an mp3 player that was as big or as white as a regular iPod.  Minis have the bonus of being very small and come in different colors.  <br>The little cutie is so easy to use, skip reading the instructions.  I use mine with a Ti4 (that's a G4 Titanium powerbook to you Pentium users).  iTunes and iPod together make it incredibly easy to put your entire music collection on your computer and select which songs/playlists you want to bring everywhere with you.  The transfer of my small library of 1 gig took about a minute, and each time I add songs to the different playlists, it takes less than a second to update all the playlists.  I also imported my contacts and calendar from Entourage (or Palm Desktop works, too).<br>The scroll/touchpad is very senstive, but there is a lock button on the top so you can throw the ipod in a bag or pocket and your volume and other settings won't be affected.  I also purchased an FM transmitter to use in my car and my other radios around the house.  The earbuds for me were too uncomfortable so I got new headphones, and now life is good.<br>The games are crap, but who buys one of these for games?  I'm sure more people will add their own reviews which may give you different information than this.

<Date>Thu Mar 04 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>I'd first picked up an iPod while in the Apple store in San Francisco 3 years ago and I was immediately impressed with its form and its intuitive user interface. I could never quite justify paying what seemed such an exorbitant price for what essentially is a sexy walkman, but when the new mini iPod came out I thought I just had to have one. I've been using it for around a week now and I have to say my affection for it grows by the day. Beware though!! You will spend a lot of time showing it to people because as soon as they catch a glance of it, they want to know what it is, what it does, how much it costs etc. I reckon Apple should give all the early adopters a heavy discount as I've already enticed 3 more people to buy one.<p>It syncs very quikly with the PC and the battery seems to charge quite quickly too (it's handy that it charges while it's connected to my PC, so I've only had to use the charger once so far)

<Content>The ipod mini has a lot going for it.  If your not looking to carry your whole cd collection with you, the mini is the way to go.  It's light and compact and makes carrying a substantial amount of music with you easy.<p>The whole ipod line blows other mp3 players away.  No one has yet to match the capacity of the ipod.  Apple has a big win with the mini for those of us who are satisfied with &quot;only&quot; 1000 songs in our pocket.

<Content>Just got mine yesterday, and I love it! Filled half the mini, and will probably never fill the rest. <p>Love the small size, weighs a little more than expected.<p>Sounds great, and easy to use!<p>4.5 instead of 5 because of weight, and the fact that the ipod software takes about .3gb of the 4gb drive.<p>Awesome product!<p>Yeah, for 50 dollars more could get a full ipod, but this is plenty of storage, and I like the smaller size.

<Title>A good move for Apple...
<Date>Sat Mar 06 00:00:00 CST 2004
<Content>Apple's raved iPod that was praised for its portability and stylish exterior was taken to a new level late February. The new Apple iPod mini sports five new colors, this being my favorite. The ultra-slim, ultra-tiny mini has a mere 4 GB, but to those who only want to store their favorite songs and not their entire CD collections, it's great. The price is a little high for such low memory, but all-in-all, it's useful and great-looking.<p>The colors are what will attract most people to it, but it also has many other new features to Apple's iPod line. The new Touch/Click-wheel has the buttons under the wheel. The screen is smaller than past models, and it sports many new software updated features, such as a &quot;Music Quiz&quot; and Contacts that you can sync with your PC/Mac.<p>But, on a darker note, a day after I received it, it froze for two hours and then froze the next morning while I was listening to music. Either it is just mine or it is the quality of the product that bothers me, and that's why it got 4 stars rather than 5.

<Title>mini ipod rocks (almost)
<Date>Fri May 13 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>Generally speaking, the mini ipod is great. I'm not an apple user, so I was hesitant to purchase it. Plus, the price is nothing to laugh at. It's very durable, and the user interface is pretty cool and easy. If your thinking of buying the 4 gig, I recommend springing for the extra cash to get the 6 gig. The ipod can hold a lot of songs, but mine is already full (4 gigs). You'll be wishing you had more space like I do.  Pros: - Lightweight - Durable - Small/compact - Easy to install (some people had problems, but my install was easy)  Cons: - You HAVE to use itunes (which comes with it) for this to work. Not a big deal. But I was so used to Windows Media 10, I thought I wouldn't like it, but itunes makes things pretty easy. It will automatically catalog and convert songs if you want it to. - There aren't many other worthy competitors out there right now, so if you want lots of storage with a simple sleek design, ipod is the way to go. - The sound quality has something to desire. With all the hype and the price, I was expecting a brilliant sound system. I've tried different earphones, but the sound is a bit tinny (metallic, harsh on the high end). This can suck when you crank it up and your ears are shattered by the high-end. The ipod does offer some preset EQs, but they should've offered a band EQ for those of us who really want to fine-tune things.  - The navigation wheel takes some time and skill to get used to. It's definitely designed for the nibble-fingered, and not for big chunky hands. So, you'll get used to it and get the feel of how to make this baby sing. - TERRIBLE stock earphones that come with it. Throw those out and buy some new ones right away.   Overall, I recommend, but be prepared to spend some money on the ipod itself, and another small investment in some quality earphones. I hope future models will include a detailed manual band EQ. That will then make this an ideal product.

<Content>I bought a crappy mp3 player ages ago (somewhere around 40 dollars) my brother gave me his daily planner that could play mp3s. Frankly I was tired of the both of them running out of battery power in less than 4 hours.  So today I ran into the store and decided to check out the ipods. I saw this beauty for $195 and thought "Why not" I am most throughly impressed. My other mp3 players could not get even near as loud as this one (I like blasting my ears). The headphones that came with it, while deceptive looking, are actually very good.  I was completely startled by the great sound quality, and how loud this little machine can get. The touch interface is gorgeous, it responds to nary a touch. No more fumbling around to get to the next song or change the volume!

<Title>Apple's iPOD = Creme of the Crop
<Date>Tue Jul 12 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>The biggest choice you'll have to wrestle with is size. Not the 3.6 inches long, or 3.6 ounces it weighs... rather the storage size. This model is 4GB - which will hold approx 1000 songs. The 20GB might be overkill, but it's fun to think about the possibilities. The Apple iPOD is easy to use - easy to add songs in, take songs out. The battery charge lasts approx 8 hours; takes 3-4 hours to fully charge again (80% charged in 2 hours I read). Unit comes with earbud headphones (delivering excellent full-bodied crisp sound), a belt clip, AC adaptor, as well as the hook up for your PC. Capable of playing MP3's. Very customizable: main menu features; playlists; shuffle songs or albums; repeat functions; alarms and sleep timers; 20 different equalizer settings; displays (date/time/etc); sound checks; etc. The size is amazing - the mini fits in my pocket with my cell phone and I almost don't notice it. In the dark, the display reads nicely. Only bad comment is that during the daylight hours, I wish the LED backlight was brighter. Max operating altitude is approx 10,000 feet (the thin air definitely effects the playback - found this out on our last Colorado vacation in the mountains). Overall an outstanding iPOD/MP3 player. Available in several colors (blue/gold/silver/pink/green). Apple still makes the best unit in 2005 and everyone and their brother is now trying to copy them. Toughest choice you'll have to make is whether to get the 1GB (250 songs), 4GB (1000 songs), or 20GB (5000 songs). Stick with Apple and you won't go wrong. Great unit!

<Title>I will never buy an iPod product again!
<Date>Tue Aug 02 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My fiance bought me the iPod shuffle for my birthday.  We tried it on THREE different computers and it didn't work on ANY of them!  So, we tried to return it and bought an iPod Mini.  What a mistake!  Within the first couple of hours the screen's contrast went to nothing-- and we even had it on the darkest setting.  Then, the next morning the screen decided to be visable again.  BUT, on the fourth day, the thing just froze!  I couldn't turn it off or anything!  So, it made me feel like those days back in college when I had to use Apple computers and the disk drive would freeze.  They never had a disk drive eject button.  Why does Apple do this stuff-- doesn't make sense. So, this one is going right back to the store.  I would like a digital player, but just won't buy an Apple one again.

<Title>Too Darn Complicated!!
<Date>Mon Aug 08 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>I consider myself to be fairly electronically inclined.  I can read directions with the best of them.  But this?  The iPod mini?  Man it gave me the blues.  I bought it on Sunday at 1PM, by 3PM I was still goofin around with it, by 4PM I decided to take it back to the store, at 7PM I let my husband take a stab at it he finally figured it out after about an hour+, but by then I was through.  I returned it to the store on Monday afternoon.   So what's the problem?  The instructions are not very clear. The icons that are supposed to show up on your computer screen once you have downloaded the iTunes software, may not always show up, and you can't figure out why.  I have about 1500 songs on my computer, at this time I only wanted to download about let's say 200 of them.  But the iTunes program took in all 1000+ songs and put a check mark next to each of them as if I wanted to download them all onto the iPod.  I had to individually "un-check" over 1000 song titles in order to deliniate between those that I wanted and those that I did not want.  There needs to be a "check-all" button and an easy way to undo it. Also, I was not real thrilled with the actual buttons on the iPod, I suppose with time I could have gotten used to them, but they were just too touchy, although there is a hold button so you cannot inadvertantly push the buttons.   I think that for the money they could have also put in an FM tuner. Bottom line is I needed something more rugged that is quick and easy to download, light for when I am running and working out.  I had a Rio Sport a few years ago, it got stolen, I'll be buying a new one.  The iPod is not for me.

<Title>Consider iPod nano
<Date>Sat Sep 10 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>People choosing iPod mini mainly because of its smaller size compared to the regular iPod. If you are planning to buy an iPod and choose iPod mini because its size, you may want to reconsider it.  The newest member of iPod family will be released to the market soon. It is iPod nano. It comes with two color, black and white. You will be surprised by its size! Yes, it is smaller than iPod mini! It is very slim, comes with color screen, and sexier design. The iPod nano will be available in 2GB or 4GB size.  Although its price is a little bit higher than the reduced price of iPod mini, there are some features that you would not find in iPod mini; completely free-skip feature. Because of its flash memory based storage media, it is not affected by movement. You can wear the iPod nano on your arm or just use it as a necklace.  There are lots of reasons for you to choose iPod nano and I cannot write it down here. I will write them down on the iPod nano review. So, will you consider iPod nano?  * You wouldn't find green iPod nano. So, if you are choosing iPod mini because of its color, you may stick at your choice.

<Title>Perhaps mine, one of the last of the minis,  is a lemon?
<Date>Thu Sep 29 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>When it works, it works great, but I've had to restore the software three times since I received it for my birthday two months ago. And I don't use it very often, because I've had nothing but problems with it from Day 1.   I had trouble installing the software originally (went through that annoying "Do not disconnect" Catch-22). Then I had trouble keeping the battery charged, even though I rarely use it! Today was the last straw: I plugged it in to download my latest purchases and was told to "update it." When I tried to update it, I got a "disk write error" message. Then I completely lost the ipod option on my itunes menu. I had to shut down my computer just to disconnect. Then when I turned on the ipod, I received that lovely folder with the exlamation point error message. So I went back online, followed all the help information offered on the ipod website, and finally got the dang thing to connect enough to get the "need to install and update" message again. Of course, once it initialized for the "update," the only option it would allow me to use was the restore one that wipes off everything! Then it tells me it couldn't even do that, due to another "disk write error"! What a lovely piece of dog-poo.   It turns out it did clear everything off, and I've reloaded all my music, etc., but the next time this happens, I'm calling Apple and demanding my money back. (I know, consider me delusional.)  I know I probably got the only "lemon" out there, but I could not possibly, in good conscience, recommend this thing. At least I can listen to the itunes music on my computer, which has much better sound anyway!

<Title>iPod Mini
<Date>Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 CST 2005
<Content>My third generation iPod has been having some problems with playing audiobooks lately, so I requisitioned an iPod Mini that has been sitting around neglected in my dad's office (with his permission, of course).   I never even came close to filling up all 20GB of my iPod, so the space constraints of the Mini are no problem at all. In fact, all I ever really keep on my MP3 player is whatever audiobook I happen to be listening to, unless I'm going on a long trip or something. On to my impressions:   This little gizmo is tiny! I don't know why that makes me like it so much more, but I'm sure we're all subconsciously aware that small equals cute. That, coupled with the nice silver cyberpunk finish, simply delights my aesthetic senses. For some reason, just having it in my pocket is a nice feeling. Oh, and the click wheel! Since I'm used to the 3G iPod, it comes across as marvelously innovative.   Sure, the same criticisms that have been leveled against the iPod can be leveled here. Mainly, the short battery life and the non-user replaceable battery. Features like an FM tuner are also missing, but I don't particularly care about listening to the radio when I can be my own DJ.
