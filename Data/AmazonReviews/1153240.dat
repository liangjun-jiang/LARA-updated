<Title> Perfect sized MP3 PLAYER.
<Date>Wed Sep 20 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>I just recieved my Nano Plus and am very happy with it so far. The only disappointment is that the colour of the Nano showed above  is not the same colour when it arrives. I would describe it as being more of a Hot Pink . Although listed as an accessory included there is no neck strap  that comes with it but you do recieve a sports band and clip cover. Overall for the price it's a good buy!!!!

<Title>Great Mp3 Player--I've Got TWO of 'EM!
<Date>Tue Sep 26 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>Don't believe the negative reviews. I've had two of them in the house for almost 6 months. No problems. They are great for downloading books on tape and music. Some libraries offer free downloads that will work on this Creative Zen Nano. They are small and easy to carry around---weigh almost nothing! Email:boland7214@aol.

<Title>Best Bang for your buck!
<Date>Thu Oct 05 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This is an awesome MP3 player. Came with earphones, arm band (perfect for the workouts in a dark gray color), rubber whitish clear clip case, audio connector, USB, battery and software CD.  Great for working out.  Easy to learn! Drag and drop from Explorer to load MP3s. Pink is a hot pink more than the color shown here.   I did lots of research before choosing an MP3 player and my friend who has the Scandisk 1G is jealous.  Great buy and the delivery came to me in 2 days even though it said 7 days shipping!

<Title>Cute, But Is It Worth It?
<Date>Fri Oct 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>This MP3 player has severe mechanical deficiencies.    It's so cute, and I wish it worked better than it does!  Everyone else I know who has one advised me not to buy it, because their Zen Nano Plus developed problems quickly.    But it was just so adorable-- I couldn't resist.  Retrospectively, I wish that I had not purchased it.  As a poor college student, my money would certainly have been better spent on a more reliable MP3 player.  I'd like to explain the difficulties I experienced, because they seem to be representative of the problems everyone else has had.   Perhaps this won't happen to everyone who buys one, but I don't think the odds are looking favorable for its reputation.    The Zen Nano Plus 1GB worked perfectly for the first few months of use.  It was lightweight, convenient, cute, and had alright sound. I never dropped it, nor did it incur any abuse.  It lead a nice, soft, life in my purse.  (1)  After two months, the LCD screen started getting a bunch of lines through the text on the screen-- so much so that I couldn't read what song was being played.  It never was the same again.  I could deal with that though, since I only use it when I'm at work or walking around with headphones.  (2)   A few weeks after the problem with the LCD screen, the battery indicator stopped working.  I kept changing batteries, because it always said there was no battery life left.  It was a little annoying, but I learned to live with it.  (3)   Another two months went by, and despite the cosmetic problems with the LCD screen, the player itself worked great.  But then, the songs started to be garbled-- as if there was too much bass in them.  I tried it out on different speakers and headphones-- the songs always sounded the same-- distorted with too much bass.  The problem was corrected by simply starting the song over. I tried changing the sound settings, but it was evident that the problem was much bigger than that.   The severe distortion and garbling only happened every once in awhile, and I just learned to start a song over when it became distorted.  After another month, however, every single song was distorted all the time, and nothing would fix it.  The MP3 player was completely unusable.  I went to the Creative support site on the internet, and followed their directions: I updated the drivers and the firmware.  (4)   After I did that, the MP3 player stopped working altogether.  It wouldn't even turn on, or be recognized by my computer.  It's as if it's cold and dead now.  This is really what it seems like.  Creative can't be reached by phone-- and this was a little frustrating.  I've contacted Creative via email, and while they are more or less prompt in their responses, I'd like more immediate customer service.    And although my product is still under warranty, it looks as though it will be an expensive ($25) and lengthy process to get another.  I would advise against buying this MP3 player.  But if you can't resist the charm, buy some kind of an additional care package for it.  And again-- it really is a cute and portable device, and would be perfect if it didn't deteriorate so quickly.   And I'd like to mention one other ancillary critique of it:  the sound is very mediocre. There isn't much richness in tone-- everything seemed a little flat. This wasn't a huge problem for me, since my MP3 usage is solely recreational.  But I bought an expensive pair of headphones to use with it, and the MP3 player didn't do them justice.  I was surprised at how great my headphones sounded on others' MP3 players.

<Content>i got this mp3 player on my birthday and was a little dissapointed because it wasnt and ipod, well was i WRONG! this player is very small easy to fit into any pocket. the sound is utterly amazing. my bro has an ipod and it is nice and all but it is bulky compared to this. i listen to this before i go to bed and it puts me to sleep great. i think if your wanting a radio, voice recorder, great sound and many other things, no doubt this is for you!

<Content>love it. got it about 4months ago. use it all the time when i go running. and it has a radio function so i can listen to the tv's at the gym when i'm there. it's economical, little, cute, and does it's job. very easy to upload music onto there. it also has a voice recording function, but i don't use that too much. if you plan on using this alot, i def recommend getting some rechargable batteries. very happy with this purchase.

<Title>Good little player
<Date>Mon Nov 06 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The player works well, is light and comes with an armband holder, which was perfect for the gym. It only plays MP3 files. I had some .wmv files I tried to play on it, but they didnt' work. So, make sure you convert all your music to MP3. Also, it comes with a bunch of software the directions say you have to install before using the player. You don't. it is a bunch of software for music downloading sites and stuff. If you hook up the player to your USB, you just drag music over. The "management" software is unnecessary. But, the player works well, the sound quality is good. I even got it all wet and when it dried it still worked fine.

<Content>The mp3 player is not to bad. I love the size because it is comfortable to carry around and fits anywhere. I kind of wish it had a little more space for more music but besides that I'm pretty satisfied with it. If your looking for a good mp3 player and dont want to spend a lot of money this is a good one.

<Title>Good player
<Date>Thu Nov 09 00:00:00 CST 2006
<Content>The Creative Zen Nano Plus is a great little player. I have not had time to use all of the features yet. I love the color and that was a deciding factor. The only thing that I did not like were the ear buds because they are too large for my ears, fall out and hurt after they have been in for a while.

<Content>My item came quickly and was just as described.  My daughter loves it.  the only thing she doesn't care for are the big ear plugs---wished they were smaller to fit in her ears.  Other than that, she really likes it.  It was easy to load music on, etc.

<Content>I love this thing.  It was a great value, love the arm strap so I can run with it when I use my sports head phones.  Love the pink.  Easy to add music directly from CD w/o storing on computer.  I will consider this brand when I am ready to get a bigger player.  I already filled this one, that is why only 4 stars.

<Title>Great for Audio Book downloads
<Date>Sat Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2007
<Content>I wanted to end the back breaking habit of carrying several audio books from the local library to work. I went to my libray website and found out that this little MP3 Player gives a lot for the buck.  It has an FM radio with presets, it has a microphone, and for those who enjoy audio books it is the only player that starts right from where you left, regardless if it is in the middle of a sentence when you turn the Nano off.  It holds quite a few books for only having 1GB.  I have just purchased the 30 GB Creative Zen Vision and will continue to use the Nano for my audio books.  I just found out the 30 GB doesn't have the start-stop feature mentioned above. I highly recommend this item for book lovers and patrons of the library.  Downloads and check out is much nicer when you don't have to pay the fines. The quality is perfect. Overall this item is a must buy!
