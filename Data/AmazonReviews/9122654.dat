<Title>It would be nice when producer solves some critical issues

<Content>I have purchased a mobiBLU US2 MP3 player with 2 Gb memory and I am very disappointed.  Right after receiving of package I updated firmware with version 1015 (downloaded from www.mobiblu.com). Following bugs are found after upgrading firmware (1013 -> 1015, I don't know if bugs exist in version 1013):  1. Playing time after full charge is less than declared: 5-6 hours only (instead of 15 hours!) 2. Player freezes when I try to enter FM mode (bug appear one month later after upgrading). Only Reset button can make player operable again. 3. Animation contains some bright pixels. 4. I can't connect player so that it charges and plays simultaneously.  I suppose that firmware version 1015 had not been tested because it contains so evident bugs. Unfortunately, newer versions of firmware is not released already 10 months.  Pros: + Good shape, light, small, thin + Good set of features + Price is low enough + Durable buttons. No need to use "hold" because it is very difficult to press buttons accidentally. + Player supports many character encodings (for example, russian - my native language). But fonts are not too good.  Contras: - BUGS! (see above) - Playing time less than declared! Actually, player charges 4 hours (inoperable during charging) to play only 6 hours! - Proprietary USB connector (sux!) - No visible indication of "Charge complete"

<Title>Terrible !!!

<Content>Unit barely worked for 1-hour, then wouldn't shut off. When it finally did shut off, the device cannot be turned on or reset as described in user manual.  Support/sales phone number is useless. All messages go to support and to leave a message ... followed by a message that the mail box is full.  No response yet via e-mail either.  The mobiBLU US2 is a $130 piece of JUNK!  If you buy one after reading this ... shame on you!

<Title>Horrible product

<Content>I would not recommend this product to anyone.  After a week of use, lines started appearing in the screen, therefore making the titles of the songs hard to read.  Other than that, it started out nice.

<Content>I second all of the previous comments in spades.  I did get to work for a while by dropping it on a hard floor.  support directs you to a Korean language site for downloads of firmware
